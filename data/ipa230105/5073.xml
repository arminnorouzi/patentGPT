In many cases, this insurance is based upon the combination of the user and the vehicle. However, as many drivers are no longer being tied to specific vehicles, it has become more difficult to determine the proper insurance for the individual user on a case by case basis. Furthermore, while the usage-based insurance (UBI) may include restrictions on the user, it is not always possible to determine when the user has complied with these restrictions. In some cases, a user may wish to modify already issued insurance to allow for a detour or side trip. There exists a need to collect and collate data about a user and a trip to allow for proper tracking of insurance policies and individuals.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present embodiments may relate to blockchain based systems and methods for managing usage-based insurance contracts.

The IM computer system may be a mobile device associated with the driver and/or a vehicle computer device associated with the vehicle. In some further embodiments, the IM computer system may be separate from the vehicle and be in communication with the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The IM computer system may be configured to: (i) receive a user request for trip insurance (such as via wireless communication or data transmission over one or more radio links or digital communication channels), where the user request includes a plurality of information about the user (who may or may not be the driver), the vehicle (which may be an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle), and the trip; (ii) transmit the user request to the insurer auction network, where the insurer auction network transmits the request to the plurality of insurer computer devices, which are configured to generate bids based upon the user request; (iii) receive, from the insurer auction network, a plurality of bids (or a selected winning bid) from the plurality of insurer computer devices for trip insurance based upon the user request; (iv) display the plurality of bids (or selected winning bid) to the user; (v) receive a user selection of a bid of the plurality of bids (or a user approval of the selected winning bid); (vi) transmit the user selection (or user approval) to the insurer auction network, where the insurer auction network notifies the insurer computer device associated with the selected bid (or winning bid), which may be the UBAIM server or may be in communication with the UBAIM server; (vii) store an insurance and/or smart contract that includes one or more terms (the terms may include conditions, clauses, vehicle or driver limitations, premiums, discounts, deductibles, endorsements, duties, obligations, etc.) for the trip using a blockchain structure, where the plurality of nodes store copies of the insurance contract, and where in some embodiments, the blockchain based insurance contract may be generated by the UBAIM server, and in other embodiments, the blockchain based insurance contract may be generated by the IM computer system based off of information from the bid and/or the UBAIM server. The IM computer system may further be configured to: (viii) receive, from the driver and/or a vehicle (such as an autonomous vehicle controller), a requested modification of at least one of the one or more terms of the insurance contract; (ix) transmit the requested modification to the UBAIM server; (x) receive a response to the request from the UBAIM server, where the response may include an approval or one or more additional terms; (xi) if the response includes one or more additional terms, display the one or more additional terms to the driver and/or vehicle for approval and wait to receive approval of the one or more additional terms from the driver; (xii) store the modification, the response, the approval, and/or the one or more additional terms in the insurance contract (which may be a virtual or electronic smart contract), in some embodiments, the IM computer system may (a) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the requested modification and the response, (b) update the insurance contract with the new block, and/or (c) transmit the new block with the plurality of nodes, where each the plurality of nodes are configured to update their stored copies of the insurance contract with the new block. In other embodiments, the IM computer system may transmit the requested modification and the response to the plurality of nodes, where each of the plurality of nodes are configured to generate a new block based upon the requested modification and the response and update their stored copies of the insurance contract with the generated block. The IM computer system may further be configured to: (xiii) receive sensor information from the one or more sensors associated with the vehicle; (xiv) with customer permission or affirmative consent, compare the received sensor information with the one or more terms (conditions, limitations, clauses, duties, obligations, etc.) of the (electronic and/or smart) insurance contract; (xv) determine whether the driver and/or the vehicle (such as autonomous vehicle) complied with the one or more terms based upon the comparison; (xvi) if the determination is that the driver or autonomous vehicle complied with the one or more terms, the computer device may be further configured to: (a) transmit a notification of driver or autonomous vehicle compliance to an insurance server associated with the insurance contract; (b) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the notification of driver or autonomous vehicle compliance; (c) store the notification of driver or autonomous vehicle compliance in the insurance contract; (d) receive an indication of a discount and/or lower premium for the insurance contract from the insurance server; (e) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the indication of the discount and/or lower premium; (f) store the indication in the insurance contract; (g) display the indication of the discount and/or lower premium of the insurance contract to the driver including an acknowledgement request; (h) receive the acknowledgement from the driver and/or vehicle; (i) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the acknowledgement; (j) store the acknowledgement in the insurance contract; and/or (k) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the notification, the indication, and/or the acknowledgement; and/or (xvii) generate a new block for the (electronic or smart) insurance contract that includes sensor information on a periodic basis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present embodiments may relate to systems and methods for managing usage-based insurance. A computer system, as described herein, may include a vehicle controller or a mobile computer device. The computer device may be configured to (i) receive a user request for trip insurance, where the user request includes a plurality of information about the user, the vehicle (which may be an autonomous vehicle), and the trip (such as an upcoming, approaching, or impending trip using the vehicle); (ii) transmit the user request to an insurer auction network, where the insurer auction network includes a plurality of insurers; (iii) receive, from the insurer auction network, a plurality of bids from a plurality of insurers for insurance for the trip (or a winning bid); (iv) display the plurality of bids (or winning bid) to the user; (v) receive a user selection of a bid of the plurality of bids (or approval of the winning bid); (vi) transmit the user selection (or user approval) to the insurer auction network; (vii) generate an insurance contract (such as a virtual or electronic insurance and/or smart contract) based upon the user request and the selected bid (or user approval of the winning bid); (viii) receive the insurance contract from an insurance server associated with the selected bid (or winning bid); (ix) store the insurance contract based upon the selected bid (or winning bid), where the insurance contract is in a blockchain structure, where a plurality of nodes store copies of the insurance contract in the blockchain structure. The plurality of nodes may include a plurality of computer devices each associated with one of a plurality of vehicles, and the insurance server may be one of the plurality of nodes, and may include one or more terms (the terms may include conditions, obligations, duties, limitations (including driver or vehicle limitations associated with a specific trip or usage-based insurance contract), premiums, discounts, deductibles, clauses, and/or other terms); (x) receive, from the driver and/or vehicle, a requested modification of at least one of the one or more terms of the insurance contract; (xi) transmit the requested modification to an insurance server associated with the insurance contract; (xii) receive a response to the request from the insurance server, where the response includes one or more additional terms; (xiii) display the one or more additional terms to the driver for approval; (xiv) receive approval of the one or more additional terms from the driver or vehicle; (xv) store the one or more additional terms and the response in the insurance contract; (xvi) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the requested modification and the response; (xvii) update the insurance contract with the new block; (xviii) transmit the new block the plurality of nodes, where each the plurality of nodes are configured to update their stored copies of the insurance contract with the new block; (xix) transmit the requested modification and the response to the plurality of nodes, where each of the plurality of nodes are configured to generate a new block based upon the requested modification and the response and update their stored copies of the insurance contract with the generated block; (xx) receive sensor information from one or more sensors associated with the vehicle or user mobile device; and/or (xxi) with the driver's or vehicle owner's permission or affirmative consent, compare the received sensor information with the one or more terms of the insurance contract.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The system may (xxii) determine whether the driver and/or vehicle (such as autonomous vehicle) complied with the one or more terms based upon the comparison; (xxiii) if the determination is that the driver and/or vehicle complied with the one or more terms, the computer device is further configured to: (a) transmit a notification of driver compliance to an insurance server associated with the insurance contract; (b) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the notification of driver compliance; (c) store the notification of driver compliance in the (electronic or smart) insurance contract; (d) receive an indication of a discount and/or lower premium for the insurance contract from the insurance server; (e) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the indication of the discount and/or lower premium; (f) store the indication in the insurance contract (g) display the indication of the discount and/or lower premium for the insurance contract to the driver including an acknowledgement request; (h) receive the acknowledgement from the driver; (i) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the acknowledgement; (j) store the acknowledgement in the insurance contract; and/or (k) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the notification, the indication, and the acknowledgement; and/or (xxiv) generate a new block for the insurance contract that includes sensor information on a periodic basis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The system may additionally or alternatively: (xxii) determine whether the driver and/or vehicle (such as autonomous vehicle) is approaching within a predetermined threshold of violating one or more terms based upon the comparison; (xxiii) if the determination is that the vehicle operation by the driver and/or vehicle itself (e.g., an autonomous vehicle) is approaching the one or more terms (or limits of vehicle operation), the computer device is further configured to: (a) transmit a warning or notification to the driver and/or vehicle; (b) generate a new block for the insurance contract based upon the notification; (c) store the notification in the (electronic or smart) insurance contract. The computing device may include additional, less, or alternate functionality, including that discussed elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">At least one advantage of this system is that because the system receives the actual telematics information from the vehicle during the trip, the computer device may analyze, with the driver's permission or affirmative consent (such as by opt-in to an insurance rewards program), the data to accurately determine if the driver has complied with the terms of the insurance during the trip and to be able to report that compliance to the insurer associated with the applicable insurance contract. Furthermore, since the insurance contract is stored using a blockchain format both the insurer and the computer device associated with the vehicle are able to update the insurance contract to ensure its accuracy. Another advantage of the system is allowing a driver a quick and efficient method of determining the most advantageous trip insurance. A further advantage of the system is to allow the driver and/or vehicle to request modifications of the insurance contract as the trip is occurring. This improves the level of customer service given to the driver by allowing reasonable modifications automatically.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect, a computer system for managing usage-based insurance is provided.

In one exemplary embodiment, the process may be performed by a computer device associated with a vehicle (such as an autonomous or smart vehicle controller or a user mobile device) and a User Based Auto Insurance Management (&#x201c;UBAIM&#x201d;) system, also known as a User Based Auto Insurance Management (&#x201c;UBAIM&#x201d;) server.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records, known as blocks. Each block may contain at least a timestamp and a link to the previous block in the chain. The link to the previous block may be a hash of the previous block. For an insurance contract, the first block may contain the initial contract between a driver and an insurer. The second block may contain a modification to the contract that was requested by the driver and approved by the insurer. The second block may contain a hashed copy of the first block as well. The third block may contain one or more additional terms for the insurance contract and a hashed copy of the second block. This continues on with each block adding on to the next while containing a hash of the previous blocks in the blockchain.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To ensure the security of the information contained in the blockchain, copies of the blockchain may be distributed across multiple computer devices, known as nodes. These nodes maintain the blockchain, update the blockchain when changes occur, and ensure the stability of the blockchain itself. In some embodiments, nodes may be also used to calculate the hash of the previous blocks. As the blockchain grows, the processing power needed to calculate the hash of the previous blocks grows as well. In these embodiments, the processing of the hash may be distributed over multiple computer devices to improve the speed of processing and/or to not overburden the hashing processor. When a node processes (hashes) a block, that node is known as a miner, where the action of validating and hashing the block is also known as mining.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the exemplary embodiment, a driver <b>115</b> is preparing to drive a vehicle on a trip. The driver generates a trip request. In some embodiments, the driver generates the trip request through a mobile device, such as a smartphone. In other embodiments, the trip request is generated through a vehicle controller of the vehicle to be driven, or operated (such as an autonomous vehicle) on the trip. To complete the trip request, the driver may enter additional information about the trip, such as, but not limited to, driver information, vehicle information, origin point, destination, date and time information, user preferences, autonomous vehicle settings, and/or other necessary data relating to the trip. For example, a trip may be for a few hours, where the driver is planning on driving to several local locations, such as for a shopping trip. Another trip may be for a few days, where the driver plans to drive from Washington D.C. to Chicago and back over a period of several days, such as for a vacation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the exemplary embodiment, the trip information may be transmitted to a multi-carrier auto insurer auction network, such as via wireless communication or data transmission over one or more radio links or digital communication channels. Within the insurer auction network may be a plurality of insurers, where computer devices associated with each insurer are in communication with the insurer auction network. In the exemplary embodiment, each insurer may receive the trip information from the driver or vehicle, and generates a bid for insuring driver's trip. The bids may be transmitted to the driver or the vehicle, such as through the vehicle controller. Each bid may include information about the bid, such as, but not limited to, limitations on the routes that the driver may take, price, such as price per mile (and/or the usage-based or mission-based insurance premium or rate), and/or stipulations or restrictions. These stipulations and/or restrictions may be based upon driver behavior, such as, but not limited to, maximum speed, maximum travel time per day, minimum safe following distance, autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle settings, and/or other driving behaviors that the insurer wishes to control.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the exemplary embodiment, the driver may choose a bid to accept. The selection is communicated to the winning insurer. The winning insurer communicates information about the policy, the driver, and the vehicle to its UBAIM system. When the driver accepts a policy, a smart contract (which may be an electronic or virtual contract) may be generated. As will be explained further below, a smart contract may be based upon a blockchain structure. In the exemplary embodiment, the smart contract includes all of the information about the trip insurance policy including the information on the stipulations. In the exemplary embodiment, the smart contract may be stored in plurality of locations including the vehicle controller and the UBAIM system. In the exemplary embodiment, the smart contract is a blockchain ledger that is distributed among a plurality of participants (also known as nodes). The nodes are capable of communicating with the UBAIM system though an application programming interface (API). The UBAIM system may also use the API to communicate with outside applications, such as, but not limited to, data sources about the vehicle and/or the driver, access to law enforcement, and other applications as necessary to work as described herein. In the exemplary embodiment, the UBAIM system may include a firewall to protect the private information of the driver. In some further embodiments, the private information is only stored by the UBAIM system and is not stored in the blockchain ledger.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the exemplary embodiment, the UBAIM system may also include a usage manager/messaging system. The UBAIM system may use usage manager/messaging system <b>230</b> to communicate with the driver or the vehicle controller. The UBAIM system may receive information about an ongoing trip, such as driver behavior to determine if the driver is within the restrictions required by the policy. The UBAIM system may also receive communications from the driver requesting a variance from the restrictions of the trip insurance. For example, the driver may decide to travel 30 miles off of the route described in the policy, such as to visit a friend or a specific scenic site. The driver may transmit a request to the UBAIM system requesting this variance. The UBAIM system may determine whether or not to allow this variance. If the UBAIM system approves the variance, then the smart contract is updated. In some embodiments, this update may be performed at the prime node (such as at the UBAIM server) and a new block is transmitted to the other nodes in the blockchain ledger. In other embodiments, information about the update may be transmitted to the other nodes in the blockchain ledger for them to create their own blocks.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the exemplary embodiment, each smart contract is stored in its own blockchain ledger. As the smart contract is modified or additional information is added to the smart contract, such as actual driver behavior, another block may be added to the blockchain of the smart contract.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At least one of the technical problems addressed by this system may include: (i) improving speed and accuracy of issuing an insurance policy (usage-based policy) for an individual trip; (ii) allowing for automatic changes to the insurance policy based upon a user request; (iii) improving the online security of the insurance policy through the blockchain technology; (iv) accurately monitoring the actions of the insured and/or an autonomous vehicle to ensure compliance with the insurance policy; (v) constantly improving the accuracy of data used to make insurance decisions about trip insurance; and/or (iv) facilitating an auction environment for individual trip insurance.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) store an insurance contract for a currently occurring trip or an upcoming trip, where the insurance contract is for a driver of a vehicle to insure the driver and/or vehicle during the currently occurring or upcoming trip, and where the insurance contract includes one or more terms; (b) receive sensor information from one or more sensors associated with the vehicle; (c) compare the received sensor information with the one or more terms of the insurance contract; (d) determine whether the driver and/or autonomous vehicle complied with the one or more terms based upon the comparison; and (f) if the determination is that the driver and/or autonomous vehicle complied with the one or more terms, the processor may be further programmed to: (1) transmit a notification of driver and/or autonomous vehicle compliance to an insurance server associated with the insurance contract; and (2) store the notification of driver and/or autonomous vehicle compliance in the insurance contract.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additional technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) receive, from the driver and/or an autonomous or smart vehicle, a requested modification of at least one of the one or more terms of the insurance contract; (b) transmit the requested modification to an insurance server associated with the insurance contract; (c) receive a response to the request from the insurance server; and (d) store the response in the insurance contract. For example, as a new block associated with the blockchain structure.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) receive a user request for trip insurance (such as via wireless communication or data transmission over one or more radio links or digital communication channels), where the user request includes a plurality of information about the user, the vehicle (which may be a smart or autonomous vehicle), and the trip; (b) transmit the user request to an insurer auction network, where the insurer auction network includes a plurality of insurers; (c) receive, from the insurer auction network, a plurality of bids from a plurality of insurers for insurance for the trip; (d) display the plurality of bids to the user; (e) receive a user selection of a bid of the plurality of bids; (f) transmit the user selection to the insurer auction network; and (g) store an insurance contract based upon the selected bid, such as in a blockchain structure.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, additional technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) store a plurality of insurance contracts, where each insurance contract is in a blockchain structure, and where each of the plurality of insurance contracts are also stored on a plurality of nodes; (b) receive an update to one of the plurality of insurance contracts; (c) generate a new block including the update for the insurance contract associated with the update to be added to the block chain structure; and/or (d) transmit the new block to each of the plurality of nodes that are storing the associated insurance contract, so that each receiving node will update the associated insurance contract.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Exemplary Vehicle</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a view of an exemplary vehicle <b>100</b>.

As used herein, &#x201c;trip&#x201d; refers to a discrete use of vehicle <b>100</b>, from an initial starting point (e.g., starting vehicle <b>100</b>) to an end point (e.g., reaching a destination or turning off vehicle <b>100</b>). Determining usage of vehicle <b>100</b> by one or more users may facilitate collecting and/or generating vehicle-based telematics data associated with each user.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may interpret the sensory information to identify vehicle users (e.g., driver <b>115</b> and/or passengers <b>120</b>) present in vehicle <b>100</b> during a trip. For example, vehicle computer device <b>110</b> may determine positional information for at least one vehicle user of vehicle <b>100</b> present in vehicle <b>100</b> during a trip. Positional information may include a position of a vehicle user, a direction of facing of the vehicle user, a size of the vehicle user, and/or a skeletal positioning of the vehicle user. The position of the vehicle user may include which seat the vehicle user occupies. The direction of facing of the vehicle user may include whether the vehicle user is facing forward, reaching forward, reaching to the side, and/or has his/her head turned. The size of the vehicle user may determine whether the vehicle user is an adult or a child. The size of the vehicle user may also include the vehicle user's height. The skeletal positioning may include positioning of the vehicle user's joints, spine, arms, legs, torso, neck face, head, major bones, hands, and/or feet.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Where vehicle <b>100</b> is a semi-autonomous or regular vehicle, such that a driver <b>115</b> controls vehicle <b>100</b> during part or the entirety of one or more trips, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may interpret sensory information to collect and/or generate telematics data associated with driving characteristics of driver <b>115</b>. For example, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may collect vehicle telematics data from user computer device <b>125</b> and/or one or more of sensors <b>105</b>. Vehicle telematics data may include data from user computer device <b>125</b> and/or one or more of sensors <b>105</b> and may include navigation, communications, safety, security, and/or &#x201c;infotainment&#x201d; data. For example, vehicle telematics data collected and analyzed by vehicle controller <b>110</b> may include, but is not limited to braking and/or acceleration data, navigation data, vehicle settings (e.g., seat position, mirror position, temperature or air control settings, etc.), remote-unlock and/or remote-start data (e.g., determining which user computer device <b>125</b> is used to unlock or start vehicle <b>100</b>) and/or any other telematics data.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment, vehicle <b>100</b> may include a communication device that allows it to communicate with other devices, for example, via the Internet or any other wired or wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth&#xae;) over one or more radio links or wireless communication channels. Vehicle <b>100</b> may be in communication with one or more user computer devices <b>125</b> that are each associated with one of users of vehicle <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, vehicle <b>100</b> may have &#x201c;application pairing&#x201d; functionality via the communication device, such that vehicle users may engage with an app on a user interface at the vehicle and/or on their user computer device <b>125</b> (e.g., their smartphone). In one embodiment, at the beginning and/or at the end of a trip, the app may prompt selection of which vehicle user is/was the driver <b>115</b> of the trip, and vehicle controller <b>110</b> may record the selected driver <b>115</b> as the driver <b>115</b> for the trip, such that telematics data associated with that trip may be attributed to the correct driver <b>115</b>. Additionally or alternatively, this method may be employed as a validation or verification to one or more other determination methods. For example, after a trip in which the driver <b>115</b> is determined using another method, the app may prompt confirmation that the determined driver <b>115</b> was, in fact, the driver <b>115</b> of the trip. Vehicle controller <b>110</b> may receive an indication of a positive or negative response to the prompt, and update records for the trip accordingly.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Using the application pairing functionality, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may further determine which user computer device(s) <b>125</b> are within vehicle <b>100</b> during a trip. For example, each user may pair one or more user computer devices <b>125</b> (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, etc.) to vehicle <b>100</b>. Vehicle <b>100</b> may then pair with one or more user computer devices <b>125</b> that are within vehicle <b>100</b> during a trip. Vehicle controller <b>110</b> may record which device(s) <b>725</b> pair with vehicle <b>100</b> for a trip. If only one user computer device <b>125</b> pairs with vehicle <b>100</b>, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may determine that the user associated with that user computer device <b>125</b> was the driver <b>115</b> for the trip. If more than one user computer device <b>125</b> pairs with vehicle <b>100</b>, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may request selection and/or confirmation of which associated vehicle user is the driver <b>115</b> for the trip, as described above (e.g., using an in-vehicle app and/or an app on the user computer device <b>125</b>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In still other embodiments, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may use additional and/or alternative vehicle telematics data, such as sensor information from sensors within a paired user computer device <b>125</b>, to determine which vehicle user is the driver <b>115</b> when multiple user computer devices <b>125</b> pair with vehicle <b>100</b> during a single trip. In one example, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may use gyroscope and/or accelerometer sensor information from the paired user computer devices <b>125</b> to identify which side of vehicle <b>100</b> each user of a user computer device <b>125</b> used to enter vehicle <b>100</b> and/or exit vehicle <b>100</b>. In other words, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may access and process data from the gyroscope and/or accelerometer for each user computer device <b>125</b> to determine whether the user of the user computer device <b>125</b> entered vehicle <b>100</b> on the left (e.g., driver) or the right (e.g., passenger). If only two user computer devices <b>125</b> are present and vehicle controller <b>110</b> determines that a first device <b>125</b> is associated with the left side of vehicle <b>100</b> and a second device <b>125</b> is associated with the right side of vehicle <b>100</b>, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may record that the user associated with the first device <b>125</b> is the driver <b>115</b> and the user of the second device <b>125</b> is a passenger <b>120</b> for the trip. If more than one device <b>125</b> is associated with the left side of vehicle <b>100</b> (e.g., the driver's side), vehicle controller <b>110</b> may employ one or more other methods described herein to determine the driver <b>115</b> of vehicle <b>100</b>. It should be understood that although the left side is associated with a &#x201c;driver's side&#x201d; and the right side is associated with a &#x201c;passenger side&#x201d; herein, as is the custom in the United States of America, this method is easily applied to other driving customs in which the left side is a passenger side and the right side is the driver's side.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Another method of determining the driver <b>115</b> of a trip may include providing user-specific keys. For instance, each user of vehicle <b>100</b> may receive a user-specific key fob (or other device, such as a mobile device, i.e., smartphone or wearable electronics), which is registered to that specific user. The users may sign a contract or other agreement that each user will only use the key specific to his- or herself, which may encourage the vehicle users to carefully and consistently only use their specific key. When the user-specific key is employed to unlock and/or start vehicle <b>100</b> (e.g., in keyless start vehicles), vehicle controller <b>110</b> may record which key is used, and, therefore, may identify which vehicle user to designate as the driver <b>115</b> for the trip. Additionally or alternatively, location-sensitive tracking may be used to determine which user-specific key is within vehicle <b>100</b> during the trip. If only one user-specific key is sensed, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may record which user-specific key was sensed, may automatically designate the associated vehicle user as the driver <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, vehicle controller <b>110</b> may use driving profiles developed as described herein to identify drivers <b>115</b> of one or more trips in vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, driving 15 miles in the morning at average speeds of 50 mph and with few sudden decelerations may be associated with User A (e.g., a commuting user) for a dozen trips using one or more of the above methods, such that any other trips that share some or all of these characteristics may be automatically associated with User A (e.g., without using any or all of the above methods).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In still other embodiments, vehicle <b>100</b> may include and employ one or more biometric sensors <b>105</b> to determine which vehicle user is the driver <b>115</b> for a trip. Biometric sensors <b>105</b> may include any sensor <b>105</b> configured to receive a biological signal uniquely identifying an individual, such as, but not limited to, retinal scanners, fingerprint scanners, facial recognition devices, and weight scales. In one example, vehicle <b>100</b> may have one or more fingerprint scanners on a component of vehicle <b>100</b> only easily accessible by the driver, such as the dashboard, the console, or the steering wheel. In another example, vehicle <b>100</b> may have a weight scale (or pressure sensor) associated with the driver's seat and/or with the passenger's seats. Vehicle <b>100</b> may have a registered weight associated with each user of vehicle <b>100</b>. When any vehicle user sits in any of the seats, their weight may be measured by the scale and the particular vehicle user may be identified.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">While vehicle <b>100</b> may be an automobile in the exemplary embodiment, in other embodiments, vehicle <b>100</b> may be, but is not limited to, other types of ground craft, aircraft, and watercraft vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Exemplary Process for Managing Usage-Based Insurance</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of an exemplary computer-implemented process <b>200</b> of managing usage-based insurance, such as of vehicle <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, a driver <b>115</b> may exhibit one or more high-risk behaviors, according to collected vehicle telematics data (e.g., high occurrence of abrupt deceleration, particularly fast turns, and/or extreme acceleration). The driving profile may include one or more usage characteristics that represent various risk behaviors exhibited (or not exhibited) by driver <b>115</b>. For instance, one usage characteristic may include a numeric value or other indicator that represents driver <b>115</b> rarely drives above a posted speed limit. As another example, another usage characteristic may include a numeric value or other indicator that represents driver <b>115</b> frequently drives at &#x201c;high-risk&#x201d; times of the day, such as between midnight and 6 AM. As another example, a usage characteristic may be associated with maintenance of the vehicle, such as how often maintenance is performed, or whether or not scheduled maintenance is performed in a timely manner.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In these embodiments, IM computer device <b>410</b> and/or UBAIM server <b>220</b> may use the driver profile to determine whether or not to generate a lower premium and/or a discount for driver <b>115</b> and/or vehicle <b>100</b> associated with insurance contract <b>222</b> based upon driver's and/or (autonomous) vehicle's driving profile.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">IM computer device <b>410</b> and/or UBAIM server <b>220</b> may a;sp access or retrieve telematics data collected by vehicle <b>100</b>, vehicle controller <b>110</b>, sensors <b>105</b>, and/or user computer device <b>125</b> to generate the driving profile for driver <b>115</b> including the one or more usage characteristics.

The competitive advantage lies in entering this market in its infancy and employing a Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) solution to gather valuable data and gain actuarial experience in the vehicle independent UBI market. Onboard sensors collect information which may provide valuable insight on the driver's behavior.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">The UBI solution may require users to file for a policy and a quote for every individual trip that the user plans. As the user only pays for the trips that the user has performed, the user is only paying for use of the vehicle and not for the time when the user is not using a vehicle. In some embodiments, the UBI solution may also be known as a pay as you go or pay as you drive solution. The UBI solution may provide for providing insurance coverage for individual or particular trips based upon type of trip, vehicle in question, route characteristics, driver qualifications and history, etc. as discussed elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">The present embodiments may employ a UBI solution to gather valuable data and gain actuarial experience in the UBI market. Auto sensor data may be collected and used for rating purposes. The present embodiments may also establish improved restrictions and guidelines for operations of a vehicle while the user is covered under a specific insurance policy.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">In the present embodiments, the UBI solution may generate variable quotes for trips based upon a variety of factors, such as, but not limited to, type of trip, vehicle in question, route characteristics, driver qualifications, driver history, driver vehicle, and/or driver features (such as autonomous or semi-autonomous features and systems). Other factors, such as, but not limited to, how often the individual driver and/or an autonomous vehicle takes trips to the particular location, and/or the amount of experience that the individual operator has with that particular type of vehicle may affect the price of the quote as well.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">In some further embodiments, a collection of sensor information from vehicles that the driver has driven may also include information about whether the driver is a safe driver or just been lucky so far. Safety issues may include, but are not limited to, speeds, passing distances, stoplight behavior, any accidents in the past, past damage claims, traffic violations, and other factors that may allow the systems described here to determining the potential risks with this driver.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS</heading><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Usage-based auto insurance (per-trip or for a time duration&#x2014;hour, week, day, month, year) auto insurance will likely become an important auto insurance feature in the future. A usage based system can draw upon blockchain technology and an auction system, to allow drivers to submit a bid request (for a trip or time duration) to multiple insurance carriers for auto insurance coverage.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">There is currently not a known technology that allows a multi-carrier auction mechanism for usage based auto insurance that allows transparency and trusted data integrity. Part of this may be the nature of company database systems&#x2014;they are located in one company, and no third party has designed multi-party auction system probably due to the complexity of actuarial and underwriting, as well as working with each insurance carrier.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Advances in mapping technologies, GPS, available data feeds from government regarding road construction activity, weather, traffic, etc. makes it possible to consider these variables now in underwriting a per-usage (time or trip) auto insurance coverage.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">One of the advantages of the system described in this disclosure is that it allows for a driver to use an in-vehicle computer system to request an auto insurance coverage bid to various participating insurance carriers (carriers can opt-in according to some set criteria, or be pulled from a list of the insured's preferred insurers). It is assumed that a driver and vehicle combination has been &#x201c;cleared&#x201d; or approved by an insurance provider or a clearinghouse organization that my approve driver/vehicle combinations for insurance companies (possibly using driver history, vehicle attributes, other demographic information).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">The bid request is sent to a group of carriers from the vehicle wirelessly via internet, with route information, vehicle, driver, time, etc. The insurer uses standard underwriting models integrating all data available (vehicle, driver, time, date, route, traffic, etc.) to derive a bid price for coverage. This bid is sent back to the vehicle/driver for consideration, with stipulations (such as time limitations, speed limit considerations, specific route and deviance from route). Multiple bids may come in from multiple carriers, and the driver or vehicle accepts a bid with the stipulations.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Note that this assumes in some cases a vehicle may act independently, based upon preferences by the owner or insured, to be able to accept bids and remit payment for an insurance coverage usage window (time or trip). The funds for premium may be contained in a driver, owner, or vehicle &#x201c;wallet&#x201d; with cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin, Ether, proprietary insurer e-coin, etc.). This bid is written into a smart contract with price, stipulations, and all associated data (vehicle/driver, time, route, etc.) with the cryptocurrency payment (Bitcoin, Ether, any proprietary insurance company coin, etc.). The data is sent to the blockchain participant miners or block chain participant company (federation) and the data is added to a block in the blockchain. The data encoded in the blockchain is then a part of the record (immutable) and shared with all participating insurance carriers (as well as the winning bid insurance carrier).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">The blockchain manager handles the data inside the insurance company firewall, and handles stipulations and termination of coverage (and via a messaging manager can communicate to the vehicle onboard display to notify driver or vehicle of potential lack of compliance with terms and conditions or to notify driver or vehicle of an earned discount). The details of bid acceptance and termination would be visible to all drivers/owners and insurers in the network (public), and this would aid in transparency for insurance coverage and liability (a driver could not claim insurer A provided coverage when it was clearly insurer B).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">As described in detail above, the system includes (1) a multi-carrier auction; (2) per usage auto insurance coverage (time or trip, according to the insured's preferences); (3) automatic remittance of premium to insurer at start of trip, from driver/owner/vehicle wallet; and (4) clear, shared, unchangeable record detailing time and route of coverage with stipulations. The coverage window may be clearly stated in smart contract.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</heading><p id="p-0198" num="0197">As will be appreciated based upon the foregoing specification, the above-described embodiments of the disclosure may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof.
