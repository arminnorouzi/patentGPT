As is described in greater detail below, the vehicle <b>20</b> comprises a powertrain <b>22</b> configured to generate torque at an input used to rotate one or more wheels <b>24</b> at an output for propelling the vehicle <b>20</b> during use. To this end, the representative embodiment of the powertrain <b>22</b> illustrated herein comprises a prime mover realized as an electric machine <b>26</b> configured to generate torque and rotation which, in turn, is translated to a multispeed transmission <b>28</b>. The multispeed transmission <b>28</b> cooperates with a final drive assembly <b>30</b> to adjust output characteristics of the electric machine <b>26</b>, such as to translate torque at different rotational speeds and different torques to the wheel <b>24</b> in order to facilitate optimized acceleration and propulsion of the vehicle <b>20</b>. To this end, the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> may facilitate changing between discrete &#x201c;gear sets&#x201d; to translate torque at a plurality of predetermined rates to effect corresponding changes in the rotational speed of the wheel <b>24</b>. The final drive assembly <b>30</b> is employed to further adjust torque translated by the multispeed transmission <b>28</b>, such as at a predetermined final drive ratio, before subsequently directing further-adjusted torque to the wheel <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the illustrated embodiment, the final drive assembly <b>30</b> is interposed between the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> and the wheel <b>24</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the final drive assembly <b>30</b> could be formed as a part of the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> in some embodiments. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the final drive assembly <b>30</b> could be realized in a number of different ways, such as with a ring and pinion arrangement, one or more planetary gear sets, a portal gear set, and the like. Furthermore, depending on the specific configuration of the vehicle <b>20</b> and/or the powertrain <b>22</b>, the final drive assembly <b>30</b> could be positioned differently relative to the input and the output along the &#x201c;torque flow path&#x201d; between the wheel <b>24</b>, the electric machine <b>26</b>, and/or the multispeed transmission <b>28</b>, or could be omitted entirely from some embodiments. As will be appreciated from the subsequent description below, the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> could be configured in any suitable way sufficient to effect translating torque between the electric machine <b>26</b> and the wheel <b>24</b> at different speed ratios without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">While the powertrain <b>22</b> illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is configured to propel the vehicle <b>20</b> using torque generated by the electric machine <b>26</b>, it will be appreciated that the vehicle <b>20</b> could also be provided with additional components, systems, and the like that cooperate to facilitate acceleration and/or propulsion of the vehicle <b>20</b>. By way of non-limiting example, discrete powertrains <b>22</b> of the type described herein could be employed at multiple locations on a single vehicle <b>20</b> to each independently drive respective wheels <b>24</b> of the same vehicle <b>20</b>. In addition, while the illustrated powertrain <b>22</b> is shown as being configured to drive a single wheel <b>24</b>, it is conceivable that the powertrain <b>22</b> could further comprise a differential (not shown) to facilitate driving multiple wheels <b>24</b> with torque generated by the same electric machine <b>26</b>. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the vehicle <b>20</b> could comprise additional systems and components, beyond the components of the illustrated powertrain <b>22</b>, to facilitate acceleration and/or propulsion of the vehicle <b>20</b>. By way of non-limiting example, an internal combustion engine (not shown) could also be employed to generate torque used to drive the wheel <b>24</b> of the illustrated powertrain <b>22</b>, and/or to drive other wheels of the vehicle <b>20</b>. Other configurations are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that it is desirable to change (or shift) between gear sets in the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> in a smooth and controller manner. One method generally involves interrupting torque to modulate rotational velocity of the prime mover and/or the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> to match speed when changing between gear sets. In the related art, various combinations of friction-type clutches and interference-type clutches are commonly utilized for this purpose in connection with vehicles <b>20</b>, whereby friction-type clutches, either alone or in combination with interference-type clutches, are used to modulate torque. However, depending on the specific configuration and intended use of the vehicle <b>20</b>, it may be impractical to utilize conventional friction-type clutches alone for certain applications, such as where the vehicle <b>20</b> is configured for commercial or industrial use and is relatively heavy and/or is used to transport heavy loads. It will be appreciated that the substantial amount of torque needed to propel a heavy vehicle <b>20</b> generally results in a correspondingly-substantial load on the powertrain <b>22</b> which, in turn, tends to make friction-type clutches slip. Moreover, even where conventional interference-type clutches and friction-type clutches are used in combination to facilitate torque modulation without slipping under heavy load (such as with a dog clutch and a synchronizer), they can be expensive to manufacture, difficult to package, and may have a short useful life. Furthermore, when used in connection with electric machines <b>26</b>, which are capable of efficiently generating torque across broad ranges of relatively high rotational velocities (for example, 25,000 RPM) in comparison to conventional internal combustion engines (for example, 5,000 RPM), it can be extremely difficult to for an interference-type clutch to withstand impact forces encountered during a gear change where a high-speed electric machine <b>26</b> is used in connection with a relatively heavy vehicle <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As is explained in greater detail below, the present invention is directed toward an interface module, generally indicated at <b>32</b>, which overcomes the disadvantages described above by facilitating modulation of torque through the powertrain <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b> in an efficient, predictable, and reliable manner, in particular when used in connection with electric machines <b>26</b> that are capable of operating at high speeds to propel vehicles <b>20</b> that are relatively heavy and/or configured to transport heavy loads. The interface module <b>32</b> is configured for use in the powertrain <b>22</b> for modulating torque between the input and the output.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the interface module <b>32</b> generally comprises an input drum <b>34</b>, an output shaft <b>36</b>, a torsional damper assembly <b>38</b>, and an overload clutch assembly <b>40</b>. As is depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the input drum <b>34</b> of the interface module <b>32</b> is configured for receiving torque from the input and for rotating when torque is received. Similarly, the output shaft <b>36</b> is configured for transferring torque to the output and for rotating therewith. In the embodiment shown, the interface module <b>32</b> includes a drive gear <b>42</b> coupled to the input drum <b>34</b> for concurrent rotation. The drive gear <b>42</b> is disposed in meshed-engagement with the input, shown here as an input pinion <b>44</b> coupled to the electric machine <b>26</b>, and the output shaft <b>36</b> of the interface module <b>32</b> is disposed in rotational communication with the multispeed transmission <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>B</figref>, the interface module <b>32</b> is shown both in an exploded perspective view and in a section view. The input drum <b>34</b> defines an interior <b>46</b> and a rotational axis <b>48</b>, and has a drive hub <b>50</b> facing the interior <b>46</b> and extending along the rotational axis <b>48</b>. The input drum <b>34</b> further defines a bore <b>52</b> extending through the drive hub <b>50</b> along the rotational axis <b>48</b> and radially inward of the drive hub <b>50</b>. The input drum <b>34</b> is configured for receiving torque from the input pinion <b>44</b> and for rotating about the rotational axis <b>48</b> when torque is received. As will be discussed in further detail below, the overload clutch <b>40</b> is operatively arranged between the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> and the drive hub <b>50</b> of the input drum <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The vehicle <b>20</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> that generally supports and otherwise accommodates various components of the powertrain <b>22</b>. Here, the interface module <b>32</b> is rotatably supported in the housing <b>102</b> by bearings <b>54</b>, discussed in further detail below. It is contemplated that the interface module <b>32</b> could be constructed without the bearings <b>54</b> and integrated into the input or the output. While the interface module <b>32</b> is schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with both the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> and the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> being supported in the input drum <b>34</b>, it will be appreciated that the interface module <b>32</b> could be arranged differently in some embodiments. By way of non-limiting example, it is conceivable that the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> could be interposed between the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> and the final drive assembly <b>30</b>, while the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> could remain supported in the housing <b>102</b> interposed between the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> and the electric machine <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> is disposed in the interior <b>46</b> of the input drum <b>34</b> about the rotational axis <b>48</b> and operatively arranged between the input drum <b>34</b> and the output shaft <b>36</b>. The output shaft <b>36</b> extends along the rotational axis <b>48</b> and is at least partially disposed in the interior <b>46</b> of the input drum <b>34</b>. The torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> comprises an input-side damper body <b>56</b> rotatable about the rotational axis <b>48</b> and having a first ramp arrangement <b>58</b>, and an output-side damper body <b>60</b> coupled to the output shaft <b>36</b> and having a second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> disposed in resilient engagement with the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b>. The input-side damper body <b>56</b> is arranged with the drive hub <b>50</b> arranged radially inward of the overload clutch <b>40</b> and a portion of the input-side damper body <b>56</b>. The output-side damper body <b>60</b> is rotatable about the rotational axis <b>48</b> and arranged to move axially along the rotational axis <b>48</b> relative to the input-side damper body <b>56</b>. The output-side damper body <b>60</b> is movable between a first engagement position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and a second engagement position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) defined by a predetermined torque differential between the input drum <b>34</b> and the output shaft <b>36</b>. The first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> and the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> abut each other in both the first and second engagement positions. The predetermined torque differential occurring between the input drum <b>34</b> and the output shaft <b>36</b> moves the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> away from the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> axially along the rotational axis <b>48</b> and toward the second engagement position.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the embodiment shown, the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> comprises a plurality of input lobes <b>66</b> and the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> comprises a plurality of output lobes <b>68</b>. Each input lobe <b>66</b> and output lobe <b>68</b> defines a ramp angle &#x3b8;, with the ramp angle &#x3b8; being between 35 degrees and 45 degrees. Each of the input lobes <b>66</b> and the output lobes <b>68</b> has a respective crest <b>106</b>. A valley <b>108</b> is defined between each adjacent input lobe <b>66</b> and each adjacent output lobe <b>68</b> with the crests <b>106</b> and valleys <b>108</b> having complementary profiles.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The output-side damper body <b>60</b> defines a pocket <b>110</b> opposite the second ramp <b>62</b>. The pocket <b>110</b> has an annular profile coaxial with the rotational axis <b>48</b> and radially outward of the output shaft <b>36</b>. The output shaft <b>36</b> protrudes through the pocket <b>110</b> away from the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> and defines a recess to receive an external snap-ring <b>96</b>, discussed in further detail below. In the illustrated embodiment the output shaft <b>36</b> is integrally formed with the output-side damper body <b>60</b>, however it should be appreciated that the output shaft <b>36</b> may be coupled to the output-side damper body <b>60</b> using other methods known in the art. For example, the output shaft <b>36</b> may be splined or otherwise keyed to the output-side damper body <b>60</b>, or may be fixed by welding or a threaded fastener (not shown).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Relative movement between the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> and the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> causes the output lobes <b>68</b> to slide against the input lobes <b>66</b>, following the profile of the crest <b>106</b>. The complementary crest <b>106</b> and valley <b>108</b> profiles guide the output lobe <b>68</b> into a stability condition with the input lobe <b>66</b> wherein the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> and the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> are fully engaged with each other in equilibrium. More specifically, the first engagement position of the output-side damper body <b>60</b> is defined when the crests <b>106</b> and the valleys <b>108</b> of the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> nest with the crests <b>106</b> and the valleys <b>108</b> of the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b>. Movement of the output lobe <b>68</b> and the input lobe <b>66</b> away from equilibrium causes corresponding movement of the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> relative to the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b>, with the first engagement position of the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> corresponding to equilibrium of the output lobe <b>68</b> and the input lobe <b>66</b>. This movement of the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> relative to the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> is translated into axial displacement and angular displacement of the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> proportional to the ramp angle &#x3b8;. Minimum axial displacement and angular displacement are achieved in the first engagement position, with the second engagement position defined by axial displacement and angular displacement greater than the minimum.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Movement of the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> between the first engagement position and the second engagement position is responsive to a difference in torque between the input and the output. Said differently, a torque differential between the input and the output acts to move the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> and the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> relative to each other. The torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> further comprises a damper preload member <b>64</b> abutting the output-side damper body <b>60</b> to urge the output-side damper body <b>60</b> into the first engagement position. The damper preload member <b>64</b> is disposed in the pocket <b>110</b> and generally coaxial with the rotational axis <b>48</b>. Here, the damper preload member <b>64</b> comprises at least one disc spring <b>70</b> arranged about the rotational axis <b>48</b> for opposing axial displacement of the output-side damper body <b>60</b>. The damper preload member <b>64</b> must be compressed by the output-side damper body <b>60</b> to move the output-side damper body <b>60</b> away from the first engagement position. The predetermined torque differential is the amount of torque applied to the output shaft <b>36</b> and the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> to generate an axial force that overcomes the force to compress the damper preload member <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As mentioned above the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> is operatively arranged between the input-side damper body <b>56</b> and the drive hub <b>50</b> of the input drum <b>34</b>. The overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> is configured to limit the amount of torque that can be translated between the electric machine <b>26</b> and the wheel <b>24</b> and vice versa. The maximum torque that can be translated through the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> is referred to as a capacity. By way of non-limiting example, the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> may be configured to &#x201c;slip&#x201d; in response to a differential torque occurring between the electric machine <b>26</b> and the final drive assembly <b>30</b> which exceeds 120% of the maximum torque output of the electric machine <b>26</b>, caused such as via a torque spike resulting from shifting the multispeed transmission <b>28</b>. The overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> is operable between a first mode rotatably coupling the input drum <b>34</b> and the input-side damper body <b>56</b>, and a second mode permitting relative rotation of the input drum <b>34</b> and the input-side damper body <b>56</b>. The overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> includes a clutch biasing member <b>72</b>, an inner clutch plate <b>74</b> mounted to the drive hub <b>50</b> and an outer clutch plate <b>76</b> mounted to the input-side damper body <b>56</b>, each of the inner clutch plate <b>74</b> and the outer clutch plate <b>76</b> being disposed between the clutch biasing member <b>72</b> and the input drum <b>34</b>. The clutch biasing member <b>72</b> is configured to urge the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> into the first mode, in which the inner clutch plate <b>74</b> and the outer clutch plate <b>76</b> are rotatably fixed to transfer torque and rotation between the input drum <b>34</b> and the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b>. In the second mode the inner clutch plate <b>74</b> and the outer clutch plate <b>76</b> rotate relative to each other, or &#x201c;slip&#x201d;, limiting the amount of torque transferred between the input drum <b>34</b> and the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment shown, the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> is a friction clutch, with the inner clutch plate <b>74</b> further defined as a plurality of inner clutch plates <b>74</b>A, <b>74</b>B, <b>74</b>C, and the outer clutch plate <b>76</b> further defined as a plurality of outer clutch plates <b>76</b>A, <b>76</b>B, <b>76</b>C. It should be appreciated that alternative configurations of an overload or torque limiting clutch may be implemented. For example, the overload clutch <b>40</b> may comprise an electromagnetic coupling, wherein the input drum <b>34</b> and the input-side damper body <b>56</b> are magnetically coupled for concurrent rotation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the inner clutch plates <b>74</b> are supported for concurrent rotation on the drive hub <b>50</b> of the input drum <b>34</b>.

Similarly, the outer clutch plates <b>76</b> are supported for concurrent rotation in the input-side damper body <b>56</b> of the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b>. Each outer clutch plate <b>76</b> defines an outer engagement feature, generally indicated at <b>82</b>, and the input-side damper body <b>56</b> defines an inner engagement feature <b>84</b> configured for engagement with the outer engagement feature <b>82</b> of the outer clutch plates <b>76</b>.

Each of the disc springs <b>70</b>, <b>104</b> may be realized as a stack of coned-shaped disc springs, which advantageously exert relatively high force at relatively low displacement. However, it will be appreciated that other configurations are contemplated and, thus, the clutch biasing member <b>72</b> could be configured in any suitable way sufficient to energize the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b>, and the damper preload member <b>64</b> could be configured in any suitable way sufficient to energize the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b>. By way of non-limiting illustration, the damper preload member <b>64</b> and the clutch biasing member <b>72</b> could be realized as coil springs. Other configurations are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>B</figref>, the interface module <b>32</b> further includes an input drum cover <b>86</b>, which abuts the output-side damper body <b>60</b> and is restricted from moving axially relative to the input drum <b>34</b> by a first internal snap ring <b>88</b>. A damper cover <b>90</b> is disposed in the bore <b>52</b> of the input drum <b>34</b> and arranged in abutment with the damper preload member <b>64</b>. The pocket <b>110</b> of the output-side damper body <b>60</b> faces the damper cover <b>90</b> with the damper preload member <b>64</b> disposed in the pocket <b>110</b> and abutting the damper cover <b>90</b>. The damper cover <b>90</b> defines an opening <b>92</b> along the rotational axis <b>48</b> for receiving the output shaft <b>36</b>. Here, it will be appreciated that the output-side damper body <b>60</b> is not splined to the input drum <b>34</b> and is able to translate axially relative to the input drum <b>34</b> and to rotate relative to the input drum <b>34</b>. The damper cover <b>90</b> is restricted from moving axially in one direction relative to the input drum <b>34</b> via a second internal snap ring <b>94</b>, and the damper cover <b>90</b> is restricted from moving axially relative to the output shaft <b>36</b> by an external snap ring <b>96</b>. Thus, the first internal snap ring <b>88</b>, the second internal snap ring <b>94</b>, and the external snap ring <b>96</b> cooperate to limit the amount of axial displacement that can occur between the input drum cover <b>86</b> and the damper cover <b>90</b>, which in turn limit the amount of axial movement that can occur between the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> and the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned above, bearings <b>54</b> support the input drum <b>34</b> and the input drum cover <b>86</b> for rotation relative to the housing <b>102</b>. The torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> further comprises a pilot shaft <b>98</b> coupled to the input-side damper body <b>56</b> and extending along the rotational axis <b>48</b>, and a pilot bushing <b>100</b> coupled to the output-side damper body <b>60</b> for engaging the pilot shaft <b>98</b>. The pilot shaft <b>98</b> is rotatably supported by the pilot bushing <b>100</b> to help promote concentric alignment relative to the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b>. However, because the interface module <b>32</b> can be configured in different ways, such as where the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> is not supported within the input drum <b>34</b> as noted above, it will be appreciated that concentric alignment can be achieved differently without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first and second ramp arrangements <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> cooperate with the overload clutch <b>40</b> in order to facilitate operation of the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b>. When opposing forces acting between the input and the output of the powertrain <b>22</b> overcome the predetermined torque differential, such as via a torque spike resulting from shifting the multispeed transmission <b>28</b>, the shape and arrangement of the input lobe <b>66</b> and the output lobe <b>68</b> cause the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b> to rotate relative to the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> and translate axially. Kinetic energy from the torque spike is absorbed by the damper preload member <b>64</b> due to the axial translation of the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b>. This dampens the torque spike occurring between the electric machine <b>26</b> and the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> without interrupting torque translation. Energy absorbed by the damper preload member <b>64</b> is dissipated in two forms. Force from the damper preload member <b>64</b> urges the first and second ramp arrangements <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> back into equilibrium, where torque is returned to the output shaft <b>36</b> at a lower rate. If excess energy above a predetermined level is absorbed by the damper preload member <b>64</b>, the torque will exceed the capacity of the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> and cause the outer clutch plates <b>76</b> to slip relative to the inner clutch plates <b>74</b>. When the outer clutch plates <b>76</b> slip, the input-side damper body <b>56</b> briefly accelerates allowing the first ramp arrangement <b>58</b> to return to equilibrium with the second ramp arrangement <b>62</b>. In this way, excess energy from torque spikes is dissipated as heat generated by friction between the inner and outer clutch plates <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. Thus, the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> dampens differential torque occurring between the electric machine <b>26</b> and the multispeed transmission <b>28</b>, and the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> limits the maximum amount of torque that can be translated between the electric machine <b>26</b> and the wheel <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this way, the torsional damper assembly <b>38</b> and the overload clutch assembly <b>40</b> of the interface module <b>32</b> of the present invention afford significant advantages for powertrains <b>22</b> that employ multispeed transmissions <b>28</b>, in particular when used in connection with electric machines <b>26</b> that operate at relatively high rotational velocities and/or when used in connection with relatively heavy commercial or industrial vehicles <b>20</b> where significant amounts of torque are involved in achieving application-specific vehicle <b>20</b> acceleration and propulsion requirements. Specifically, it will be appreciated that the interface module <b>32</b> of the present invention allows the electric machine <b>26</b> to smoothly match speed as the multispeed transmission <b>28</b> shifts between gears in an efficient, predictable, and reliable manner without necessitating the use of expensive components, complex control systems, and/or structural features that are unreliable when used in connection with high-torque and high-speed applications.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation.
