Examples of such agents include gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine, Rohypnol, and the like. For example, the agents may be secretly placed in the beverage, such as an alcoholic beverage, of the intended consumer. Because these and similar agents are colorless, substantially odorless, and hard to detect, methods and devices are needed to detect the presence of such agents prior to consumption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although there are various techniques for detecting the presence of a chemical substance in a subject after the subject has consumed such an agent (e.g., by urinalysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), such techniques are reactive in nature and merely confirm what may already be suspected, rather than proactive to detect the agent before it has been consumed. Furthermore, such techniques require expensive equipment run by highly trained technicians. Proactive testing devices may require exposing a portion of the liquid to be tested to a chemical reagent composition, which may result in a color change that indicates the presence of the agent in the liquid sample. Unfortunately, such tests are time consuming and may not be discrete.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional testing apparatus are available. For example, a subject may use drug testing strips that are hidden in or incorporated into, for example, a match, a match book, a cocktail napkin, a coaster, a placemat, a menu, and so forth. Although such techniques may appear more discreet, the subject may nevertheless be placed in an awkward position by having to perform the test. Moreover, the subject may have to carry out tests periodically over the course of a social encounter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 9,285,352 describes an apparatus for testing a liquid using a straw, a stirrer, and/or a beverage container, where an indicator adapted to provide a visible reaction, e.g., a color change, upon exposure to an agent of interest may be adhered or otherwise bonded to a portion of the straw, stirrer, and/or beverage container. In particular, the indicator may cause the straw, stirrer, and/or beverage container, or the liquid contacting the straw, stirrer, and/or beverage container, to change color and/or fluoresce when an agent of interest is detected at or above a certain concentration.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite the advances made to date, there still exists a need for improved devices (e.g., colorimetric sensors) and methods for detecting chemical substances of interest in a liquid sample.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is based, in part, upon the discovery of a new colorimetric sensor that can detect an analyte of interest in a fluid or liquid sample and that, in some implementations, may be disposed upon or integrated within a surface of a fluid receptacle (e.g., a glass or a cup) or a straw.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the colorimetric sensor includes a lamellar photonic material (e.g., a photonic gel or a photonic crystal) having alternating layers of a first polymer layer (e.g., a binding or receptor-containing polymer) and a second polymer layer (e.g., polystyrene). Each first polymer layer may be a molecularly imprinted polymer defining a cavity shaped to receive an analyte of interest. The photonic material may be configured such that, when an analyte contacts the photonic material and becomes disposed within a cavity of the molecularly imprinted polymer (i.e., the first polymer layer), a refractive property of the photonic material changes, causing a detectable color change in the sensor. The first polymer layer that is molecularly imprinted may contain a chromophore-containing polymer such as poly(urea-naphthalimide), poly(thiourea-naphthalimide), poly(styrene-urea-naphthalimide) or poly(styrene-thiourea-naphthalimide).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain applications, each first polymer layer is adapted such that, when the cavity receives the analyte of interest, the first polymer layer changes volume relative to a second polymer layer, thereby changing the refractive property of the photonic material. In some implementations, each first polymer layer further includes a chromophore indicator (e.g., a naphthalimide moiety) such that, when the cavity receives the analyte of interest, the analyte causes an electronically induced color change of the chromophore indicator that amplifies the color change in the sensor. In some variations, the chromophore indicator is incorporated into the first polymer layer as a co-polymer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, the alternating layers of the first and second polymer layers have a periodic distribution. In the absence of the analyte of interest, the periodic distribution may be from about 1 nm to about 1000 nm, or from about 100 nm to about 950 nm, or from about 200 nm to about 900 nm, or from about 300 nm to about 850 nm, or from about 400 nm to about 800 nm. In some embodiments, the periodic distribution in the presence of the analyte may be different from the periodic distribution in the absence of the analyte.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a second aspect, the invention provides a method for detecting an analyte of interest in a fluid sample, which includes contacting a colorimetric sensor of the invention with a fluid sample to be interrogated and detecting whether a color change occurs when the sensor is contacted with the fluid sample. A color change being indicative that the analyte is present in the fluid sample. In certain embodiments, the colorimetric sensor includes a lamellar photonic material (e.g., a photonic gel or a photonic crystal) having alternating layers of a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer as described herein. Advantageously, in some implementations, the photonic material is configured so that, when an analyte contacts the photonic material and becomes disposed within a cavity of the molecularly imprinted polymer, a refractive property of the photonic material changes, causing a detectable color change in the sensor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, each first polymer layer is adapted such that, when the cavity receives the analyte of interest, the first polymer layer changes volume relative to a second polymer layer, thereby changing the refractive property of the photonic material. In certain embodiments, each first polymer layer further includes a chromophore indicator (e.g., a naphthalimide-containing moiety) such that, when the cavity receives the analyte of interest, the analyte causes an electronically induced color change of the chromophore indicator that amplifies the color change in the sensor. In some variations, the chromophore indicator is incorporated into the first polymer layer as a co-polymer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the alternating layers of the first and second polymer layers have a periodic distribution. In the absence of the analyte of interest, the periodic distribution may be from about 1 nm to about 1000 nm, or from about 100 nm to about 950 nm, or from about 200 nm to about 900 nm, or from about 300 nm to about 850 nm, or from about 400 nm to about 800 nm. In some implementations, the periodic distribution in the presence of the analyte may be different from the periodic distribution in the absence of the analyte.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, the invention provides a method of manufacturing a colorimetric sensor capable of detecting an analyte of interest in a fluid sample. In some embodiments, the method includes creating a first set of spaced apart layers of a first polymer. Each layer of the first set of spaced apart layers of the first polymer can be a molecularly imprinted polymer that defines a cavity shaped to receive an analyte of interest. The method may also include imprinting (e.g., using a stamp and/or a mold) the first set of layers into a coating that is or includes a second polymer (e.g., polystyrene), thereby creating a photonic material having alternating layers of first and second polymers configured such that, when an analyte contacts the photonic material and becomes disposed within a cavity of the molecularly imprinted polymer, a refractive property of the photonic material changes thereby to cause a detectable color change in the sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the coating that is or includes the second polymer is disposed upon the surface of a substrate, e.g., a fluid receptacle (e.g., a cup, a glass, or the like) or a straw. In certain embodiments, the first set of spaced apart layers is disposed upon a release medium with anti-adhesive properties, e.g., a hydrophobic monolayer molecular coating such as a fluorinated self-assembled monolayer, a fluorinated diamond-like carbon coating, or the like.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the drawings, like reference characters generally refer to the same parts throughout the different views.

Such change(s) may induce at least two exemplary observable colorimetric effects. First, a reflecting color change may occur due to a local refractive index change, for example, due to the presence of an analyte in a cavity of a first polymer (e.g., an MIP) and/or due to swelling of a first polymer layer due to the presence of the analyte in a cavity. More particularly, reflectivity may be selectively tuned to a desired wavelength(s) (e.g., within the visible spectrum and/or near infrared) by selectively modulating the optical thickness of a discrete layer of a polymeric phase due to swelling caused by binding of one or more specific analyte target molecules to the polymeric phase, which may change the photonic band gap and the reflected color. Second, a coordination complex of a specific analyte target molecule with a chromophore indicator (for example, incorporated into a polymer) may also result in a color change due to, for example, the intrinsic change of electronic state. Consequently, in some implementations, due to the second effect, the color change may be &#x201c;amplified&#x201d; so that an enhanced color contrast is seen upon the binding of one or more specific analyte target molecules to the chromophore of the polymeric phase. In some implementations, the color contrast may be increased or decreased as desired by tuning the interplay of the two colorimetric sensing mechanisms.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Device with Selectively Tunable Reflectivity</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments, a colorimetric sensor of the invention is employed to detect an analyte of interest in a fluid sample. The sensor may include a lamellar photonic material having alternating layers of a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer. Each first polymer layer may be a molecularly imprinted polymer that defines a cavity shaped to receive an analyte of interest. The photonic material may be configured such that, when an analyte contacts the photonic material and becomes disposed within a cavity of the molecularly imprinted polymer, a refractive property of the photonic material changes, causing a detectable color change in the sensor. In various embodiments, the sensor (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>) functions in a similar fashion to a Bragg reflector (or &#x201c;Bragg mirror&#x201d;). In other embodiments, the sensor (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>) functions in a similar fashion to a diffraction grating.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Bragg diffraction, which results from the constructive interference of reflected light, occurs when reflected light passing through multiple layers of alternating materials remains in phase owing to the periodic distribution or periodicity of the spacing between the layering. For example, if the periodic distribution of the alternating layers is maintained at an integer multiple of the desired reflected wavelength (&#x3bb;), then a device with a band gap that selectively reflects light of a particular wavelength can be formed. For example, within the visible spectrum, blue light has a wavelength of about 450-495 nm, and red light has a wavelength of about 620-750 nm. Thus, a device with a periodic distribution of about 450-495 nm reflects blue light, whereas a device with a periodic distribution of about 620-750 nm reflects red light.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As is known in the art, the periodic modulation of differing dielectric properties (e.g., refractive indices) between plural (e.g., two) alternating layers of materials may also be used to create photonic crystals to form a band gap to selectively reflect light of a particular wavelength. Periodic modulation may occur in one-dimensional (e.g., lamellar) structures, two-dimensional structures, or three-dimensional structures. For example, a lamellar distributed Bragg reflector (or Bragg mirror) may include a stack of film layers having alternating high refractive index (n<sub>1</sub>) and low refractive index (n<sub>2</sub>) materials, in which each film layer may have a thickness of a quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4). As light passes from a lower refractive index layer into a higher refractive index material, the light reflected at the surface of the higher refractive index material undergoes a 180-degree phase shift; however, as light passes from a higher refractive index layer into a lower refractive index material, the reflected light at the surface of the lower refractive index material interferes constructively, increasing the intensity of the reflected light.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">An illustrative embodiment of a colorimetric chemical sensor with enhanced color sensitivity, which functions in a similar fashion to a Bragg reflector or Bragg mirror, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. Advantageously, a sensor may be optically tuned to a selected wavelength (e.g., 450-495 nm) associated with a desired visible color (e.g., blue light) as a function of the reflectivity (or periodicity) of the lamellar photonic material making up the sensor and, more specifically, may enable users to selectively modulate the optical thickness of discrete sensor layers, e.g., via swelling (e.g., to about 620-750 nm) due to adherence or adsorption of an analyte target molecule(s) to the sensor. The adherence or adsorption and/or a swelling effect can change the photonic bandgap as well as the reflected color (e.g., to red light) that may be seen by the user.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows, for example, a sensor <b>100</b> in an original state that, due to the thicknesses of the first polymer layer <b>101</b> and the second polymer layer <b>102</b> and/or the refractive indices (n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>) of each of the polymer layers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, may appear as a first color at a shorter wavelength of the visible spectrum (e.g., blue). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a volume and/or layer thickness change in the first polymer layer <b>101</b>&#x2032; due to swelling may modify the photonic band gap and the reflecting color of the material, which provides indicia of the presence of the analyte target molecule(s). In some implementations, the change in refractive index, for example, due to swelling, may appear or manifest as an optimized color toward the longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum (e.g., red).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some variations, the sensors of the invention are one-dimensional photonic crystals. In general, there are two kinds of one-dimensional photonic crystal structures, each of which features a lamellar photonic material having alternating layers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> of (e.g., two or more) discrete polymeric phases. In a first embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the alternating layers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are stacked on top of each other along the z-axis and upon a substrate <b>103</b>, such that only a single bottom layer <b>102</b> makes direct contact with substrate <b>103</b>. In this embodiment, the sensor <b>100</b> functions in a manner similar to a Bragg reflector or Bragg mirror, as described above. In contrast, in a second embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, the alternating layers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are disposed next to each other along the x-axis and upon the substrate <b>103</b>, such that each alternating layer <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> makes direct contact with substrate <b>103</b>. In this embodiment, the sensor <b>100</b> functions in a similar fashion to a diffraction grating. As described further below, the substrate <b>103</b> can be adhered, or otherwise attached to, a surface of interest, for example, the surface of a cup or a straw.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, sensor <b>100</b> includes a series of repeating layers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> that vary periodically in one dimension with two different refractive indices (n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>). In general, light incident on the grating surface is scattered into several &#x201c;orders&#x201d; of both transmitted and reflected waves. The diffraction orders exist at varying angles to the grating surface and are numbered such that the order which is equivalent to the reflected and transmitted wave from a smooth surface is the 0<sup>th </sup>order, each subsequent order of a smaller or larger angle is given &#x2212;1 and +1 numbers, respectively, and the order of each successive angle decrease or increase is respectively decremented (e.g., &#x2212;2, &#x2212;3, etc.) or incremented (e.g., +2, +3, etc.) appropriately.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Initially, in the absence of analyte target molecule(s) and at a given angle of observation, the diffraction grating reflects a selected wavelength (e.g., 450-495 nm) associated with a first visible color (e.g., blue light). When, however, the physical geometry of the diffraction grating is manipulated, e.g., via swelling of the polymer layer <b>101</b> in a vertical direction along the z-axis due to the adherence, binding or absorption of an analyte target molecule(s), the diffraction grating will, at the same given angle of observation, reflect a second, different wavelength (e.g., 620-750 nm) of the incident light, which leads to an observable color change in the sensor <b>100</b> (e.g., from blue to red).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The color reflected by a diffraction grating also depends, however, on the angle at which a user observes the diffraction grating. Because of this, sensor <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> is, in one embodiment, employed in connection with a reference. The reference (not shown) may be the same as (e.g., identical to) the depicted sensor <b>100</b> and may be placed on the same plane as the depicted sensor <b>100</b> so that, in operation, the angle of observation is the same for both the depicted sensor <b>100</b> and the reference. The reference, however, may be covered with a transparent material, such as a plastic or glass, that is impervious to, and thus prevents the introduction of analyte into the reference. In this way, both the depicted sensor <b>100</b> and the reference reflect, in the absence of analyte, the same wavelength of the incident light and appear to be the same color, regardless of the angle at which a user observes the depicted sensor <b>100</b> and its reference. In the presence of analyte, however, the depicted sensor <b>100</b> and the reference appear as different colors, as the analytes will only have been adhered to, bound or absorbed by the depicted sensor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the sensors described herein are thin films. For example, in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D</figref>, the thickness of the thin film along the z-axis may be on the micron scale (e.g., about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m, about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m, about 100 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m, about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 10 &#x3bc;m), while the lateral dimensions of the thin film along the x- and y-axes may on the centimeter scale (e.g., about 1 cm to about 1000 cm, about 10 cm to about 1000 cm, about 100 cm to about 1000 cm, about 1 cm to about 100 cm, about 1 cm to about 10 cm).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For the purpose of illustration and not limitation, illustrative embodiments of the invention are described for a sensor that functions in a similar fashion to a Bragg reflector or Bragg mirror and that, upon detecting an analyte of interest, transitions from reflecting an initial, blue light (&#x3bb;=450-495 nm) to reflecting a red light (&#x3bb;=620-750 nm) to provide an indication of the presence of the analyte of interest detectable by the unaided eye. Those of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that sensors of the invention may use transitions from any spectral color having a first wavelength to another spectral color having a second, different wavelength.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Preferably, the first polymer layer and second polymer layer have a periodic distribution within the device such that, in a first state (i.e., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), a distance or height from the top of one first polymer layer to the top of any other first polymer layer is an integer multiple of the wavelength of the desired reflected color (e.g., 450p to 495p nm, where p is an integer). For example, the desired wavelength can be selected from wavelengths between about 1 nm to about 1000 nm, between about 100 nm to about 950 nm, between about 200 nm to about 900 nm, between about 300 nm to about 850 nm, and between about 400 nm to about 800 nm, which latter range covers the visible light spectrum. For exemplary embodiments using an initial, blue light, a periodic distribution between about 450 nm and about 495 nm may be appropriate.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments, the first polymer layer is a hydrophilic polymer. A block co-polymer of a first polymer layer that is hydrophilic and a second polymer layer that is hydrophobic permits the first polymer domains and the second polymer domains to self-assemble into a structure (photonic material or sensor) having alternating first and second polymer layers as described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first polymer layer can include a chemical moiety (e.g., a &#x201c;receptor&#x201d; or &#x201c;binding site&#x201d;) that can form a complex (e.g., host-guest chemistry) with an analyte target molecule of interest via a non-covalent bond, for example, via hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, &#x3c0;-&#x3c0; interactions, halogen bonding, and/or electrostatic and/or electromagnetic effects. The use of such a receptor can facilitate positioning of the analyte during creation a molecularly imprinted first polymer layer. Such a receptor can facilitate an analyte positioning itself in a cavity of the molecularly imprinted first polymer layer during use. Examples of such chemical moieties (receptors) include urea, thiourea, guanidine, aminopyridine, or amidine, cucurbituril, cyclodextrin, calixarene, crown ether, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and the like.

MIPs are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,241,575 and 9,285,352, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, a first polymer layer that is or includes a MIP may be formed by any molecular imprinting technique (e.g., a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization method, an atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method, a covalent bonding method, a self-assembly method, a hierarchical imprinting method, a polymerization packed bed method, or the like) that can leave a cavity in the first polymer layer, which cavity has an affinity to a chosen &#x201c;analyte&#x201d; molecule. In certain approaches, the process may involve initiating the polymerization of monomers in the presence of an analyte of interest that is then extracted leaving behind a cavity that is complementary in three-dimensional shape to, or a mirror image of, the three-dimensional surface of at least a portion of the analyte.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the first polymer layer can include a monomer and a crosslinker, for example, a polymerizable monomer optionally with a receptor that can bind with an analyte molecule, such as urea or thiourea receptors, and a cross-linkable monomer that contains two or more reactive groups such a one vinyl moiety and one allylic moiety. Each of the two or more reactive groups should have different reactivities such that they can be employed in different stages of the manufacture of the first polymer layer. For example, a vinyl group can be employed for incorporation into a pre-polymer for the first polymer layer while the less reactive allylic functional group can be used as a crosslinker during the molecularly imprinting process. Other asymmetrically divinyl or vinyl/allyl or other monomer with two double bonds of different reactivity can be used, for example, methacrylate-based divinyl monomers such as hex-5-enyl methacrylate.

The chromophores include molecules that can form a complex with an analyte to induce a photo-induced electron transfer. For example, the first polymer layer can include a naphthalimide-containing molecularly imprinted polymer, for example, naphthalimide-based chromogenic molecules and/or their derivatives such as a 1,8-naphthalimide-containing polymer having a urea or thiourea moiety present (e.g., poly(urea-naphthalimide) or poly(thiourea-naphthalimide)). A chromophore can be used to enhance the color appearance and contrast. When a carboxylate ion is present, it forms a complex with urea or thiourea. The complex formation can change the electron density of the naphthalimide moiety leading to an optical absorption change. A suitable Bragg resonance can enhance such an optical change with a better saturation of the hue. For example, the color may be enhanced from a dull red to a very bright red so that a human observer can easily identify a color change, especially under diffuse illumination or low light conditions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In various embodiments, a naphthalimide-based fluorescence indicator monomer can be integrated into the first polymer layer. The monomer can contain a urea binding site to respond to carboxylate-containing analytes that result in absorption and fluorescence change. Specific substitutions on the naphthalimide core may provide a binding partner for a carboxylate group present on an analyte of interest such as NaGHB. Furthermore, the naphthalimide can be functionalized with an alkene group so that it can be incorporated into a MIP. The binding of analyte can change the electron density in the naphthalimide aromatic ring and cause a change in the optical absorption properties. By combining the optical absorber (such as but not limiting to a chromophore) with structural color, the saturation of the color can be tuned so that it is more easily distinguished by the unaided eye.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Examples of chromophores can include xanthene derivatives: fluorescein, rhodamine, Oregon green, eosin, and Texas red; cyanine derivatives: cyanine, indocarbocyanine, oxacarbocyanine, thiacarbocyanine, and merocyanine; squaraine derivatives and ring-substituted squaraines, including Seta, SeTau, and Square dyes; naphthalene derivatives (including dansyl and prodan derivatives); coumarin derivatives; oxadiazole derivatives: pyridyloxazole, nitrobenzoxadiazole and benzoxadiazole; anthracene derivatives: anthraquinones, including DRAQ5, DRAQ7 and CyTRAK Orange; pyrene derivatives: cascade blue and the like; oxazine derivatives: Nile red, Nile blue, cresyl violet, and oxazine 170; acridine derivatives: proflavin, acridine orange, and acridine yellow; arylmethine derivatives: auramine, crystal violet, malachite green; tetrapyrrole derivatives: porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bilirubin; and BODIPY dyes.

Then a small amount of co-polymer solution can be spin-cast onto a suitable substrate such as glass or glass-like substrates. The glass can have a surface treatment appropriate for the intended use, for example, a surface treated either with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane or with (3-iodopropyl)trimethoxysilane, or a surface treated with a thin metallic film coating. The thickness of the metal film can be in the range of about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m. One-dimensional lamellar structures can be formed via thermal annealing at low temperature (such as 50&#xb0; C. for 24 hours) in a suitable vapor such as chloroform.

(2007), 6: 957-960.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">Those of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that each first polymer layer in a sensor of the invention may include any number of cavities appropriate to achieve the intended purpose. The number of cavities in a first polymer layer is, in part, determined by the dissociation constant of the material used for the first polymer layer. As different materials will have different dissociation constants, the number of cavities present in a first polymer layer will depend upon the type of material employed as the first polymer layer. In general, however, the average density of the cavities in a first polymer layer will be very high (e.g., up to 10<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>15 </sup>or 10<sup>20 </sup>cavities per gram of first polymer). There may also be some variation in the number, density, and arrangement (e.g., distribution or pattern) of the cavities in the various first polymer layers, so long as each first polymer layer captures substantially the same number of analytes of interest and swells by substantially the same amount so as to create a color contrast with the sensor's original state in the absence of the analytes of interest.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">Each formed cavity in the first polymer layer should have an affinity for a corresponding analyte of interest, which may include, for the purpose of illustration and not limitation, GBL, GHB, ketamine, Rohypnol, other pharmaceutical grade drugs, bacteria, allergens and proteins, 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol, substances that may be created during a process of creating 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol, substances that may be created when beer is exposed to sunlight, congeners (e.g., produced during fermentation and/or distillation of a beverage), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">In some embodiments, the second polymer layer is a hydrophobic polymer. A block co-polymer of a second polymer layer that is hydrophobic and a first polymer layer that is hydrophilic permits the first polymer domains and the second polymer domains to self-assemble into a structure (photonic material or sensor) having alternating first and second polymer layers as described herein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">The second polymer layer may be a polymer of the type that may be incorporated into, e.g., plastic cups, bottles (or other food/beverage/liquid containers), stirrers, straws, utensils, gloves, contraception devices, feminine hygiene products, and so forth. For example, materials for the second polymer layer may include polystyrene, substituted polystyrene, modified polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), and poly(vinylpyridine). A desired characteristic of material for a second polymer layer is that it does not change volume (e.g., swell) in the presence of the analyte of interest and/or the solvent/beverage being tested, or does not change volume in the presence of the analyte and/or the solvent/beverage being tested as much as the first polymer layer.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">The second polymer layer may have a certain porosity that allows liquid to permeate through it to permit access to the internally-located surfaces including cavities and receptors, if present, of the first polymer layers in a self-assembled structure. The thickness of a thin film of such a structure is on the order of microns, such that a liquid should be able to diffuse through the alternating first and second polymer layers and/or to move via capillary action into the internal area of the alternating layers of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0074">In various embodiments of the invention, the affinity of a cavity for its corresponding analyte of interest causes a selective volume change in the first polymer layer when the analyte of interest adheres to, binds or is adsorbed or is disposed in a cavity of the MIP. For example, in the sensors depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, the volume change typically results in a corresponding increase in height in the first polymer layer and in the periodic distribution between first and second polymer layers, which results in a visible change in color. For example, if the sensor initially has a periodic distribution of about 450-495 nm to reflect blue light, but a volume change causes the periodic distribution to be about 620-750 nm, then red light would be reflected and visible instead of blue light. Volume and height increases can be referred to as the &#x201c;swelling&#x201d; of the first polymer layer. In the self-assembly process, the amount of volume and/or height increase(s) of the first polymer layer can be controlled by adjusting the size distribution of the block co-polymer, for example, using the RAFT polymerization technique.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0075">In certain embodiments, in addition to selectively tuning a sensor via swelling, the polymeric phases of the alternating layers of polymeric materials may be designed to affect particular wave propagation modes. For example, the polymeric materials of the polymer layers may be chosen so that, in the presence of a target analyte of interest, a periodic change of refractive index (n<sub>i</sub>) in the various photonic materials occurs. Indeed, in some applications of the present invention, the mere presence of an analyte in a cavity in the first polymer layer can lead to a change in the refractive index (n<sub>1</sub>) of the first polymer layers. Advantageously, such a change may result in a reflection of light of a selectively different wavelength.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">In particular, whereas a swelling effect can enable users to optically tune a sensor using changes in the thickness or shape of the polymer layers within a sensor, molecular binding or disposition of an analyte in a cavity of the first polymer layer can enable users to optically tune the sensor using molecular changes affecting, for example, the index of refraction of the polymeric phase. More specifically, molecular binding may change the average refractive index according to the effective medium theory. For example, if n<sub>1 </sub>is the refractive index of the polymeric material in the first polymer layers and n<sub>0 </sub>is the refractive index of the air in the cavities in the absence of the analytes, then the average refractive index of the first polymer layers in the absence of the analytes depends upon the values of both n<sub>1 </sub>and n<sub>0</sub>. Once analytes having a refractive index of n<sub>2</sub>, are received by the cavities, the average refractive index of the first polymer layers changes to instead depend upon the values of both n<sub>1 </sub>and n<sub>2</sub>. This change in the average refractive index of the first polymer layers causes a change in the color of the light reflected from the sensor.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary MIP <b>225</b> with a chromophore indicator incorporated into a polymeric phase of a first polymer layer <b>101</b> is depicted. As previously described, in some implementations, a cavity(ies) <b>220</b> may be formed in a MIP <b>225</b>, e.g., after the analyte molecule template is removed. Once a fluid containing an analyte of interest <b>300</b> is introduced to the first polymer layer <b>101</b> and MIP <b>225</b>, the presence of and re-binding of any target analyte <b>300</b> in any of the cavities <b>220</b> of the MIP <b>225</b> may transform the first polymer layer <b>101</b> into a hybrid layer <b>310</b> having, for example, modified chemico-electric properties.

In some implementations, a co-polymer may be synthesized as described herein to facilitate the microphase separation for self-assembly. For example, a second polymer layer <b>102</b> can include polystyrene <b>402</b>, formed from styrene monomers <b>406</b>. A first polymer layer <b>101</b> may be formed, with a chromophore indicator as a co-polymer, for example, poly(urea-naphthalimide-styrene) (PUNS) polymer <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an exemplary polymerization synthesis route to form a self-assembled photonic material is depicted. The first and second layers are self-assembled into a one-dimensional structure rather than a three-dimensional cube. The self-assembly is accomplished due to the hydrophilic nature of the first polymer layer and the hydrophobic nature of the second polymer layer. For example, the block co-polymer in suitable solvent (e.g., propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA)) can be spin-coated onto a suitable substrate such as glass.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">In some implementations, as depicted, a block co-polymer of, e.g., polystyrene (first polymer layer) and poly(urea-naphthalimide-styrene) (second polymer layer) may be synthesized via, e.g., reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Subsequent to the formation of the block co-polymer, it can self-assemble into the photonic material. Other polymerization methods, including but not limit to, atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), may be used to control the molecular weight and distribution, as can RAFT polymerization.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">Such a structure can also be produced by layer-by-layer assembly, for example, via spin-coating or dip-coating of each of the respective layers to form the alternating first polymer and second polymer layers. For example, the first polymer layer can be made from a pre-polymer without styrene blocks. The second polymer layer can be liquid polystyrene. Each of these polymers can be dissolved in appropriate solvent (e.g., water, ethanol, and/or propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate) in suitable concentrations. Each of the polymers in the solvents then can be alternatingly spin-coated or dip-coated on to a selected substrate to form the final structure. Finally, the photonic material or sensor can be removed from the substrate, for example, by peeling, if the substrate is not the intended end use product.
