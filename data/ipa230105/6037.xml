The drawings form a part of the description and for the purpose of illustration show examples of how the invention may be used and implemented. It is to be understood that the features of the various embodiments described herein may be combined with each other, unless specifically noted otherwise.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a sectional view of one section of a superjunction device. The superjunction device includes a semiconductor body <b>100</b> and a drift region <b>2</b> arranged in the semiconductor body <b>100</b>. The drift region <b>2</b> includes a plurality of first regions <b>4</b> of a first doping type (conductivity type) and a plurality of second regions <b>5</b> of a second doping type (conductivity type) complementary to the first doping type. The first regions <b>4</b> and the second regions <b>5</b> are arranged alternately in the semiconductor body <b>100</b>, and a pn-junction is formed between each first region <b>4</b> and a corresponding adjoining second region <b>5</b>. Just for the purpose of illustration, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first regions <b>4</b> and the second regions <b>5</b> are arranged alternately in a first lateral direction x of the semiconductor body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The semiconductor body <b>100</b> may include a conventional semiconductor material. According to one example, the semiconductor body <b>100</b> is based on silicon carbide (SiC). According to another example, the semiconductor body <b>100</b> is based on silicon (Si). In this context, &#x201c;based on a material&#x201d; may mean that the semiconductor body <b>100</b> comprises or essentially consists of said semiconductor material, except for unwanted impurities or intentional doping.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first and second regions <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> may be elongated in a second lateral direction y of the semiconductor body <b>100</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> that shows a horizontal cross sectional view of the semiconductor body <b>100</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a horizontal section plane A-A. The &#x201c;horizontal section plane A-A&#x201d; is a section plane that is perpendicular to the vertical section plane shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The second lateral direction y is essentially perpendicular to the first lateral direction x, according to one example. The first and second regions <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> being &#x201c;elongated&#x201d; means that a length of the first and second regions <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, which is a dimension in the second lateral direction y, is significantly greater than a respective width, which is a dimension in the first lateral direction. In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the width w<b>4</b>, w<b>5</b> is the dimension in the first lateral direction x and the &#x201c;length&#x201d; is the dimension in the second lateral direction y of the semiconductor body <b>100</b>. According to one example, &#x201c;significantly greater&#x201d; means that a ratio between the length and the width is greater than 10, greater than 100, or even greater than 1000.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first regions <b>4</b> are connected to a first load node <b>71</b> of the superjunction device, and the second regions <b>5</b> are connected to a second load node <b>72</b> of the transistor device. A connection between the second regions <b>5</b> and the second load node <b>72</b> is only schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Examples of how these connections can be implemented are explained with reference to examples herein further below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one example, the first regions <b>4</b> are connected to the first load node <b>71</b> via a further semiconductor region <b>11</b> of the first doping type.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The further semiconductor region <b>11</b> may adjoin the first regions <b>4</b>. This, however, is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a buffer region <b>12</b> of the first doping type is arranged between the further semiconductor region <b>11</b> and the first regions <b>4</b>. According to one example, a doping concentration of the buffer region <b>12</b> is lower than a doping concentration of the further semiconductor region <b>11</b>. According to one example, the doping concentration of the buffer region <b>12</b> is lower than the doping concentration of the further semiconductor region <b>11</b> and may be less than 20%, less than 10% or even less than 1% of the doping concentration of the further semiconductor region <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the superjunction device further includes a head structure <b>3</b> connected between the second load node <b>72</b> and the first regions <b>4</b>. The head structure <b>3</b> may at least partially be integrated in the semiconductor body <b>100</b>. Examples of how the head structure <b>3</b> may be implemented are explained with reference to examples herein further below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Basically, the head structure <b>3</b>, defines an operating state of the superjunction device, wherein the operating state may include a conducting state or a blocking state. In the conducting state, the superjunction device is configured to conduct a current via the first regions <b>4</b> between the first load node <b>71</b> and the second load node <b>72</b> when a voltage is applied between the first load node <b>71</b> and the second load node <b>72</b>. In the blocking state, the superjunction device is configured to block when a voltage is applied between the first load node <b>71</b> and the second load node <b>72</b>, provided that the voltage is lower than a voltage blocking capability of the superjunction device. The &#x201c;voltage blocking capability&#x201d; is the maximum voltage the superjunction device can withstand in the blocking state before an Avalanche breakdown occurs.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The implementation of the head structure <b>3</b> is dependent on the type of the superjunction device. The superjunction device may be implemented as a passive device, such as a Schottky diode. In this case, the operating state of the superjunction device is only dependent on a polarity of a load path voltage V<sub>LP </sub>applied between the first load node <b>71</b> and the second load node <b>72</b>, wherein the superjunction device is in the conducting state when the load path voltage V<sub>PL </sub>has a first polarity and the blocking state when the load path voltage V<sub>PL </sub>has a second polarity opposite the first polarity.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The superjunction device may also be implemented as an active device, such as a transistor device.
