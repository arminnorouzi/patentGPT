SAR sensors that emit the radar signal and detect reflections from the object to be scanned are often space-borne.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior academic and corporate research done in the space of 3D modeling of SAR data from space-borne sensors has related to prediction of two-dimensional signatures that may result from a particular object geometry.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Described herein are techniques for analyzing SAR data resulting from a SAR scan of a scene, which may include one or more 3D objects, in connection with a 3D model of the scene and the 3D object(s) of the scene, to suppress SAR artifacts that may be present in the SAR data from the scan. The 3D model may be derived from electro-optical image data of the scene, a Laser Imaging, Detection, and Ranging (LIDAR) scan of the scene, architectural renderings of the scene (e.g., from Computer-Assisted Drafting (CAD) modeling software or other sources), photogrammetrically derived 3D surface models, and/or other sources. Using the 3D model of the scene at any resolution, a prediction may be generated of how the geometry of the scene may impact SAR signals directed at the scene, including how SAR signals may reflect off of the objects in the scene, such as by generating a time-variant power profile of the scene. This information on predicted reflections of SAR signals at the scene may be used to suppress (e.g., eliminate or reduce) SAR artifacts in the SAR data resulting from the SAR scan of the scene, as well as for machine learning purposes, such as providing training data for classification routines or serving as a basis for a verification step for more detailed automatic object recognition searches.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also described herein are techniques for generating a radio frequency model of a 3D scene, using a combination of SAR data resulting from a scan of the scene and the 3D object(s) of the scene, and a 3D model of the scene and the object(s) of the scene. Such a 3D model of the scene may be derived from electro-optical image data of the scene (such as in a photogrammetric model), a LIDAR scan of the scene, architectural renderings of the scene (e.g., from CAD modeling software or other sources), and/or other sources. SAR data of the scene may be mapped to the 3D model of the scene, including to surfaces and intersections of surfaces (such as on vertex nodes and surface edges) in the 3D model. The complex SAR data (e.g., in-phase and quadrature components of the SAR signal) may then be resampled based on 3D scene mapping to generate one or more two-dimensional (2D) images of the 3D scene incorporating data from the SAR scan and from the 3D model, where each such 2D image represents a view of the 3D scene from a different angle. When multiple 2D images of the 3D scene are generated, the multiple 2D images may be used in a perspective modeling technique to generate a photo-realistic 3D model of the scene that has been derived from the SAR data and the input 3D model.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further described herein are techniques for performing feature identification and/or extraction from SAR data of a 3D scene, including of a scene having multiple 3D objects in close proximity. Such a 3D scene may be, for example, a suburban or urban area, or other area that includes 3D objects in proximity to one another such that one object may occlude another when viewed from an angle other than a nadir. Such objects in proximity to one another may include human structures, such as commercial and/or residential buildings, roadway structures (e.g., bridges, streetlights, utility poles, etc.), and other structures. The feature extraction technique may include generating a 3D model of the scene, such as a photo-realistic 3D model of the scene, from SAR data resulting from a SAR scan of the scene and an input 3D model of the scene. The input 3D model of the scene may be derived from electro-optical image data of the scene (such as in a photogrammetric model), a LIDAR scan of the scene, architectural renderings of the scene (e.g., from CAD modeling software or other sources), and/or other sources. Once the SAR mapped 3D model of the scene is derived from the SAR data and the input 3D model, feature extraction may be performed on the output 3D model of the scene. Such feature extraction may include identifying one or more objects depicted in the output 3D model, counting one or more objects depicted in the output 3D model, identifying one or more differences over time in the output 3D model over the course of a time of a SAR scan of the scene or between different SAR scans of the scene, or other forms of feature extraction.

Such an elevational model may be a 2D model lacking depth information, or may be a limited 3D model that provides only topology information associated with a scene. This topology information may include only a single depth or height coordinate (or a z-axis coordinate) at each position in the scene. Such &#x201c;bare-earth&#x201d; elevation models can include digital elevation models (such as SR&#x2122; (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) and WorldDEM&#x2122;) that are used to transform the SAR electro-magnetic data into a final product that resembles standard electro-optical imagery captured from directly overhead through a process called ortho-rectification. Ortho-rectified complex pixel products that leverage these &#x201c;bare earth&#x201d; elevation models are currently available from various space-borne SAR vendors.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The inventors have recognized and appreciated that such a mapping presents challenges for change detection and feature extraction for scenes that include 3D structures, including areas that include natural or human structures, such as scenes of suburban or urban areas. Such 3D structures may include, for example, vertical structures such as buildings in urban areas. While the &#x201c;bare earth&#x201d; elevation models can be used for modeling image-to-image changes on relatively flat surfaces with few vertical or 3D structures in close proximity, they are limited in performing change detection for vertical structures (e.g., analyzing change in and around vertical structures) that are not included in these models. Performing change detection of such vertical structures can be challenging because the same structure can create a different signature depending upon the angle at which it is imaged (e.g., due to various SAR artifacts described in detail below). When the vertical structure presents a different signature depending on angle, this can trigger a false positive for a change detection or feature classification process.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Certain change detection processes can be known for having an excess number of false positive detections, primarily due to severe differences in backscatter magnitude when viewing a scene from different look geometries. Direct pixel-to-pixel comparisons on their own are unable to distinguish between changes in the actual scene content from change due to differing geometry, resulting in significant and often overwhelming false positive detections. This difficulty extends as well to feature classification and other machine learning and computer vision algorithms. This &#x201c;false change,&#x201d; identified from the flawed data, poses a number of constraints on SAR data collection and subsequent analytics.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, to avoid such changes in the SAR data, SAR data collection from a radar sensor may be performed when the SAR sensor is in the exact same location during each image collection event. In such a scenario, orbitology constraints of the spaced-based radar sensor can result in undesirably long intervals between image collection events, e.g., between 11 to 28 days.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As another example, due to the presence of such &#x201c;false change&#x201d; risks with vertical structures, SAR data analysis has conventionally been limited to performing change detection in areas without 3D structures, or without 3D structures that extend above ground level. Such conventional uses include performing change detection in undeveloped or rural areas or other areas without vertical structures, or performing change detection in limited scenes that do not include vertical structures, such as parking lots. To analyze a parking lot, for example, areas around a parking lot that include vertical structures, or a border area of the parking lot, may be excluded from analysis, leaving only a central part of the scene that does not include any vertical structures or occlusions or shadows from vertical structures. The inventors have recognized and appreciated that this limitation on use is disadvantageous, as much of collected SAR data may be filtered out and remain unintelligible for purposes of change detection and feature extraction.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The inventors additionally appreciated that vertical structures in a scene conventionally present other challenges to feature extraction and detection. Objects in a scene may reflect SAR signals directed to the scene in a variety of ways, including ways that create artifacts in the SAR data. Such artifacts may include ambiguity signatures, side-lobes, multi-path or layover effects (each discussed in detail below). When such artifacts are present in SAR data resulting from a SAR scan of a scene, the artifacts may appear to be structures or objects in the scene. When a scene includes many objects, such as a scene of an urban or suburban area, it may be difficult for a feature extraction process to differentiate between the artifacts and the objects, limiting the usefulness of the feature extraction process. Moreover, when there are more structures in a scene, particularly human structures, more artifacts may appear in a SAR scan of the scene. These additional artifacts can further reduce the effectiveness and usefulness of feature extraction and change detection. This had additionally led to conventional use of SAR data being limited to analysis of rural areas or other areas without vertical structures.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The inventors have appreciated that it would be advantageous to perform feature extraction and change detection of a scene including vertical, 3D structures using SAR data. The inventors additionally appreciated that a photo-realistic 3D model of a scene, derived from SAR data from a SAR scan of the scene, would be useful for multi-angle change detection for 3D structures, feature extraction for 3D structures, and intuitive scene visualization. The inventors further appreciated that it would be advantageous, in creating such a photo-realistic 3D model, to reduce, suppress, or eliminate SAR artifacts that may arise in complex SAR data (i.e., In-phase (I) and Quadrature-phase (Q) data) due to reflections of SAR signals in the scene. Such an advantageous photo-realistic 3D model may have the look and feel of imagery derived from an electro-optical sensor at nadir or as imaged from any off-nadir viewing location, with reduced SAR artifacts.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The inventors have recognized that complex SAR data can be utilized to build a 3D model of a scene and the 3D model in turn can be used to filter the complex SAR data to eliminate the SAR artifacts. The use of SAR data with digital elevation models and other topographic models described above was limited to simulating how the 3D scene would appear in a native imaging &#x201c;slant&#x201d; plane of a SAR instrument in an ellipsoidal or ortho-rectified raster image. In contrast to this conventional process, described below are embodiments of a method of resampling complex pixels and forming image snapshots of a scene, including embodiments for forming such image snapshots at various viewing perspectives.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some such embodiments, a high resolution face and vertex model, which may be a photogrammetric model, may be derived from Electro-Optical Imaging sensors, a mixture of LIDAR sensors and Electro-Optical sensors, architectural renderings (e.g., created by CAD modeling software such as Trimble SketchUp, Autodesk AutoCAD, or Rhinoceros 3D), or other sources. For example, high resolution electro-optical data such as 25 cm image resolution data may be used to generate a high resolution face and vertex model associated with the scene that is to be or has been scanned with SAR to generate SAR data of the scene. Such a photogrammetric model may include 3D elements corresponding to 3D, vertical objects in the scene, such as 3D, vertical structures like buildings.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As discussed in more detail below, in some embodiments, vertices from the photogrammetric model may be mapped to sub-pixels of the SAR data. For example, the vertices may be mapped to a specific complex sub-pixel location in the native &#x201c;slant&#x201d; plane of a vendor-provided Single Look Complex (SLC) product incorporating SAR data, using the projection models described by vendor-specific metadata in the vendor's SLC format specification. Once the vertex transformations are computed, pixels in a perceived focal image that can be negatively affected by layover, ambiguities, or other artifacts, may be identified by analyzing the scene and subsequently predicting the locations at which artifacts would be perceived to exist. For example, locations of bright radar signatures may be predicted, and the locations of such bright signatures may be mapped to focal locations at which resulting artifacts would be perceived by a SAR sensor.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, artifacts in SAR data resulting from a SAR scan of the scene may be suppressed using predicted time-variant power profiles for each predicted artifact determined from the model of the scene, and based on an expected time-variant power profile of the true perceived location. Once predictable radar artifacts are eliminated or reduced in the original SAR data for a scene, In-phase (I) and Quadrature-phase (Q) SAR data may be resampled to one or more 2D images, such as a geodetic raster image or sub-scene planar image representing a particular face of the 3D model. If multiple images are generated, perspective modeling may then be used to simulate the scene from separate viewing angles to create an improved photo-realistic 3D model of the collection scene from the source radar imagery. This process may also be leveraged to generate a robust training library for use in machine learning applications. The details of the generation of the library of imagery and metadata are described below.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">SAR Artifacts</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, techniques described herein may be used to reduce, suppress, or eliminate SAR artifacts in SAR data. Such SAR artifacts may include, but are not limited to, layover, ambiguity signatures, side-lobes, multi-path and perspective. Examples of each of these artifacts are described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Layover may be caused by the way in which a radar sensor records information in a non-planar 3D environment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a rectangular structure as imaged by a far-field radar antenna, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates imaging of the same structure by a far-field electro-optical telescope. With an electro-optical telescope, every visible element of the rectangle is represented in a unique pixel in the resulting image. A lay person viewing the image would understand the order of points D, A, B, C, in the captured image, given the similarity between the electro-optical imaging plan and the way a lay person would perceive the structure from that perspective. In the data resulting from a radar scan, however, point D is shown in the radar image diagram co-located with image contributions that are located in between B and C, on top of the structure. Because the contents of this radar image are not arranged optically, to be understandable to a lay person (e.g., a typical image scientist or digital signal processing engineer without expertise in SAR-based systems), the contents would need to be translated.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A second artifact that may make SAR exploitation particularly difficult for a lay person is the presence of ambiguous artifacts caused by bright reflections that are recorded by non-rectangularly-shaped transmit and receive antennas. Radar collection systems are configured based on an assumption that an imaged object of interest always produces sufficiently strong returns and that the lower-power beam returns are substantially similar to ambient noise and can be filtered out (e.g., by applying a noise suppression filter). While this assumption is made, those skilled in the art understand that it is a fundamentally false assumption, as bright reflections (e.g., reflections having a higher power, such as above a filtering threshold) from an imaged object may not be filtered. Such unfiltered bright reflections may result in ambiguity artifacts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a diagram depicting the antenna beam and bright scatterer configuration that could cause ambiguity artifacts in a SAR image. The ambiguity shown is that while C is in one particular location in the scene, the reflection from C may translate leftward in the figure (as shown by the arrow) such that the perceived scene, as shown at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, shows a lower-power, false copy of C that overlaps B. In some cases, an object in a scene may be so reflective that a SAR signal may reflect far away from the actual position of the object. The reflection may result from a SAR signal emitted in one sampling interval that, between sampling intervals, travels a far distance and is detected by the SAR sensor during a subsequent sampling interval.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, depending on the time between sampling intervals, such artifacts may appear a certain distance (e.g., a few kilometers) away from the source, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for example. The imaged scene in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a piece of land in the middle of the port of Zhoushan, China, adjacent to water of the port. In the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the water is at the top of the image, with the land shown in much of the image. The scene also includes oil storage tanks on the land. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of ambiguities caused by the cylindrical oil storage tank creating a strong artifact signature off the beam peak in one sampling interval, that appears as an object in the water (see top-right of right-hand image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Many radar ship detection algorithms are tuned to simply detect bright pixel responses or bright signatures in imaged areas that should correspond to regions of known bodies of water on the globe. Such a data extraction algorithm would fail due to the presence of ambiguity artifacts like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and subsequently would not produce quality ship detection results, because the algorithm may erroneously detect the artifact as a ship.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another common artifact in SAR imagery is a side-lobe signature around bright reflectors in a range and/or cross-range (or azimuth) direction. A side-lobe can be thought of as non-zero levels in a distribution that have separated from the desired central response, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This artifact occurs because SAR point scatterers naturally exist as sync functions in the image domain, including side-lobes. In a typical radar pulse, the sync functions contain a main lobe and theoretically an infinite number of side-lobes to capture the frequency domain characteristics of the signal, but such side-lobes may not be perceptible in the image. Often, these side-lobes are weak signals and have a brightness far less than the brightness of the surrounding objects or ambient noise, and thus are often not perceptible in the SAR data. Side-lobe problems arise, however, when an extremely bright reflective object causes a reflection with a peak power greater than the surrounding pixels, meaning that side-lobes associated with the reflection may be stronger/brighter than normal and become visible in the image.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">SAR sensors measure electromagnetic propagation time to resolve the location and geometry of objects. On occasion, transmitted energy can bounce off multiple scene features to delay a return. This bouncing effect creates a trailing artifact in the SAR image known as a Multi-Path artifact, which can be contrasted to other image content obtained from Direct Path measurements. This artifact type may be difficult for a layperson to address, as it may be nearly indistinguishable from a direct path return when the imaged object type is unknown. These returns may also be highly dependent on the geometry captured in the collection, and SAR collections may not perceive the same multi-path signature on two separate collection cases. In the case of multi-path for an oil storage tank illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for example, the multi-path tail adversely impacts the measurement of the expected down-range shadow. In this particular example, understanding the configuration of the inlet pipe atop the floating lid is critical to identifying particular imaging geometries where a multi-path tail would need to be considered.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Another differentiating feature of radar that may lead to resulting data being non-photorealistic is perspective. Human eyes are accustomed to seeing all objects on a single plane normal to their line of sight. The most common way to create usable imagery from SAR systems that appeal to human optical sensors is to distort the image such that the human understands that the image is from above rather than from some a side angle. While this simplification is quite harmless in a rural environment with few 3D structures, it can lead to a significant loss of information in urban settings. Even if one had the ability to deconflict layover signatures in a ground projected image, there remains an inability to portray the two variants as a top-down perspective only retains the top layer.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a parking structure model with cars parked at multiple levels. A car counting radar algorithm could be deployed to get a reasonable pulse on how busy the parking structure is using standard radar imaging geometries, so long as the images were analyzed in the native radar imaging plane. As previously mentioned, typical SAR projection techniques would confound the signal and place all cars on top of one another as layover. A more advanced algorithm that could potentially identify 3D structures and separate the layover artifacts would still struggle to render the final signal results in a single image as the traditional standard overhead image perspective would not allow it. Through 3D mapping of SAR data, perspectives outside of the traditional ground projected overhead perspective can be adopted.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Techniques for Analyzing SAR Data</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073">To create a photo-realistic model of a collection scene, the inventors have recognized that it would be advantageous to account for, including remove or otherwise suppress, the above-mentioned SAR artifacts&#x2014;in many scenarios, as many such SAR artifacts as possible. The inventors have further appreciated that feature extraction of complex pixel SAR data may be achieved in some embodiments through use of 3D scene modeling and high performance graphics rendering capabilities, including some of the techniques described below.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a process <b>700</b> that may be carried out in some embodiments for suppression of SAR artifacts from complex SAR data associated with a scene and generation of a photo-realistic 3D model of the scene. Process <b>700</b> begins in block <b>702</b>, in which a 3D model (e.g., a 3D vertex and face model, a point cloud 3D model, or another suitable type of 3D model) associated with a scene is obtained. The 3D model may include data corresponding to, such as depicting, one or more objects in the scene. As discussed above, the objects in the scene may be three-dimensional and the 3D model may include data regarding the three-dimensional structure of the objects, such as including data regarding the height of the objects. The 3D model may be in various forms, examples of which are discussed above. In some embodiments, the 3D model may be generated by a SAR analysis facility that may perform subsequent analysis on the 3D model, such as by performing the analysis of blocks <b>704</b>-<b>712</b>. For example, a SAR analysis facility may derive the 3D model by combining and analyzing a collection of 2D images. In some embodiments, such a SAR analysis facility may derive the 3D model by combining and analyzing a collection of SAR images, such as 2D SAR images.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In block <b>704</b>, vertices from the 3D model may be correlated with pixels of the complex SAR data. In some embodiments, the pixels refer to the formed image resulting from the in-phase and quadrature components of the complex SAR data. Examples of this correlation are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In block <b>706</b>, a location of one or more artifacts that may be generated by the structures shown in the 3D model may be predicted. Examples of techniques for this prediction are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In block <b>708</b>, the predicted artifacts may be used to suppress actual SAR artifacts from complex SAR data. Examples of techniques for this suppression are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In block <b>710</b>, the complex SAR data (i.e., complex SAR data cleaned by suppression of the SAR artifacts) may be resampled to generate one or more 2D images of the scene.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In block <b>712</b>, a photo-realistic 3D model of the scene may be generated based on the one or more 2D images of the scene. In some embodiments, the photo-realistic aspect of the 3D model may refer to lack of one or more image artifacts. While 3D mapped SAR data can still contain some imaging artifacts (e.g., perspective distortions), the photo-realistic 3D model may contain fewer imaging artifacts or no imaging artifacts at all.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The process <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may, in some embodiments, be performed by a SAR analysis facility. Such a SAR analysis facility may be implemented as computer-executable instructions, executed by one or more processors of one or more suitable computing devices, such as a server or a desktop or laptop personal computer, a cloud computing platform or other distributed network of devices, or other suitable device(s). The SAR analysis facility may receive as input in block <b>702</b> a 3D model of a scene, and may additionally obtain SAR data of the scene, which the facility may then analyze as laid out in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and in accordance with techniques described herein. In some embodiments, after the photo-realistic 3D model has been generated, the facility may generate an updated model of the scene from the photo-realistic 3D model based on updated SAR data (which may lack at least some of the artifacts of the input SAR data) and output that generated model, such as by storing the generated model or outputting the model to another entity.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">An example of a technique for suppression of SAR artifacts and creation of a photo-realistic model of a scene is described below. This technique may, in some embodiments, be implemented by a SAR analysis facility executing on one or more computing devices. It should be appreciated that while one specific example of a technique is described below, embodiments are not limited to operating precisely in accordance with this technique, as other techniques are possible.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A high resolution 3D vertex and face model may be obtained that corresponds to a footprint of a scene. The 3D model may be stored as computer-readable data, such as in one or more files or other suitable data structures. Additional information for the scene may be captured in an SLC product, based on SAR data from a SAR scan of the scene, provided by a satellite vendor with associated metadata to enable 3D projection. Alternatively or additionally, the additional information for the scene may be captured as a stripmap collection, which employs a linear collection geometry and a fixed antenna orientation. In some embodiments, this mode of operation may achieve fine cross-range (or azimuth) resolution while surveying the scene without gaps in coverage.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">To aid in artifact suppression for the scene, in some embodiments the input 3D model of the scene may extend past the edges of the scene in both the range and cross-range (or azimuth) dimensions. The direction of the range and the azimuth dimensions may be defined relative to the orbit of the satellite. While range may be defined as the direction perpendicular to the satellite flight path, azimuth may be defined as the direction parallel to the satellite flight path.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">To determine the portions that extend past the edges of the scene in both the range and cross-range (or azimuth) dimensions, or the overhang, in some embodiments vendor metadata may be used to determine the location of one or more primary ambiguity zones. In some embodiments, these zones are determined with the sampling frequency in each dimension and the Nyquist relationship in distance from a given point or origin. The zones along the range dimension may be determined by the pulse repetition frequency of the scene. Azimuth zones may be determined by the location of the object relative to the flight path of the sensor and differential doppler frequency range that it can create before wrapping around to the other side of the image.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Framing the imaged scene in the near and far range and negative and positive doppler directions, these zones contain the majority of potential ambiguity sources and are therefore useful for ambiguity modeling of the imaged scene area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the relationship of eight primary ambiguity zones in relation to the imaged scene for a given SLC spotlight or stripmap collection. By extending the scene in the particular areas covered by the ambiguity zones, ambiguity effects can be identified (e.g., those ambiguity effects described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>). In some embodiments, these ambiguity effects are conventionally difficult to identify as they arise from signal aliasing due to radar pulse under-sampling. Examining the scene in those particular zones provides the opportunity to capture the geometry of the scene and account for features that could be distorted by aliasing effects. Features within the primary imaged scene that seem ambiguous can be analyzed based on the ambiguity zones to see if a feature from within those zones is being masked, e.g., as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or otherwise distorted in appearance. If distortion is apparent or likely, the distortion may be suppressed. 3D models of these areas may then be constructed without distorted features, or with features having less distortion, to be fed into a SAR signature simulator.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The input 3D model may, as discussed above, be derived from electro-optical image data of the scene (such as in a photogrammetric model), a LIDAR scan of the scene, architectural renderings of the scene (e.g., from CAD modeling software or other sources), and/or other sources. The 3D model may have information regarding a vertical geometry of an object, including storing information on a shape or dimension, or other geometry information, of multiple points along a depth or height direction at each of one or more locations, or for each location. For example, for each (x, y) coordinate in the model, the 3D model may store information for multiple z coordinates. 3D modeled scene includes high-fidelity geometric representations of the feature of interest as well as surface properties such as reflectivity factors for each object face.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Once an input 3D model is acquired for the scene, one or more focal planes with defined uniform pixel spacing may be selected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In one embodiment, for the purposes of creating a photo-realistic 3D model, a nadir overhead plane with four additional planes corresponding to 45 degree incidence angles off-nadir at 90 degree azimuthal offsets may be selected.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">For each focal plane, a uniform pixel grid may be defined that determines the final number of complex pixels to be computed during a resampling process described in more detail below. Once the pixel grid is defined, a focal plane tie-point may be placed in between every other pixel. These tie-points represent a computational unit for later processing steps, described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a sample pixel grid with tie-points at a very coarse spacing so as to illustrate how the grid interacts with the 3D model of interest.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Once the focal tie-points are determined, they are projected along the focus plane normal to (i.e., perpendicular to) the focal plane defined by the SAR imagery, into the 3D model until they intersect with a face of the mesh. A perspective of this can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, where the grid illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is projected toward the photo-realistic model illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. Each tie-point is associated with a single mesh face from that focal perspective. The X- and Y-coordinates of all associated face vertices in addition to the tie-point of interest in this new vertex-centric coordinate frame are determined through an automatic extraction of model geometry.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A bilinear mapping is created that relates the absolute X-, Y-, and Z-Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates of each vertex as a function of face-centric x and y coordinates. This bilinear mapping is used to solve for the ECEF location of the intersection of the tie-point focal vector and its associated face. More conceptually, the local coordinate system defined within the 3D model is translated to a geolocated global coordinate system. These tie-point intersection points are then mapped into vendor-provided SLC product pixel grid using the vendor specific metadata provided along with the complex image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates how a set of tie-points can be mapped to the vendor provided SLC complex pixel grid. Having these coordinate systems correlated allows the radar imagery to be accurately represented within 3D space, which may eliminate or mitigate the need to generate a top-down, ground projected image. This is known as the 3D mapping step.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">One vertex from each associated face, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, is chosen to create a face-centric coordinate scheme that maintains the X-, Y- and Z-unit vectors from the original focal plane. Once the tie-point to SLC transformation is defined, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the full face and vertex model is converted to a set of unit vectors with associated origin coordinates. Mesh faces are represented by a vector field where one unit vector is defined at an interval (e.g., of 9 square meter area patches) and seams, or mesh edges, are represented by multiple (e.g., as many as 60) unit vectors where one unit vector is defined at an interval (e.g., of 6 degrees). The vector field defined at the mesh edges describes the angular relationship between the faces forming the seam at intervals (e.g., of every 3 meters) along the seam.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates how the vertex and face model may be converted into an up-sampled set of vectors for radar response simulation. In addition to the 3D geometric description of the scene, radiometric properties may also be described in input. This includes look angles, resolution in range and azimuth, wavelength, etc. Converting the vertex and face defined 3D model to vector form prepares the model for interaction with a simulated radar sensor. Different radiometric models can be defined in this step. One method is to define intensity values on an object surface in terms of diffuse and specular reflection models. These models characterize the reflectivity and roughness of the surface. The small perturbation method can be introduced to adapt these models to the wavelength of the defined SAR signal.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A time-variant radar response curve for each vector origin is computed by summing the vendor provided antenna pattern response for each single pulse as it reflects off the 3D model, as represented in vector form, in order to bounce back at the radar. While direct path returns only return to the sensor if the origin vector is in the opposite direction as the pulse pointing vector, multi-path bounces can return to the radar sensor by reflecting off multiple origin vector surface elements. If a single vector origin (i.e., coordinate on the 3D model from where the vector emanates) has multiple vectors pointing to different positions along the recording sensor location track during the simulated collection, the time-variant power response curve would remain at a constant high power value at this vector coordinate point. This type of response would be typical of a corner point on a rectangular object and would ultimately be represented as a bright spot in the signal representation. In contrast, a vector origin located squarely in the center of a rectangular face would only exhibit a high power signature during the time window of the collection when that particular face is orthogonal to the sensor pointing vector. A time-variant power profile of a sample vector origin is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Once each reflectivity vector origin is assigned a time-variant power profile, the total power integral is computed for each origin and the values are mapped to a distribution to determine the mean and standard deviation of the whole set. Vector origins that are above the mean are projected to their real location, potential ambiguous locations, range and cross-range (or azimuth) sidelobe locations, and multi-path perceived location in the SLC pixel grid corresponding to the vendor product. This process generates a more true-to-life representation of the simulated signal, which is beneficial for comparison to signals collected in the field. Radiometric output is compiled on a regular grid to form the final SAR simulated image. Imposing a regular grid on an irregular set of point clouds can introduce aliasing error. It may therefore be advantageous in some embodiments to perform a smoothing process prior to final image formation.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Artifacts from the imaged scene can be determined through analyst tagging or through automatic feature extraction through machine learning. Different artifacts may require different algorithms for successful detection. Feature detection algorithms can take advantage of the optical characteristics of the formed image of the scene (e.g., using matched filters or Generative Adversarial Networks to locate ambiguity artifacts as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) or can take advantage of energy properties of the SAR collection (e.g., using wavelet denoising and compressive sensing techniques to locate and suppress sidelobe lines associated with bright scatterers as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In some embodiments, artifacts can be determined through a pattern recognition-based feature extraction algorithm with analyst tagging as a quality assurance step.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Once the artifact list is compiled for the SLC image, the vector origins within a small area around each tie-point face intersection point are analyzed to create an expected time-variant power profile of the scene. This reference time-variant power profile is compared to the average time-variant power profile for a small set of pixels around the tie-point face intersection SLC projection point computed at an earlier step. Prior to resampling the complex image data into the original focal plane, the slant pixels surrounding the projected SLC tie-point are extracted from the image and undergo a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the cross-range (or azimuth) dimension. Each cross-range column is mapped back to a specific collection time through the vendor metadata, allowing the reference and artifact power profile values to be directly mapped to each column.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">This power profile calculation is performed on the surrounding tie-points as well and a correlation analysis is done to determine a common recommended &#x201c;artifact free&#x201d; time window for the center tie-point. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a sample power profile with an artifact free time window identified. Once the artifact free time window is determined, the remaining power profile pixels are analyzed to produce a correction vector that is applied to the frequency domain pixels in order to shape the power profile like that of the expected scene power profile. Once the complex pixels associated with the tie-point are prepared for projection to their final perceived location, the focal pixels from the original grid are mapped onto the tie-point grid through bilinear interpolation. These interpolated tie-point locations are then converted into specific pixel locations in the mitigated complex image and the complex pixels (e.g., the original SAR signal in the SLC or stripmap collections associated with specific pixels from the formed image identified as artifacts) are resampled with either bilinear, bi-cubic spline, a ripple-free polyphase filter, or other interpolation technique depending upon the throughput requirements of the application (e.g., bilinear interpolation may provide the fastest solution, though potentially with accuracy loss, and polyphase filter may provide the slowest solution, with potentially higher accuracy). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates how both the real and imaginary complex data is resampled to form perspective gridded pixels.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Once all focal images are assembled from resampling, each model face is analyzed to determine the best vantage point for non-obstructed viewing using the focal vector projections from earlier rendering calculations. Once an optimal viewing angle is selected for each face, a new 3D face and vertex file is created that can be rendered by a standard software tool, (e.g., Google Earth, Trimble SketchUp, Autodesk AutoCAD, or Rhinoceros 3D). This new photo-realistic 3D model generated from SAR collection can be derived through methods such as stereo radargrammetry or interferometric SAR (InSAR). In some embodiments, to generate a 3D model from SAR imagery, at least two SAR collections/images may be used, though more images can in some embodiments result in a higher quality 3D model. In stereo radargrammetry, like photogrammetry, 3D coordinates of an object or scene may be derived by triangulating nodes of features exhibited in the set of images where the images are taken from different camera (or sensor) locations. This method would focus more on the amplitude of the SAR collection. InSAR is able to generate 3D surface models of a scene using two or more SAR collections by exploiting changes in the phase history of the radar signal. In some circumstances, InSAR can be a more robust method than stereo radargrammetry, however, in some such cases, the InSAR method may have strict input requirements to run successfully. In cases in which InSAR may not be feasible or is less desirable, stereo radargrammetry may be employed to generate a new 3D model of the scene.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Artificially Intelligent Training Data</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, the resulting artificial SAR image retains labeled metadata describing the modeled 3D features as well as satellite properties. These images may be used to build a set of training data for machine learning techniques, which may in turn be used for enhanced feature classification.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the process of generating simulated imagery from the different orientations as defined by the ambiguity zones for artifact suppression, the associated area of interest (AOI) or image collection geometry may have SAR target signatures that can further be interpolated, with the assistance of 3D mapping, to provide a full view of the area. This library can contain both simulated SAR imagery and collected SAR imagery.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, an output of generating simulated SAR signatures for artifact suppression may be the association of 3D face and vertex files with 2D features. A library of annotated images can be associated with each 3D volumetric model input to a SAR simulator. The SAR simulator may be a ray-tracing based program, including a package such as GRECO-SAR or RaySAR. Virtual twins of an AOI can be constructed by an analyst who is familiar with the features of the scene. In the process of assembling the scene, the analyst can label features from the associated SAR image to build out a library of 2D features that correspond with the particular 3D model. For feature detection within the library, the image can be searched through methods such as a 2D match filter or feature encoding technique. Simulation chips can be encoded through dictionary encoding, with input SAR collections also encoded through dictionary encoding. From this process, a database of SAR images related to specific features can be produced, which can then be related to 3D models. Machine learning apparatus like Baeysian/Gaussian and other probabilistic classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), variance considered machine (VCM), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) with varying deep learning architecture can be trained to identify features within this library. The machine learning apparatus would receive a SAR image chip with an unidentified feature as an input and would output a classification of that feature. Real SAR collections can be annotated by an analyst when input into the library. Classifications are returned, and the machine learning apparatus may be able to generate such classifications with high confidence. In some embodiments, as additional scenes are simulated, or new real data is collected, new images can be input into the training library to strengthen the detection algorithm.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">When a 2D feature is identified from SAR imagery, a 3D model match can be determined from the dictionary of 2D SAR images/3D models through a search algorithm. Additional 3D features of the identified model can be extracted that can inform the analyst on geometric details of the 3D features. This is particularly advantageous for architectural renderings generated in programs such as Trimble SketchUp, Autodesk AutoCAD, or Rhinoceros 3D. Geometric properties of structures such as building heights or tank diameter can be extracted from the final new 3D face and vertex file generated as an output of the photorealistic SAR process through radargrammetry or InSAR. Such properties can be applied to 3D models, including automatically generated or hand generated 3D models, to improve the output of the SAR simulated scene. This feedback loop between SAR collections and 3D model of the scene can provide an up-to-date and complete volumetric representation of the scene. In some embodiments, this additional geometric information may also allow for automatic 3D model updating over surface models, as described below.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">SAR Simulator Supported 3D Change Detection</heading><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Change detection can be challenging on processed SAR imagery, as algorithms to convert the SAR signal to a ground projected formed image can introduce artifacts that warp the representation of the data. By working in the space of the SAR signal, in some embodiments 3D change analytics can be performed directly on SAR pixels without the challenges introduced by 2D pixel formation assumptions. In some cases, high resolution (e.g., &#x3c;0.5 m ground in the range dimension) SAR collections may be needed to achieve a desired level of detail for change detection on 3D structures. Described herein is an approach to automatically and globally detect spatial/3D change at low resolution and move to high resolution when a change is detected. In some embodiments, through 3D mapping described previously, detected changes may then be projected back onto the 3D surface model to identify and highlight areas and vertices for update, as described below.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Satellite system modes vary widely across available ground resolution. Some systems have modes that allow collection across very large areas with very large effective pixel sizes, which can detect general change in a scene but are not suitable to characterize subtle change. Satellite systems with a smaller pixel size (and hence higher resolution) also have a smaller coverage footprint, rendering a considerably higher cost to provide imagery over the full coverage of the AOI. In some embodiments, a hybrid collection methodology can be used in which area change detection is performed quickly and repetitively and high resolution imagery is then acquired on areas where sufficient change is detected. In these embodiments, this may limit the time and expense of acquisition or processing of high resolution imagery.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition to localizing areas within the 3D model of the image collection geometry, a stack of SAR imagery can be compared to the previous image in the time history to track relative changes. Transient changes can be filtered out as they may not have lasting effect on the topography of the AOI. Time history tracking can also provide provenance to the change detection, assigning a time frame for when a change in the landscape was first detected. This may be helpful for 3D model updating in some embodiments, as described below. This feature may also allow tracking of a rate of change, giving the ability to prioritize regions with rapid development and predict areas that have a high probability of crossing the threshold set by a change metric.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Through the use of a land-use land-cover (LULC) mask, the SAR collection can be filtered such that the change detection algorithm only searches within certain regions of the scene. In some embodiments, the LULC mask is user specified, determined automatically by analyzing the SAR data, or obtained through other suitable means. For example, the initial LULC mask can be downloaded from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) database, determined through Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite image data or another source, and/or determined through analysis. This localizes monitoring only to relevant areas, such as urban landscapes where construction/destruction of infrastructure is probable, further reducing falsely detected change and increasing detection precision. The contents of the LULC mask can also be monitored, to enable tracking changes within an area of interest over time, e.g., land classification perimeters. The area of interest may be specified as a geospatial shape file or using another suitable geospatial vector data format that can spatially describe vector features, e.g., land or water features. Monitoring the contents of the LULC mask may include tracking the actual shape of the mask and how that is changing, e.g., to see if areas identified as &#x201c;urban&#x201d; are taking up more area on the mask. This could support forecasting urban growth or deforestation models.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">3D Model Updating</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, in the 3D models derived through SAR collections (which can be generated through both simulated SAR imagery and real SAR collections), it may be the case that features, or detailed features of objects, no longer agree with the 3D modeled image geometry of the collection scene. SAR collections provide a dynamic view of the scene, describing a time sensitive representation of the scene. The corresponding virtual representation of the scene is static, and thus at any time may be in need of update to capture up-to-the-moment details of the AOI.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Vertex level change detection between sets of 3D models may determine the magnitude of volumetric change in terms of a distance metric. Although surface models generated through InSAR or radargrammetry are considered directly in at least some of the described embodiments, any combination of 3D models pairs within available 3D explicit data (e.g., 3D architectural models, point clouds, digital surface models, etc.) are possible. These models may use a shared ground resolution, which can be accomplished through an interpolation method after registration such as 3D least squares surface matching. The local transformation is used to perform a coarse correlation and the global transformation is used to achieve point (e.g., pixel) level registration. A geometric comparison algorithm may be used to calculate the point-by-point difference between the pair of 3D models. This may be performed by measuring Euclidean distances between the model pair but can be accomplished through a different distance metric. Geometric information may be delivered with spectral information. Geometric spectral analysis offers an opportunity to refine results from direct 3D geometric measurements by taking into account feature-based cues of change to robustly determine the presence of change. The image texture delivered in the spectral data can also assist in feature extraction to assist the feature-driven cues described above.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The output of this 3D change detection returns both the locations and magnitude of change on a vertex level. This allows automatic edits to the vertices of 3D models with a concrete distance metric. The time history and LULC trending methods described previously may filter detections to reduce false positives such that volumetric distortions are not applied to the 3D models.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Example Computer/Software Implementations</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Techniques operating according to the principles described herein may be implemented in any suitable manner.
