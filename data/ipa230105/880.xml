The World Health Organization recently reported that more than a billion teens and young adults worldwide are at risk of NIHL caused by loud music (http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/health/hearing-loss-loud-music/index.html). Acute or chronic acoustic overexposure has put more than 40 million U.S. workers at risk of permanent hearing loss (Kopke et al. (2007) <i>Hear. Res. </i>226: 114-125). NIHL is also prevalent in military settings, costing more than $2 billion per year in veterans (VA) compensation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Noise trauma results in two types of hearing loss, depending on intensity and duration: permanent or temporary threshold shift (PTS or TTS). Persons can recover from TTS within 24-48 hrs, whereas PTS is irreversible. Mechanistically, acoustic overexposure causes hearing loss through overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial injury, lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, reperfusion injury, excessive glutamate release, and/or loss of hair cells and neurons through programmed cell death (PCD, apoptosis) and inflammatory pathways (Kopke et al. (2007) <i>Hear. Res. </i>226: 114-125). Many of these cellular pathways overlap with those involved in hearing loss caused by cisplatin chemotherapy, antibiotics, and age (Mukherj ea et al. (2011) <i>Expert Opin. Drug Discov. </i>6: 491-505; Schacht et al. (2012)<i>Anat Rec</i>. (<i>Hoboken</i>) 295: 1837-1850; Vu et al. (2013) <i>PLoS One </i>8: e54794. However, it is not known which pathways, established or novel, are key to the prevention of NIHL and other forms of ototoxicity, such as cisplatin-induced or chemotherapy-induced hearing loss, antibiotic-induced hearing loss, and age-related hearing loss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cisplatin is known to exhibit toxic effects on hair cells of the inner ear. Indeed, high frequency hearing loss (&#x3e;8 kHZ) has been reported to be as high as 90% in children undergoing cisplatin therapy (Allen et al. (1998) <i>Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg </i>118: 584-588). Other clinically important and commonly used drugs also have documented ototoxic effects, including loop diuretics (Greenberg (2000) <i>Am. J. Med. Sci. </i>319:10-24), antimalarial sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxides (e.g., artemesinins) (Toovey and Jamieson (2004) <i>Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. </i>98: 261-267), antimalarial quinines (Claessen et al. (1998) <i>Trop. Med. Int. Health </i>3: 482-489), salicylates (Matz (1990) <i>Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol</i>. Suppl. 148: 39-41), and interferon polypeptides (Formann et al. (2004) <i>Am. J. Gastroenterol. </i>99: 873-877).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, ototoxicity to the vestibular system, which includes the vestibule and semicircular canal, manifests as balance and orientation-related disorders. These disorders include, but are not limited to, induced or spontaneous vertigo, dysequilibrium, increased susceptibility to motion sickness, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, labyrinthitis, oscillopsia, nystagmus, syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, increased falling, difficulty walking at night, Meniere's disease, and difficulty in visual tracking and processing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Extensive research in recent years has sought to identify small molecules that can protect against hearing loss. Those tested can be classified into three different groups based on their main cellular function: 1) antioxidants and ROS scavengers, 2) anti-inflammatory drugs, and 3) apoptosis inhibitors. Many candidate compounds are currently in pre-clinical and clinical trials; most are related to antioxidants, vitamins, and glutathione metabolism, although their effectiveness remains unclear.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite the promising protective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in preclinical and clinical safety studies, it has shown no protection against NIHL in several clinical trials (Kopke et al. (2007) <i>Hear. Res. </i>226: 114-125; Tieu and Campbell (2013) <i>Otolaryngology </i>3:130). D-methionine has shown protective effects against NIHL but remains to be tested in clinical trials (Muller and Barr-Gillespie (2015) <i>Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. </i>14: 346-365; Oishi and Schacht (2011) <i>Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs </i>16: 235-245). Similarly, Ebelsen (SPI-1005), a seleno-organic compound with antioxidant activity through glutathione peroxidase-like action, has been tested against TTS in noise-induced excitotoxicity studies but remains unproven in clinical trials (See &#x201c;Sound Pharmaceuticals Inc. successfully completes its first Phase 2 clinical trial with SPI-1005&#x201d; (Nov. 5, 2013); Lynch and Kil (2005) <i>Drug Discov. Today </i>10: 1291-1298). To date, no drugs are FDA-approved for protection against NIHL and traumatic brain injury (TBI)-associated hearing loss. Thus, there remains a need for compositions and methods of preventing and treating hearing loss.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention, in one aspect, relates to compositions and methods for use in the prevention and treatment of a hearing impairment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Disclosed are methods of treating hearing impairment, the methods comprising administering to a subject diagnosed with a need for treatment of hearing impairment a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also disclosed are methods of preventing hearing impairment, the methods comprising administering to a subject a CDK2 inhibitor in an amount of from about 0.001 &#x3bc;M to about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>&#x3bc;M at least once every three weeks, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also disclosed are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a CDK2 inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and one or more of: (a) at least one agent known to treat hearing impairment, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and (b) at least one agent known to prevent hearing impairment, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also disclosed are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a CDK2 inhibitor, wherein the CDK2 inhibitor is not a paullone derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and one or more of: at least one agent known to treat hearing impairment, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and at least one agent known to prevent hearing impairment, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also disclosed are methods for making compounds and for making compounds for use in pharmaceutical compositions.

This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In various aspects, the term covers any treatment of a subject, including a mammal (e.g., a human), and includes: (i) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject that can be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; or (iii) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease. In one aspect, the subject is a mammal such as a primate, and, in a further aspect, the subject is a human. The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; also includes domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.), livestock (e.g., cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), and laboratory animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, fruit fly, etc.).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; or &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; refers to precluding, averting, obviating, forestalling, stopping, or hindering something from happening, especially by advance action.

Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; and &#x201c;amount effective&#x201d; refer to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired result or to have an effect on an undesired condition. For example, a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side effects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered in a &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d;; that is, an amount effective for prevention of a disease or condition.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">As used herein, &#x201c;dosage form&#x201d; means a pharmacologically active material in a medium, carrier, vehicle, or device suitable for administration to a subject.

The term therefore encompasses those compounds or chemicals traditionally regarded as drugs, vaccines, and biopharmaceuticals including molecules such as proteins, peptides, hormones, nucleic acids, gene constructs and the like. Examples of therapeutic agents are described in well-known literature references such as the Merck Index (14<sup>th </sup>edition), the Physicians' Desk Reference (64<sup>th </sup>edition), and The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (12<sup>th </sup>edition), and they include, without limitation, medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of a disease or illness; substances that affect the structure or function of the body, or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a physiological environment. For example, the term &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; includes compounds or compositions for use in all of the major therapeutic areas including, but not limited to, adjuvants; anti-infectives such as antibiotics and antiviral agents; analgesics and analgesic combinations, anorexics, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-epileptics, local and general anesthetics, hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychotic agents, neuroleptic agents, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antagonists, neuron blocking agents, anticholinergic and cholinomimetic agents, antimuscarinic and muscarinic agents, antiadrenergics, antiarrhythmics, antihypertensive agents, hormones, and nutrients, antiarthritics, antiasthmatic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antinauseants, antineoplastics, antipruritics, antipyretics; antispasmodics, cardiovascular preparations (including calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, beta-agonists and antiarrythmics), antihypertensives, diuretics, vasodilators; central nervous system stimulants; cough and cold preparations; decongestants; diagnostics; hormones; bone growth stimulants and bone resorption inhibitors; immunosuppressives; muscle relaxants; psychostimulants; sedatives; tranquilizers; proteins, peptides, and fragments thereof (whether naturally occurring, chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced); and nucleic acid molecules (polymeric forms of two or more nucleotides, either ribonucleotides (RNA) or deoxyribonucleotides (DNA) including both double- and single-stranded molecules, gene constructs, expression vectors, antisense molecules and the like), small molecules (e.g., doxorubicin) and other biologically active macromolecules such as, for example, proteins and enzymes. The agent may be a biologically active agent used in medical, including veterinary, applications and in agriculture, such as with plants, as well as other areas. The term &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; also includes without limitation, medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of disease or illness; or substances which affect the structure or function of the body; or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a predetermined physiological environment.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; describes a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., without causing an unacceptable level of undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">As used herein, the term &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; refers to a compound having a structure derived from the structure of a parent compound (e.g., a compound disclosed herein) and whose structure is sufficiently similar to those disclosed herein and based upon that similarity, would be expected by one skilled in the art to exhibit the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds, or to induce, as a precursor, the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds. Exemplary derivatives include salts, esters, amides, salts of esters or amides, and N-oxides of a parent compound.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; refers to sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">The term &#x201c;hearing impairment&#x201d; as used herein refers to a neurologic disorder, oto-neurological in nature, typically sensorineural, but including composite loss (both sensorineural and conductive loss), preferably either a sensory or a neural (8th nerve related) hearing lost, and most preferably a sensory loss (cochlear related), in which the patient will display, complain of, or is diagnosed to have a hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss is typically related to the external or middle ear. These impairments of interest to the present invention are those associated with hair cell damage. Less preferably such impairments can occur along with conductive hearing loss damage or damage, loss, or degeneration of a neuron of the auditory system. Hair cells are epithelial cells possessing fine projections and located in the maculae and the organ of Corti.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Examples of hearing impairments and situations in which such hearing impairments can occur encompassed by the term &#x201c;hearing impairment,&#x201d; as used herein, include sensory hearing loss due to end-organ lesions, e.g., acoustic trauma, viral endolymphatic labyrinthitis, and Meniere's disease. The impairment can also be a neural hearing loss due to events including cerebellopontine angle tumors of the 8<sup>th </sup>nerve. Hearing impairments include tinnitus, this is a perception of sound in the absence of an acoustic stimulus, and may be intermittent or continuous, wherein there is a diagnosed sensorineural loss. Hearing loss may be due to bacterial or viral infection of the 8<sup>th </sup>nerve ganglia, such as in herpes zoster oticus, purulent labyrinthitis arising from acute otitis media, purulent meningitis, chronic otitis media, sudden deafness including that of viral origin, e.g., viral endolymphatic labyrinthitis caused by viruses including mumps, measles, influenza, chickenpox, mononucleosis, and adenoviruses. The hearing loss can be congenital, such as that caused by rubella, anoxia during birth, bleeding into the inner ear due to trauma during delivery, ototoxic drugs administered to the mother, erythroblastosis fetalis, and hereditary conditions including Waardenburg's syndrome and Hurler's syndrome. The hearing loss can be noise-induced, generally due to a noise greater than 85 decibels (db) SPL (sound pressure level) that damages the inner ear. Hearing loss includes presbycusis, which is a sensorineural hearing loss occurring as a normal part of aging, fractures of the temporal bone extending into the middle ear and rupturing the tympanic membrane and possibly the ossicular chain, fractures affecting the cochlea, and acoustic neurinoma, which are tumors generally of Shwann cell origin that arise from either the auditory or vestibular divisions of the 8th nerve. In various aspects, the hearing loss is caused by an ototoxic drug that affects the auditory portion of the inner ear, particularly the organ of Corti. The hearing loss may be due to chemotherapy or to cisplatin. The hearing loss can be related to a vestibular disorder including vertigo, dysequilibrium, increased susceptibility to motion sickness, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, labyrinthitis, oscillopsia, nystagmus, syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, increased falling, difficulty walking at night, Meniere's disease, and difficulty in visual tracking and processing. Incorporated herein by reference are Chapters 196, 197, 198, and 199 of The Merck Index, 14th Edition (1982), Merck Sharp &#x26; Dome Research Laboratories, N.J. and related chapters in the most recent edition, relating to description and diagnosis of hearing impairments.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Tests are known and available for diagnosing hearing impairments. Neuro-otological, neuro-ophthalmological, neurological examinations, and electra-oculography can be used (Wennmo et al., <i>Acta Otolaryngol </i>1982, 94, 507). Sensitive and specific measures are available to identify patients with auditory impairments. For example, tuning fork tests can be used to differentiate a conductive from a sensorineural hearing loss and determine whether the loss is unilateral. An audiometer is used to quantitate hearing loss, measured in decibels. With this device the hearing for each ear is measured, typically from 125 to 8000 Hz, and plotted as an audiogram. Speech audiometry can also be performed. The speech recognition threshold, the intensity at which speed is recognized as a meaningful symbol, can be determined at various speech frequencies. Speech or phoneme discrimination can also be determined and used as an indicator of sensorineural hearing loss since analysis of speech sounds relies upon the inner ear and 8<sup>th </sup>nerve. Tympanometry can be used to diagnose conductive hearing loss and aid in the diagnosis of those patients with sensorineural hearing loss. Electrocochleography, measuring the cochlear microphonic response and action potential of the 8<sup>th </sup>nerve, and evoked response audiometry, measuring evoked response from the brainstem and auditory cortex, to acoustic stimuli can be used in patients, particularly infants and children or patients with sensorineural hearing loss of obscure etiology. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) or distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are most commonly used audiometry methods. These tests serve a diagnostic function as well as a clinical function in assessing response to therapy.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">A residue of a chemical species, as used in the specification and concluding claims, refers to the moiety that is the resulting product of the chemical species in a particular reaction scheme or subsequent formulation or chemical product, regardless of whether the moiety is actually obtained from the chemical species.

For example, the term &#x201c;halogenated alkyl&#x201d; or &#x201c;haloalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more halide, e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Alternatively, the term &#x201c;monohaloalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with a single halide, e.g. fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The term &#x201c;polyhaloalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is independently substituted with two or more halides, i.e. each halide substituent need not be the same halide as another halide substituent, nor do the multiple instances of a halide substituent need to be on the same carbon. The term &#x201c;alkoxyalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more alkoxy groups, as described below. The term &#x201c;aminoalkyl&#x201d; specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more amino groups.

Unless stated to the contrary, the present invention includes all such possible diastereomers as well as their racemic mixtures, their substantially pure resolved enantiomers, all possible geometric isomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Mixtures of stereoisomers, as well as isolated specific stereoisomers, are also included.

In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and <b>1</b> or (+) and (&#x2212;) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (&#x2212;) or meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane). The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system can be used to assign the (R) or (S) configuration to a chiral carbon.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0116">Compounds described herein comprise atoms in both their natural isotopic abundance and in non-natural abundance. The disclosed compounds can be isotopically-labeled or isotopically-substituted compounds identical to those described, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature.

Tritiated, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances.

NIHL is the No. 1 diagnosis among U.S. soldiers who served in Afghanistan (http://issuu.com/hearinghealthmagazine/docs/hearinghealthwinter2010issuurev3). Of 1,250 Marine Commandos who served in Afghanistan, 69% suffered hearing loss due to the intense noise of combat. Hearing impairment significantly affects performance (Consideration of Hazardous Noise in the Acquisition of Selected Major Department of the Navy Weapon Systems and Platforms N2010-0038, 22 Jun. 2010). Given the importance of auditory acuity in perceiving commands and sensing enemy activity, it is clear that even mild loss of hearing increases the risk to soldiers. While hearing aids and cochlear implants are helpful devices in the civilian and non-combatant community, they are not an appropriate remedy in a combat setting. When hearing loss restricts continued military service, forces suffer loss of personnel, often including the most effective and experienced officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). Finally, even the best available protection cannot prevent NIHL. As a result, 2.3 million veterans now receive disability compensation and treatment that exceeds $2 billion annually (Annual Benefits Report Fiscal Year 2012, U.S. Dept. Veterans Affairs). Among veterans who suffer from NIHL, difficulty in communicating with clinicians and family impedes reintegration into society and exacerbates depression and anxiety. A preventive solution would cost-effectively and significantly improve the effectiveness of military personnel and the quality of life of veterans.</p><p id="p-0632" num="0515">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and blast-associated injury occur most frequently in military situations where blast exposure cannot be predicted, trauma intensity exceeds the effectiveness of protective devices, or protective devices are not available. TBI is often accompanied by a diverse range of disruption or damage to the auditory sensory system, which is highly vulnerable to blast injury. Extreme physical blast force can cause damage of various types to the peripheral auditory system, including rupture of the tympanic membrane (TM, eardrum), fracture of the middle ear bones, dislocation of sensory hair cells from the basilar membrane, and loss of spiral ganglia that innervate hair cells. In human studies of blast injury, approximately 17-29% of cases involve severe TM rupture, while 33-78% involve moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss (hair cell and ganglion loss). Therefore, TBI and blast injury are a common, although extreme, cause of hearing loss.</p><p id="p-0633" num="0516">In various aspects, the disclosed compounds can be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of hearing impairments and disorders for which disclosed compounds or the other drugs can have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone.

Thus, the subject of the herein disclosed methods can be a human, non-human primate, horse, pig, rabbit, dog, sheep, goat, cow, cat, guinea pig or rodent. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are intended to be covered. A patient refers to a subject afflicted with a disease or disorder. The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; includes human and veterinary subjects.</p><p id="p-0718" num="0589">In some aspects of the disclosed methods, the subject has been diagnosed with a need for treatment prior to the administering step. In some aspects of the disclosed method, the subject has been diagnosed with a hearing impairment or disorder prior to the administering step. In some aspects of the disclosed methods, the subject has been identified with a need for treatment prior to the administering step. In one aspect, a subject can be treated prophylactically with a compound or composition disclosed herein, as discussed herein elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0719" num="0590">a. Dosage</p><p id="p-0720" num="0591">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the agents and pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures, using either cells in culture or experimental animals to determine the LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>. Polypeptides or other compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.</p><p id="p-0721" num="0592">Data obtained from cell culture assays and further animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with little or no toxicity, and with little or no adverse effect on a human's ability to hear. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agents used in the methods described herein, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC<sub>50 </sub>(that is, the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Exemplary dosage amounts of a differentiation agent are at least from about 0.01 to 3000 mg per day, e.g., at least about 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, or 3000 mg per kg per day, or more.</p><p id="p-0722" num="0593">The formulations and routes of administration can be tailored to the disease or disorder being treated, and for the specific human being treated. For example, a subject can receive a dose of the agent once or twice or more daily for one week, one month, six months, one year, or more. The treatment can continue indefinitely, such as throughout the lifetime of the human. Treatment can be administered at regular or irregular intervals (once every other day or twice per week), and the dosage and timing of the administration can be adjusted throughout the course of the treatment. The dosage can remain constant over the course of the treatment regimen, or it can be decreased or increased over the course of the treatment.</p><p id="p-0723" num="0594">In various aspects, the dosage facilitates an intended purpose for both prophylaxis and treatment without undesirable side effects, such as toxicity, irritation or allergic response. Although individual needs may vary, the determination of optimal ranges for effective amounts of formulations is within the skill of the art. Human doses can readily be extrapolated from animal studies (Katocs et al., (1990) Chapter 27 in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). In general, the dosage required to provide an effective amount of a formulation, which can be adjusted by one skilled in the art, will vary depending on several factors, including the age, health, physical condition, weight, type and extent of the disease or disorder of the recipient, frequency of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy, if required, and the nature and scope of the desired effect(s) (Nies et al., (1996) Chapter 3, In: Goodman &#x26; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.).</p><p id="p-0724" num="0595">b.

For example, the compounds and compositions described herein can be administered by intratympanic injection (e.g., into the middle ear), and/or injections into the outer, middle, and/or inner ear. Such methods are routinely used in the art, for example, for the administration of steroids and antibiotics into human ears. Injection can be, for example, through the round window of the ear or through the cochlear capsule. Other inner ear administration methods are known in the art (see, e.g., Salt and Plontke, <i>Drug Discovery Today </i>2005, 10, 1299).</p><p id="p-0729" num="0600">In various aspects, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered in situ, via a catheter or pump. A catheter or pump can, for example, direct a pharmaceutical composition into the cochlear luminae or the round window of the ear and/or the lumen of the colon. Exemplary drug delivery apparatus and methods suitable for administering one or more of the compounds described herein into an ear, e.g., a human ear, are described in US 2006/0030837 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,206,639. In a further aspect, a catheter or pump can be positioned, e.g., in the ear (e.g., the outer, middle, and/or inner ear) of a patient during a surgical procedure. In a still further aspect, a catheter or pump can be positioned, e.g., in the ear (e.g., the outer, middle, and/or inner ear) of a patient without the need for a surgical procedure.</p><p id="p-0730" num="0601">In various aspects, one or more of the compounds and compositions described herein can be administered in combination with a mechanical device such as a cochlear implant or a hearing aid, which is worn in the outer ear.

Primary Screen of a Bioactive Library for Reduction of Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis in the HEI-OC1 Cell Line</p><p id="p-0738" num="0609">Caspase-3 activation is an important downstream molecular event known to occur in the majority of cellular pathways leading to apoptosis, including apoptosis of inner ear cells. Previous work has shown that inhibition of caspases, for example, by zVAD-fmk, an irreversible general caspase inhibitor, confers robust protection against cisplatin-induced cell death (Liu et al. (1998) <i>Neuroreport </i>9: 2609-2614). For this screen, caspase-3 cleavage was chosen as the endpoint indicating cisplatin-induced cell death, as it allowed the inhibition of cell death to be monitored at the level of any intracellular molecular target upstream of caspase-3 cleavage in the cell line. Pifithrin-&#x3b1; was also chosen as a reference compound for the screen, as it provided good protection against cisplatin ototoxicity by inhibiting caspase-3 cleavage with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 17 &#x3bc;M. Pifithrin-&#x3b1;, a small molecule that inhibits p53, was shown to suppress the expression of p53, caspase-3, and caspase-1 in mouse cochlear explants (Zhang et al. (2003) <i>Neuroscience </i>120: 191-205). Pifithrin-&#x3b1; has previously been shown to confer reasonable protection from cisplatin-induced cell death in cell lines and, importantly, in mouse cochlear explants at concentrations of 20-100 &#x3bc;M (Zhang et al. (2003) <i>Neuroscience </i>120: 191-205), although at these doses it was reported to damage the hair cell stereocillia.</p><p id="p-0739" num="0610">To measure cell death induced by cisplatin in cochlear hair cells, the HEI-OC1 immortalized inner ear cell line isolated originally from P7 organs of Corti of the Immortomouse (Kalinec et al. (2003) <i>Adiol. Neurootol. </i>8: 177-189) was used. This cell line has been shown to serve as a good model of inner ear cells (Kim et al. (2010) <i>J. Neurosci. </i>30: 3933-3946), and it was independently confirmed by qRT-PCR that the cells used in this screen express the hair cell markers Myo6 and Myo7a.</p><p id="p-0740" num="0611">This screen is also described in Teitz, T., Goktug, A.

The Promega Caspase-3/7 Glo assay, which allows measurement of light emitted as the result of caspase cleavage and is suitable for HTS, was used. The linearity of the Caspase-3/7 Glo assay was validated and it was verified that 0.5% DMSO had no effect on cell death kinetics. The Caspase-3/7 Glo assay was then tested for reproducibility on the St. Jude robot systems. By using a pintool, test compounds were added to the screen to a final concentration of 8 &#x3bc;M, and cisplatin solution was added immediately to each well to a final concentration of 50 &#x3bc;M. Cells were incubated with the test compounds and cisplatin for 22 hrs at 33&#xb0; C., 10% CO<sub>2 </sub>with the medium as previously described (Kalinec et al. (2003) <i>Adiol. Neurootol. </i>8: 177-189); no &#x3b3;-interferon was added. The 384-well plates were shaken and spun after compound addition to enhance assay reproducibility.</p><p id="p-0742" num="0613">The assay positive control, pifithrin-&#x3b1;, induced 50% reduction of caspase-3/7 activity at 17 &#x3bc;M (IC<sub>50</sub>) and full reduction at 34 &#x3bc;M.

Cells not treated with cisplatin (grown in media only) were assigned 0% caspase-3/7 activity. 177 compounds were found to decrease cisplatin-induced caspase-3/7 activity by 60% or more (see black line and below).</p><p id="p-0744" num="0615">2. Dose-Response and Toxicity of the Top Hits from the Primary Screen</p><p id="p-0745" num="0616">The Caspase-3/7 Glo assay was used as described above to test the 177 top hit compounds for protection against cisplatin-induced cell death. Ten serial 1:3 dilutions (40 &#x3bc;M to 40 nM) of each compound were tested in triplicate in the presence of 50 &#x3bc;M cisplatin. To measure the viability of the HEI-0C1 cells treated with these compounds alone, the compounds were added to the cells without cisplatin at the same final concentrations of 40 &#x3bc;M to 40 nM. Cell viability was assayed in triplicate by using the Promega Cell Titer Glo assay (CTG), which quantifies the ATP released from live cells and is suitable for HTS. Cells grown in media only, without compounds, under identical conditions served as positive control for 100% viability. Cells treated with a 100% lethal concentration of staurosporine for 22 hours were controls for 0% viability. The results of the caspase-3/7 assay and the CTG viability assay are shown for three known compounds (pifithrin-&#x3b1;, zVAD-fmk, and Ebselen, shown in Teitz et al., 2016, Auditory and Vestibular Research, Methods and Protocols, Second Edition.

(1998) <i>Neuroreport </i>9: 2609-2614). However, this compound is unlikely to be the best choice for therapeutic use in vivo. Another interesting hit from the screen was Ebselen, which is currently being tested for protection against noise-induced hearing loss in a clinical Phase 2 trial (www.soundpharmaceuticals.com). Ebselen showed low potency in protection against cisplatin and was toxic at the concentration that inhibited caspase-3/7.</p><p id="p-0746" num="0617">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i></figref>, dose response curves were generated after 22 hr culture in HEI-0C1 cells.

Protection Against Cisplatin-Induced Hair Cell Loss in Cochlear Explants</p><p id="p-0751" num="0620">The top 13 compounds were texted ex vivo in neonatal (P3) mouse cochlear explants.

After one day of culture, cisplatin (50 &#x3bc;M) with or without compounds were added to growth media and incubated for 24 hrs at 37&#xb0; C. 50 &#x3bc;M cisplatin was chosen because the explant assay consistently showed death at &#x2dc;40% of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the mouse cochlea at this concentration after 24 hrs co-incubation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-G</figref>). It is known that OHCs are the first cells to be damaged ex vivo and in vivo by cisplatin and noise, while inner hair cells (IHCs) are injured at higher concentrations of cisplatin or higher levels of noise (Oishi and Schacht (2011) <i>Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs </i>16: 235-245; Zhang et al. (2003) <i>Neuroscience </i>120: 191-205). Cochleae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained against actin with Phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 568 to determine hair cells' viability, which was also assayed by 4&#x2032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, FM1-43 dye uptake, and immunohistochemistry with known hair cell markers (Parvalbumin and Myo7a). Cochleae were imaged by confocal microscopy, two 160 &#x3bc;m regions from middle turns were photographed, and the number of intact hair cells was counted.

Protection Against Cisplatin-Induced Hair Cell Loss in Zebrafish Lateral Lines In Vivo</p><p id="p-0757" num="0625">The top ten compounds as determined by the mouse cochlear explants were further tested in the lateral line neuromasts of 5-days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae in vivo. Hair cells in the zebrafish lateral line are considered homologous to sensory hair cells in the mammalian inner ear and have similar responses to ototoxic drugs (Ou et al. (2007) <i>Hear. Res. </i>233: 46-53). Zebrafish are well established in vivo system to test cisplatin damage, as the hair cells are easily accessible to drugs (Coffin et al. (2013) <i>Apoptosis </i>18: 393-408; Vlasits et al. (2012) <i>Hear. Res. </i>294: 153-165). The experiments were performed with 5-dpf larval zebrafish of the *AB wild-type strain. Dose-response studies were performed to find the cisplatin concentration at which most of the hair cells in each neuromast were killed in the absence of a protective compound and at the same DMSO concentration (&#x3c;0.2%). It was determined that 5 &#x3bc;M cisplatin killed 91% of the hair cells without addition of protective compounds in zebrafish treated for 20 hrs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-E</figref>, see the data point of 9% survival with &#x201c;5.0 CIS&#x201d;). Next, the cisplatin protection effect of the top ten compounds as determined by the experiments herein above was tested. As positive controls in these experiments, Paroxetine and Benzamil were used at concentrations previously shown to confer cisplatin protection in zebrafish (Vlasits et al. (2012) <i>Hear. Res. </i>294: 153-165; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0758" num="0626">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-D</figref>, compound 4 protects against cisplatin-induced hair cell loss in zebrafish lateral lines in vivo.

Benzamil and Paroxetine are compounds known to protect against cisplatin-induced hair cell loss in zebrafish (Vlasits et al. (2012) <i>Hear.

Fish were incubated with 5 &#x3bc;M and stained with 0.005% DASPEI vital dye for 15 minutes. After two washes with egg water, fish were visualized in an epiflourescence microscope. Ten specific neuromasts in each fish were scored based on their intensity, in a scale from 0 (no labeling) to 2 (high intensity), as described previously (Owens et al. (2009) <i>Hear. Res. </i>253: 32-41). Results were plotted as percent survival of hair cells in the cisplatin-treated fish relative to the untreated fish (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0761" num="0629">Of the ten compounds tested, only compound 4 showed significant protection of zebrafish neuromasts against cisplatin-induced hair cell loss (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-E</figref>; Table 4). Without wishing to be bound by theory, these results suggest that most of these compounds protect through molecular mechanisms that are specific and unique to mammalian cells.

Protection Against Noise- and Blast Injury-Induced Hearing Loss In Vivo in Adult Mouse Models</p><p id="p-0781" num="0648">The protective effects of the top 4 compounds, administered locally (transtympanic injection into the middle ear), will be tested against NIHL and blast injury-induced hearing loss in adult mouse models. The local delivery route was chosen for several reasons. First, it is frequently used in mammalian hearing studies, as it offers minimal invasiveness and simple procedures. In fact, drugs are commonly administered via this route by pediatricians and ENT doctors to patients of diverse ages (Banerjee and Parnes (2005) <i>Otol. Neurotol. </i>26: 878-881; Dodson et al. (2004) <i>Ear Nose Throat J. </i>83: 394-398; McCall et al. (2010) <i>Ear Hear. </i>31: 156-165; Muller and Barr-Gillespie (2015) <i>Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. </i>14: 346-365; Rauch (2004) <i>Otolaryngol. Clin. North Am. </i>37: 1061-1074). If the compounds work well in murine models when delivered in this manner, they can be directly tested for prevention of cisplatin-associated hearing loss in patients undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy in clinical trials. Second, transtympanic delivery allows the compounds to diffuse easily across the round window membrane into the endolymphatic fluid (Borkholder (2008) <i>Curr. Opin. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. </i>16: 472-477; Mizutari et al. (2013) <i>Neuron </i>77: 58-69; Swan et al. (2008) <i>Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. </i>60: 1583-1599; Tamura et al. (2005) <i>Laryngoscope </i>115: 2000-2005), such that their potency and toxicity can be directly tested in vivo with little concern about the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB). In the future oral and other routes may be considered for further characterization of in vivo properties of these compounds (e.g., solubility, permeability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicology (ADMET)).</p><p id="p-0782" num="0649">The compounds to test in this manner will be chosen on the basis of the following considerations: (1) they exhibit potent IC<sub>50 </sub>values and minimal toxicity (i.e., high LD<sub>50</sub>/IC<sub>50 </sub>values, preferably &#x3e;50-100 &#x3bc;M); (2) they target several different biological targets/pathways; and (3) they can be delivered via other routes (e.g., oral).</p><p id="p-0783" num="0650">For tests of noise injury, wild-type FVB mice will be used at age P28, when hearing has matured but long before significant age-related hearing loss (Kermany et al. (2006) <i>Hear Res. </i>220: 76-86; Maison et al. (2002) <i>J. Neurosci. </i>22: 10838-10846; Maison et al. (2007) <i>J. Neurophysiol. </i>97: 2930-2936; Zheng et al. (1999) <i>Hearing Research </i>130: 94-107). The standard noise exposure protocols (94, 100, 106, 116, and 120 dB sound pressure level (SPL) ocaave-band 8-16 kHz noise for 2 hrs) have previously been tested in various transgenic mouse strains from the FVB background (Maison et al.

These noise injury protocols led to hearing loss (ABR) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-D</figref>) similar to those previously reported in CBA/CaJ mice (Wang et al. (2002) <i>J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. </i>3: 248-268).</p><p id="p-0784" num="0651">Repeated impulses at 135-155 dB SPL can effectively recapitulate the effects of blast injury in adult mouse cochleae. Previous studies of blast injuries in animal models have demonstrated that 50-160 repeated impulses at 147-160 dB SPL impose physiological and morphological damage to the cochleae of chinchilla, sheep and pigs similar to 3-4 impulses of 14 psi blasts (194 peak dB SPL) in rats (Choi et al. (2008) <i>Free Radic. Biol. Med. </i>44: 1772-1784; Hamernik et al. (1987) <i>J. Acoust. Soc. Am. </i>81: 1118-1129; Henselman et al. (1994) <i>Hear. Res. </i>78: 1-10; Kopke et al.

More interestingly, 3-4 impulses of 14 psi blasts caused 43% OHC loss and 30-40 dB ABR threshold elevation in rats 21 days post-blast, damage that resembles that caused by 6 hrs of continuous exposure to 105 dB SPL octave-band noise centered at 4 kHz in chinchillas (Choi et al. (2008) <i>Free Radic. Biol. Med. </i>44: 1772-1784; Ewert et al. (2012) <i>Hear. Res. </i>285: 29-39; Kopke et al. (2005) <i>Acta Otolaryngol. </i>125: 235-243). Based on these results, a range of 135-155 dB SPL octave-band 8-16 kHz noise impulses of &#x2dc;10-ms duration were chosen, which can be repeated 100 times at 1-s intervals in mouse models to mimic traumatic blast injury (Choi et al. (2008) <i>Free Radic. Biol. Med. </i>44: 1772-1784; Ewert et al. (2012) <i>Hear. Res. </i>285: 29-39; Henselman et al. (1994) <i>Hear. Res. </i>78: 1-10; McFadden et al. (2000) <i>J. Acoust. Soc.

Mice exposed to noise or blast exposure will be immediately treated with the individual compounds in one ear and vehicle control (0.5% DMSO) in the other ear. DMSO or compound will be delivered locally at the highest feasible dose (which should be much higher than the IC<sub>50 </sub>in cochlear explants but not toxic by itself in vivo) by trans-tympanic injection into the adult mouse middle ear at &#x2dc;54 per ear. The ABR and Distortion Products Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) will be measured pre-noise exposure or TBI and at 1 and 2 weeks post-injection. After hearing tests by ABR and DPOAE, the mice will be cardiac-perfused for fixation and harvesting of the cochleae. The cochleae will be analyzed by using both whole-mount preparations and sections, and immunofluorescence will be used to detect HC/SC markers (i.e., phalloidin, Myo7a, Prestin, and Sox2, etc.) and synaptic markers (Ctbp2, GluR2/3 and Tuj 1) (Liu et al.

ABR/DPOAE Measurements in Adult Mice</p><p id="p-0788" num="0655">ABR measurements have been previously described in detail (Dallos et al. (2008) <i>Neuron </i>58: 333-339; Gao et al. (2007) <i>Mol.

Briefly, mice will be anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (0.5 mg/kg body weight) and placed on an electric heating pad to maintain body temperature, using a homeothermic blanket system (Harvard Apparatus Ltd). Mice that die or show signs of middle-ear dysfunction during the course of the experiment will be excluded from analysis. All recordings will be conducted in a sound booth (Industrial Acoustic Company). For acoustic stimulation and measurements two speakers (f1 and f2; EC1) and a microphone (ER-10B, Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, Ill.) are connected to a short flexible coupler tube with a tapered plastic tip that is inserted into the external auditory meatus. The microphone will be calibrated in situ, with the coupler in the measuring position. At frequencies higher than 22 kHz, the frequency responses of the measurement microphone (ER10B+) are lower than those of a reference microphone (ACO-7017; ACO Pacific, Inc., Belmont, Calif.). Therefore, DPOAE 2f1-f2 responses will be recorded at a frequency f1 range of 5454-18180 Hz, using the TDT BioSig III system (TDT). Signal duration is 83.88 ms, with a repetition rate of 11.92/s. The f1 and f2 responses are passed separately through an RX6 MultiFunction Processor (TDT) for digital/analog conversion to PAS programmable attenuators. Stimulus intensity will be reduced from 90 to 0 dB in 5 dB steps to establish thresholds and will be digitally sampled at 200 kHz and averaged from 100 discrete spectra. The signals are delivered through ED1 speaker drivers that feed into the EC1 electrostatic speakers coupled to the ear canal. The resulting ear canal sound pressure will be recorded with an ER10B+ low noise microphone (gain Ox) and probe (Etymotic) housed in the same coupler as the f1 and f2 speakers. The output of the ER10B+ amplifier is routed directly to an RX6 MultiFunction Processor (TDT) for analog/digital conversion for sampling at 200 kHz. Fast-Fourier transforms (FFT) of averaged responses will be generated by using TDT BioSigRP software on the resultant waveform (TDT). Noise floors will be determined by averaging the sound levels of 10 frequency bins above and below the 2f1-f2 frequency bin. No instrumental distortion products have been observed in evaluation of ears postmortem.</p><p id="p-0789" num="0656">b.

The sound pressure level will be measured through a &#xbc;-inch freefield microphone (ACO Pacific, Belmont, Calif.) and calibrated to a 124 dB pistonphone (Bruel and Kjaer, Denmark). Prior to experimental noise exposure, four quadrants of the chamber will be sampled with the &#xbc;-inch microphone to ensure that sound pressure varies by &#x3c;0.5 dB across the measured positions.</p><p id="p-0791" num="0658">c.

Using a 33-gauge cannula, 5 &#x3bc;L of compound or DMSO in PBS is gently injected through the tympanic membrane, followed by surgical stereomicroscopic confirmation that the solution is in the middle ear cavity. Mice are then placed in the cage on the heating pad for an additional 30 minutes.
