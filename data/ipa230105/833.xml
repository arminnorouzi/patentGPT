Accordingly, the population afflicted by diabetes and obesity, etc. due to various metabolic diseases, is growing rapidly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Diabetes is a disease with various complications and whose management requires a restricted diet that substantially lowers patient quality of life. Awareness of diabetes treatment and management is increasing, and the development of therapeutic agents for improvement or treatment of diabetes is urgent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Diabetes is categorized as &#x2018;Type I&#x2019; diabetes, which is caused by the inability to produce insulin, or as &#x2018;Type II&#x2019; diabetes, wherein insulin production is normal but insulin resistance causes reduced ability to regulate the metabolism. Type II diabetes and obesity are mutual risk factors to each other. They are causes of metabolic disease and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, a major cause of death for diabetes patients, making them both extremely dangerous diseases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, glucagon derivatives are attracting attention. Glucagon is produced by the pancreas when blood glucose levels begin to drop due to causes such as drug therapy, illness, hormones or enzyme deficiency. Glucagon signals the liver to decompose glycogen to release glucose, raising blood glucose to normal levels. In addition to its hyperglycemic effect, glucagon has been reported to suppress appetite and activate the hormone-sensitive lipases of adipose cells to promote fat decomposition and exhibit an anti-obesity effect. One derivative of glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is a substance under development as a therapeutic agent reducing hyperglycemia in diabetes patients and whose functions include promoting insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, suppressing gastric emptying, promoting use of glucose, and inhibiting food intake.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exendin-4, made from lizard venom which has approximately 50% amino acid homology with GLP-1, is reported to also activate GLP-1 receptors to reduce hyperglycemia of diabetes patients.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, problems with peptide and protein drugs when orally administered is their decomposition due to enzyme attack, and low intestinal membrane permeability.</p><heading id="h-0005"

Peptide and protein drugs are characterized in that they are highly hydrophilic and have large molecular weights, in that they can be decomposed by low-pH gastric acid, and in that they are attacked by enzymes such as trypsin to have low absorption in the intestines. Peptide and protein drugs generally have an oral bioavailability (BA) of around 0.1%, making them difficult to use as pharmaceutical compositions. Whereas enteric coated capsuled are being used to pass [such drugs] through the stomach to overcome this problem, this technology has the problem of not being able to fundamentally improve peptide and protein absorption.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, the pharmaceutically active substance bonded to a biotin moiety according to one embodiment of the present invention, having improved intestinal membrane permeability, may have improved absorption in the intestines.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">More specifically, the physiologically active substance bonded to a biotin moiety according to one embodiment of the present invention, by being bonded to biotin, a type of water-soluble vitamin B7, may be absorbed by active transport through a sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present invention, &#x201c;unsubstituted or substituted&#x201d; means [something] may be unsubstituted or may be substituted. &#x201c;Substituted&#x201d; means having one or more substituents, and a substituent refers to a chemical portion covalently bonded or fused to an arbitrary atom in a parent group such as an alkylene or heteroalkylene.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the present invention, &#x201c;halo&#x201d; means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, etc.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present invention, &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; means a monovalent portion obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom of an aliphatic or alicyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon compound, examples of which include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, isopentyl and neopentyl.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present invention, &#x201c;heteroalkyl&#x201d; is an alkyl including at least one heteroatom, and a heteroatom means an alkyl wherein a heteroatom is located in the position of an arbitrary carbon atom in an alkyl, substituting C, CH, CH<sub>2 </sub>or CH<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present invention, &#x201c;alkylene&#x201d; refers to a bivalent portion obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom of an aliphatic or alicyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon compound.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present invention, &#x201c;heteroalkylene&#x201d; refers to an alkylene including at least one heteroatom.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the present invention, &#x201c;aryl&#x201d; refers to a monovalent portion obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from the aromatic ring atoms of an aromatic compound having ring atoms.

Organic solvent and TFA were evaporated under vacuum from the collected peaks, followed by concentration and purification using an ultracentrifugal filter having an appropriate molecular weight cutoff. The purity of the purified substances was confirmed using HPLC analysis. At a constant temperature near room temperature, analysis was carried out using a Gemini C18 column (4.6&#xd7;250 mm, 5 &#x3bc;m; Phenomenex, Calif., USA). Analysis was carried out at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using a mobile phase comprised of trifluoroacetic acid test solution: acetonitrile mixture. (with a mix ratio of 70:30, then 50:50 20 minutes later).
