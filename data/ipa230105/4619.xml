It should be understood that the terms so used may be interchangeable where appropriate, such that embodiments of the present disclosure described herein may be implemented in a sequence other than those illustrated or described herein. The embodiments described in the following illustrative examples are not intended to represent all embodiments consistent with the present disclosure. On the contrary, they are merely examples of apparatus and methods consistent with some aspects of the present disclosure as recited in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In technical solutions provided by some embodiments of the present disclosure, once a first client receives a first page display instruction, it displays a pre-stored reference page. In this way, the first client will not display a blank page on a screen. The first client triggers a webpage control to perform page view rendering to acquire a first page frame view. In response to receiving a page acquisition request, a first page content is sent to the webpage control. A first page view is acquired by the webpage control through integration according to the first page frame view and the first page content. The first client withdraws the reference page and displays the first page view once information that the page rendering is finished sent by the webpage control is received by the first client. In the above-mentioned technical solutions, the reference page stored in the first client is displayed without loading the reference page, which avoids the blank page on the screen, and ensure the continuity of the page display.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The page display control method provided in the present disclosure may be applied in an application environment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The application environment includes a first client <b>101</b> and a webpage control <b>102</b>. The first client <b>101</b> is communicated with the webpage control <b>102</b> through a network. The first client <b>101</b> may be, but is not limited to, various terminals. Further, the first client <b>101</b> may refer to an application program installed in the above-mentioned terminal devices. The webpage control <b>102</b> may be implemented by a terminal device or a server, or may be a browser or a webpage container provided on the terminal device or the server, and it may process webpage information and control the output and display of the webpage. The terminal device may be a personal computer, a laptop, a smartphone, a tablet and a portable wearable device. The server may be implemented by an independent server or a server cluster composed of multiple servers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart of a page display control method according to an embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the page display control method is applied to a first client. The page display control method includes the following operations.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In S<b>201</b>, a first page display instruction is received.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In S<b>202</b>, a reference page stored in the first client is displayed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first page display instruction may be an instruction for triggering the display of the first page, and contain an identification parameter of the first page, which allows the first client to know which page is currently targeted upon receiving the first page display instruction. The first page display instruction may be a click triggering instruction received by an interface of the first client. For example, a link address of the first page is displayed on the interface of the first client, a user clicks the link address, and the webpage control receives click information, that is, receives the first page display instruction. The first page may be a page corresponding to a webpage in a format such as hypertext markup language (HTML). Specifically, the first page may be a page corresponding to HTML5. In some embodiments, the first page may be referred to as a general page.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The reference page may be a preset dynamic page, static page, a picture and so on. In a case where the reference page is the dynamic page, it may be called as a loading animation, and having various contents, which are not limited by the present disclosure. Further, the reference page may be in a graphics interchange format (GIF). Further, the reference page may be a native animation in the first client, that is, stored in an internal storage of the first client.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the first page display instruction may be sent to the first client by the webpage control once the webpage control receives the triggering information that the user triggers the first page.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In S<b>203</b>, a first page content is sent to the webpage control in response to receiving a page acquisition request sent by the webpage control. The first page content represents a webpage interactive content that is interactive with the first client in the first page. A first page view is acquired by the webpage control through integration according to the first page frame view and the first page content, and information that page rendering is finished is returned by the webpage control.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the first page view may be simply referred to as a first page.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The page acquisition request may be sent by the webpage control after acquiring the first page frame view, or may be sent by the webpage control in a case where a page rendering instruction is received and it is determined that the first page content is not stored in the webpage control.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first page content may refer to the webpage interactive content uploaded by the user to a server-side, and the server-side may be a server for publishing and maintaining a first webpage and a second webpage. The webpage interactive content may be an article, a picture, a video, a post, a microblog comment and other media information. In addition, the first page content may also refer to information uploaded by a web developer to the server through the client, which may be a company profile, product information for sale, and the like. After displaying the first page view on the interface of the first client, an interactive operation of the above-mentioned webpage interactive content may be triggered through clicking on a display screen by the user. For example, the user clicks a video icon to play the video, or the user clicks a comment box below a microblog to enter a comment. In some embodiments, the first client may also acquire the first page content through a way other than the server, for example, directly acquire the pre-stored first page content from the internal storage.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first page view may refer to a view that needs to be displayed in response to displaying the first page, which may be a picture, an animation or a video. In this operation, the first page frame view and the first page content are integrated by the webpage control to acquire the first page view, and the information that the page rendering is finished is generated after acquiring the first page view and this information is returned to the first client. The information that the page rendering is finished may include the first page view. The webpage control may also return the information that the page rendering is finished to the first client first, and then return the first page view to the first client.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, the webpage control may send the information that the page rendering is finished to the first client in response to a preset page hiding instruction being triggered. Alternatively, the webpage control may directly return the information that the page rendering is finished to the first client once acquiring the first page view.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In S<b>204</b>, the reference page is hidden and the first page view is displayed in response to receiving the information that the page rendering is finished.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this operation, after receiving the first page view by the first client, the currently displayed reference page is directly hidden and the first page view is displayed. The client may also hide the reference page and display the first page view under the condition that the preset page hiding instruction is triggered. In some embodiments, the first client may first receive the information that the page rendering is finished sent by the webpage control to remove the reference page accordingly, and then receive the first page view sent by the webpage control and display the first page view.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, the first client does not need to hide or withdraw the reference page, it may directly overlay the first page view above the reference page, such that the first page view is finally displayed by the first client to the user.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Before displaying a page, the webpage control needs to perform preprocesses, such as loading a page file and rendering the page. In a traditional page display process, during these preprocesses, the first client interface is in a blank screen state, resulting in a discontinuous display of the webpage and a poor user experience. In the page display control method of the above-mentioned embodiments, the first client may display the reference page in response to receiving the first page display instruction, such that the webpage control may display the corresponding reference page on the first client during the preprocess of the first webpage. In addition, the reference page is pre-stored in the first client and does not need to be loaded, in this way the reference page can be displayed immediately, thereby ensuring the continuity of the page display and avoiding psychological pressure on the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, in a case where codes need to be updated, the codes may be updated at any time without a review process of an application store, and thus may be launched in a short time, which improves an update efficiency of the codes in the case the codes need to be updated, and ensures the continuity of the page display. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, it does not need to acquire the reference page from an APP package file, and thus an acquisition speed is fast and the reference page can be quickly displayed, which greatly shortens a display time of the blank page on the screen and further ensures the continuity of the page display.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, acquiring the first page view through the integration according to the first page frame view and the first page content may be implemented in at least the following ways:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000">1. the first page content is filled into a webpage frame corresponding to the first page frame view;<br/>2. in a case where the first page content is in a form of a page view, the first page content may be directly overlaid on the first page frame view.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Further, in a case where the page content fits in the webpage frame, the operation of returning the first page content to the webpage control to trigger the webpage control to acquire the first page view through the integration according to the first page frame view and the first page content includes: returning the first page content to the webpage control to trigger the webpage control to fill the first page content into the webpage frame of the first page frame view to acquire the first page view.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a left sub-diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a first page frame view, which presents positions, area sizes, colors corresponding to different page contents, such as a title cover, a user avatar, user personal information, a published content on an interface. For example, a background element color corresponding to a webpage element of the user personal information is gray. A right sub-diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a first page view acquired after filling the first page content to the first page frame view. As shown in the right sub-diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each position in the webpage frame is filled with the corresponding page content. The user may perform an interactive operation by clicking on the display screen of the first client, such as clicking an icon corresponding to &#x201c;Video <b>1</b>&#x201d;, to enable the first client to play a content of Video <b>1</b> on the interface.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">In some embodiments, in a case where there is a sub-page (i.e., a second page) corresponding to the first page, a second page view of the second page may be preloaded during the display of the first page view. That is, the second page view is loaded before a second page display instruction is received, and thus the second page view may be immediately sent to the first client in response to receiving the second page display instruction.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Further, after it is determined that the first page has been displayed in the first client, the first client may control the webpage control to load relevant information of the second page. For example, a process of acquiring, parsing and rendering a second description file of second rendering information is completed, that is, visual codes of the second page is loaded, and the second page view is acquired. In responding to that the second page display instruction is received, the second page view is sent to the first client, and the first client is controlled to display the second page view, thereby switching the first page view to the second page view in the first client.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In addition, in some embodiments, it is also possible to preload a part of information of the second page, such as a second page frame view. In response to receiving the second page display instruction, a complete second page view is loaded according to the preloaded part of information, and the second page view is sent to the first client. Further, after hiding the reference page and displaying the first page view in response to receiving the information that the page rendering is finished sent by the webpage control, the page display control method further includes: trigging the webpage control to acquire the second description file of second rendering information corresponding to the second page based on the presence of the second page corresponding to the first page, parsing the second description file to acquire second page rendering information, performing page view rendering according to the second page rendering information to acquire the second page frame view, acquiring a second page content from the server in response to receiving the second page display instruction, triggering the webpage control to acquire the second page view by integration according to the second page frame view and the second page content, and displaying the second page view. The second page is a sub-page of the first page, and the second page frame view represents a webpage frame of the second page. The second page content represents a webpage interactive content that is interactive with the first client in the second page. The second page display instruction is generated once the second page is triggered. In some embodiments, the second page view may also be referred to as a second page.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The second page is the sub-page of the first page, and thus the second page may be referred to as a specific page. In this case, the second page may also have a corresponding specific page, and the specific page of the second page may have its own specific pages, and so on. In addition, the number of the second pages (including the sub-pages of the second page) may be one, two, or even more. Further, the second page may also be a page corresponding to HTML webpage, such as a page corresponding to HTML5.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The second page display instruction may refer to an instruction for triggering the display of the second page. In some embodiments, the second page display instruction may be sent to the first client by the webpage control upon receiving trigger information that the user triggers the second page.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The second page frame view is generated during the first client displaying the first page view. Further, during displaying the first page, the webpage control is triggered by the first client to perform the page rendering to acquire the second page frame view, and is triggered to generate the second page view according to the second page content once the second page display instruction is received.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there are two sub-pages (i.e., Page A and Page B) corresponding to a general page.
