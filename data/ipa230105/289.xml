A drivetrain couples the motor to the mixer shaft such that the mixer shaft is rotatable by the motor. A single stage planetary gear set of the drivetrain includes a sun gear connected to a rotor of the motor. The single stage planetary gear set also includes a plurality of stepped planetary gears. Each of the stepped planetary gears includes a first tooth section and a second tooth section. A first ring gear is mounted to the head such that the first ring gear is fixed relative to the head. The first ring gear and the sun gear are meshed with the stepped planetary gears at the first tooth section. A second ring gear is meshed with the stepped planetary gears at the second tooth section.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another example aspect, a drivetrain for coupling a motor to a mixer shaft within a mixer includes a sun gear connectable to a rotor of the motor.

In at least some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value. For example, the approximating language may refer to being within a ten percent (10%) margin.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> provides a side, elevation view of a stand mixer <b>100</b> according to an example embodiment of the present subject matter. It will be understood that stand mixer <b>100</b> is provided by way of example only and that the present subject matter may be used in or with any suitable stand mixer in alternative example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Stand mixer <b>100</b> includes a head <b>102</b> and a base <b>104</b>. Head <b>102</b> houses various mechanical and/or electrical components of stand mixer <b>100</b> and thus may also be referred to herein as a casing. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a motor <b>112</b>, a planetary gear set <b>114</b>, and a bevel gear set <b>116</b> may be disposed within head <b>102</b>. Base <b>104</b> may support head <b>102</b>. For example, head <b>102</b> may be pivotally mounted to base <b>104</b> on a post <b>106</b>, e.g., that extends upwardly. Head <b>102</b> may be suspended over a mixing zone <b>105</b>, within which a mixing bowl may be disposed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A drivetrain <b>110</b> is disposed within head <b>102</b> and is configured for coupling a motor <b>112</b> to a mixer shaft <b>109</b>, e.g., such that mixer shaft <b>109</b> is rotatable with motor <b>112</b> via drivetrain <b>110</b>. Drivetrain <b>110</b> may include planetary gear set <b>114</b>, bevel gear set <b>116</b>, etc. Mixer shaft <b>109</b> may be positioned above mixing zone <b>105</b> on head <b>102</b>, and an attachment <b>108</b>, such as a beater, whisk, or hook, may be removably mounted to mixer shaft <b>109</b>. Attachment <b>108</b> may rotate within a bowl (not shown) in mixing zone <b>105</b> to beat, whisk, kneed, etc. material within the bowl, during operation of motor <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As noted above, motor <b>112</b> may be operable to rotate mixer shaft <b>109</b>. Motor <b>112</b> may be a direct current (DC) motor in certain example embodiments. In alternative example embodiments, motor <b>112</b> may be an alternating current (AC) motor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, motor <b>112</b> may include a rotor <b>113</b> and a stator <b>115</b>. Stator <b>115</b> may be mounted within head <b>102</b> such that stator <b>115</b> is fixed relative to head <b>102</b>. A current through windings within stator <b>115</b> may generate a magnetic field that induces rotation of rotor <b>113</b>, e.g., due to magnets on stator <b>115</b>. Stator <b>115</b> may rotate at a relatively high rotational velocity and relatively low torque. Thus, drivetrain <b>110</b> may be configured to provide a rotational speed reduction and mechanical advantage between motor <b>112</b> and mixer shaft <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Planetary gear set <b>114</b> may include a sun gear <b>130</b>, a plurality of stepped planetary gears <b>150</b>, a first ring gear <b>160</b>, and a second ring gear <b>170</b>. Sun gear <b>130</b>, stepped planetary gears <b>150</b>, first ring gear <b>160</b>, and second ring gear <b>170</b> may collectively form a single stage planetary gear set, e.g., such that planetary gear set <b>114</b> has a single input and a single output. Planetary gear set <b>114</b> may provide a suitable mechanical advantage. For instance, a gear ratio of planetary gear set <b>114</b> may be between 35:1 and 80:1. As another example, the gear ratio of planetary gear set <b>114</b> may be between 50:1 and 60:1. Such gear ratios may advantageously allow motor <b>112</b> to rotate attachment <b>108</b> at suitable speeds and with suitable torques.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Sun gear <b>130</b> may be connected to rotor <b>113</b> of motor <b>112</b>. For instance, an input shaft <b>120</b> of drivetrain <b>110</b> may extend between and connect rotor <b>113</b> and sun gear <b>130</b>. In alternative example embodiments, one or more additional shafts may be disposed in the power flow between motor <b>112</b> and sun gear <b>130</b>. Due to input shaft <b>120</b> being connected to sun gear <b>130</b>, sun gear <b>130</b> may correspond to an input for planetary gear set <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each of stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> may include a first tooth section <b>152</b> and a second tooth section <b>154</b>. An outside diameter D<b>1</b> of first tooth section <b>152</b> may be greater than an outside diameter D<b>2</b> of second tooth section <b>154</b>. Moreover, first tooth section <b>152</b> and second tooth section <b>154</b> may each include a different number of teeth. For instance, first tooth section <b>152</b> may have more teeth than second tooth section <b>154</b> in certain example embodiments. Thus, stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> may also be referred to compound planetary gears. To engage with stepped planetary gears <b>150</b>, first and second ring gears <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> may have different inside diameters. First and second tooth sections <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> may be spaced axially, e.g., along an axis of rotation, on stepped planetary gears <b>150</b>. First and second tooth sections <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> of each stepped planetary gear <b>150</b> may be fixed and not rotatable relative to each other. Stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> may be meshed with both first and second ring gears <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> at a respective one of first and second tooth sections <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, as discussed in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Planetary gear set <b>114</b> may also include a planet carrier <b>140</b>. Stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> may be rotatably mounted on planet carrier <b>140</b>. For example, planet carrier <b>140</b> may include a plurality of axles <b>142</b>, and each of stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> may rotatably mounted on a respective one of axles <b>142</b>. Input shaft <b>120</b> may extent through planet carrier <b>140</b>, e.g., such that planet carrier <b>140</b> is rotatably mounted on input shaft <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Sun gear <b>130</b>, stepped planetary gears <b>150</b>, first ring gear <b>160</b>, and second ring gear <b>170</b> may be formed of suitable materials, such as plastic or metal. In particular, each of stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> may be a single, unitary piece of material, such as plastic or metal. Thus, first and second tooth sections <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> may be formed of or from the single, unitary piece of material in each stepped planetary gear <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">First ring gear <b>160</b> may be fixed and non-rotatable. Thus, first ring gear <b>160</b> may be mounted to head <b>102</b> such that first ring gear <b>160</b> is fixed relative to head <b>102</b>. First ring gear <b>160</b> may be fastened, adhered, shaped, or otherwise suitably fixed to head <b>102</b>. First ring gear <b>160</b> and sun gear <b>130</b> may be meshed with stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> at first tooth section <b>152</b>. Thus, e.g., first tooth section <b>152</b> of each stepped planetary gear <b>150</b> may extend between first ring gear <b>160</b> and sun gear <b>130</b>. The external teeth of sun gear <b>130</b> may mesh with the teeth of each stepped planetary gear <b>150</b> at first tooth section <b>152</b>, and the internal teeth of first ring gear <b>160</b> may mesh with the teeth of each stepped planetary gear <b>150</b> at first tooth section <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Second ring gear <b>170</b> may be meshed with stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> at second tooth section <b>154</b>. Thus, e.g., internal teeth of second ring gear <b>170</b> may mesh with the teeth of each stepped planetary gear <b>150</b> at second tooth section <b>154</b>. Drivetrain <b>110</b> may include an output shaft <b>122</b> connected to second ring gear <b>170</b>. Moreover, output shaft <b>122</b> may extend between and connect second ring gear <b>170</b> and another component of drivetrain <b>110</b>, such as a bevel gear of bevel gear set <b>116</b>. Due to output shaft <b>122</b> being connected to second ring gear <b>170</b>, second ring gear <b>170</b> may correspond to an output for planetary gear set <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another example embodiment, e.g., when the outside diameter D<b>1</b> of first tooth section <b>152</b> is less than the outside diameter D<b>2</b> of second tooth section <b>154</b>, first ring gear <b>160</b> may be meshed with stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> at second tooth section <b>154</b>, and second ring gear <b>170</b> and sun gear <b>130</b> may be meshed with stepped planetary gears <b>150</b> at first tooth section <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Bevel gear set <b>116</b> may include bevel gears (not shown) that changes a rotational axis of power flow within drivetrain <b>110</b>.

A second bevel gear of bevel gear set <b>116</b> may be meshed with the first bevel gear of bevel gear set <b>116</b>, and the second bevel gear of bevel gear set <b>116</b> may rotate about a second axis X<b>2</b>.
