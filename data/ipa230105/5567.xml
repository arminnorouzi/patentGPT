It also includes modifications, such as by methylation and/or by capping, and unmodified forms of the polynucleotide. There is no intended distinction in length between the terms &#x201c;nucleic acid,&#x201d; &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule,&#x201d; &#x201c;polynucleotide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; and these terms will be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;target nucleic acid region&#x201d; or &#x201c;target nucleic acid&#x201d; denotes a nucleic acid molecule with a &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; to be amplified. The target nucleic acid may be either single-stranded or double-stranded and may include other sequences besides the target sequence, which may not be amplified. The term &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; refers to the particular nucleotide sequence of the target nucleic acid which is to be amplified. The target sequence may include a probe-hybridizing region contained within the target molecule with which a probe will form a stable hybrid under desired conditions. The &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; may also include the complexing sequences to which the oligonucleotide primers complex and are extended using the target sequence as a template. Where the target nucleic acid is originally single-stranded, the term &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; also refers to the sequence complementary to the &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; as present in the target nucleic acid. If the &#x201c;target nucleic acid&#x201d; is originally double-stranded, the term &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; refers to both the plus (+) and minus (&#x2212;) strands (or sense and anti-sense strands).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0037">The term &#x201c;primer&#x201d; or &#x201c;oligonucleotide primer&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to the template strand of a nucleic acid and initiates synthesis of a nucleic acid strand complementary to the template strand when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product is induced, i.e., in the presence of nucleotides and a polymerization-inducing agent such as a DNA or RNA polymerase and at suitable temperature, pH, metal concentration, and salt concentration. The primer is preferably single-stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification, but may alternatively be double-stranded. If double-stranded, the primer can first be treated to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. This denaturation step is typically effected by heat, but may alternatively be carried out using alkali, followed by neutralization. Thus, a &#x201c;primer&#x201d; is complementary to a template, and complexes by hydrogen bonding or hybridization with the template to give a primer/template complex for initiation of synthesis by a polymerase, which is extended by the addition of covalently bonded bases linked at its 3&#x2032; end complementary to the template in the process of DNA or RNA synthesis. Typically, nucleic acids are amplified using at least one set of oligonucleotide primers comprising at least one forward primer and at least one reverse primer capable of hybridizing to regions of a nucleic acid flanking the portion of the nucleic acid to be amplified.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0038">The term &#x201c;amplicon&#x201d; refers to the amplified nucleic acid product of a PCR reaction or other nucleic acid amplification process (e.g., ligase chain reaction (LGR), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), Q-beta amplification, strand displacement amplification, or target mediated amplification). DNA amplicons may be generated from RNA by RT-PCR.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;probe&#x201d; or &#x201c;oligonucleotide probe&#x201d; refers to a polynucleotide, as defined above, that contains a nucleic acid sequence complementary to a nucleic acid sequence present in the target nucleic acid analyte. The polynucleotide regions of probes may be composed of DNA, and/or RNA, and/or synthetic nucleotide analogs. Probes may be labeled in order to detect the target sequence. Such a label may be present at the 5&#x2032; end, at the 3&#x2032; end, at both the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends, and/or internally. The &#x201c;oligonucleotide probe&#x201d; may contain at least one fluorescer and at least one quencher. Quenching of fluorophore fluorescence may be eliminated by exonuclease cleavage of the fluorophore from the oligonucleotide (e.g., TaqMan assay) or by hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe to the nucleic acid target sequence (e.g., molecular beacons). Additionally, the oligonucleotide probe will typically be derived from a sequence that lies between the sense and the antisense primers when used for nucleic acid amplification.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0040">It will be appreciated that the hybridizing sequences need not have perfect complementarity to provide stable hybrids. In many situations, stable hybrids will form where fewer than about 10% of the bases are mismatches, ignoring loops of four or more nucleotides. Accordingly, as used herein the term &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; refers to an oligonucleotide that forms a stable duplex with its &#x201c;complement&#x201d; under conditions, generally where there is about 90% or greater homology.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0041">The terms &#x201c;hybridize&#x201d; and &#x201c;hybridization&#x201d; refer to the formation of complexes between nucleotide sequences which are sufficiently complementary to form complexes via Watson-Crick base pairing. Where a primer &#x201c;hybridizes&#x201d; with target (template), such complexes (or hybrids) are sufficiently stable to serve the priming function required by, e.g., the DNA polymerase to initiate DNA synthesis.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0042">The &#x201c;melting temperature&#x201d; or &#x201c;T<sub>m</sub>&#x201d; of double-stranded DNA is defined as the temperature at which half of the helical structure of the DNA is lost due to heating or other dissociation of the hydrogen bonding between base pairs, for example, by acid or alkali treatment, or the like. The T<sub>m </sub>of a DNA molecule depends on its length and on its base composition. DNA molecules rich in GC base pairs have a higher T<sub>m </sub>than those having an abundance of AT base pairs. Separated complementary strands of DNA spontaneously reassociate or anneal to form duplex DNA when the temperature is lowered below the T<sub>m</sub>. The highest rate of nucleic acid hybridization occurs approximately 25 degrees C. below the T<sub>m</sub>. The T. may be estimated using the following relationship: T<sub>m</sub>=69.3+0.41(GC) % (Marmur et al. (1962) <i>J Mol.

The method typically comprises first acquiring amplicon coverage data for target nucleic acids of interest. Next, the ratio of amplicon coverage between a test genomic region and a reference genomic region for each target nucleic acid is calculated. Outliers are removed followed by data normalization. The ratio of amplicon coverage between the test genomic region and the reference genomic region for each target nucleic acid is normalized according to the formula:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>normalized</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mi>ratio</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <mi>original</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mi>ratio</mi>    </mrow>    <mrow>     <mi>median</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>original</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mtext>   </mtext>       <mi>ratio</mi>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mfrac>   <mo>.</mo>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0054" num="0046">In order to correct amplification bias, various parameters that may contribute to amplification bias are evaluated by analyzing sequence differences between the test and reference genomic regions.

Sources of nucleic acid molecules include, but are not limited to, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. For example, a biological sample containing nucleic acids to be analyzed can be any sample of cells, tissue, or fluid isolated from a prokaryotic, archaeon, or eukaryotic organism, including but not limited to, for example, blood, saliva, cells from buccal swabbing, fecal matter, urine, bone marrow, bile, spinal fluid, lymph fluid, sputum, ascites, bronchial lavage fluid, synovial fluid, samples of the skin, external secretions of the skin, respiratory, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, tears, saliva, milk, organs, biopsies, and also samples of cells, including cells from bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, plants, and animals as well as in vitro cell culture constituents, including recombinant cells and tissues grown in culture medium. A biological sample may also contain nucleic acids from viruses. In certain embodiments, nucleic acids (e.g., DNA or RNA) are obtained from a single cell or a selected population of cells of interest. The cell may be a live cell or a fixed cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is an invertebrate cell, vertebrate cell, yeast cell, mammalian cell, rodent cell, primate cell, or human cell. Additionally, the cell may be a genetically aberrant cell, rare blood cell, or cancerous cell. The target nucleic acids may be from a fetus, a child, or an adult.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0049">Cells may be pre-treated in any number of ways prior to amplification and sequencing of nucleic acids (e.g., DNA and/or RNA). For instance, in certain embodiments, the cell may be treated to disrupt (or lyse) the cell membrane, for example, by treating samples with one or more detergents (e.g., Triton-X-100, Tween 20, Igepal CA-630, NP-40, Brij 35, and sodium dodecyl sulfate) and/or denaturing agents (e.g., guanidinium agents). In cell types with cell walls, such as yeast and plants, initial removal of the cell wall may be necessary to facilitate cell lysis. Cell walls can be removed, for example, using enzymes, such as cellulases, chitinases, or bacteriolytic enzymes, such as lysozyme (destroys peptidoglycans), mannase, and glycanase. As will be clear to one of skill in the art, the selection of a particular enzyme for cell wall removal will depend on the cell type under study.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0050">After lysing, nucleic acid extraction from cells may be performed using conventional techniques, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, precipitation with alcohol, or non-specific binding to a solid phase (e.g., silica). Care should be taken to avoid shearing the nucleic acids to be sequenced during extraction steps. Additionally, enzymatic or chemical methods may be used to remove contaminating cellular components (e.g., ribosomal RNA, mitochondrial RNA, protein, or other macromolecules). For example, proteases can be used to remove contaminating proteins. A nuclease inhibitor may be used to prevent degradation of nucleic acids.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0051">DNA may be amplified prior to sequencing using any suitable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique known in the art. In PCR, a pair of primers is employed in excess to hybridize to the complementary strands of a target nucleic acid. The primers are each extended by a polymerase using the target nucleic acid as a template. The extension products become target sequences themselves after dissociation from the original target strand. New primers are then hybridized and extended by a polymerase, and the cycle is repeated to geometrically increase the number of target sequence molecules. The PCR method for amplifying target nucleic acid sequences in a sample is well known in the art and has been described in, e.g., Innis et al. (eds.) PCR Protocols (Academic Press, NY 1990); Taylor (1991) <i>Polymerase chain reaction: basic principles and automation, in PCR: A Practical Approach, </i>McPherson et al. (eds.) IRL Press, Oxford; Saiki et al. (1986) <i>Nature </i>324:163; as well as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202 and 4,889,818, all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0052">In particular, PCR uses relatively short oligonucleotide primers which flank the target nucleotide sequence to be amplified, oriented such that their 3&#x2032; ends face each other, each primer extending toward the other. Typically, the primer oligonucleotides are in the range of between 10-100 nucleotides in length, such as 15-60, 20-40 and so on, more typically in the range of between 20-40 nucleotides long, and any length between the stated ranges.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0053">The DNA is extracted and denatured, preferably by heat, and hybridized with first and second primers that are present in molar excess. Polymerization is catalyzed in the presence of the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs&#x2014;dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP) using a primer- and template-dependent polynucleotide polymerizing agent, such as any enzyme capable of producing primer extension products, for example, <i>E. coli </i>DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, T4 DNA polymerase, thermostable DNA polymerases isolated from <i>Thermus aquaticus </i>(Taq), available from a variety of sources (for example, Perkin Elmer), <i>Thermus thermophilus </i>(United States Biochemicals), <i>Bacillus stereothermophilus </i>(Bio-Rad), or <i>Thermococcus litoralis </i>(&#x201c;Vent&#x201d; polymerase, New England Biolabs). This results in two &#x201c;long products&#x201d; which contain the respective primers at their 5&#x2032; ends covalently linked to the newly synthesized complements of the original strands. The reaction mixture is then returned to polymerizing conditions, e.g., by lowering the temperature, inactivating a denaturing agent, or adding more polymerase, and a second cycle is initiated. The second cycle provides the two original strands, the two long products from the first cycle, two new long products replicated from the original strands, and two &#x201c;short products&#x201d; replicated from the long products. The short products have the sequence of the target sequence with a primer at each end. On each additional cycle, an additional two long products are produced, and a number of short products equal to the number of long and short products remaining at the end of the previous cycle. Thus, the number of short products containing the target sequence grows exponentially with each cycle. Preferably, PCR is carried out with a commercially available thermal cycler (available from, e.g., Bio-Rad, Applied Biosystems, and Qiagen).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0054">RNA may be amplified by reverse transcribing RNA into cDNA with a reverse transcriptase and then performing PCR (i.e., RT-PCR), as described above. Suitable reverse transcriptases include avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (available from, e.g., Promega, New England Biolabs, and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Alternatively, a single enzyme may be used for both steps as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,770, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this manner, cDNA can be generated from all types of RNA, including mRNA, non-coding RNA, microRNA, siRNA, and viral RNA to allow sequencing of RNA transcripts.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0055">In certain embodiments, amplification comprises performing a clonal amplification method, such as, but not limited to bridge amplification, emulsion PCR (ePCR), or rolling circle amplification. In particular, clonal amplification methods such as, but not limited to bridge amplification, emulsion PCR (ePCR), or rolling circle amplification may be used to cluster amplified nucleic acids in a discrete area (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,790,418; 5,641,658; 7,264,934; 7,323,305; 8,293,502; 6,287,824; and International Application WO 1998/044151 A1; Lizardi et al. (1998) Nature Genetics 19: 225-232; Leamon et al.

Biotechnol. 102: 117-124; herein incorporated by reference). For this purpose, adapter sequences (e.g., adapters with sequences complementary to universal amplification primers or bridge PCR amplification primers) suitable for high-throughput amplification may be added to DNA or cDNA fragments at the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032;ends. For example, bridge PCR primers, attached to a solid support, can be used to capture DNA templates comprising adapter sequences complementary to the bridge PCR primers. The DNA templates can then be amplified, wherein the amplified products of each DNA template cluster in a discrete area on the solid support.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0056">In particular, the methods of the invention are applicable to digital PCR methods. For digital PCR, a sample containing nucleic acids is separated into a large number of partitions before performing PCR. Partitioning can be achieved in a variety of ways known in the art, for example, by use of micro well plates, capillaries, emulsions, arrays of miniaturized chambers or nucleic acid binding surfaces. Separation of the sample may involve distributing any suitable portion including up to the entire sample among the partitions. Each partition includes a fluid volume that is isolated from the fluid volumes of other partitions. The partitions may be isolated from one another by a fluid phase, such as a continuous phase of an emulsion, by a solid phase, such as at least one wall of a container, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the partitions may comprise droplets disposed in a continuous phase, such that the droplets and the continuous phase collectively form an emulsion.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0057">The partitions may be formed by any suitable procedure, in any suitable manner, and with any suitable properties. For example, the partitions may be formed with a fluid dispenser, such as a pipette, with a droplet generator, by agitation of the sample (e.g., shaking, stirring, sonication, etc.), and the like. Accordingly, the partitions may be formed serially, in parallel, or in batch. The partitions may have any suitable volume or volumes. The partitions may be of substantially uniform volume or may have different volumes. Exemplary partitions having substantially the same volume are monodisperse droplets. Exemplary volumes for the partitions include an average volume of less than about 100, 10 or 1 &#x3bc;L, less than about 100, 10, or 1 nL, or less than about 100, 10, or 1 pL, among others.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0058">After separation of the sample, PCR is carried out in the partitions. The partitions, when formed, may be competent for performance of one or more reactions in the partitions. Alternatively, one or more reagents may be added to the partitions after they are formed to render them competent for reaction. The reagents may be added by any suitable mechanism, such as a fluid dispenser, fusion of droplets, or the like.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0059">After PCR amplification, nucleic acids are quantified by counting the partitions that contain PCR amplicons. Partitioning of the sample allows quantification of the number of different molecules by assuming that the population of molecules follows a Poisson distribution.

Correction of amplification bias in sequencing data, as described herein, makes possible more accurate detection of even minor copy number variation. In particular, the methods will find use in non-invasive prenatal testing to detect fetal chromosomal aneuploidy or copy number variation. A biological sample can be collected from the mother or potential mother of an offspring prior to conception or after conception and analyzed. Detection of aneuploidy or copy number variation, as described herein, may indicate an increased risk of the offspring developing abnormally or having a disease (e.g., Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18), or Patau Syndrome (Trisomy 13)). The offspring may be, for example, a neonate or a fetus. In particular, this method can be used to evaluate a mother or potential mother potentially at high risk of having a child with a disease associated with aneuploidy or copy number variation, such as a mother or potential mother who has had a previous child with such a disease or a familial history of the disease, or a history of miscarriages.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0070">The methods of the invention will also find use in genetic testing of cancerous cells. Aneuploidy and copy number variation are commonly associated with many types of cancer. Hence, genetic testing of cancerous cells or abnormal potentially precancerous cells may be useful for diagnosing a patient with a particular type of cancer or precancerous condition and determining an appropriate treatment regimen.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0071">For genetic testing, a biological sample containing nucleic acids is collected from an individual. The biological sample is typically blood, saliva, or cells from buccal swabbing or a biopsy, but can be any sample from bodily fluids, tissue, or cells that contains genomic DNA or RNA of the individual. For prenatal testing of a fetus, the biological sample can be, for example, amniotic fluid (e.g., amniocentesis), placental tissue (e.g., chorionic villus sampling), or fetal blood (e.g., umbilical cord blood sampling). In particular, non-invasive cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood or nucleic acids extracted from fetal cells in maternal blood (FCMB) can be used in genetic screening. The methods of the invention are also applicable to genetic screening of embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF). For example, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be performed using the methods described herein to correct amplification bias in order to improve detection of aneuploidy and/or copy number variation in embryos prior to transfer to a mother. In certain embodiments, nucleic acids from the biological sample are isolated and/or purified prior to amplification, sequencing, and analysis using methods well-known in the art. See, e.g., Green and Sambrook <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual </i>(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 4<sup>th </sup>edition, 2012); and <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology </i>(Ausubel ed., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1995); herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0072">Copy number variation can be evaluated based on &#x201c;relative copy number&#x201d; so that apparent differences in gene copy numbers in different samples are not distorted by differences in sample amounts. The relative copy number of a gene (per genome) can be expressed as the ratio of the copy number of a target gene to the copy number of a reference polynucleotide sequence in a DNA sample. The reference polynucleotide sequence can be a sequence having a known genomic copy number. Typically, the reference sequence will have a single genomic copy and is a sequence that is not likely to be amplified or deleted in the genome. It is not necessary to empirically determine the copy number of a reference sequence. Rather, the copy number may be assumed based on the normal copy number in the organism of interest. Accordingly, the relative copy number of the target nucleotide sequence in a DNA sample is calculated from the ratio of the two genes. wherein detection of copy number variation, that is, the presence of a greater or fewer number of a gene (i.e., abnormal copy number) in the subject compared to a control subject (e.g., normal, healthy subject) is diagnostic of a disease.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">System and Computerized Methods for Correcting Amplification Bias</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0073">In a further aspect, the invention includes a computer implemented method for correcting amplification bias.

The color of each data point depends on the loci in the test region of the corresponding T/R pair: light gray represents chromosome 13; medium gray represents chromosome 18; and dark gray represents chromosome 21. Adding the regression line (the gray line), as calculated according to step 6 of Example 1, demonstrates the correlation between amplicon GC content and normalized loci coverage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (at right) is similar except for using the residual c as the Y-axis. Diff<sub>amplicon GC </sub>is not correlated to the residual c, which indicates that the PCR-bias resulting from the difference of amplicon GC content was suppressed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows a boxplot instead to illustrate the effectiveness of PCR-bias correction in a more intuitive way. Each box represents a chromosome, under ideal conditions, the median of a box should be zero. However, because of the existence of PCR-bias, the box representing chromosome 21 goes down before correction, which may lead to wrong identification. After PCR-bias correction, the box representing chromosome 21 goes up, demonstrating that the correction was effective.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0099">Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those shown and described herein, will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description.
