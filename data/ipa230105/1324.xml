Typically the upright wall of the crystallizing vessel is cooled. An example of a material that is crystallized is para-xylene, a compound used for the production of PET. After discharge from the crystallizing vessel the crystals will be separated from the mother liquor, the latter containing impurities.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0010">In a crystallizing vessel it is important that fresh liquid to be subjected to crystallisation reaches the inner surface of the upright wall.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0011">The object of the present invention is provide a method and a crystallisation vessel for allowing improved liquid flow in the lumen.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0012">To this end, a method according to the preamble is characterized in that a plurality of arms of the rotor arms are hollow arms, each arm of the plurality of arms comprising an inlet opening that is relatively close to the shaft and an outlet opening that is relatively far from the shaft.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0013">It has been found that rotating such an arm in the liquid subjected to crystallisation causes liquid to flow from the centreline of the lumen towards the upright wall. This allows the crystallisation process to be performed quicker (larger through-put) and/or allows for a smaller crystallisation vessel for the same through-put (saving cost).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0014">More specifically, cooling the upright wall results in crystallisation at the surface and a relatively cold solvent that contains a reduced concentration (in moles per litre) of the compound that is crystallized. By transporting liquid from the centreline to the wall, the concentration of the compound near the wall is increased, allowing new crystals to grow at the wall and crystals scraped off from the upright wall to grow.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0015">Typically the crystallisation process will be operated as a continuous process, wherein relatively warm fresh liquid to be subjected to crystallisation is added at one end of the crystallisation vessel (typically the top), and relatively cold liquid (a suspension of crystals in mother liquor) is discharged at the other end.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0016">Typically the inlet and the outlet will be at least 40% of the length of the arm apart, preferably at least 75% of the length of the arm.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0017">The surface area of the inlet opening (or in case the arm has more than one inlet opening the total surface area) is preferably at least 35% of the cross-sectional area of the cross-sectional area (in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the arm) of the lumen of the arm, and preferably at least 70%.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0018">The surface area of the outlet opening (or in case there is more than one outlet opening the total surface area) is preferably at least 35% of the cross-sectional area (in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the arm) of the lumen of the arm, and preferably at least 70%.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0019">According to a favourable embodiment, the arms have a cross-sectional surface area of the lumen in the longitudinal direction of the arm, aid cross-sectional surface having a width/height ratio of at least 1.25, preferably at least 1.5.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0020">This allows the rotor arms to move through the liquid with relative ease, as a result of which in the steady state the arms move faster than the liquid surrounding the arms while liquid inside the arms moves as fast as the arms. As a result, a centrifugal force causes the transport of the liquid to be subjected to crystallisation through the arms.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0021">In practice, at the distal ends of the arms liquid in the vessel is forced to move faster between the arms (fitted with scrapers) and the inner wall of the vessel, causing a zone of reduced pressure, facilitating the flow of liquid inside the arm to flow out.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0022">Relatively flat arms also allow for a reduction in (vertical) mixing, as it is desired to establish a flow from the upright wall towards the rotational axis and in the arm from the rotational axis to the upright wall.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">According to a favourable embodiment, the scrapers comprise a scraper profile provided with scraper blades, a scraper profile being attached to the distal ends of at least two arms, said scraper profiles having a tapered cross-section, tapering in the forward direction of the rotating arms.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">This allows the rotor arms to move through the liquid with relative ease, as a result of which in the steady state the arms move faster than the liquid surrounding the arms while liquid inside the arms moves as fast as the arms. As a result, a centrifugal force causes the transport of the liquid to be subjected to crystallisation through the arms.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">In practice, at the distal ends of the arms liquid in the vessel is forced to move faster between the arms (fitted with scrapers) and the inner wall of the vessel, causing a zone of reduced pressure, facilitating the flow of liquid inside the arm to flow out.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">According to a favourable embodiment, para-xylene dissolved in a solvent is introduced into the crystallizing vessel assembly.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">The crystallisation of para-xylene is an important application of the method according to the invention. In this particular case the solvent is typically formed by a mixture of isomers, i.e. ortho-xylene and meta-xylene that were also formed during synthesis of para-xylene and (residual) solvent such as benzene and ethylbenzene.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">Finally, the present invention relates to a crystallizing vessel assembly, said vessel assembly comprising<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0029">a crystallizing vessel, said vessel comprising a top wall, a bottom wall and an upright wall extending from the bottom wall to the top wall, said top wall, bottom wall and upright wall defining a lumen,</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0030">a superstructure on top of the vessel, said superstructure comprising a bearing, said bearing comprising an upper race member, a lower race member and roller bodies between said upper race member and said lower race member, said lower race member being attached to the superstructure,</li>        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0031">a rotor, said rotor comprising        <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0032">an upright, rotatable shaft, said shaft comprising i) a top shaft section extending above the top wall and ii) a bottom shaft section in said lumen, said top shaft section being provided with said upper race member, allowing the rotor to rotate along a shaft axis of the upright, rotatable shaft in line with the axis of rotation of the bearing;</li>            <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0000">&#x2003;and</li>            <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0033">a plurality of rotor arms comprising</li>            <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0034">arms attached with proximal ends thereof to said bottom shaft section, and</li>            <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0035">scrapers attached at the distal ends of said arms;<br/>wherein a plurality of arms of the rotor arms are hollow arms, each arm of the plurality of arms comprising an inlet opening that is relatively close to the shaft and an outlet opening that is relatively far from the shaft.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0036">This allows the weight of the rotor to be moved from the bearing to the seat in a method according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0037">Typically the inlet and the outlet will be at least 40% of the length of the arm apart, preferably at least 75% of the length of the arm.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0038">The surface area of the inlet opening (or in case there is more than one inlet opening the total surface area) is preferably at least 35% of the cross-sectional area of the cross-sectional area (in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the arm) of the lumen of the arm, and preferably at least 70%.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0039">The surface area of the outlet opening (or in case there is more than one outlet opening the total surface area) is preferably at least 35% of the cross-sectional area of the cross-sectional area (in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the arm) of the lumen of the arm, and preferably at least 70%.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0040">According to a favourable embodiment, the arms have a cross-sectional surface area of the lumen in the longitudinal direction of the arm, aid cross-sectional surface having a width/height ratio of at least 1.25, preferably at least 1.5.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0041">This allows the rotor arms to move through the liquid with relative ease, as a result of which in the steady state the arms move faster than the liquid surrounding the arms while liquid inside the arms moves as fast as the arms.
