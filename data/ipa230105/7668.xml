Vehicle to Everything (V2X)</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Long term evolution (LTE) has supported Sidelink (sidelink) transmission since release 12, allowing user equipments (UE, also called terminal) to directly transmit data at a physical layer without intervention of a network device. LTE sidelink communication is performed based on broadcast, although supporting basic safety communication in V2X, not suitable for other more advanced V2X services. The fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) system supports more advanced sidelink transmission designs, such as unicast and multicast or groupcast, and therefore can support more comprehensive service types.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The design of LTE sidelink is suitable for specific public safety affairs (such as emergency communication in disaster areas such as fire or earthquake) or vehicle to everything (V2X) communication. Vehicle to everything communication includes various services, such as basic safety communication, advanced (autonomous) driving, formation, sensor expansion, and so on. LTE sidelink supports only broadcast communication, mainly used for basic safety communication, and NR sidelink supports other advanced V2X services with high quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of delay, reliability, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">NR R16 V2X supports vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">2. Resource Allocation</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The design of LTE sidelink supports two resource allocation modes, namely, scheduled resource allocation mode and autonomous resource selectionmode. In the former mode, a network-side device controls and allocates resources for each UE, and in the latter mode, resources are autonomously selected by UEs. LTE sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is a device-to-device (D2D) scheduling resource allocation mode, LTE sidelink resource allocation mode 2 is a D2D autonomous resource allocation mode; LTE sidelink resource allocation mode 3 is a V2X scheduling resource allocation mode, and LTE sidelink resource allocation mode 4 is a V2X autonomous resource allocation mode.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A basic working principle of LTE sidelink mode 4 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Measurement is performed in a sensing window, and scheduling assignment (SA) demodulation and interference measurement are performed within each monitoring transmission time interval (TTI). The UE performs resource selection based on the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Step S<b>11</b>: Exclude occupied resources indicated by SA.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">This step is mainly to demodulate a received SA by the terminal to obtain resources reserved for other UEs, so as to exclude the resources reserved for other UEs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Step S<b>12</b>: Obtain an interference threshold based on priority.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Step S<b>13</b>: Exclude candidate resources whose interference is greater than the threshold.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">This step is mainly to perform energy monitoring within the sensing window by measuring reference signal strength indication (RSSI), and then based on a measurement result, exclude candidate resources whose interference is greater than the threshold.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Step S<b>14</b>: Determine whether remaining candidate resources account for more than 20% of total resources; if not, perform step S<b>15</b>; otherwise, perform step S<b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Step S<b>15</b>: Adjust the interference threshold, and proceed to step S<b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Step S<b>16</b>: Select 20% resources from the remaining resources as a resource set.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Step S<b>17</b>: Randomly select a resource from the candidate resource set as a reserved resource.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">This step is mainly to randomly select a subframe from the 20% resources with least interference within a selection window, so as to implement periodic resource reservation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">NR V2X defines two resource allocation modes: in mode 1, resources are scheduled by a base station; in mode 2, UE determines by itself which resource is to be used for transmission. In this case, resource information may be obtained from a broadcast message of the base station or preconfigured information. If the UE works within coverage of the base station and has an RRC connection to the base station, the UE can work in mode 1 and/or mode 2; if the UE works within coverage of the base station but has no RRC connection to the base station, the UE can work only in mode 2; and if the UE is outside coverage of the base station, the UE can work only in mode 2 and performs V2X transmission based on preconfigured information.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In mode 2, a specific working manner is as follows: (1) After resource selection is triggered, TX UE first determines a resource selection window, with a lower boundary of the resource selection window being in a time of T1 after triggering of resource selection and an upper boundary for resource selection being in a time of T2 after triggering, where T2 is a value selected by the UE from a packet delay budget (PDB) of its TB transmission, and T2 is not earlier than T1. (2) Before resource selection, the UE needs to determine a candidate resource set for resource selection by comparing a reference signal received powers (RSRP) measured on resources in a resource selection window with a corresponding RSRP threshold and then adding the resources into the candidate resource set if the RSRP is lower than the RSRP threshold. (3) After being determined, the candidate resource set is reported to a medium access control (MAC) layer, and the MAC layer randomly selects a resource from the candidate resource set as the resource of the UE. In addition, during a current transmission, the UE may reserve transmission resources for a next transmission.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">NR V2X supports chained resource reservation, that is, one piece of sidelink control information (SCI) may be used for reserving and indicating a frequency domain resource of a current slot and also for reserving a maximum of two additional resources; and two more reserved resources can be indicated during transmission on a next resource. Within the selection window, resources can be continuously reserved in a dynamic reservation manner.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">3. Partial Sensing</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Part sensing in LTE V2X is mainly designed for power saving to support P2V communication. PUEs support two modes of resource selection. One is random resource selection; the other is partial sensing mode, where monitoring is first performed on part of resources, a resource is selected based on a partial sensing result, to implement semi-static resource reservation. Which mode to be selected by the PUE is configured via radio resource control (RRC), and when the RRC configures two modes of resource selection being supported, the PUE determines a resource selection manner to be used.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Specifically, a manner of partial sensing and resource selection by the terminal is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A PUE sensing window is a resource subset within a range of [n&#x2212;1000, n] (a blank box between n&#x2212;1000 and n represents a sensing window range). Each sub-window (which is a slashed rectangle in the figure) is Yms in length, which is a length of the PUE sensing window. k is a parameter configured via RRC, and a value range of k may be {1,2,3, . . . ,10}. A rectangle filled with horizontal lines within [n+T 1, n+T2] of the selection window indicates a PUE selection window configured by a higher layer. In the PUE sensing window in the slashed rectangle, the PUE monitors SCI sent by other terminals; and based on detected SCI and a reservation period, infers a resource reservation status of other terminals in the PUE selection window indicated by the rectangle filled with horizontal lines. Then, based on such information, the PUE may exclude resources not satisfying a condition from the selection window. At least 20% of the remaining resources (20% of the window length Y) is used as the candidate resource set, and is reported to the medium access control (MAC) layer. The MAC layer randomly selects a resource from the candidate resource set as the resource of the PUE.
