The following disclosure will focus on specific implementations and embodiments of the teachings. This focus is provided to assist in describing the teachings and should not be interpreted as a limitation on the scope or applicability of the teachings. However, other teachings can certainly be used in this application.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;has,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of features is not necessarily limited only to those features but may include other features not expressly listed or inherent to such method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, &#x201c;or&#x201d; refers to an inclusive-or and not to an exclusive-or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present), and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present), and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Also, the use of &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; is employed to describe elements and components described herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the scope of the invention. This description should be read to include one or at least one, and the singular also includes the plural, or vice versa, unless it is clear that it is meant otherwise. For example, when a single item is described herein, more than one item may be used in place of a single item.

In an aspect, the portions may include a different abrasive characteristic. For example, the body may include a first portion coupled to a second portion, in which the first portion may be configured to conduct a coarse grinding operation, and the second portion may be configured to conduct a fine grinding operation. In a further aspect, the portions may include a different composition. For example, the first portion may include abrasive particles contained in a bond material, including an inorganic material, and the second portion may include abrasive particles contained in a bond material, including an organic material. The abrasive articles of embodiments herein can have improved dimension and/or thermal stability in fast material-removal operations. In particular, the abrasive article can have improved fracture-at-elongation, Young's Modulus, hardness, stiffness, coefficient of thermal expansion, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments are drawn to methods of forming abrasive articles. The methods may allow the formation of the body, including portions including a homogenous distribution of abrasive particles in a bond material. In particular embodiments, methods may include dispersing fine abrasive particles in a viscous bond material to form a uniform mixture, which facilitates formation of the abrasive articles having improved performance.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The abrasive articles of embodiments herein can include fixed abrasives, such as bonded abrasives. The abrasive body may have any suitable size and shape as known in the art and can be incorporated into various types of abrasive articles to form an abrasive article suitable for conducting material removal operations, including but not limited to abrasive wheels, cones, hones, cups, flanged-wheels, tapered cups, segments, mounted-point tools, discs, thin wheels, grinding wheels, large diameter cut-off wheels, and the like. In a particular embodiment, the abrasive articles can include abrasive wheels. In a more particular example, the abrasive articles may be suitable for gear grinding, which often demands both fast removal rates and the generation of precise surface features.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a cross-sectional view of the body <b>100</b> of an exemplary abrasive article is illustrated in accordance with an embodiment.
