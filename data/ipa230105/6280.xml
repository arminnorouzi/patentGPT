Each module can have a plurality of electronic cells received in a casing and liable to release heat when operating. High-density energy storage cells such as Li-ion batteries ideally need to operate in a temperature range of between 20&#xb0; C. and 40&#xb0; C., and a temperature that is too low has an impact on their power, while a temperature that is too high has an impact on their service life. It is therefore necessary to be able to thermally regulate them, whether this be in order to cool them or in order to heat them.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">What is meant by unit cells is an individual electrochemical element equipped with a positive terminal and with a negative terminal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is meant by battery module is a collection comprising a plurality of unit cells contained in a casing, the cells being electrically connected to one another.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During the charging phase, the battery cells or module heat up according to the conditions of use and it is a known practice to regulate the temperature by plate heat exchangers in contact with the modules and in which canals for the circulation of a cooling liquid are formed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With an aim to increase the surface area for heat exchange, document US2017176108 describes a heat exchanger for a battery which comprises first and second fluid transport panels, defining first and second flow canals, the first and second fluid transport panels being arranged such that they define an angle between them. The heat exchanger can also comprise a third fluid transport panel defining a third flow canal and arranged such that it defines an angle with respect to the second fluid transport panel. The heat exchanger comprises first and second plates which are connected in a fluidtight manner to one another along their peripheries and define a passage for the flow of fluid between their central fluid flow regions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In general, in order to provide thermal management of battery cells of electric or hybrid vehicles, a heat-transfer liquid such as glycol water is often used. This liquid circulates through the plates or tubes in contact with the cells, and there is an exchange of heat between this heat-transfer liquid and the cells.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One risk associated with this technology is that if this liquid leaks into the battery pack, a lack of electrical isolation can occur, with consequences ranging as far as causing a fire to break out in the battery pack or even causing the cells in the pack to explode. In order to avoid this phenomenon, certain manufacturers make the choice of having no liquid connection within the battery pack and opt for a large plate at the bottom for example. However, certain battery pack architectures, and the increase in the surface areas for exchanges between the cells and the cooling exchangers give rise to increasing numbers of heat exchangers within the pack and therefore several connections between the piping supplying this liquid and the cooling exchangers.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention seeks to prevent these risks.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention notably seeks to prevent these risks associated with heat-transfer fluid leaking into the pack.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">What is proposed is a thermal management system for an electrical component liable to release heat during its operation, in particular for an electrical energy storage module, this system comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">at least one housing intended to receive at least one electrical component, notably a plurality of such housings arranged in parallel;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">at least one heat exchange plate extending over at least part of the surface of the lateral face of the housing, said at least one plate comprising at least one canal for heat-transfer fluid between a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet of said plate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">an intake duct configured to supply the plate with heat-transfer fluid via the fluid inlet of the plate and a discharge duct configured to remove the heat-transfer fluid from the plate via the fluid outlet of the plate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">a casing defining the housing or housings and receiving the heat-exchange plate and the intake and discharge ducts;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0017">a fluid collecting tank arranged to collect any fluid that might leak from the junction between the fluid inlet and outlet of the plate and the associated intake and discharge ducts, so as to prevent this leaking fluid from dropping into the casing, notably into a region containing the at least one electrical component, notably into a bottom of the casing, notably into the region in which the battery cells are placed, notably into one or more of the housings.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">Thanks to the invention, it is possible to ensure that even in the event of a leak at the junctions, or connections, between the fluid inlet and outlet of the plate and the associated intake and discharge ducts that might occur in the casing, notably the battery pack, the heat-transfer liquid or fluid does not come into contact with the battery cells, so that no defective isolation between the battery cells will be able to arise.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">In other words, the invention proposes to avoid leaks of heat-transfer liquid thanks to the presence of a volume, by way of the collecting tank, around the connection regions so as to collect such liquid as might leak and thus prevent it from being able to create a short circuit within the battery pack.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the system comprises a plurality of heat-exchange plates, notably arranged parallel to one another with, for each plate, junctions between the fluid intake and discharge ducts and the plate inlet and outlet, and the fluid collecting tank is common to all the plates so as to collect any fluid that might be leaking from all of the junctions associated with all of the plates.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the collecting tank extends perpendicular to the heat-exchange plates, notably at one end thereof.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">According to one of the aspects of the invention, each plate comprises a connecting part which comprises the fluid inlet and outlet, this connecting part extending over just part of one side of the associated plate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">According to one of the aspects of the invention, this connecting part takes the form of a lug projecting on one side of the plate, notably projecting on a side of the plate which is the width, and this connecting part is notably positioned in the upper part of the plate when the plate is in position in the system for normal use.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the fluid collecting tank comprises notches for each receiving a connecting part of one of the plates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">According to one of the aspects of the invention, there is a sealing between the notch of the collecting tank and the connecting part of the plate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the notches have a rectilinear shape and are parallel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the notches extend over just part of the height of the collecting tank. In this way, the notches do not extend up to the bottom of the collecting tank.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">In an alternative, the collecting tank is positioned along a lower edge of the connecting parts. Thus, the collecting tank is positioned below the connecting parts so that in normal operation this collecting tank can collect any leaking fluid that falls under gravity from the junctions of the ducts to the plates.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the collecting tank extends from the connecting parts of the plate up to the foot of the heat-exchange plates. Thus, the collecting tank extends over the majority of the width of the heat-exchange plates. In this instance, the height of the collecting tank runs parallel to the width of the plates.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the collecting tank has a bottom and lateral walls. In particular, the collecting tank is open at the top.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">According to one of the aspects of the invention, certain walls of the collecting tank, notably all the lateral walls, are rectangular in shape.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0032">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the collecting tank contains a plastics material and is notably formed as a single piece.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the tank is fixed to the housing or housings, notably by bonding, screwing to the casing of the pack, or for example is held on the casing of the pack by a clip.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034">According to one of the aspects of the invention, the system comprises at least one sensor designed to detect presence of water in the collecting tank.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035">According to one of the aspects of the invention, this sensor is a water-level sensor positioned inside the collecting tank. Preferably, the collecting tank is of substantial length, two sensors being positioned one at each longitudinal end of this tank in order to detect a liquid leak whatever the inclination of the vehicle in the event of a leak.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">As an alternative, the collecting tank common to all the heat-exchange plates can be replaced by a multitude of collecting tanks, for example each collecting tank being associated with one or two plates.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">Thus, by virtue of the invention, it is possible to add on a volume for containing all of the plate connections so as to collect the heat-transfer liquid in the event of a leak. This liquid is therefore contained in this volume, which is separated and sealed from the other volume in which the battery cells are situated. The area around the joint between the cooling plates and the volume is sealed using for example a flexible lip or an added sealing compound such as a silicone seal for example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">It is moreover possible to position a sensor to detect the presence of the heat-transfer liquid in the heat-transfer liquid collecting volume so that information that there is a leak of heat-transfer liquid at one of the heat-exchanger connections, notably one of the plate connections, can be fed back for example to the vehicle on-board computer. This information can travel through a vehicle information network so as to display a visible indication warning that maintenance is required.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">As an alternative, it is possible to add several level sensors, at least two, in order to evaluate the rate of leakage in the collecting tank so as to allow the vehicle to operate in a downgraded mode between initial detection of the leak and until such point as the fluid in the collecting tank reaches a maximum level beyond which the vehicle is to be made unsafe and can no longer be used.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">According to one embodiment of the invention, said at least one plate forms a vertical contact surface for contact with a vertical heat-exchange surface of the electrical component that is to be cooled, when that component is placed inside the housing.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">According to one embodiment of the invention in which the thermal management system comprises at least one plate positioned between two end plates, the main inlet of the intake duct is positioned on the fluid inlet of one of the end plates of the row and the main outlet is positioned on the outlet of the other end plate of the row.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">The features set out in the paragraphs that follow can optionally be employed. They can be employed independently of one another or in combination with one another.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">Said intake and discharge ducts can be parallel to one another and run transversely with respect to the canals over at least part of a transverse lateral face.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">Said at least one plate can comprise a first series of fluid canals extending in a first plane and a second series of fluid canals extending in a second plane distinct from the first plane, each of the canals of the first series being in communication with a neighboring canal of the second series to form a plurality of U-shaped fluid paths.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">Said at least one plate can comprise a border situated outside of a contact surface of said plate that contacts a vertical heat-exchange surface of the electrical component that is to be cooled, said border comprising a supply region and a discharge region, said supply and discharge regions having a substantially elongated shape which runs transversely with respect to the canals.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">Said fluid inlet and the fluid outlet of said at least one plate can be positioned on the border of the plate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">According to one embodiment of the invention, the border of the plate has a substantially C-shaped profile so as to define a passage for a connecting duct, said connecting duct being intended to be connected to the main outlet of the discharge duct or to the main inlet of the intake duct so as to place the main inlet and the main outlet on the one same side so as to be connected to an external fluid circuit.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">Thanks to the presence of the passage, it is thus possible to bring all of the connections of the thermal management system onto the same side so as to meet the connectivity constraints dictated by the external fluid circuit and also the packaging constraints so as to limit the volume occupied by the battery pack in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">According to one embodiment of the invention, said at least one plate comprises a central sheet interposed between two lateral sheets, the central sheet being provided with grooves on each of the two faces, the three sheets being assembled with one another in order to form canals of the first series alternating with canals of the second series.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">According to one particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention in which the system comprises at least one plate positioned between two end plates, said end plates each being equipped with a through-connection and with a connection that does not pass through, said connection that does not pass through having a bore section adjusted to reduce the flowrate of heat-transfer fluid in said end plates.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">A through-connection is a connection which comprises two connection endpieces extending one on each side of the plate at the fluid inlet or the fluid outlet so as to allow fluid to pass through the plate and which is connected to a plate feed reservoir or to a plate discharge reservoir.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">A connection that does not pass through is a connection which comprises a single connection endpiece which extends out from one face of the plate in order to allow fluid to pass between the plate feed reservoir and a supply duct, or the plate discharge reservoir and a discharge duct.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">It is thus possible to increase the pressure drops at the end plates in order to adapt the flowrate of heat-transfer fluid according to the thermal power dissipated at these end plates. Specifically, the end plates of the row are in contact on just one side with an electrical component that is to be cooled. Thus, the end plates will exchange a thermal power that is a factor of two lower compared with the plates positioned in the center of the pack. By reducing the flowrate of the heat-transfer fluid in these end plates it is therefore possible to keep the temperature as uniform as possible across all the electrical components.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">According to one embodiment of the invention, the connection that does not pass through comprises a fluidic connection endpiece extending from one face of said end plate and that is attached to said end plate at the fluid inlet or the fluid outlet, said fluidic connection endpiece having an inside diameter that is narrowed in comparison with a connection endpiece of a through connection so as to reduce the flowrate of the heat-transfer fluid in said end plate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">According to another embodiment of the invention, the connection that does not pass through has a deformation on one of the faces of the end plate that is the opposite to the face from which there extends a connection endpiece that forms the fluid inlet or fluid outlet of the connection that does not pass through, said depression being configured in such a way as to reduce the flowrate of the heat-transfer fluid in said end plate. Said depression can be a deformation only of the lateral sheet that does not bear the connection endpiece of the connection that does not pass through, or else of this same lateral sheet and of the intermediate sheet. Said depression can be formed for example by stamping.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">According to one embodiment of the invention and in order to increase the surface areas for exchanges of heat with the electrical components, the thermal management system further comprises a plate comprising a plurality of heat-transfer fluid canals extending over at least part of the surface of the bottom face in order to form a contact surface contacting a horizontal heat-exchange surface of the electrical component that is to be cooled, when said component is in place in the housing.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">In one embodiment of the invention, the intake duct and the discharge duct are formed of a plurality of pipes, the ends of each of the pipes being provided with a fluidic-connection endpiece configured to be connected to a fluidic connection endpiece of a through connection or of a connection that does not pass through belonging to a plate at the fluid inlet and the fluid outlet.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">According to one aspect of the invention, the invention relates to a battery pack equipped with a thermal management system as defined hereinabove, said pack comprising at least one electrical energy storage module housed in the housing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0059">Other features, details and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the detailed description below, and upon analyzing the appended drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically depicts a perspective view of a battery pack equipped with a cooling device according to one embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically depicts a perspective view of part of the cooling device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> without the electrical energy storage modules;</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically depicts the direction of circulation of the heat-transfer fluid in a plate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically depicts an exploded view of a plate of heat-transfer fluid canals of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an enlarged perspective view of a region of communication between the first series of canals and the second series of canals, viewed from the side of the first series of canals;</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an enlarged perspective view of a region of communication between the first series of canals and the second series of canals, viewed from the side of the second series of canals;</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an enlarged perspective view of a supply region of the canals of the plate;</p><p id="p-0063" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an enlarged perspective view of a discharge region of the canals of the plate;</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an enlarged view of the fluid inlet and outlet of a plate, the inlet and the outlet being equipped with tubular connection endpieces;</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an enlarged view of a region of connection between two plates by pipes, one of the two plates being an end plate of a row;</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts another exemplary implementation of the invention;</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts a view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> with the collecting tank;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts the collecting tank of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> depicts another exemplary implementation of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0074">The drawings and the description below contain, for the most part, elements of a certain character.
