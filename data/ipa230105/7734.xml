The vapor is typically released by a heating element that heats the vaporizable material through convection or conduction. Typically, the user activates the vaporizer by taking a puff or pressing a button. Many of the vaporizers today are small, hand-held, and battery-powered for ease of use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several disadvantages associated with current battery-powered vaporizers. One disadvantage is that the battery life can be low due to constant heating of the device. Another disadvantage is that the temperature of the oven can vary, particularly when ambient air is drawn therethrough, which can make consistent heating and vaporizing of the material difficult.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Described herein are apparatuses and methods that may address the issues discussed above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates generally to apparatuses, including systems and devices, for vaporizing material to form an inhalable aerosol. Specifically, these apparatuses may include vaporizers. The vaporizer devices described herein may be similar to the vaporizer devices described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2013-0042865, 2013-0312742, and 2015-0208729, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Such devices may include a capacitive touch (e.g., lip, hand, etc.) sensor that may be adapted to adjust the temperature of the heater during control of the apparatus. For example, an apparatus may be configured to adjust the heater to boost the temperature upon contact with a user's lip. This boost may transiently (e.g., for 0.5 sec, 1 sec, 2 sec, 3 sec, 4 sec, 5 sec, etc.) increase the temperature of the heater by a predetermined amount (e.g., 1&#xb0; C., 2&#xb0; C., 3&#xb0; C., 4&#xb0; C., 5&#xb0; C., 6&#xb0; C., 7&#xb0; C., etc.) or percentage of a target (e.g., preset) temperature. This may help accommodate heating and cooling of the heater during draw (inhalation) on the device, and may enhance the user experience. The temperature boost may be achieved by increasing the duty cycle over which power is applied by the controller to the heater, e.g., increasing the duty cycle to 100 percent until the temperature reaches the target boost temperature (e.g., the pre-determined amount, such as 5&#xb0; C., over a set temperature) or the transient boost period ends.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the capacitive sensors (e.g., capacitive lip sensors) described herein may be used to place the apparatus into a &#x2018;sleep&#x2019; mode when no contact (e.g., lip sensing), and therefore no activity, is sensed after a predetermined period of time. For example, the capacitive sensing may be used to determined when no lip has been sensed (e.g. no increase in capacitance) for greater than an idle period (e.g., of 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 45 seconds, 1 min, etc.), and thereafter reduce the temperature of the heater by a predetermined initial reduction amount (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10&#xb0; C., etc.). If no new lip sensing (capacitance increase compared to a baseline) is detected for some continuing idle period (e.g., 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 45 seconds, 1 min, etc.) then the apparatus will again reduce the temperature by a predetermined step amount (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10&#xb0; C., etc.). This process may be continued through additional cycles as long as the no lip sensing is detected by the capacitance (lip) sensor, or the apparatus may shut the device off completely. In some variations, rather than cooling the heater in steps when the apparatus is inactive, the apparatus may instead begin a continuous cool-down period.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, a vaporizer device having capacitive lip sensing may include: a reservoir configured to hold a vaporizable material; a heater configured to heat the vaporizable material; a mouthpiece in communication with the reservoir; a capacitive lip sensor configured to output an instantaneous capacitance reading; and a controller (e.g., microcontroller) configured to: regulate a temperature of the heater to a preselected temperature; obtain the instantaneous capacitance reading from the capacitive lip sensor; determine a difference between the instantaneous capacitance reading and a baseline capacitance; and increase the temperature of the heater to an override temperature for a boost time period when the difference is above a threshold.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A vaporizer device may alternatively or additionally include: a reservoir configured to hold a vaporizable material; a heater configured to heat the vaporizable material; a mouthpiece in communication with the reservoir; a capacitive sensor (e.g., a capacitive lip sensor) configured to output an instantaneous capacitance reading; and a controller configured to: regulate a temperature of the heater to a first temperature; obtain sensor readings from the capacitive sensor; determine a difference between the instantaneous capacitance reading and a baseline capacitance; and reduce the temperature of the heater to a second temperature that is lower than the first temperature when the difference is below a threshold for a predetermined period of time.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A vaporizer device may include: a reservoir configured to hold a vaporizable material; a heater configured to heat the vaporizable material; a mouthpiece in communication with the reservoir; a capacitive lip sensor configured to detect a capacitance proximate to the mouthpiece; and a controller configured to regulate a temperature of the heater to a predetermined temperature, to determine the presence of a user's lip based upon a change in capacitance detected by the capacitive lip sensor, and to transiently boost the temperature of the heater when a lip is detected.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In any of these apparatuses described herein, the capacitive sensor (e.g., capacitive lip sensor) may be positioned on, near, within or behind the mouthpiece, e.g., proximate to the mouthpiece. In some variations, the capacitive sensor may be a conductor (e.g., a conductive plate or fill) that is positioned behind the mouthpiece. Behind the mouthpiece may be between the mouthpiece, which may be removable, and the body of the apparatus. The body may be an elongate body (e.g., cylindrical body, etc.), e.g., between the mouthpiece and the controller, battery, etc. For example, the capacitive sensor may be a copper fill region of a circuit (e.g., flex circuit) that is positioned under and/or behind the mouthpiece to detect contact between the mouthpiece (which may be any appropriate material, including a silicone mouthpiece) and the user's lips or other body part (e.g., fingers, etc.). In some variations, the capacitive sensor may comprise a flex circuit onto which a conductive region has been layered.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In general, the reservoir may be an oven, and the heater may be in thermal contact with the oven, and/or integrated into the oven. The oven may be be configured to hold a solid (e.g., loose-leaf) material. The reservoir may be a tank, including a tank holding a liquid, gel, or semi-solid material that is configured to be vaporized (e.g., a tobacco solution, a <i>cannabis </i>solution, etc.). Any of the apparatuses described herein may include a wick or wicking mechanism for heating the vaporizable material, including drawing the vaporizable material into thermal contact with the heater, which may include a coil (e.g., resistive coil). Alternatively or additionally, the heater may be in thermal (conductive, convective and/or radiant) contact with the reservoir. For example, the reservoir may be an oven that is directly and/or indirectly heated by the heater.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The controller may be a microcontroller and may be referred to as a heater controller. The controller may receive raw or processed input from the capacitance sensor (e.g., the controller may receive capacitance values or values based on the capacitance values, including averaged, scaled, filtered, etc. capacitance values.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some variations the controller determines, based on the instantaneous capacitance readings received from the capacitance sensor, the baseline values. For example, the controller may be configured to determining the baseline based on the instantaneous sensor readings by taking a running average of the instantaneous sensor readings. The baseline may be frozen or held at a value (e.g., prior baseline value) once the sensor determines that a large change in capacitance has been detected (e.g., due to lip/skin contact or the like). For example, the controller may be configured to determine the baseline based on the instantaneous capacitance readings and may be configured to hold the baseline at a prior value of the baseline while the instantaneous capacitance readings are above the baseline by a first offset value or below the baseline by a second offset value. The first offset value may be based on a percentage of the current baseline value (e.g., 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, etc. of the baseline value). In this manner the apparatus may detect the sudden change &#x201c;on&#x201d; and &#x201c;off&#x201d; contact with the mouthpiece. Similarly, the second offset value may be zero, or it may be based on a percentage of the current baseline value (e.g., 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, etc. of the baseline value). For example, the controller may be configured to hold the baseline at a prior value of the baseline while the instantaneous capacitance readings are above the baseline by a first offset value. In some variations the controller may be configured to hold the baseline at a prior value of the baseline while the instantaneous capacitance readings are above the baseline by a first offset value and further wherein the controller is configured to hold the baseline at the prior value of the baseline while the instantaneous capacitance readings are below the baseline by a second offset value.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The the controller may be configured to determine the difference between the instantaneous capacitance reading and the baseline capacitance by determining a percent difference between the instantaneous capacitance and the baseline. The threshold of the controller may be greater than a 0.5% change (e.g., &#x3e;about 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, etc. of the baseline value) between the instantaneous capacitance and the baseline.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As mentioned above, the boost time period is between 2 and 5 seconds (e.g., approximately 3 seconds, etc.). The controller may be configured to increase the temperature of the heater by increasing the duty cycle of power applied to the heater for the boot time period. The controller may be configured to increase the temperature of the heater to the override temperature when the difference is greater than 0.5% above the baseline.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the mouthpiece is a flat (e.g., silicone) mouthpiece having a side opening region through which the vapor may exit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> the mouthpiece extends from the body of the vaporizer slightly, and includes an opening through which the vapor may exit. As will be described in greater detail below, the capacitive (lip) sensing described herein may operate equally as well with either mouthpiece. Further the mouthpiece may be made of any appropriate material, including both conductive and non-conductive materials. For example, the mouthpiece may be polymeric (e.g., silicone), plastic, metal, ceramic, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The body <b>419</b> can be a single extruded aluminum outer body. Further, the mouthpiece <b>410</b> can be removable from the body <b>419</b>. The device <b>400</b> further includes an indicator <b>460</b>, such as an LED indicator.

In some embodiments, pressing the button <b>105</b> can cycle through the temperature settings (and, for example, the current temperature setting can be indicated by the LED indicator <b>460</b>). The device <b>400</b> also includes a capacitive sensor <b>103</b> proximate to, i.e., just under, the mouthpiece <b>410</b>. In one embodiment, the sensor <b>103</b> (capacitive lip sensor) can surround the on/off button <b>105</b> and can be positioned in a plane that is parallel to the mouthpiece <b>410</b>. For example, the capacitive sensor <b>103</b> can be a copper pad that has a thickness and/or width, e.g., of between about &#xbd; inches and 1 inch, such as about &#xbe; inches. Because the copper pad faces the lip when the lip is placed thereon, it can be geometrically tuned to be sensitive thereto. The capacitive sensor <b>103</b> can be configured to determine a change in capacitance thereacross (and thus the presence of a lip).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>I-<b>2</b>J</figref>, illustrate the proximal end of an exemplary device, with the mouthpiece removed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>J</figref>) and with the mouthpiece in place (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>I</figref>).

The capacitive sensor <b>103</b> may be a conductive material, such as copper or other conductive materials, on a board such as a flex circuit. One or more additional circuit elements (filtering circuitry, memory, averaging circuitry, etc.) may be used to enhance the signal from the capacitive sensor. In some variations a separate capacitive trace near the periphery of the device (not shown) may be included and used to subtract signal to remove artifacts from holding the device.

In general, the PID control algorithm calculates an &#x201c;error&#x201d; value as the difference between the measured temperature (or some value proportional to the temperature, such as the resistance) and the desired setpoint and uses that to control power to the heater. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the components used to control the PID algorithm can include a microcontroller <b>200</b>, the device heater <b>201</b>, the measurement circuit <b>203</b>, a temperature input <b>205</b>, a capacitive lip sensor <b>204</b>, and an optional on/off activation mechanism <b>206</b>. The microcontroller <b>200</b> can be used to run the PID control algorithm. Further, the microcontroller can control the amount of power provided to the heater <b>201</b> to thereby control the oven temperature. The measurement circuit <b>202</b> can include a measured temperature or measured value proportional to the temperature, such as resistance detected by a thermistor. The measured resistance or temperature can then be fed directly to the microcontroller <b>200</b> (such as to establish a baseline temperature or resistance) and/or can be fed to the summation block <b>203</b> for comparison computation of error relative to the desired temperature or resistance provided to the microcontroller <b>200</b> from temperature input <b>205</b>. The microcontroller <b>200</b> can take set inputs regarding the temperature from the temperature input <b>205</b>. This temperature input <b>205</b> be a user selected temperature or a preset temperature. The microcontroller <b>200</b> can also take input from a capacitive lip sensor <b>204</b>, which will be described further below. Additional inputs from activation mechanism <b>206</b> can also be provided to the microcontroller, such as from an on/off button or a motion sensor (including when to activate or deactivate).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the input from the capacitive sensor can be used to increase the temperature of the device over the set temperature, decrease the temperature of the device over the set temperature, and/or turn the device off. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, at step <b>401</b>, the device is turned on. At step <b>403</b>, the device oven is heated to, and maintained at, the set baseline temperature. The set baseline temperature can be user selected (such as from a plurality of different preselected temperatures, e.g., four preselected temperatures) or can be preprogrammed. The temperature can be, for example, between 190&#xb0; C. and 240&#xb0; C. In one embodiment, the user can select between a first temperature setting of between 190&#xb0; C. and 205&#xb0; C., a second temperature setting of between 205&#xb0; C. and 220&#xb0; C., a third temperature setting of between 220&#xb0; C. and 230&#xb0; C., and a fourth temperature setting of between 230&#xb0; C. and 240&#xb0; C. At step <b>405</b>, a baseline capacitance of the lip sensor is determined. After the baseline capacitance has been determined and the device is heated to the set baseline temperature (and in some embodiments, even before the set baseline temperature has been reached), the capacitance of the lip sensor can be measured at step <b>407</b>. The difference between the measured capacitance and the baseline capacitance can be determined at step <b>409</b>. It can be determined whether that different is above a threshold amount at step <b>411</b>. In one example, the threshold is an increase in capacitance of at least 0.5%-1%.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the difference is above the threshold amount at step <b>411</b>, then it can be determined that the lip is present at step <b>413</b> (and correspondingly, assumed that the user is puffing on and/or actively using the device). Thus, the PID (such as the PID control loop shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) can be overridden at step <b>415</b> to actively heat the oven (for example, a 100% duty cycle can be activated). In some cases (e.g., where the device was already at the set baseline temperature), this step can heat the oven to a temperature above the set baseline temperature. In other embodiments, this step helps account for the cooling of the oven when air is drawn therethrough. It can then be determined whether a preset length of time (e.g., 3 seconds) or a preset amount (e.g., 5 degrees) over the baseline temperature has been reached at step <b>417</b>. If not, then PID can continue to be overridden at step <b>415</b>. If the preset length of time or the present amount over the baseline temperature has been reached at step <b>417</b>, then the new override temperature can be maintained at step <b>421</b>. At step <b>423</b>, it can be detected whether a lip is present (e.g., using the steps outlined in steps <b>407</b>, <b>409</b>, <b>411</b>, <b>413</b>, and <b>420</b>). If a lip is determined to be present at step <b>423</b>, then the new override temperature can be maintained (step <b>421</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring back to step <b>411</b>, if the difference in capacitance is not above the threshold amount, then it can be determined that no lip is present at step <b>420</b>. At step <b>419</b>, it can be determined whether no lip has been present for a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 3 minutes). If the predetermined amount of time has not been met, then the temperature can be maintained at the set baseline temperature (step <b>403</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">If it has been more than the predetermined time (at step <b>419</b>) or if the lip is not present (at step <b>423</b>), then the device can enter an automatic cool-down mode at step <b>425</b>. For example, in the auto-cool-down mode, the temperature can decrease by a set amount (e.g., 5 degrees) every set amount of time (e.g., 20 seconds) until a predetermined amount of time has passed (e.g., 1 minute). The new cool-down temperature can then be maintained at step <b>426</b>. It can then be determined at step <b>427</b> whether a lip is present (e.g., using the steps outlined in steps <b>407</b><i>m </i><b>409</b>, <b>411</b>, <b>413</b>, and <b>420</b>). If a lip is detected, then the heater can be returned to the set baseline temperature at step <b>403</b>. If a lip is not detected, it can be determined whether a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 3 minutes) without presence of the lip has been met. If not, the new cool-down temperature can continue to be maintained at step <b>426</b>. If the predetermined time without sensing a lip (e.g., 3 minutes) has passed, the device can shut off at step <b>429</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the capacitive sensor can be used to turn the device on.
