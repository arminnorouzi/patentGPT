The basic LTE physical resource can thus be seen as a time-frequency grid as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, where each Resource Element (RE) corresponds to one OFDM subcarrier during one OFDM symbol interval. Furthermore, the resource allocation in LTE is typically described in terms of resource blocks, where a resource block corresponds to one slot (0.5 millisecond (ms)) in the time domain and 12 contiguous subcarriers in the frequency domain. Resource blocks are numbered in the frequency domain, starting with 0 from one end of the system bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the time domain, downlink (DL) and UL transmissions in LTE are organized into equally-sized subframes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In LTE, the subframe length is 1 ms. There are two slots per subframe for the subcarrier spacing of 15 kilohertz (kHz) supported in LTE, thus there are 20 slots per radio frame. In Time Domain duplexing (TDD) systems, the subframes can be UL subframes, DL subframes, or special subframes. In the UL subframes, all the symbols are allocated for UL transmissions. In the DL subframes, all the symbols are allocated for DL transmissions. A special subframe is used to switch between UL and DL or vice versa. The special subframe consists of a DL part (referred to as DL Pilot Time Slot (DwPTS)), a UL part (referred to as UL Pilot Time Slot (UpPTS)), and a guard period.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">DL transmissions are dynamically scheduled, i.e., in each subframe the enhanced or evolved Node B (eNB) transmits DL Control Information (DCI) about which User Equipment (UE) data is to be transmitted to and which resource blocks in the current DL subframe the data is transmitted on. This control signaling is typically transmitted within the first three OFDM symbols in each subframe in LTE. The control information is carried on the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) and data is carried on the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH). A UE first detects and decodes PDCCH and, if a PDCCH is decoded successfully, it then decodes the corresponding PDSCH based on the decoded control information in the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">UL data transmissions are also dynamically scheduled using PDCCH. Similar to DL, a UE first decodes UL grants in PDCCH and then transmits data over the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) based on the decoded control information in the UL grant such as modulation order, coding rate, UL resource allocation, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to PUSCH, Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) is also supported in LTE to carry UL Control Information (UCI) such as Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)related Acknowledgment (ACK), Negative Acknowledgment (NACK), or Channel State Information (CSI) feedback.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) is used for UL channel quality measurements for frequency-selective scheduling and link adaption. SRS is also used for UL timing estimation and UL power control.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Until Release 15 in LTE, in normal UL subframes configured for SRS transmission, SRS can only be transmitted by a UE in the last Single Carrier Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-OFDMA) symbol. The location of SRS in a Physical Resource Block (PRB) in an SRS subframe where the SRS subframe is a normal UL subframe is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, where Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) symbols are used for channel estimation in PUSCH demodulation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The subframes in which SRS transmission can occur in a cell are referred to as cell-specific SRS subframes. In current LTE specifications, the cell-specific SRS subframe configuration is configured with a periodicity given by T<sub>SFC </sub>and subframe offset given by &#x394;<sub>SFC</sub>, as defined in clause 5.5.3.3 of [1]. A cell-specific SRS subframe is a subframe that satisfies &#x2514;n<sub>s</sub>/2&#x2518;modT<sub>SFC </sub>&#x3f5; &#x394;<sub>SFC</sub>, where n<sub>s </sub>&#x2208; {0,1, . . . , 19} denotes the slot number within a radio frame. A UE can be configured to transmit SRS on a subset of the cell-specific SRS subframes. These subsets of cell-specific SRS subframes are also referred to as UE-specific SRS configurations. As defined in clause 8.2 of [2], a UE-specific SRS configuration includes an SRS transmission periodicity T<sub>SRS </sub>and subframe offset T<sub>offset</sub>. It should be noted that the UE-specific SRS configuration can be different for periodic SRS and aperiodic SRS. An example of cell-specifically configured SRS subframes and UE-specifically configured SRS subframes is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A UE can be configured with different SRS bandwidths. In general, two kinds of SRS bandwidths are supported, one is wideband and the other is narrowband. In case of wideband SRS bandwidth, channel measurement over the full system bandwidth can be performed in a single subframe. While in narrowband SRS bandwidth, only part of the full system bandwidth can be measured in a subframe, and thus multiple SRS subframes are needed for a full bandwidth channel measurement. Frequency Hopping (FH) is supported for narrowband SRS so that different parts of the frequency band can be measured in different subframes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, two types of SRS are supported, i.e. periodic (also referred to as type 0) and aperiodic (also referred to as type 1). In case of periodic SRS, a UE transmits SRS periodically at certain configured SRS subframes. In case of aperiodic SRS, a UE transmits SRS only when it is requested by the eNB. The SRS subframes for periodic and aperiodic SRS are separately configured for a UE. Both are comprised within the cell-specific SRS subframes.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The SRS bandwidth for a UE is configurable and is a multiple of 4 PRBs. The minimum SRS bandwidth is four PRBs. An example of wideband and narrowband SRS with 10 Megahertz (MHz) system bandwidth is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In case of narrowband SRS with FH, an SRS is transmitted on different parts of the system bandwidth at different SRS subframes. For example, for a 10 MHz system and SRS bandwidth of four PRBs, a possible set of locations in the frequency domain for SRS transmission are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In this example, the whole bandwidth can be measured after 12 SRS subframes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An SRS signal is a phase-shifted Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence. Different UEs can be multiplexed on the same time-frequency resources by assigning different phase shifts, known as Cyclic Shifts (CSs). There are eight CSs defined in LTE Release 8. In addition, an SRS signal is only transmitted on half of the subcarriers in the configured SRS bandwidth, either even-numbered or odd-numbered subcarriers, configurable through a parameter called a comb. Therefore, up to 16 UEs can be multiplexed on the same SRS bandwidth. In LTE Release 8 to Release 12, 2-comb is supported, meaning SRS can be transmitted on every other subcarrier.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In current LTE specifications [1], the SRS sequences are a function of the physical cell Identity (ID) N<sub>ID</sub><sup>cell</sup>. Specifically, the ZC base sequences <o ostyle="single">&#x3b3;</o><sub>u,v</sub>(n) used to construct the SRS sequences are parameterized by the sequence group number u and the number v within the group, and N<sub>ID</sub><sup>cell </sup>is used to select the values of u and v. This implies that SRS transmissions for all UEs connected to the same cell must use the same ZC base sequence, which only enables user separation in a completely orthogonal fashion by using different combs or CSs.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In LTE Release 13, support for 4-comb was introduced, which means that an SRS signal can be mapped to every fourth subcarrier, thereby increasing the SRS multiplexing capacity provided that the channel is sufficiently flat so that transmitting SRS on every fourth subcarrier is adequate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">UEs with different SRS bandwidths can be multiplexed on an SRS subframe with different comb values. UEs with the same SRS bandwidth can be multiplexed in an SRS subframe with different CSs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Up to LTE Release 12, one or two Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) symbols can be used for SRS transmission in UpPTS. In LTE Release 13, the number of SC-FDMA symbols that can be used for SRS in UpPTS was extended to up to six SC-FDMA symbols.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In LTE Release 13 SRS enhancements, a new set of Radio Resource Control (RRC) parameters were introduced for additional SRS symbols in UpPTS for both aperiodic and periodic SRS.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In LTE, up to Release 15, three sets of SRS parameters are higher layer configured for aperiodic SRS triggering with UL-related DCI formats 4, 4A, 4B, and 7-0B. A two-bit SRS request field present in DCI formats 4, 4A, 4B, and 7-0B indicate the SRS parameter set according to Table 1 below.

In scenario (A), the PUSCH PRBs are fully overlapped with the SRS. In this case, the last SC-OFDM symbol has to be removed from the calculation of available PUSCH REs, or rate matched around the SRS. In scenario (B), PUSCH is partially overlapped with SRS and in this case, the last SC-FDMA symbol is also removed from the calculation of available PUSCH REs in LTE. In scenario (C), there is no overlap between PUSCH and SRS, so in this case the last OFDM symbol is counted in the calculation of available PUSCH REs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Since both the subframes for SRS transmission and the maximum SRS bandwidth in a cell are signaled to all UEs semi-statically, a UE can perform PUSCH rate matching when a PUSCH is scheduled in a subframe.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">For LTE Release 16, a work item was approved in June 2018 for improving LTE DL Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) efficiency enhancements [3].

Preferably, the same Downlink Control Information (DCI) parameter (i.e., the same DCI field) is used to triggering aperiodic SRS for both the first and second type of SRS. Embodiments are disclosed herein to provide various ways in which, upon receiving DCI including the parameter to trigger aperiodic SRS, the UE decides whether to transmit the first type of aperiodic SRS in accordance with the first SRS configuration or to transmit the second type of aperiodic SRS in accordance with the second SRS configuration. As discussed below, this decision may be made based on the transmission time (e.g., subframe) in which the aperiodic SRS is to be transmitted (e.g., where the first and second SRS configurations apply to different sets of UL subframes), based on an indicator received by the UE from the network (e.g., via Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling or via Medium Access Control (MAC) Control Element (CE)), or based on a value of the parameter (e.g., different values are mapped to different SRS configurations).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0092">In a first embodiment (&#x201c;Embodiment 1&#x201d;), whether legacy SRS or Release 16 SRS configuration is triggered is determined using the UL normal subframe in which the aperiodic SRS trigger in DCI is received.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0093">In a second embodiment (&#x201c;Embodiment 2&#x201d;), whether legacy SRS or Release 16 SRS configuration is triggered is determined using one or more higher layer parameters that activate one of the legacy SRS configuration or the Release 16 SRS configuration.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0094">In a third embodiment (&#x201c;Embodiment 3&#x201d;), whether the legacy SRS configuration or Release 16 SRS configuration is triggered is determined using MAC CE that activates one of the legacy SRS configuration or the Release 16 SRS configuration.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0095">Preferably, in Embodiments 1, 2, and 3, aperiodic SRS for both legacy SRS and Release 16 SRS is triggered with the same length SRS request field in DCI.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0096">Certain embodiments may provide one or more of the following technical advantage(s).

At subframe n, the UE receives an SRS trigger in DCI. Assuming K<sub>p</sub>=2, the first SRS subframe n+k configured for the UE that satisfies k&#x2265;K<sub>p </sub>is subframe n+3, which is configured for legacy SRS transmission.

At subframe m, the UE receives another SRS trigger in DCI, and the first SRS subframe m+k configured for the UE that satisfies k&#x2265;K<sub>p </sub>is subframe m+3. The UE then transmits a Release 16 SRS at subframe m+3. As illustrated in the example, whether a legacy or Release 16 SRS is transmitted after receiving an SRS trigger in DCI is determined by the first available SRS subframe, n+k, for the UE that satisfying k&#x2265;K<sub>p</sub>. If the first available SRS subframe n+k is configured for legacy SRS, then a legacy SRS is transmitted.

In some such embodiments, the Release 16 SRS subframe configuration and legacy SRS subframe configuration have different subframe offsets so as to ensure that legacy and Release 16 SRS subframes never collide. In some other embodiments, the subframe offset is the same for the legacy and Release 16 SRS subframe configurations, but when the Release 16 and legacy subframes collide, the Release 16 subframe configuration has priority. That is, if the said positive integer multiple is N, every Nth SRS subframe will be a Release 16 SRS subframe while the remaining N-1 SRS subframes will be legacy SRS subframes.

One example of such a rule is that the colliding subframe is classified as a Release 16 SRS subframe. Another example is that the colliding subframe is classified as a legacy SRS subframe.

As illustrated, a base station configures a UE with a first SRS configuration for a first type of aperiodic SRS, which in this example is legacy aperiodic SRS (step <b>900</b>). This first SRS configuration is for a first set of UE-specific SRS UL normal subframes. The base station also configures the UE with a second SRS configuration for a second type of aperiodic SRS, which in this example is Release 16 aperiodic SRS (step <b>902</b>). This second SRS configuration is for a second set of UE-specific SRS UL normal subframes.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0105">The base station sends, to the UE, DCI triggering aperiodic SRS (step <b>904</b>). The DCI includes a parameter, which in this example is an SRS request field, that is used regardless of whether the request is for the first or second aperiodic SRS type (e.g., the SRS request field is one bit for DCI format 0/2B/2C/2D and two bits in DCI format 4/4A/4B regardless of whether legacy or Release 16 aperiodic SRS is being requested). Whether Release 16 SRS or legacy SRS is triggered depends on the UE-specific SRS UL normal subframe in which the aperiodic SRS is triggered.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0106">In this regard, the UE determines the SRS configuration to use for the triggered aperiodic SRS transmission based on the subframe in which the aperiodic SRS transmission is to be transmitted (step 906). For instance, in some embodiments, the DCI is received in subframe n, and the aperiodic SRS transmission is to occur in subframe n+k. In this case, if subframe n+k is in the first set of UE-specific SRS UL normal subframes, then the UE determines that the first SRS configuration is to be used and, thus, that the first type of SRS is to be transmitted. On the other hand, if subframe n+k is in the second set of UE-specific SRS UL normal subframes, then the UE determines that the second SRS configuration is to be used and, thus, that the second type of SRS is to be transmitted. As discussed above, in some embodiments, there may be a collision (i.e., subframe n+k is a subframe that is in both the first set of UE-specific SRS UL normal subframes and the second set of UE-specific SRS UL normal subframes). In this case, the UE may then determine which of the SRS configurations to use based on, e.g., priority or some other criterion such as, e.g., periodicity of the two sets of UE-specific SRS UL normal subframes, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0107">The UE then transmits SRS in accordance with the determined SRS configuration (step <b>908</b>).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 2: Higher Layer Parameter(s) for Switching Between Release 16 SRS and Legacy SRS</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0108">In this embodiment, a Release 16 UE is configured with a higher layer parameter (e.g., a RRC parameter) to switch between aperiodic triggering of legacy SRS and Release 16 SRS. If the higher layer parameter is set to one value, then the DCI triggers the legacy SRS; and, if the higher layer parameter is set to another value, then the DCI triggers the Release 16 SRS.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0109">In some specific embodiments, when multiple SRS configurations are configured for a UE, the higher layer parameter may be configured per SRS configuration (i.e., per legacy SRS configuration and per Release 16 SRS configuration), and it may activate one of the DCI formats. For example, the higher layer parameter included in the legacy SRS configuration can be set to indicate legacy SRS transmission when triggered using DCI format 0, while the higher layer parameter included in the Release 16 SRS configuration can be set to indicate that Release 16 SRS is not to be triggered by DCI format 0. In this example, when aperiodic SRS is triggered using DCI format 0, the UE interprets this as legacy SRS being triggered. In a counter-example, the higher layer parameter included in the legacy SRS configuration can be set to indicate that legacy SRS is not to be triggered by DCI format 0, while the higher layer parameter included in the Release 16 SRS configuration can be set to indicate that Release 16 SRS is triggered by DCI format 0. In this counter-example, when aperiodic SRS is triggered using DCI format 0, the UE interprets this as Release 16 SRS being triggered. Although the examples here are presented for DCI format 0, this embodiment can be easily extended to other DCI formats such as 1A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 6-0A, 6-1A, 7-0A, 7-1E, 7-1F, 7-1G, 4, 4A, 4B, and 7-0B.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0110">This embodiment may for instance be particularly useful in the following scenario. Since one interesting use case for Release 16 multi-symbol SRS is to provide better SRS channel estimation performance for reciprocity-based DL precoding purposes, the eNB may configure the DL DCI formats such as 2B, 2C, and 2D to be associated with Release 16 SRS configurations, while the UL DCI formats such as 4A and 4B may be configured to be associated with the legacy SRS configuration. This is beneficial because the eNB can then trigger a multi-symbol SRS (which is used for DL precoder determination purposes) with the same DCI that scheduled the DL Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH). That is, the eNB does not have to send a UL DCI to trigger the SRS in this case, which potentially saves DCI overhead since the UE may not have UL data in its buffer. Conversely, when SRS needs to be triggered for UL link adaptation purpose, the eNB can trigger that SRS with the same UL DCI which also schedules the UL Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), thereby no DL DCI needs to be transmitted for SRS request purposes. Since there is a higher layer mapping between each type of DCI and the associated SRS configuration which is suitable to be associated with each type of DCI, overhead and latency is optimized.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates the operation of a base station (e.g., an LTE eNB) and a UE in accordance with at least some of the aspects of Embodiment 2 described above.

When an SRS configuration is triggered, either the legacy or Release 16 SRS is transmitted depending on the value indicated in the bit field in DCI for SRS triggering. An example of associating an SRS configuration with either legacy or Release 16 SRS when more than one bit is used in a DCI for SRS triggering is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In this example, if the bit field value indicates &#x2018;01&#x2019;, then a legacy SRS corresponding to SRS configuration 1 is transmitted by the UE.

Each such SRS configuration can be either a legacy or Release 16 SRS configuration. This may be achieved for instance by assigning each SRS configuration (whether legacy or Release 16) an SRS configuration Identity (ID) (which may be an integer) and then referring to the SRS configuration IDs in the SRS trigger state definition. Alternatively, the each trigger state may be defined as a new RRC Information Element (IE) with a CHOICE structure, where one bit in the ASN.1 code indicates if the IE is of either &#x201c;legacy SRS configuration type&#x201d; or &#x201c;Release 16 SRS configuration type&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0117">A benefit of this embodiment is that the eNB can, for each possible SRS occasion, choose if it wants to trigger a legacy or a Release 16 SRS without having to wait for specific subframes for each of the dedicated types. For instance, the eNB may, depending on the current traffic load at the time of SRS triggering, choose if it intends to schedule Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) which may require higher SRS Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and therefore be motivated to trigger a Release 16 multi-symbol SRS or intended to schedule Single-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (SU-MIMO) which may require comparably lower SRS SINR whereby a legacy single-symbol SRS may be sufficient.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates the operation of a base station (e.g., an LTE eNB) and a UE in accordance with at least some of the aspects of Embodiment 3 described above.

Different values of the SRS request field (i.e., different codepoints or values of the two or more bits) are mapped to different ones of the SRS configurations.

Examples of network nodes include, but are not limited to, Access Points (APs) (e.g., radio APs), Base Stations (BSs) (e.g., radio base stations, Node Bs, eNBs, and gNBs). Base stations may be categorized based on the amount of coverage they provide (or, stated differently, their transmit power level) and may then also be referred to as femto base stations, pico base stations, micro base stations, or macro base stations. A base station may be a relay node or a relay donor node controlling a relay. A network node may also include one or more (or all) parts of a distributed radio base station such as centralized digital units and/or Remote Radio Units (RRUs), sometimes referred to as Remote Radio Heads (RRHs). Such RRUs may or may not be integrated with an antenna as an antenna integrated radio. Parts of a distributed radio base station may also be referred to as nodes in a Distributed Antenna System (DAS). Yet further examples of network nodes include Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) equipment such as MSR BSs, network controllers such as Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) or BS Controllers (BSCs), Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs), transmission points, transmission nodes, Multi-Cell/Multicast Coordination Entities (MCEs), core network nodes (e.g., Mobile Switching Centers (MSCs), MMEs), Operation and Maintenance (O&#x26;M) nodes, Operations Support System (OSS) nodes, Self-Organizing Network (SON) nodes, positioning nodes (e.g., Evolved Serving Mobile Location Center (E-SMLCs)), and/or Minimization of Drive Tests (MDTs).
