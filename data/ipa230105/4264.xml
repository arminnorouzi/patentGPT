For example, a device using the mechanisms described herein can cause a user interface that includes media identifier elements corresponding to various videos that can be streamed to the device to be presented. These media identifier elements can be presented, for example, in a grid of media identifier elements, as a column of media identifier elements, as a row of media identifier elements, as multiple rows of media identifier elements with each row representing a group of related media assets, and/or using any other suitable technique or techniques.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can receive directional inputs (e.g., issued by a user input device), and can highlight a particular media identifier based on the received directional input. For example, the mechanisms described herein can cause various media identifiers corresponding to videos to be sequentially highlighted in response to a device using the mechanisms receiving directional inputs. In a more particular example, the mechanisms described herein can cause a first media identifier corresponding to a first video to be highlighted. Upon receiving a request to navigate to the right, the mechanisms described herein can cause a second media identifier corresponding to a second video to be highlighted, where the second media identifier is presented to the right of the first media identifier in the user interface.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can cause a menu element to be presented in association with the currently highlighted media identifier element. For example, the menu element can be presented in the user interface near a position of the currently highlighted media identifier element such that the menu element can be navigated to from the currently highlighted media identifier element using a single directional input. Additionally, in some embodiments, each time a directional input is received, the mechanisms described herein can cause a new media identifier element to be highlighted, the mechanisms can determine whether the menu element is in a position that is associated with the newly highlighted media identifier element. If the menu element is not associated with the newly highlighted media identifier element, the mechanisms described herein can cause the menu element to be presented at a new position that is associated with the newly highlighted media identifier element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, an example of a process <b>100</b> for navigating a user interface using directional controls is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, process <b>100</b> can begin at <b>102</b> by causing a user interface that includes media identifier elements to be presented. In some embodiments, each of the media identifiers can be associated with a particular media asset. For example, the user interface presented at <b>102</b> can be a user interface for selecting a media asset and the media identifier elements can identify the media asset.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, media identifier elements can identify any type of media asset. For example, media assets can include audio and/or video media. As another example, media assets can include print media or image media. As still another example, media assets can include a collection of media assets, such as a playlist of videos, a playlist of songs, a collection of images, etc. As a further example, media assets can include subscription based media, such as podcasts, online magazine subscriptions, etc. As another further example, media assets can include interactive media, such as applications and video games. As another further example, media assets can include any suitable combinations of these assets and/or any other suitable assets</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the media assets can be stored locally on a device executing process <b>100</b> and/or remotely. For example, media assets can include media assets such as video files or audio files that are stored locally and can be played back, copied, deleted, organized and/or otherwise used by the device executing process <b>100</b>. As another example, media assets can include streaming media assets such as streaming video assets, streaming audio assets, live streamed video, live streamed audio, and/or any other media asset that can be streamed by the device executing process <b>100</b>. As still another example, media assets can include media assets available for download to the device executing process <b>100</b> by purchasing the asset, borrowing the asset, renting the asset, as a freely downloadable asset, etc. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, an identifier element that identifies any sort of asset can be included in the user interface. For example, search results can be presented in the user interface and identifiers for the search results can be presented with, or in lieu of, the media identifier elements. Note that search results can be search results that include media identifier elements.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, media identifier elements can include any suitable information for presentation. For example, media identifier elements can include images, text, video, audio, and/or any other suitable information for presentation. In some embodiments, how a particular media identifier element is presented can be based on one or more items of metadata associated with the media asset with which the media identifier is associated. For example, the media identifier element can include title information based on title metadata of the media asset. As another example, the media identifier element can include an image based on thumbnail metadata of the media asset and/or a frame of image data from the data of the media asset.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, how the media identifier element is presented can be based on a type of media asset with which the media identifier element is associated. For example, a media identifier element for a video asset can include information identifying the media asset as a video. As another example, the media identifier element for a playlist of media assets can include information identifying the media asset as a playlist of other media assets.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the user interface can have any suitable layout and can include selectable and non-selectable elements. For example, the user interface can include graphical elements that are non-selectable, such as background graphics, descriptive information of other elements in the user interface, and/or any other suitable non-selectable graphics. As another example, the user interface can include graphical elements that are selectable such as the media identifier elements described herein, one or more menu elements and/or menu option elements, navigational elements, and/or any other suitable selectable elements. In some embodiments, the user interface can include one or more hidden elements that can be navigated to by a user performing a suitable action. Such hidden elements can be selectable and/or non-selectable. Additionally or alternatively, selectable elements can become non-selectable elements and vice versa by a user performing a suitable action, in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, a group or groups of media identifier elements can be presented within the user interface in any suitable arrangement. For example, the media identifier elements can be arranged as a column of media identifier elements. As another example, the media identifier elements can be arranged as a row of media identifier elements. As yet another example, the media identifier elements can be arranged as a grid of media identifier elements. As still another example, the media identifier elements can be arranged in any suitable pattern. As a further example, the media identifier elements can be arranged in a non-uniform pattern within the user interface (e.g., scattered randomly about the user interface). In some embodiments, the media identifier elements can be presented with any suitable spacing. example, the media identifier elements can be presented as tiles that are directly adjacent to one another (e.g., by row, by column, in a grid, etc.). As another example, media identifier elements can be presented using uniform spacing in one or more directions. In a more particular example, media identifier elements in a same row (or column) can be uniformly spaced. In another more particular example, a space between rows (or columns) of media identifier elements can be uniform. As yet another example, spacing between media identifier elements can be based on an amount of available space in the user interface, a number of media identifier elements being presented, and/or any other suitable factors. In some embodiments, spacing of media identifier elements can be dynamic and/or can be based on a layout of one or more other elements that that are presented by the user interface.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, one or more of the media identifiers at various positions with the user interface can be different sizes, where the size of a media identifier can be based on any suitable factor or factors. For example, the size of the media identifier element can be based on the position of the media identifier element in the user interface. As another example, the size of the media identifier element can be based on the amount of information presented by the media identifier element in the user interface (e.g., a media identifier element with a longer title can be larger). As yet another example, the size of the media identifier element can be based on the length and/or size of the media asset to which the media identifier elements corresponds (e.g., a longer video asset can have a larger media identifier element). As still another example, the size of the media identifier element can be based on an importance of the media asset to which the media identifier corresponds, which importance can be determined on any suitable basis (e.g., user assigned, by popularity, etc.).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an example <b>200</b> of a user interface in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.

For example, a media identifier element at a particular position can be highlighted initially after process <b>100</b> starts. The default media identifier element can be any media identifier element in any suitable position, such as an upper left media identifier element, a center media identifier element, a left-center media identifier element, or any other suitable position. Additionally or alternatively, process <b>100</b> can cause a media identifier to be highlighted in response to receiving a directional input. For example, until a directional input is received, process <b>100</b> can inhibit any media identifier from being highlighted, and upon receiving a directional input, can highlight a media identifier element based on the input. The media identifier element that is highlighted in response to receiving the directional input can be a media identifier element at a position based on the directional input (e.g., an upper media identifier element can be highlighted in response to receiving an &#x201c;up&#x201d; input), and/or can be a media identifier element at a default position (e.g., where there are multiple default positions and a directional input selects among the multiple default positions).
