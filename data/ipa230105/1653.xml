Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to the European Patent Application No. 21 175 032.8 filed May 20, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosed subject matter relates to a light projector module and a method of manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Light projector modules are commonly used in virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) glasses, helmets or head-up displays for a broad range of applications like navigation, training, entertainment, education or work. A light source emits one or usually three (red, green, blue) light beams carrying an image comprised of pixels onto a moving micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) mirror which deflects the light beams into subsequent directions (angles), one direction (angle) per pixel of the image. For example, the MEMS mirror oscillates fast about a vertical axis and slowly about a horizontal axis to sweep the directions and, thus, scan the light beam/s over the pixels of a display area row by row and line by line.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In VR applications, the display area is typically a (miniature) reflective screen in front of the user's eye. In AR applications the display area is a semi-transparent combiner which redirects the light beam/s towards the user's eye while concurrently superposing them with light field from a surrounding. In either case the cornea and the lens of the user's eye focus each light beam from a specific direction onto one image point on the retina, so that all image points on the retina then form the image perceived by the user. In head mounted displays the light projector may even project the scanned light beam/s directly into the user's eye, without any reflective screen or semi-transparent combiner. In general video beamer applications the light projector module can be used to project an image onto an external screen like a reflective wall or a movie screen.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In all these applications collimating and directing the light beam/s as good as possible is critical to obtain a sharp, undistorted and evenly lit image. Usual light sources such as laser diodes, however, do not emit perfectly collimated light beams so that separate collimation lenses need to be added downstream. The focal length and the position of these lenses needs to be specifically tailored to the mounting position, wavelength and type of the light source used in the projector module. When the light source emits multiple light beams of different colours, in general one or more lenses have to be individually positioned for each light beam.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the prior art a specific light source is first assembled with specifically tailored collimation lenses, which involves a first relative positioning (aligning) step between the light source and the lenses, before this sub-assembly is joined with the MEMS scanning assembly. The MEMS scanning assembly contains a moving MEMS mirror with individual mounting tolerances which need to be taken into account, too. The joining step hence requires a second relative positioning (aligning) step between the light source/lens sub-assembly and the MEMS scanning assembly. This two-fold alignment process significantly increases labour time and costs for manufacturing a high quality light projector module.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present disclosed subject matter to overcome the inconveniences of the state of the art and provide a light projector module of high quality which can be manufactured in a fast and cost-efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is achieved in a first aspect of the disclosed subject matter with a method of manufacturing a light projector module, comprising the steps of:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">firstly, providing a base plate with two opposite sides, a light source mounted on the base plate for emitting at least one light beam, and a micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) scanning assembly mounted on the base plate at a distance from the light source for scanning the at least one light beam over a display area, wherein the base plate has, between the light source and the MEMS scanning assembly, a mounting surface accessible at one side of the base plate;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">secondly, positioning a set of one or more lenses on the mounting surface and adjusting the position of the one or more lenses of the set while the light source is emitting and the at least one light beam projected by the light projector module is monitored in the display area; and lastly</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">mounting the one or more lenses of the set in the adjusted position fixedly on the base plate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The disclosed method allows for an aligning of the entire light projector module in one single step during the manufacturing process. In particular, the light source/lens sub-assembly and the MEMS scanning assembly can be fully joined first, whereupon the light source is turned on and only then, in a final single alignment step, the lens/es are put in and adjusted in position with regard to the overall beam output of the light projector module, e.g., by monitoring the light beam/s in the display area for a desired target alignment. This leads to a significantly faster and more cost-efficient manufacturing of the light projector module. Furthermore, by including the MEMS scanning assembly into the alignment step of the lenses any misalignments within the MEMS scanning assembly, e.g., positional or angular offsets or imperfections of the scanning mirror, can be compensated for in the same step.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further embodiment of the disclosed method not only the light source is turned on for the adjustment of the lens set but also the MEMS scanning assembly, so that also uneven curvatures of the surface of the scanning mirror or non-linear movements of the scanning mirror can be accounted for and compensated during the alignment of the light projector module.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">After adjusting the lens/es of the set they can be fixed in their adjusted positions by any suitable means, e.g., by clamping them down on the mounting surface, by drilling holes and screwing them down, or by gluing, soldering, or sintering them to the mounting surface, e.g., on their edges, etc. Optionally, the lens set is positioned on the mounting surface via an unhardened glue and then, after adjusting the position/s of the lens/es, is fixedly mounted by hardening the glue. This is least affecting the adjusted positions when mounting. The hardening of the glue can be furthered, e.g., by thermosetting or by ultraviolet (UV) light when a UV hardenable glue is used. During the adjusting and fixing operation the beam alignment is continuously monitored.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further embodiment of the disclosed subject matter the MEMS scanning assembly has an arm mounted on and extending from the other side of the base plate, a scanning mirror is movably mounted on the arm and facing the base plate, and a light guide is mounted on the base plate or the arm for directing the at least one light beam from the lens set to the scanning mirror, and, when adjusting the lens set, a separate prism or mirror is adjusted in position on the other side of the base plate, and then, when mounting the lens set, is fixedly mounted in its adjusted position on the base plate. In this way the hit point of the light beam/s on the scanning mirror can be adjusted independently of the collimation function of the lens set during the alignment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the arm is adjustably mounted on the base plate and, when adjusting the lens set, also the arm is adjusted. This allows for additional degrees of freedom of directing the output light beam/s of the light projector module.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Both measures, using a separate prism or mirror and using an adjustable arm, can be used specifically in AR glasses to compensate for face wrap and pantoscopic tilt angles of the eye glasses. In addition, the arm can be adapted to match various input locations of the display area. For example, adjusting the separate prism or mirror can be used for one dimension and adjusting the arm can be used for a perpendicular other dimension to compensate for both (perpendicular) tilt angles.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a second aspect there is provided a light projector module, comprising:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">a base plate with two opposite sides,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">a light source mounted on the base plate for emitting at least one light beam,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">a micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) scanning assembly mounted on the base plate at a distance from the light source for scanning the at least one light beam over a display area, and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">a set of at least one lens mounted on the base plate between the light source and the MEMS scanning assembly,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">wherein the base plate has, between the light source and the MEMS scanning assembly, a mounting surface accessible at one side of the base plate for adjustably positioning the lens/es of the set on the mounting surface during mounting.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Optionally, the MEMS scanning assembly has an arm mounted on and extending from the other side of the base plate, a scanning mirror being movably mounted on the arm and facing the base plate, in particular under an acute angle, and a light guide is mounted on the base plate or the arm for directing the at least one light beam from the lens set to the scanning mirror.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further embodiment, the light guide comprises a separately adjustable prism or mirror which is mounted on the other side of the base plate facing the scanning mirror.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In any of these embodiments, the light source may be configured to emit three mutually spaced light beams, the lens set may have at least one lens per light beam, and the light guide may include a beam combiner to combine the three light beams into a combined light beam directed to the scanning mirror.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In particular, the lens set may comprise, for each light beam, a first cylindrical lens with a first cylinder axis followed by a second cylindrical lens with a second cylinder axis perpendicular to the first cylinder axis.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The disclosed light projector module is particularly suited for miniature implementations, e.g., in VR or AR glasses. In particular, the light projector module may be attached to a temple of a spectacle frame or integrated into the temple.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As to the advantages of the disclosed light projector module and its various embodiments the same applies as to the manufacturing method of the disclosed subject matter detailed above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The disclosed subject matter will now be described by means of exemplary embodiments thereof with reference to the enclosed drawings, in which show:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the light projector module of the disclosed subject matter integrated into a pair of AR glasses in a perspective view;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref> the light projector module of the disclosed subject matter in a bottom perspective view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), a fragmentary top perspective view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), a fragmentary front perspective view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and in a fragmentary side view in front of an eye glass (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), respectively;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>face wrap tilt and pantoscopic tilt angles, respectively, of an eye glass with a schematic representation of an eyeball in top views; and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> sequential steps of the method of the disclosed subject matter for manufacturing the disclosed light projector module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> in two fragmentary perspective views.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses <b>1</b> comprising a spectacle frame <b>2</b>, a pair of eye glasses <b>3</b> and a pair of temples <b>4</b>.

The semi-transparent combiner <b>7</b> is supported by the spectacle frame <b>2</b> or an eyeglass <b>3</b> or integrated into the latter. The semi-transparent combiner <b>6</b>, e.g., a waveguide or a holographic combiner, superposes the image <b>6</b> projected by the light projector module <b>5</b> with a light field from a surrounding <b>8</b> so that the wearer of the AR glasses <b>1</b> can see the image <b>6</b> overlaying (&#x201c;augmenting&#x201d;) the surrounding <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The image <b>6</b> can, e.g., be monochromatic or coloured, a single image or part of a video sequence of images.

A similar application of the light projector module <b>5</b> could be in an AR helmet worn by a user, a handheld AR device like a smartphone with a camera, or an AR head-up display for a vehicle which all use a semi-transparent combiner <b>7</b> as the display area of the light projector module <b>5</b>. If desired, suitable re-lay optics can be interposed between the light projector module <b>5</b> and the semi-transparent combiner <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Instead of the semi-transparent combiner <b>7</b> the light projector module <b>5</b> could be used with any other display area, e.g., a conventional reflective projection screen such as a miniature screen mounted on the frame <b>2</b> of virtual reality (VR) glasses, or a projection wall or a movie screen, for example when the light projector module <b>5</b> is used as a miniature (or full-scale) video beamer. The light projector module <b>5</b> could even be used to directly project the image <b>6</b> directly into the user's eye, optionally with suitable optics therebetween.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The light projector module <b>5</b> can be built into a separate housing (not shown) or be directly integrated into the spectacle frame <b>2</b> or one of its temples <b>4</b>, i.e., use the spectacle frame <b>2</b> or a temple <b>4</b> as its housing.

For a full colour image <b>6</b> three light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> of the primary colours red, green and blue are used as known in the art. For improving image quality also more than three light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> of the primary colours red, green and blue can be used. To add further functionalities such as sensing, light beams with invisible wavelengths, e.g., infrared or ultra-violet, can be integrated as well.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> usually carry the image <b>6</b> in a time-multiplexed manner, i.e., the intensity values of the image pixels one after the other, e.g., row-by-row and line-by-line per image <b>6</b> comprised of a grid of pixels, and image-by-image per video comprised of a sequence of images <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The light source <b>16</b> can be of any kind including gas lasers, fibre lasers, semiconductor lasers etc. For miniaturisation the light source <b>16</b> may employ LEDs, micro LEDs or laser diodes, e.g., edge-emitting laser diodes or surface-emitting laser diodes, one per light beam <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> exit the light source <b>16</b> on a front side <b>20</b> thereof and are mutually spaced. The light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> may exit the side <b>20</b> at different positions, under different angles and different mutual spacings. In the shown example, the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> are parallel to each other and lie in a common plane which runs parallel to and at a distance from the one side <b>11</b> of the base plate <b>10</b>. This is not obligatory but makes it easier to combine the different light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> into a single combined light beam, as will be explained later on.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Downstream&#x2014;i.e., when seen in the direction of the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>&#x2014;of the light source <b>16</b> is a set of lenses <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> for collimating, shaping and/or directing the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>. For a light source <b>16</b> based on laser diodes the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> will usually diverge when exiting the side <b>20</b> so that they need to be collimated as best as possible for a sharp image <b>6</b>. The lenses <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> will therefore usually have the primary function of collimation. As the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> may diverge differently in a first axis <b>27</b> and a second axis <b>28</b> perpendicular to the first axis <b>27</b> (the &#x201c;fast&#x201d; and &#x201c;slow&#x201d; axes of laser diodes) the lenses <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> may need to collimate differently in those two axes <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To this end, an astigmatic lens may be used per light beam <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>, or two separate cylindrical lenses per light beam <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>, i.e., a first cylindrical lens <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> with a cylinder axis parallel to the first axis <b>27</b> followed by a second cylindrical lens <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> with a cylinder axis parallel to the second axis <b>28</b>. Of course, any other number, type and combination of lenses can be used in the lens set <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> to collimate the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> as desired, e.g., also so-called meta lenses. Furthermore, the lenses <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> could also shape, shift and/or deflect the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>, in particular to make them parallel and lie in a common plane parallel to the side <b>11</b>, if needed, for example by incorporating prisms, waveguides, diffractive gratings, meta surfaces and the like into the lenses.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lens set <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> is mounted on the base plate <b>10</b> in a substantially flat area thereof which constitutes a mounting surface <b>29</b>. On the mounting surface <b>29</b> the lenses <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> can be freely adjusted in position (&#x201c;aligned&#x201d;) with respect to the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>, as will be detailed later on.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The mounting surface <b>29</b> is accessible from the outside of the light projector module <b>5</b> at the side <b>11</b> of the base plate <b>10</b>, at least when the housing of the light projector module <b>5</b> is removed. The lens set <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> is mounted to the mounting surface <b>29</b> by, e.g., clamping it down with a clamp or top plate (not shown), by drilling holes and screwing it down, or by gluing, soldering, sintering or the like. In particular, the lens set <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> may first be loosely positioned on the mounting surface <b>29</b> with a thin layer of yet unhardened glue G (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), then the lenses <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> are adjusted in position for alignment, and finally are fixedly mounted to the mounting surface <b>29</b> by hardening the glue G. For example, an ultraviolet (UV) curable viscous glue G can be used, which is hardened by UV light for the final fixing of the lenses <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> in their adjusted positions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Downstream of the lens set <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> enter a light guide <b>30</b> which combines and directs them as a &#x201c;combined&#x201d; light beam <b>31</b> to a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) scanning assembly <b>32</b> on the other side <b>12</b> of the base plate <b>10</b>.

The aperture <b>40</b> can be in the form of a sheet metal plate, an opaque sticker or a selectively absorbing coating with a centre hole and will block any stray light outside of the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>, <b>31</b> from hitting the MEMS scanning assembly <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The MEMS scanning assembly <b>32</b> is configured to scan the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>, <b>31</b> received from the light source <b>16</b> via the lens set <b>21</b>-<b>26</b> and the light guide <b>30</b> over the desired display area, e.g., the semi-transparent combiner <b>7</b> of the AR glasses <b>1</b>, a reflective screen in front of the light projector module <b>5</b>, or even directly the user's eye via optional optics. For example, the MEMS scanning assembly <b>32</b> scans the light beam/s <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>, <b>31</b> row by row and/or line by line over the display area to project the image <b>6</b> pixel by pixel according to image pixel information modulated onto the light beams <b>17</b>-<b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the MEMS scanning assembly <b>32</b> has a scanning mirror <b>41</b> movably mounted on an arm <b>42</b> which extends from the other side <b>12</b> of the base plate <b>10</b>.
