level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a cleansing foam cosmetic composition comprising amino acid-based surfactants, and more particularly to a cleansing foam cosmetic composition in which a nonionic or ionic surfactant is not used, and which comprises amino acid-based surfactants consisting of only sodium lauroyl glutamate, sodium cocoyl glycinate, and potassium cocoyl glycinate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Arts</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, a cleansing agent is a general cosmetic used for cleanliness of the skin, and functions to maintain a skin state moistly and healthfully by removing sweat or sebum on a surface of the skin, various wastes, such as dust, aged horny substance, and so on, residual substance resulting from a makeup, and other pollutants.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Soap is frequently used as a cleansing agent for mainly washing the skin. However, the soap is strongly alkaline showing a pH value of about 9 to 10, and may give stimulation to a weak skin. Also, because most soap contains a small quantity of skin moisture element, and is made only for showing complete cleansing ability, when it is used in a dry skin, dehydration of the skin, or roughness of the skin may be shown.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cleansing foam is intended for making up for the disadvantages of this general soap. Thus, the cleansing foam has mainly been developed for washing of a sensitive skin, such as a face, so it almost has a low pH value (mainly neutrality or weak acidity) and contains a moisture element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing surfactants which have been used consist mostly of petroleum-based surfactants produced through several times of processes after extraction of crude oil, and these petroleum-based surfactants have been known as causing the problem of environmental pollution and the problem of stability on the human body. That is, if they are absorbed into the skin, a skin protection membrane may be damaged, and an itch or dermatitis may be generated, and if they are repeatedly used in the skin for a long time, the loss of hair, an allergy, a decline in immunity from atopy, and so on may be caused. Accordingly, due to these problems, studies for developing eco-friendly bio-surfactants to substitute for the petroleum-based surfactants tends to have actively been carried out. Although the biosurfactants have been defined as surface activity biomolecules having their wide application scopes, and generated by microorganisms, they have recently been defined as including all the surfactants produced using renewable natural vegetable materials.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Amino acids have often been used in synthesis of surfactants because they have excellent biodegradability, and surface activity capable of efficiently lowering interfacial energy, and amino acid-based surfactants synthesized using amino acids are advantageous in that they have excellent biocompatibility, multi-functionality, nontoxic and nonirritant properties, don't harm underwater life, and have excellent biodegradability. Furthermore, many amino acid-based surfactants comprising n-acyl amino acid based-surfactants have also been known as having sterilizing power against microorganisms causing diseases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, it has been reported that each of the amino acid-surfactants basically has two functional groups, an amine group and a carboxyl group, and because these amino acid-based compounds have low reactivity to a high-quality fatty or high-class alcohol, a large quantity of non-reactant remains. Furthermore, because an additional process is required for removing a non-reactive fatty acid, the amino acid-surfactants aren't advantageous economically largely. Thus, methods of synthesizing amino acid-based anionic biosurfactants using raw materials originating from nature, such as coconut oil, and so on have been studied.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, although general amino acid-based surfactants have the advantages of softly reacting to the skin and having excellent biodegradability, they are also disadvantageous in that foaming ability causing foam, or cleansing ability to remove pollutants is not sufficient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve this disadvantage of being inferior in cleansing ability, there were many studies intended for using various amino acid-surfactants in a state of being mixed with synthetic surfactants or amphiprotic surfactants, and so on (Patent Documents 1 to 5 below). According to circumstances, bubbling ability (foaming ability), washing ability (rinse property), or the like varies according to each mixed ratio of the surfactants.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to these surfactants, nonionic surfactants may further be used for realizing solubilization and emulsification dispersion functions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In general, when surfactants having different properties are used in a state of being mixed, their disadvantages are supplemented more than when only one kind of surfactant is used, and thus although there are partly utilized study methods, it is difficult to solve eco-friendly problems under an aspect.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, it has been required to develop a new cleansing foam cosmetic composition, foaming ability or cleansing ability of which doesn't decline, although surfactants of being soft while being low irritant to the skin, and having excellent biodegradability are used therein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0013">(Patent Document 1) Korean Patent No. 10-1042717 (registered on Jun. 13, 2011)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0014">(Patent Document 2) Korean Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-2017-0058146 (published on May 26, 2017)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0015">(Patent Document 3) Korean Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-2019-0090841 (published on Aug. 2, 2019)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0016">(Patent Document 4) International Patent Publication No. WO 2017/106276 (published on Jun. 22, 2017)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0017">(Patent Document 5) Chinese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. CN 105902411 A (published on Aug. 31, 2016)</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">(Non-Patent Document 1) Da Nan Yea, and al., &#x2018;Study on Synthesis of Amino-Acid based Anionic Surfactants from Coconut Oil, and Characterization of Interfacial Properties&#x2019;, Appl.

However, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the specifically disclosed exemplary embodiments, but should be understood as comprising all modifications, equivalents or alternations included in the idea and technical scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">Furthermore, the terms used in the present specification are only used for describing the specific exemplary embodiments, and are not intended for limiting the present invention. It should be understood that all the terms used herein including technical or scientific terms have the same meanings as those which are generally understood by those having ordinary skill in the art field to which the present invention pertains, unless they are defined differently.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">The inventors of the present invention made studies and efforts in order to get over the problems of the conventional arts, and as a result thereof, in the case of cleansing foam produced by mixing of only specific kinds of amino acid-based surfactants, it was found that the cleansing foam is low irritant to the skin, is friendly environmental, and also has excellent properties with respect to cleansing ability, foaming ability, and foam maintenance ability, and so on.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">As the ingredients of amino acid-based anionic surfactants penetrate into between the scalp, which is a surface targeted for cleansing, and the hair, the adhesive power of wastes becomes weakened so that cleansing can easily be performed by physical power. The appropriate cleansing property and foaming ability of these anionic surfactants act as important elements for removing wastes from the scalp and the hair.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">In general, although the amino acid-based surfactants have widely been known as representative surfactants for producing a hypoallergenic cleansing agent, and have also been known as having good biodegradability, it is problematic in that the cleansing agent does not foam well, slipperiness and stickiness often remain even after cleaning, and the cost of production rises.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">The amino acid-based surfactants preferable to be used in the cleansing foam cosmetic composition according to the present invention may appropriately be selected and used according to each purpose, and for example, surfactants based on amino acids of being acidic, such as N-acyl glutamates, and surfactants based on amino acids of alkalescency verging on neutrality shown in acyl glycinates can all be used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">In particular, it is preferable to select sodium lauroyl glutamate, sodium cocoyl glycinate, and potassium cocoyl glycinate which are obtainable from natural raw materials.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">The sodium lauroyl glutamate is obtainable from coconut oil or palm oil, and so on, and is an anionic surfactant ingredient originating from glutamic (amino acid), lauricacid, and natrium. It is a vegetable ingredient which may substitute for a synthetic surfactant and is characteristic in that biodegradability is excellent. Furthermore, because the sodium lauroyl glutamate acts as an active material so as to be mixed well by being absorbed into surfaces of each materials, it helps to stabilize constituent ingredients which are not mixed in a cosmetic. In particular, it can widely be utilized as a cleansing ingredient showing the same weak acidity as pH of the skin, and can provide an excellent feeling of use because it causes cleansing to be finished by a soft feeling of touch.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The sodium cocoyl glycinate and the potassium cocoyl glycinate are anionic surfactants based on a vegetable amino acid extracted from coconut fruit having a pH value of 8 to 9, have biodegradability as ingredients originating from nature, are not almost give stimulation to the skin, and are safe. Because foam generation ability is excellent, they can cause cleansing to be softly performed, and they can also cause soft foam, and provide high cleansing ability and a moisture use sensation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">Accordingly, when the three ingredients are appropriately mixed, high skin stability can be realized, a feeling of use can also be improved, and a mild cleansing foam cosmetic composition having an excellent cleansing or foam effect more than ever can be realized.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">According to a preferable embodiment of the present invention, each of the amino acid-based anionic surfactants has a content which ranges from 15 to 30 wt % with respect to a whole composition. Preferably, the content may be used in the range of 20 to 25 wt %. When the respective contents of the amino acid-based anionic surfactants are less than 15 wt %, it is problematic in that the elasticity of foam lacks, or ability of relieving stimulation to the skin decreases, and when their respective contents are more than 30 wt %, it is problematic in that a feeling of use is not good because hardness becomes higher.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">7 to 25 wt % of (A) sodium lauroyl glutamate, 7 to 25 wt % of (B) sodium cocoyl glycinate, and 1 to 5 wt % of (C) potassium cocoyl glycinate with respect to a total weight of the cleansing foam cosmetic composition are included. It is the most preferable that a weight ratio (A:B:C) of the amino acid-based surfactants is 10:10:1.4. If necessary, the weight ratio of the ingredients may also be selected within the range of 7:7:1 to 13:13:1.4.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">In the cleansing foam cosmetic composition according to the present invention, in addition to the aforesaid essential ingredients, ingredients used in general cosmetics, such as remaining purified water, an antioxidant, a cosmetic preparation, a moisturizing agent, a ultraviolet ray absorbent, a perfume, and so on may be mixed within the scope which does not influence the effects of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">According to the present invention, polyvalent alcohol is included as a moisturizing agent for providing a moisture feeling after cleansing.
