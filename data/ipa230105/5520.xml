The sense amplifier circuitry operates to sense or otherwise detect the stored data which is read from selected memory cells. The type and design of the sense amplifier circuitry which is implemented for a given memory device defines the robustness of bitline sensing, and strongly impacts performance metrics such as memory access time and overall power consumption/dissipation of the memory device. Recent trends have seen an increase in integration density of semiconductor memory devices and a reduction of operating voltages. An increase in memory density results in an increase in bitline capacitance which results in reduced memory speed (e.g., reduced memory access times) and increased power consumption.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Next generation sense amplifiers require single ended input. Single ended sense amplifiers are desirable as they lead to a simple top level interface to the READ/WRITE logic. Traditional differential sense amplifier circuits use latches, which consumes larger area and power, and skews requirements.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the disclosure include singled ended current sense amplifier circuits, and memory devices and systems which implement single ended current sense amplifier circuits to perform memory read operations.

The level of the constant voltage is set by the feedback amplifier MP<b>1</b>,MP<b>2</b>,MN<b>1</b>,MN<b>2</b> and MN<b>3</b>. In some embodiments, this voltage level will be close to 0.5&#xd7; VDD. The feedback amplifier will detect deviations for that voltage and open or close MN<b>3</b> as required to maintain the voltage level on RBL constant. At the same time this part of the circuit decreases the input impedance significantly compared to the prior art. This is the &#x201c;inner&#x201d; feedback loop of the input stage and one of the main features of the current mode sense amplifier. MP<b>3</b> is configured to limit the current it can provide to the RBL to a certain value much lower than the READ-1 current of an SRAM cell. During idle phases or READ-0 operations, only the bitline leakage has to be compensated by the current mode sense amplifier to keep the RBL voltage constant. This current can be supplied by MP<b>3</b> alone, the transistor will stay in triode mode, SENSE_N (node <b>18</b>) will be close to VDD, MP<b>4</b> and MP<b>6</b> stay turned off. During READ-1 operations, the current that needs to be supplied to the RBL to keep the voltage level constant exceeds the drive capability of MP<b>3</b>. MP<b>3</b> will switch from triode to saturated mode, its rds impedance will change from low to high. This is the main sensing mechanism. Consequently, the voltage on SENSE_N will drop until MP<b>4</b> is turned on and will provide (I<sub>READ1</sub>-I<sub>MP3</sub>) to the bitline. The input stage will control MP<b>4</b> by modulating SENSE_N as required to keep the RBL voltage level at 0.5&#xd7; VDD against the read devices of an SRAM cell that wants to pull down RBL to VSS. This is the function of the &#x201c;outer&#x201d; feedback loop of the input stage. In other words, if the input stage calls MP<b>4</b> for help, it is interpreted as a READ-1 operation by the sense amp. MP<b>6</b> is connected to the same SENSE_N node as MP<b>4</b>. MP<b>6</b> will also be turned on in this case and pull up the Q node (input of output inverter MP<b>9</b>/MN<b>10</b>) to VDD. MP<b>4</b> and MP<b>6</b> work in a current mirror configuration.

The output voltages of the amplifier are set by the transfer curve of the inverter and the input gate voltage which is controlled by SRAM cell and the feedback loop. The feedback is provided by the PMOS transistor MP<b>4</b>. Thus, the feedback loop eliminates the additional biases which are overhead in terms of transistors and difficult to maintain at corner conditions and get affected by device variabilities and cannot track cell voltages. In this case majority of work is done by SRAM cell, which may be an 8T cell as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Thus, tracking is well maintained.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the operation of the single ended current sense amplifier circuit is to detect if there is a cell read current flowing from the input of the circuit or not. The current input of the single ended current sense amplifier works like the output of a series voltage regulator, since it keeps the voltage of the connected net at a specific voltage. In this case, the voltage is roughly 0.5&#xd7; VDD and the connected net is the read bitline. During the evaluation window (i.e., the width of the wordline pulse), the read port of an 8T SRAM cell will sink a specific read current if the SRAM cell stores a 1 (READ-1) or no current (only leakage) if the SRAM cell stores a 0 (READ-0). In order to keep the read bitline voltage stable, the input of the single ended current sense amplifier has to have a very low input impedance. A stable bitline voltage is mandatory for a stable, strong read current.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some prior sense amplifier implementations, a simple source follower was used to define the read bitline voltage, which required a bias voltage that was connected to the gate of the bitline device. The source of the bitline device is the current input of the sense amplifier. In this prior implementation, the input impedance depends on the transconductance, gm, and the small signal output conductance, gds, of the bitline device, which a) requires a fairly large device and b) requires a bias voltage. Bias voltages are costly in terms of power and distribution wiring. In some prior implementations, a current sink device is required to set the correct bias current through the bitline device, and a an NFET device is required to as bleeder to keep the Q node at VSS in the READ-0 case. Those two devices required another bias voltage.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">One improvement of the embodiments of the present disclosure is the active feedback from the current sense amplifier input to the gate of NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b>, which has two advantages. First, the input impedance of the sense amplifier input is significantly reduced. This  helps the cell read current and therefore improves SNR. Second, the topology is self-biasing, so the bitline bias voltage can be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another improvement of the embodiments of the present disclosure is the elimination of the N bias voltage. In the embodiments disclosed herein, NMOS transistors MN<b>4</b>, MN<b>5</b> and MN<b>6</b> are active NFET loads (diode-style connected NFETS) that are used to set the N bias current.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The only remaining required bias voltage is VB_P, that sets the current threshold, that is used to differentiate between a READ-1 current and a READ-0 current.

The inverter is not working as logic gate but as a high gain inverting voltage amplifier. It self-biases itself in the high gain area of the Vin/Vout curve, so that the input of the inverter will be at &#x2212;0.5&#xd7; VDD and the output will be about one with higher than 0.5&#xd7; VDD. If the read bitline voltage should drop, the output of the feedback inverter will rise and open the NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b> more, allowing more current to flow in order to maintain the read bitline voltage at the steady state voltage. This is strong feedback with a high loop gain, that effectively reduces the input impedance by a factor of &#x3e;10 compared to the prior implementation. In other word, the bitline voltage will be much better controlled by the sense amp, which improves the read performance significantly.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Circuit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is basically using the same principle, but here the active feedback element is NOR-alike topology, that allows the introduction of the STBY pin. The prior implementation was lacking a way for at speed power gating. To shut of the sense amps in the prior implementation, all the 3 highly capacitive bias voltages had to be pulled either to VDD or to VSS. The power down and power up phase took &#x3e;10 clock cycles. Due to the much improved (lowered) impedance of the sense amplifier output, the SDBY pin provides a way to shut down and turn on the sense amplifier within less than a cycle. If STBY is &#x2018;1&#x2019;, the gate of NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b> is pulled to VSS, the current through the feedback NOR and MN<b>3</b> is turned off. At the same time the bleeder circuit formed by NMOS transistors MN<b>13</b> and MN<b>14</b> is turned on. In standby mode, the read bitline is not driven/controlled by the sense amplifier. The bleeder devices make sure that the read bitline rather floats down then up. If STBY switches to 1, due to the low input impedance, the sense amplifier is able to re-establish the steady state read bitline  voltage within less than 1 clock cycle.
