For example, &#x201c;outboard&#x201d; may indicate a relative position that is laterally farther from the centerline of the vehicle, or a direction that is away from the vehicle centerline. Conversely, &#x201c;inboard&#x201d; may indicate a direction toward the centerline, or a relative position that is closer to the centerline. Similarly, &#x201c;forward&#x201d; means toward the front portion of the vehicle, and &#x201c;rearward&#x201d; means toward the rear of the vehicle. In the absence of a host vehicle, the same directional terms may be used as if the vehicle were present. For example, even when viewed in isolation, a device may have a &#x201c;forward&#x201d; edge, based on the fact that the device would be installed with the edge in question facing in the direction of the front portion of the host vehicle.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">&#x201c;Coupled&#x201d; means connected, either permanently or releasably, whether directly or indirectly through intervening components.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">&#x201c;Resilient&#x201d; describes a material or structure configured to respond to normal operating loads (e.g., when compressed) by deforming elastically and returning to an original shape or position when unloaded.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x201c;Rigid&#x201d; describes a material or structure configured to be stiff, non-deformable, or substantially lacking in flexibility under normal operating conditions.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">&#x201c;Elastic&#x201d; describes a material or structure configured to spontaneously resume its former shape after being stretched or expanded.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;Processing logic&#x201d; describes any suitable device(s) or hardware configured to process data by performing one or more logical and/or arithmetic operations (e.g., executing coded instructions).

For example, an electronic controller may be configured to receive an input signal, compare the input signal to a selected control value or setpoint value, and determine an output signal to a control element (e.g., a motor or actuator) to provide corrective action based on the comparison. In another example, an electronic controller may be configured to interface between a host device (e.g., a desktop computer, a mainframe, etc.) and a peripheral device (e.g., a memory device, an input/output device, etc.) to control and/or monitor input and output signals to and from the peripheral device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">&#x201c;Providing,&#x201d; in the context of a method, may include receiving, obtaining, purchasing, manufacturing, generating, processing, preprocessing, and/or the like, such that the object or material provided is in a state and configuration for other steps to be carried out.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this disclosure, one or more publications, patents, and/or patent applications may be incorporated by reference.

In the event of any such conflict, including any conflict in terminology, the present disclosure is controlling.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In general, a self-balancing skateboard in accordance with the present teachings may include a board having a two deck portions on either side of a central opening. In examples described below, each deck portion is configured to support a respective foot of a user oriented as on a standard skateboard, such that the vehicle is ridden with the user facing approximately ninety degrees to the direction of travel. A single wheel (or side-by-side wheels) is supported in the central opening on an axle and driven by a motor (e.g., a hub motor). The board is therefore tiltable about the axis of the wheel (i.e., about an axis of rotation defined by the axle). An onboard electronic controller is configured to receive orientation information indicating an orientation of the board. In response to this orientation information, the controller causes the hub motor to propel the board, and provides a self-stabilizing feature.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, the skateboard includes a handle pivotably coupled to a portion of the board, such as to an axle mounting block of the board. The handle can be pivoted between a stowed configuration and a deployed configuration. In the stowed configuration, the handle is flipped up (or in some examples down) adjacent the hub motor. In the deployed configuration, the handle is pivoted down (or up) to extend away from the hub motor and provide a graspable carrying handle for the user.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, the vehicle has a fender, which is interchangeable with a substitute &#x201c;fender delete,&#x201d; which covers the connection points of the fender to the vehicle but does not extend to cover the vehicle wheel. The fender is removably coupled to a frame of the board and spans the opening between the deck portions. The fender has an arched portion covering an upper surface of the tire and a peripheral flange extending around the opening. The fender delete has a similar appearance, without the arched portion. In other words, it surrounds the periphery of the opening but does not overarch the tire or wheel.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some examples, the vehicle includes a status indicator (e.g., a battery charge indicator) including a plurality of illuminators viewable through a slot formed in an upper surface of the board. This enables easy viewing for the rider.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The vehicle includes footpads having concave upper surfaces configured to reduce foot fatigue and improve user control. One or more sensors embedded within the concave footpads have a three-dimensional shape to conform to the footpad concavity, and are configured to provide rider detection functionality.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some examples, the footpad sensors comprise a plastic laminate which can bend or curve in one direction but cannot easily bend in a compound curvature, e.g., without damaging internal circuitry. To accommodate the compound curvature of the concave footpad surface, slots (AKA &#x201c;cuts,&#x201d; &#x201c;slits,&#x201d; &#x201c;isolines,&#x201d; or &#x201c;channels&#x201d;) are provided along specific lines (e.g., diagonal from the outer corners). The slots facilitate conforming to the compound curvature of the footpad while relieving stress on the membrane.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, the footpad surface provides a concave surface by creating multiple regions, wherein each region has substantial curvature only in a single direction. In some examples, sensor traces of the membrane switch are aligned with the direction of curvature to prevent buckling. In some examples, ribs or ridges protrude from the footpad surface to fill in or retain the sensor slots. In some examples, computational flattening is utilized to convert the desired curved surface of the membrane into a flat pattern for manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some examples, the concave footpads include at least two portions: a rigid substrate (e.g., plastic) and a resilient layer (e.g., rubber or foam) disposed thereon. The rigid substrate may comprise a thermoplastic polymer, e.g., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and/or another suitable material. The resilient layer may comprise an elastomer, e.g., a synthetic and/or natural rubber or another suitably resilient material, e.g., a high density foam. In some examples, the resilient layer may include a plurality of downward-facing protrusions configured to be received in corresponding apertures in the rigid substrate to provide additional mechanical stability. In some examples, these protrusions are formed during an overmolding or injection molding process. In some examples, the injection molding process results in portions of the resilient layer passing through and around apertures and features of the underlying rigid substrate, such that the resilient layer and the rigid substrate cannot be separated mechanically in a nondestructive manner.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Aspects of the control systems described herein (e.g., electronic controllers, motor controllers, etc.) may be embodied as a computer method, computer system, or computer program product.

First and second deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may be formed of a same physical piece, may be unitary with the frame, or may be separate pieces. First and second deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may be included in the definition of board <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Vehicle <b>100</b> includes a wheel assembly <b>112</b> having a rotatable ground-contacting element <b>114</b> (e.g., a tire, wheel, or continuous track) disposed between and extending above first and second deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and a motor assembly <b>116</b> configured to rotate ground-contacting element <b>114</b> to propel the vehicle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and elsewhere, vehicle <b>100</b> may include exactly one ground-contacting element, disposed between the first and second deck portions. In some examples, vehicle <b>100</b> may include a plurality of ground-contacting elements (e.g., coaxial wheels).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Wheel assembly <b>112</b> is disposed between first and second deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and ground-contacting element <b>114</b> is coupled to motor assembly <b>116</b>. Motor assembly <b>116</b> includes an axle <b>126</b> (AKA a shaft), which couples motor assembly <b>116</b> to board <b>102</b>, e.g., by one or more axle mounts and one or more fasteners, such as a plurality of bolts. In some examples, axle <b>126</b> is coupled to board <b>102</b> by way of a suspension system. In some examples, motor assembly <b>116</b> is configured to rotate ground-contacting element <b>114</b> around (or about) axle <b>126</b> to propel vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, motor assembly <b>116</b> may include an electric motor, such as an electric hub motor, configured to rotate ground-contacting element <b>114</b> about axle <b>126</b> to propel vehicle <b>100</b> along the ground. For convenience, ground-contacting element <b>114</b> is hereinafter referred to as a tire or wheel, although other suitable embodiments may be provided.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">First and second deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are located on opposite sides of wheel assembly <b>112</b>, with elongate board <b>102</b> being dimensioned to approximate a skateboard. In some embodiments, the board approximates a longboard skateboard, snowboard, surfboard, or may be otherwise desirably dimensioned. In some examples, deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> of board <b>102</b> are at least partially covered with non-slip material portions <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> (e.g., grip tape or other textured material) to aid in rider control and protect underlying components.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Frame <b>104</b> may include any suitable structure configured to rigidly support the deck portions and to be coupled (directly or indirectly) to the axle of the wheel assembly, such that the weight of a rider is supported on tiltable board <b>102</b>, and the board has a fulcrum at the axle.

Deck portions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, as well as related features, are described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Shaft or axle <b>126</b> of motor assembly <b>116</b> is coupled to frame <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the axle may be directly attached to frame <b>104</b>, or may be coupled to the frame at each end through a respective connection or axle mounting block <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> (also referred to as an axle mount or a simply a mounting block). Axle <b>126</b> may be bolted or otherwise affixed to mounting blocks <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, e.g., at either end, which in turn may be bolted or affixed to frame <b>104</b> using suitable fasteners (e.g., by bolts <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>). Through-holes <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> may be provided in frame <b>104</b> for receiving fasteners of the axle and mounting blocks, thereby securing the components together. In some examples, as mentioned above, axle <b>126</b> is coupled to frame <b>104</b> by a suspension system (not shown).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Vehicle <b>100</b> has a pitch axis A<b>1</b>, a roll axis A<b>2</b>, and a yaw axis A<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Pitch axis A<b>1</b> is the axis about which tire <b>114</b> is rotated by motor assembly <b>116</b>. For example, pitch axis A<b>1</b> may pass through axle <b>126</b> (e.g., pitch axis A<b>1</b> may be parallel to and aligned with an elongate direction of axle <b>126</b>). Roll axis A<b>2</b> is perpendicular to pitch axis A<b>1</b>, and extends in direction D (i.e., the direction in which vehicle <b>100</b> is propelled by the motor assembly). For example, roll axis A<b>2</b> may correspond to a long axis of board <b>102</b>. Yaw axis A<b>3</b> is perpendicular both to pitch axis A<b>1</b> and to roll axis A<b>2</b>. Yaw axis A<b>3</b> is normal to a plane defined by deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Axes A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> are analogous to the Y and X axes (e.g., corresponding to horizontal), while axis A<b>3</b> is analogous to the Z axis (e.g., corresponding to vertical). Pitch axis A<b>1</b> and roll axis A<b>2</b> may lie in a plane of the board. In some embodiments, the pitch and roll axes may define this plane.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Tire <b>114</b> may be wide enough in a heel-toe direction (e.g., in a direction parallel to pitch axis A<b>1</b>) that the rider can balance in the heel-toe direction manually, i.e., by shifting his or her own weight, without automated assistance from the vehicle. Tire <b>114</b> may be tubeless, or may be used with an inner tube. In some examples, tire <b>114</b> may be a non-pneumatic tire. For example, tire <b>114</b> may be &#x201c;airless,&#x201d; solid, and/or may comprise a foam. Tire <b>114</b> may have a profile such that the rider can lean vehicle <b>100</b> over an edge of the tire (and/or pivot the board about roll axis A<b>2</b> and/or yaw axis A<b>3</b>) through heel and/or toe pressure to facilitate cornering of vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Motor assembly <b>116</b> may include any suitable driver of tire/wheel <b>114</b>, such as an electric hub motor <b>144</b> mounted within wheel <b>114</b>. The hub motor may be internally geared or may be direct-drive. The use of a hub motor facilitates the elimination of chains and belts, and enables a form factor that considerably improves maneuverability, weight distribution, and aesthetics. Mounting tire <b>114</b> onto hub motor <b>144</b> may be accomplished by either a split-rim design that may use hub adapters, which may be bolted on to hub motor <b>144</b>, or by casting a housing of the hub motor such that it provides mounting flanges for a tire bead directly on the housing of the hub motor.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>19</b></figref>, first bumper <b>122</b> (AKA the front bumper) is integrated into (or removably coupled to) a first end <b>146</b> of board <b>102</b> proximate first deck portion <b>106</b>, and second bumper <b>124</b> (AKA the rear bumper) is integrated into (or removably coupled to) a second end <b>148</b> of board <b>102</b> proximal second deck portion <b>108</b>.

Handle <b>150</b> is disposed on a lateral side of wheel <b>114</b>, adjacent hub motor <b>144</b>, and is transitionable between a first configuration, in which a graspable grip portion <b>152</b> of the handle is stowed in a position proximate the hub motor, and a second configuration, in which grip portion <b>152</b> is pivoted or folded into a position extending or protruding transverse to the stowed position, such that the grip portion may be engaged by a hand of the user to carry or transport the board. With the board in an operational position on a support surface, the grip of the handle may be substantially vertical in the first configuration (preventing breakage, interference with riding, etc.) and substantially horizontal in the second configuration. The first configuration may be referred to as the &#x201c;stowed&#x201d; position, the &#x201c;up&#x201d; position, the &#x201c;riding&#x201d; position, the &#x201c;operational&#x201d; position, the &#x201c;undeployed&#x201d; position, and/or the &#x201c;in&#x201d; position.

Handle <b>150</b> may be pivotably coupled to any suitable fixed feature of the vehicle, such as the frame, fender, or axle block. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, handle <b>150</b> is coupled to axle mounting block <b>134</b> by hinge <b>154</b>, e.g., on an inboard upper side of the block. In some examples, a magnetic tab is configured to contact and be biased toward (i.e., attracted to) mounting block <b>134</b> to retain handle <b>150</b> while in the stowed position. In some examples, a spring-loaded hinge (e.g., using a torsion spring) may be utilized in addition to or instead of the magnet arrangement.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Components of handle <b>150</b> may be constructed using injection-molded plastic and/or machined or cast metal.

For example, vehicle <b>100</b> may include a fender (AKA a full fender) configured to fully cover an upper periphery of tire <b>114</b>. The fender is coupled to frame <b>104</b>, e.g., using fasteners and/or magnetic connectors, and configured to prevent debris from being transferred from tire <b>114</b> to the rider, such as when tire <b>114</b> is rotated about pitch axis A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, and depicted variously in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>13</b></figref>, and elsewhere, the one or more electrical components of vehicle <b>100</b> may include a power supply <b>164</b>, a motor controller <b>166</b>, a rider detection device <b>168</b>, a power switch <b>170</b>, and a charge plug receptacle <b>172</b>. Further description is provided below, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Power supply <b>164</b> may include one or more batteries (e.g., secondary or rechargeable batteries), such as one or more lithium-ion batteries that are relatively light in weight and have a relatively high power density. In some examples, power supply <b>164</b> may include one or more lithium iron phosphate batteries, one or more lithium polymer batteries, one or more lithium cobalt batteries, one or more lithium manganese batteries, or a combination thereof. For example, power supply <b>164</b> may include sixteen (16) A123 lithium iron phosphate batteries (e.g., size 8050). The batteries of power supply <b>164</b> may be arranged in a 16S1P configuration, or any other suitable configuration.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Motor controller <b>166</b> will generally include suitable electronics for controlling the vehicle motor. For example, a microcontroller <b>174</b> and/or one or more sensors (or at least one sensor) <b>176</b> may be included in or connected to motor controller <b>166</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). At least one of sensors <b>176</b> may be configured to measure orientation information (or an orientation) of board <b>102</b>. For example, sensors <b>176</b> may be configured to sense movement of board <b>102</b> about and/or along the pitch, roll, and/or yaw axes. The motor may be configured to cause rotation of wheel <b>114</b> based on the orientation of board <b>102</b>. In particular, motor controller <b>166</b> may be configured to receive orientation information measured by the at least one sensor of sensors <b>176</b> and to cause motor assembly <b>116</b> to propel the electric vehicle based on the orientation information. For example, motor controller <b>166</b> may be configured to drive hub motor <b>144</b> based on received sensed movement of board <b>102</b> from sensors <b>176</b> via microcontroller <b>174</b> to propel and/or actively balance vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In general, at least a portion of the electrical components are integrated into board <b>102</b>. For example, board <b>102</b> includes a first environmental enclosure that houses power supply <b>164</b>, and a second environmental enclosure that houses motor controller <b>166</b>. The environmental enclosures are configured to protect the one or more electrical components from being damaged, such as by water ingress.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Vehicle <b>100</b> further includes a plurality of light assemblies, such as one or more headlight and/or taillight assemblies (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>), and a battery indicator. For example, a first headlight/taillight assembly (or first light assembly) <b>180</b> may be disposed on or at (and/or connected to) first end portion <b>146</b> of the board (e.g., at a distal end portion of first deck portion <b>106</b>), and a second headlight/taillight assembly <b>182</b> may be disposed on or at (and/or connected to) second end portion <b>148</b> of the board (e.g., at a distal end portion of second deck portion <b>108</b>).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Headlight/taillight assemblies <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> may be configured to reversibly light vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, assemblies <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> may indicate the direction that vehicle <b>100</b> is moving by changing color. For example, the headlight/taillight assemblies may each include one or more high output RGB and/or red and white LEDs (or other suitable one or more illuminators) <b>184</b> configured to receive data from microcontroller <b>174</b> (and/or a pitch sensor or sensors <b>176</b>, such as a 3-axis gyro(s) <b>186</b> or accelerometer(s) <b>188</b>) and automatically change color (e.g., from red to white, white to red, or a first color to a second color) based on the direction of movement of vehicle <b>100</b>. The first color shines in the direction of motion and the second color shines backward (e.g., opposite the direction of motion). For example, one or more of the headlight/taillight assemblies (e.g., their respective illuminators) may be coupled to microcontroller <b>174</b> via an LED driver, which may be included in or connected to motor controller <b>166</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the illuminators of assemblies <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> may include RGB/RGBW LEDs. In a preferred embodiment, each LED is individually addressable, such that user adjustment of lighting color is permitted. Additional functionality, such as turn signal indication/animation and/or vehicle state information (e.g., battery state, operational vs. disabled by interlock, etc.) may also be provided.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Assemblies <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> and their associated illuminators may be located in and/or protected by bumpers <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. For example, bumpers <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may include respective apertures <b>200</b>, <b>202</b>, through which illuminators may shine. Apertures <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> may be dimensioned to prevent the illuminators from contacting the ground. For example, apertures <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> may each have a depth or inset profile.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Vehicle <b>100</b> may also include a power supply status indicator, specifically a battery indicator <b>204</b> comprising one or more illuminators <b>206</b> (e.g., LEDs) disposed within a housing <b>208</b> of motor controller <b>166</b>. Battery indicator <b>204</b> may include any suitable illuminator(s) configured to indicate a state of power supply <b>164</b>, e.g., by way of a signal provided to the battery indicator by the microcontroller and/or directly or indirectly from the power supply. Battery indicator <b>204</b> is viewable by a rider, e.g., during operation of the vehicle, through an aperture or slot <b>210</b> formed in an upper side of one of the foot pads.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this example, battery indicator <b>204</b> is an LED strip visible to the rider. Seven illuminators <b>206</b> are provided, using RGB-capable LED lights, although more or fewer may be utilized. The LED strip is programmable, and configured to display a battery state of charge as a bar graph and/or by a color (e.g., starts green when fully charged, goes through yellow, to red when nearing full discharge). The LED strip may also flash error codes, display status of footpad zone activation (i.e., via rider detection system <b>168</b>), display alerts/alarms, blink code warnings, and/or the like. In some examples, LED behavior may be programmed to disappear while riding and only fade back in when stopped (or below a threshold speed). This mode of operation prevents the rider from looking down while riding. One or more of the above-described modes may be remotely selectable by a user. In some examples, the modes and, for example, a brightness adjustment, may be controllable from a software application running on a user's smartphone or other mobile device. In some examples, brightness may be based on either absolute brightness setting, or some other variable, e.g., a time of day adjustment (dimmer at night).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">To facilitate and enhance viewing of illuminators <b>206</b> through slot <b>210</b>, a portion of housing <b>208</b> includes a light pipe <b>212</b> extending from adjacent the illuminators to (and in some examples, into) the slot. Light pipe <b>212</b> may include any suitable structure configured to transmit light from the illuminators (e.g., mounted on a circuit board within the controller housing) to the slot <b>210</b>. For example, light pipe <b>212</b> may be an optical fiber or a solid transparent material, and may be flexible or rigid. In this example, light pipe <b>212</b> is formed as a wide column of solid transparent material to cover a linear array of LED illuminators at a lower end and to interface with or fit into slot <b>210</b> at an upper end. In some examples, an upper portion of light pipe <b>212</b> fills slot <b>210</b>, thereby plugging the slot and preventing or reducing the incursion of debris and the like. Light pipe <b>212</b> may be formed as a single piece with a lid <b>214</b> of housing <b>208</b>, which is coupled to the base of the housing. Some or all of housing <b>208</b> may comprise a transparent material (e.g., clear polycarbonate), which may include optical windows for the headlights and battery indicator LEDs. Areas of the housing that are not used as optical windows may be aggressively textured (e.g., on both the inside and outside surfaces) to prevent visibility into the controller housing. Using a clear material with etching or texturing, rather than assembling clear windows into an opaque controller housing, helps to simplify construction and prevent potential seal failure points.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, an illustrative arrangement of components within the front deck portion will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a partially exploded view of front deck portion <b>106</b>. As depicted, deck portion <b>106</b>, in this example, includes nonskid sheet <b>128</b>, which is layered on a membrane switch <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) of rider detection system <b>168</b>, which in turn is disposed on a first footpad <b>222</b> (AKA the front footpad). Footpad <b>222</b> may include any suitable rigid, generally planar structure configured to support the rider on board <b>102</b>. In this example, footpad <b>222</b> is thicker on one end, such that an upper surface of footpad <b>222</b> is ramped or curved upward slightly toward end <b>146</b> of the board. Footpad <b>222</b> is coupled directly to frame <b>104</b>, and supported thereon. One or more apertures <b>224</b> are provided in footpad <b>222</b> for receiving conductors (e.g., wires) to connect membrane switch <b>220</b> with motor controller <b>166</b>. Motor controller <b>166</b> is housed (at least partially) in housing <b>208</b>, which is disposed under footpad <b>222</b> within the board. An undercarriage is provided by an extension of front bumper <b>122</b> (e.g., the expanse of the bumper), or in some examples by a separate housing or expanse of rigid material.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Deck portion <b>108</b>, similarly includes nonskid sheet <b>130</b>, which is disposed on a second footpad <b>226</b> (AKA the rear footpad). Footpad <b>226</b> may include any suitable rigid, generally planar structure configured to support the rider on board <b>102</b>. In this example, footpad <b>226</b> is thicker on one end, such that an upper surface of footpad <b>226</b> is curved upward slightly toward end <b>148</b> of the board. Footpad <b>226</b> is coupled directly to frame <b>104</b>, and supported thereon. Power supply <b>164</b> is housed under footpad <b>226</b>, inside an upper battery cover <b>228</b> and a lower battery housing <b>230</b>. An undercarriage is provided by the battery housing and/or an extension of rear bumper <b>124</b>, or in some examples by a separate housing or expanse of rigid material.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, each of the concave footpads may include a rigid substrate <b>223</b> with a compliant or resilient layer <b>225</b> disposed thereon. The rigid substrate may include any suitable material and structure configured to support a rider's weight, such as a thermoplastic polymer, e.g., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and/or the like. The resilient layer may comprise an elastomer, e.g., a synthetic and/or natural rubber, or another suitably resilient material, e.g., a high-density foam. In some examples, resilient layer <b>225</b> is overmolded onto rigid substrate <b>223</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Rigid substrate <b>223</b> and resilient layer <b>225</b> may be coupled by one or more mating features configured to provide structural security and additional mechanical stability. For example, resilient layer <b>225</b> may include a plurality of downward-facing protrusions <b>227</b> received in corresponding apertures <b>229</b> in the rigid substrate. Additionally, or alternatively, resilient layer <b>225</b> may have a connecting rail <b>231</b> mated with a corresponding slot structure <b>233</b> of rigid substrate <b>223</b>, such that, once formed together (e.g., by injection molding the resilient layer onto and through the rigid substrate), the resilient layer and the rigid substrate comprise a single piece incapable of nondestructive disassembly.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, footpad <b>222</b> and footpad <b>226</b> have a ramped profile in the direction of travel, such that an end portion of each footpad is ramped upward in a direction away from the wheel. In some examples, one or both footpads may be unramped or differently ramped. In the present example, the ramped profile is concave-up in the longitudinal direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> show the footpad with membrane switch <b>220</b> installed. One or both of footpads <b>222</b> and <b>226</b> may include the membrane switch, although examples depicted herein have the membrane switch on a front footpad. In some examples, the footpad is monolithic and made from a single material, instead of the two-layered, interlocked version described above.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Whether or not the footpad is ramped in a longitudinal direction, footpad <b>222</b> and footpad <b>226</b> may be concave, having a concave-up profile in a heel-toe direction (i.e., laterally). The heel-toe concave-up profile may also be described as being in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel, in a direction parallel to the axle, in a direction orthogonal to the direction of travel, and/or in a direction parallel to the pitch or tilt axis. In some examples, one or both footpads are laterally concave and longitudinally ramped. In some examples, one or both footpads are concave-up in more than one direction or on more than one axis. In some examples, one or both footpads have a longitudinal profile that is ramped and concave-up, and a lateral profile that is concave-up.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this context, a concave footpad (i.e., concave-up laterally) may have any suitable smooth, continuous, and/or faceted concave cross-sectional profile. For example, footpad <b>222</b> and/or footpad <b>226</b> may have a radial concavity (e.g., having a generally constant radius of curvature), a progressive concavity (e.g., with a smaller radius of curvature closer to lateral edges than at the center), a W-shaped concavity (e.g., with a raised portion in the center), or a tub-shaped or flat-cave concavity (e.g., with a generally flat center and raised lateral edges).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Membrane switch <b>220</b> is disposed on the concave front footpad, e.g., between resilient layer <b>225</b> and an upper layer of grip tape, and therefore has a similarly concave profile to conform to the footpad. Membrane switch <b>220</b> comprises a plastic (e.g., waterproof) laminate housing one or more (e.g., two) force sensitive resistors or other pressure sensors. Membrane switch <b>220</b> is an expanse sized and configured to enable simultaneous detection of a toe portion and a heel portion of a rider's foot. Membrane switch <b>220</b> comprises a first pressure transducer <b>220</b>A configured to detect pressure from a first (e.g., toe) portion of the rider's foot, and a second pressure transducer <b>220</b>B configured to detect pressure from a second (e.g., heel) portion of the rider's foot. In other words, the membrane switch is sized and shaped such that one pressure sensor may be disposed under a toe region of the footpad and the other pressure sensor may be disposed under a heel region of the footpad, such that the presence and stance of a rider can be detected based on which sensor or sensors are activated. Although transducer <b>220</b>A and transducer <b>220</b>B have been described as the &#x201c;toe&#x201d; and &#x201c;heel&#x201d; sensors, the roles of these transducers may be reversed depending on user preference or riding style, e.g., by way of a user-configurable setting.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Membrane switch <b>220</b> may be bendable (or flexible, e.g., slightly flexible) in one direction (e.g., on one axis), but may not be capable of compound curvature (e.g., simultaneously on two or more axes) without suffering stress and/or possible failure (e.g., sensor damage). Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, membrane switch <b>220</b> includes a pair of slots <b>221</b> to facilitate conforming to the curvature of footpad <b>222</b> and relieve stress on the membrane caused by conforming to the underlying concavity and/or ramped profile of the footpad. Membrane switch <b>220</b> has a pair of angled slots in an outer end, forming an end portion and two side portions, such that the side portions of the membrane switch are configured to bend upward to conform to the concave profile of the footpad and the end portion of the membrane switch is configured to bend upward to conform to the ramped profile. The angled slots are each oriented from an outer corner of the membrane toward a central area of the membrane. More or fewer slots may be utilized, depending on the desired concavity and conformity. Corresponding ribs <b>235</b> (AKA ridges) protrude upward from resilient layer <b>225</b> to accommodate slots <b>221</b>, e.g., to guide placement and minimize unwanted movement of membrane switch <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The concave surface of the footpads may be formed by multiple sloped portions or facets, wherein each facet is planar or has substantial curvature only in a single direction. In some examples, sensor traces of the membrane switch are aligned with the direction of curvature to prevent buckling. In some examples, computational flattening is utilized to convert the curved surface into a flat pattern for manufacturing the membrane switch.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">An inboard end of deck portion <b>106</b> may be open or uncovered. This opening is covered or substantially sealed, and interior components are protected, by a skirt portion or downward flange of the fender. The fender further includes a peripheral flange configured to seat on frame <b>104</b> and be coupled thereto, e.g., by fasteners such as screws or bolts. A dome or arch portion of the fender extends from front and rear ends of the peripheral flange, and is configured to overarch tire <b>114</b> from front to rear. On one side, corresponding to the side where handle <b>150</b> is mounted, a beveled edge is provided in an inboard side of the flange, to facilitate placement of the handle into the carrying position. A notch is formed in an end of the peripheral flange, such that the notch corresponds with a notch of footpad <b>222</b> to form a slot.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Alternatively, a fender substitute (AKA the &#x201c;fender delete&#x201d;) may be installed in place of the full fender. The fender substitute includes a skirt portion, a peripheral flange, beveled edge, and a notch, all substantially as described above with respect to the fender.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The fender and fender delete are configured to cover and protect the frame members, manage the gap around the tire (e.g., for safety and aesthetics), to snap onto the axle mounting blocks for additional retention, and to provide additional protection from water/mud ingress into motor controller <b>166</b> through the open end of deck portion <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">A tire pressure sensor <b>298</b> may be included in vehicle <b>100</b>, and coupled electrically/electronically to a pressure valve <b>299</b> of tire <b>114</b>.

The electrical components may include a power supply management system <b>300</b> having a battery management system (BMS), a direct current to direct current (DC/DC) converter <b>302</b>, a brushless direct current (BLDC) drive logic <b>304</b>, a power stage <b>306</b>, one or more 3-axis accelerometers <b>188</b>, one or more 3-axis gyros <b>186</b>, one or more Hall sensors <b>308</b>, and/or a motor temperature sensor <b>310</b>. DC/DC converter <b>302</b>, BLDC drive logic <b>304</b>, and power stage <b>306</b> may be included in and/or coupled to motor controller <b>166</b>. In some examples, motor controller <b>166</b> may comprise a variable-frequency drive and/or any other suitable drive. Gyro(s) <b>186</b> and accelerometer(s) <b>188</b> may be included in sensors <b>176</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Active balancing (or self-stabilization) of the electric vehicle may be achieved through the use of a feedback control loop or mechanism. The feedback control mechanism may include sensors <b>176</b>, which may be electrically coupled to and/or included in motor controller <b>166</b>. Preferably, the feedback control mechanism includes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control scheme using one or more gyros (e.g., gyro(s) <b>186</b>) and one or more accelerometers (e.g., accelerometer(s) <b>188</b>). Gyro <b>186</b> may be configured to measure a pivoting of the foot deck about its pitch axis. Gyro <b>186</b> and accelerometer <b>188</b> may be collectively configured to estimate (or measure, or sense) a lean angle of board <b>102</b>, such as an orientation of the foot deck about the pitch, roll and/or yaw axes. In some embodiments, gyro <b>186</b> and accelerometer <b>188</b> may be collectively configured to sense orientation information sufficient to estimate the lean angle of frame <b>104</b> including pivotation about the pitch, roll and/or yaw axes.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">As mentioned above, orientation information of board <b>102</b> may be measured (or sensed) by gyro <b>186</b> and accelerometer <b>188</b>. The respective measurements (or sense signals) from gyro <b>186</b> and accelerometer <b>188</b> may be combined using a complementary or Kalman filter to estimate a lean angle of board <b>102</b> (e.g., pivoting of board <b>102</b> about the pitch, roll, and/or yaw axes, with pivoting about the pitch axis corresponding to a pitch angle (about axle <b>126</b>), pivoting about the roll axis corresponding to a roll or heel-toe angle, and pivoting about the yaw axis corresponding to a side-to-side yaw angle) while filtering out the impacts of bumps, road texture and disturbances due to steering inputs. For example, gyro <b>186</b> and accelerometer <b>188</b> may be connected to microcontroller <b>174</b>, which may be configured to correspondingly measure movement of board <b>102</b> about and/or along the pitch, roll, and/or yaw axes.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Alternatively, the electronic vehicle may include any suitable sensor and feedback control loop configured to self-stabilize a vehicle, such as a 1-axis gyro configured to measure pivotation of the board about the pitch axis, a 1-axis accelerometer configured to measure a gravity vector, and/or any other suitable feedback control loop, such as a closed-loop transfer function. Additional accelerometer and gyro axes may allow improved performance and functionality, such as detecting if the board has rolled over on its side or if the rider is making a turn.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The feedback control loop may be configured to drive motor <b>144</b> to reduce an angle of board <b>102</b> with respect to the ground. For example, if a rider were to angle board <b>102</b> downward, so that first deck portion <b>106</b> was &#x2018;lower&#x2019; than second deck portion <b>108</b> (e.g., if the rider pivoted board <b>102</b> counterclockwise (CCW) about axle <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), then the feedback loop may drive motor <b>144</b> to cause CCW rotation of tire <b>114</b> about the pitch axis (i.e., axle <b>126</b>) and a clockwise force on board <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Thus, motion of the electric vehicle may be achieved by the rider leaning his or her weight toward a selected (e.g., &#x201c;front&#x201d;) foot. Similarly, deceleration may be achieved by the rider leaning toward the other (e.g., &#x201c;back&#x201d; foot). Regenerative braking can be used to slow the vehicle, as discussed further below. Sustained operation may be achieved in either direction by the rider maintaining their lean toward either selected foot.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, microcontroller <b>174</b> may be configured to send a signal to brushless DC (BLDC) drive logic <b>304</b>, which may communicate information relating to the orientation and motion of board <b>102</b>. BLDC drive logic <b>304</b> may then interpret the signal and communicate with power stage <b>306</b> to drive motor <b>144</b> accordingly. Hall sensors <b>308</b> may send a signal to the BLDC drive logic to provide feedback regarding a substantially instantaneous rotational rate of the rotor of motor <b>144</b>. Motor temperature sensor <b>310</b> may be configured to measure a temperature of motor <b>144</b> and send this measured temperature to logic <b>304</b>. Logic <b>304</b> may limit an amount of power supplied to motor <b>144</b> based on the measured temperature of motor <b>144</b> to prevent the motor from overheating.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some examples, microcontroller <b>174</b> (or another suitable portion of the control system) provides feedback to the user when an error is detected, the vehicle is operating in an unsafe condition, power supplied to motor <b>144</b> is about to be limited, the motor is at risk of overheating or overdrawing current, battery charge is low, and/or other potentially dangerous situations. For example, microcontroller <b>174</b> may provide haptic feedback (e.g., via a vibration motor within board <b>102</b>), audible feedback (e.g., via a speaker within board <b>102</b>), and/or visual feedback (e.g., via color changes and/or light patterns using illuminators <b>206</b>). In some examples, feedback may be provided to the user via a mobile digital device such as a smartphone alert.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Certain modifications to the PID loop or other suitable feedback control loop may be incorporated to improve performance and safety of the electric vehicle. For example, integral windup may be prevented by limiting a maximum integrator value, and an exponential function may be applied to a pitch error angle (e.g., a measured or estimated pitch angle of board <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Alternatively or additionally, some embodiments may include neural network control, fuzzy control, genetic algorithm control, linear-quadratic regulator control, state-dependent Riccati equation control, and/or other control algorithms. In some embodiments, absolute or relative encoders may be incorporated to provide feedback on motor position.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, a field-oriented control (FOC) or vector control system may be incorporated into the motor controller (e.g., in microcontroller <b>174</b>, drive logic <b>304</b>, and/or any other suitable processing logic of the motor controller). A suitable FOC system may be configured to divert excess regenerative current, thereby acting as a protective mechanism for the battery.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">As mentioned above, during turning, the pitch angle can be modulated by the heel-toe angle (e.g., pivoting of the board about the roll axis), which may improve performance and prevent a front inside edge of board <b>102</b> from touching the ground. In some embodiments, the feedback loop may be configured to increase, decrease, or otherwise modulate the rotational rate of the tire if the board is pivoted about the roll and/or yaw axes. This modulation of the rotational rate of the tire may exert an increased normal force between a portion of the board and the rider, and may provide the rider with a sense of &#x201c;carving&#x201d; when turning, similar to the feel of carving a snowboard through snow or a surfboard through water.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Once the rider has suitably positioned themselves on the board, the control loop may be configured to not activate until the rider moves the board to a predetermined orientation. For example, an algorithm may be incorporated into the feedback control loop, such that the control loop is not active (e.g., does not drive the motor) until the rider uses their weight to bring the board up to an approximately level orientation (e.g., zero-degree pitch angle). Once this predetermined orientation is detected, the feedback control loop may be enabled (or activated) to balance the electric vehicle and to facilitate a transition of the electric vehicle from a stationary mode (or configuration, or state, or orientation) to a moving mode (or configuration, or state, or orientation).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the various electrical components may be configured to manage power supply <b>164</b>. For example, the battery management system of power supply management system <b>300</b> is configured to protect batteries of power supply <b>164</b> from being overcharged, over-discharged, and/or short-circuited.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">For example, a high voltage threshold may be instituted to stop and/or prevent charging at a selected battery charge percentage (e.g., 95%), and a low voltage threshold may be configured to stop discharging at a selected battery charge percentage (e.g., 5%). The high voltage threshold and low voltage threshold may be configured at the cell level, the battery pack level, or both. In some examples, the high voltage threshold allows more room for energy absorption via regenerative braking by limiting possible overcharging, such as when recently removed from the charger. By raising the low voltage threshold and reducing the high voltage threshold, the cycle life of the battery may be extended. The high voltage threshold and low voltage threshold may be selectively enabled and modified by the user, e.g., through a networked device such as a user's mobile digital device (e.g., smart phone).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">System <b>300</b> may monitor battery health, may monitor a state of charge in power supply <b>164</b>, and/or may increase the safety of the vehicle. Power supply management system <b>300</b> (AKA a battery charging system) may be connected between a user-accessible charge plug receptacle <b>172</b> (AKA charge port) of vehicle <b>100</b> and power supply <b>164</b>. The rider (or other user) may couple a charger to plug receptacle <b>172</b> and re-charge power supply <b>164</b> via system <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>12</b></figref>, and elsewhere, charge receptacle <b>172</b> includes three electrical pins configured to mate with female connectors in a corresponding charging plug connectable to the charging port. The three pins include a ground pin <b>173</b>, an input pin <b>175</b>, and a third pin <b>177</b> (AKA the identification (ID) pin). The charging plug may be a component of an external charging circuit <b>179</b>, e.g., comprising an alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) converter (AKA adapter) that receives AC power from a standard home outlet or the like.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The external charging circuit is configured to communicate an identification (ID) signal to the ID pin of the charging port. Accordingly, the charging system of the vehicle receives the identification signal via the third pin, and selectively enables charging of the battery based on the received identification signal. In other words, to enable charging of the rechargeable battery, system <b>300</b> (or the BMS of system <b>300</b>) checks that the signal applied to the ID pin matches a known, expected value (or series of values and/or timing of the series of values). In some examples, the identification signal is a specific voltage, current, or both. System <b>300</b> therefore confirms legitimacy of the charger by confirming that the correct identification signal has been applied to the ID pin.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some examples, the correct (i.e., expected) ID signal varies with respect to time. For example, the correct ID signal may change according to a known sequence of values, a known continuous function, or the like. In some examples, the ID signal utilizes a form of pulse width modulation, in which a selected value and duty cycle are expected by the BMS. For example, the external charging unit may provide an ID signal in pulses at regular or calculable intervals. The magnitude of the ID signal may be higher or lower than a background value, or the ID signal and the background may have overlapping values.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In operation, when an input voltage is detected on the input pin, the BMS checks for the identification signal on the third pin. If the ID signal matches the expected value, then the BMS enables charging of the vehicle. Otherwise, the BMS does not enable charging of the vehicle. In some examples, the charging circuit of the vehicle is disabled by default, with the BMS configured to enable the charging circuit of the vehicle only when a proper ID signal is present from the charger. In some examples, the BMS is configured to actively or affirmatively disable the charging circuit of the vehicle when a proper ID signal is absent.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Accordingly, a device for charging the battery of an electric vehicle (e.g., external charging circuit <b>179</b>) may include a first plug having three conductors, wherein the first plug is configured to mate with a three-conductor charging receptacle of an electric vehicle, and the three (e.g., female) conductors of the first plug include a direct current (DC) output conductor, a ground, and an identification signal conductor. The device may further include a second plug configured to mate with an alternating-current (AC) outlet, and an AC to DC converter configured to receive an AC current from the second plug and to provide a DC current to the first plug. Furthermore, the device may include a signal generator configured to produce an identification signal comprising a selected value (e.g., a voltage or electrical current magnitude) pulsed periodically in accordance with a selected duty cycle. The signal generator is further configured to provide the identification signal to the identification signal conductor of the first plug.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Accordingly, a method for charging the battery of an electric vehicle (e.g., vehicle <b>100</b>) may include coupling an alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) adapter (e.g., external charging circuit <b>179</b>) to a charging port of the vehicle (e.g., charge receptacle <b>172</b>). The method includes applying a charging voltage to a first conductor of the charging port, using the AC to DC adapter, and communicating an identification signal to a second conductor of the charging port, wherein the identification signal is configured to match an identification signal expected by the battery management system (BMS) of the vehicle. The method may include generating the identification signal in response to sensing that the adapter has been coupled to the charging port. In some examples, the first and second conductors of the charging port are male connectors (e.g., pins). In some examples, the charging port has a third male connector in the form of a ground pin.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The identification signal comprises a selected value (e.g., a voltage and/or current magnitude) pulsed periodically in accordance with a selected duty cycle. Finally, in response to the BMS enabling the charging system of the vehicle, the method includes charging the secondary battery of the vehicle using the AC to DC adapter. The method may further include coupling the AC to DC adapter to a source of AC electricity (e.g., a household electrical outlet). In some examples, the AC to DC adapter has a first plug configured to mate with the charging port of the electric vehicle and a second plug configured to mate with an AC electrical outlet.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">To begin operating the vehicle, power switch <b>170</b> may be activated (e.g., by the rider). Activation of switch <b>170</b> may send a power-on signal to converter <b>302</b>. In response to the power-on signal, converter <b>302</b> may convert direct current from a first voltage level provided by power supply <b>164</b> to one or more other voltage levels. The other voltage levels may be different than the first voltage level. Converter <b>302</b> may be connected to the other electrical components via one or more electrical connections to provide these electrical components with suitable voltages.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Converter <b>302</b> (or other suitable circuitry) may transmit the power-on signal to microcontroller <b>174</b>. In response to the power-on signal, microcontroller may initialize sensors <b>176</b>, and rider detection device <b>168</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The electric vehicle may include one or more safety mechanisms, such as power switch <b>170</b> and/or rider detection device <b>168</b> to ensure that the rider is on the board before engaging the feedback control loop. In some embodiments, rider detection device <b>168</b> may be configured to determine if the rider's foot or feet are disposed on the foot deck, and to send a signal causing motor <b>144</b> to enter an active state when the rider's foot or feet are determined to be disposed on the foot deck.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Rider detection device <b>168</b> may include any suitable mechanism, structure, or apparatus for determining whether the rider is on the electric vehicle. For example, device <b>168</b> may include one or more mechanical buttons, one or more capacitive sensors, one or more inductive sensors, one or more optical switches, one or more force-resistive sensors, and/or one or more strain gauges. Rider detection device <b>168</b> may be located on or under either or both of first and second deck portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. In some examples, the one or more mechanical buttons or other devices may be pressed directly (e.g., if on the deck portions), or indirectly (e.g., if under the deck portions), to sense whether the rider is on board <b>102</b>. In some examples, the one or more capacitive sensors and/or the one or more inductive sensors may be located on or near a surface of either or both of the deck portions, and may correspondingly detect whether the rider is on the board via a change in capacitance or a change in inductance. In some examples, the one or more optical switches may be located on or near the surface of either or both of the deck portions. The one or more optical switches may detect whether the rider is on the board based on an optical signal. In some examples, the one or more strain gauges may be configured to measure board or axle flex imparted by the rider's feet to detect whether the rider is on the board. In some embodiments, device <b>168</b> may include a hand-held &#x201c;dead-man&#x201d; switch.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">If device <b>168</b> detects that the rider is suitably positioned on the electric vehicle, then device <b>168</b> may send a rider-present signal to microcontroller <b>174</b>. The rider-present signal may be the signal causing motor <b>144</b> to enter the active state. In response to the rider-present signal (and/or the board being moved to the level orientation), microcontroller <b>174</b> may activate the feedback control loop for driving motor <b>144</b>. For example, in response to the rider-present signal, microcontroller <b>174</b> may send board orientation information (or measurement data) from sensors <b>176</b> to logic <b>304</b> for powering motor <b>144</b> via power stage <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments, if device <b>168</b> detects that the rider is no longer suitably positioned or present on the electric vehicle, device <b>168</b> may send a rider-not-present signal to microcontroller <b>174</b>. In response to the rider-not-present signal, circuitry of vehicle <b>100</b> (e.g., microcontroller <b>174</b>, logic <b>304</b>, and/or power stage <b>306</b>) may be configured to reduce a rotational rate of the rotor relative to the stator to bring vehicle <b>100</b> to a stop. For example, the electric coils of the rotor may be selectively powered to reduce the rotational rate of the rotor. In some embodiments, in response to the rider-not-present signal, the circuitry may be configured to energize the electric coils with a relatively strong and/or substantially continuously constant voltage, to lock the rotor relative to the stator, to prevent the rotor from rotating relative to the stator, and/or to bring the rotor to a sudden stop.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments, the vehicle may be configured to actively drive motor <b>144</b> even though the rider may not be present on the vehicle (e.g., temporarily), which may allow the rider to perform various tricks. For example, device <b>168</b> may be configured to delay sending the rider-not-present signal to the microcontroller for a predetermined duration of time, and/or the microcontroller may be configured to delay sending the signal to logic <b>304</b> to cut power to the motor for a predetermined duration of time.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">C.
