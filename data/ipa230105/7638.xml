NR is much different from Long Term Evolution (LTE), which is an existing mobile communication system, and, in NR, transmission and reception bandwidths of respective terminal apparatuses may be different (for example, see NPL 1, 2 and 3).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, in a general mobile communication system, a terminal apparatus transmits, in uplink, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) information indicating whether data received in downlink is correctly decoded or not. In NR, a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) or a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) is used as a physical channel for transmitting uplink control information (UCI) including this HARQ-ACK information.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, PLT 1 discloses that a base station determines a PUCCH resource dynamically from among candidates which a terminal apparatus is notified of in advance and notifies the terminal apparatus of the PUCCH resource.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A PUCCH used in NR is expected to have structure similar to PUCCH format 1/1a/1b used in LTE. One of specific common points is support for frequency hopping in a slot. When frequency hopping is performed in transmission of such a PUCCH, it may be necessary to perform retuning of a transmission band within an uplink system band because maximum transmission bandwidths of respective terminal apparatuses may be different in NR for example as described in NPL 1. Specifically, a terminal apparatus whose maximum transmission bandwidth is smaller than an uplink system bandwidth may need to perform frequency hopping using both edges of an uplink system band by performing above described retuning.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, a time period between 50 microseconds and 200 microseconds is needed for retuning with change of a center frequency, for example as described in NPL 4.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">[PTL 1] JP 2014-504061 T</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">[NPL 1] RAN WG1 &#x201c;LS on UE RF Bandwidth Adaptation in NR&#x201d;, 3GPP TSG RAN WG1 Meeting #87.

Related Arts</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0058">As arts related to example embodiments of the present disclosure, a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) used in NR is described mainly.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">In NR, there are two types of PUCCHs with different time duration, that is a PUCCH with a short time duration (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Short PUCCH&#x201d;) and a PUCCH with a long time duration (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Long PUCCH&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">A Long PUCCH of them includes 4 to 14 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols. A Long PUCCH is intended to be used mainly for coverage improvement.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0061">Furthermore, when the number of bits of UCI transmitted on a Long PUCCH is equal to or less than 2, a Long PUCCH is expected to have a structure similar to PUCCH format 1/1a/1b of LTE in light of agreement up to this point.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">Specific common points are support for frequency hopping in a slot, and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) or quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) to be used as a modulation scheme for HARQ-ACK information, multiplication of modulated symbols repeated in a time domain by a sequence, and applicability of orthogonal cover code(s) of a time domain to UCI and reference signal(s) (RS(s)).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">Note that a slot is one of scheduling units in NR. In case of Normal cyclic prefix (CP), one slot includes 7 or 14 OFDM symbols.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">One resource block (RB) includes 12 subcarriers contiguous in a frequency domain. Note that &#x201c;RB&#x201d; is used as &#x201c;a minimum unit of resource allocation in frequency domain&#x201d; in present example embodiments because a time period of an RB in NR has not been defined yet. In addition, &#x201c;RB&#x201d; as referred to herein may be referred to as &#x201c;physical resource block (PRB)&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating example configuration of Long PUCCH for the case of one slot including 14 OFDM symbols. Specifically, in example configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (A), 14 OFDM symbols are used for transmission of a Long PUCCH. A Long PUCCH with such configuration is realized when all OFDM symbols in a slot can be used for uplink transmission.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">On the other hand, in example configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (B), 10 OFDM symbols are used for transmission of a Long PUCCH. This is an example in which slot configuration in time division duplex (TDD) is used. Specifically, after a physical downlink control channels (PDCCHs) are transmitted at the beginning of a slot, a guard period necessary for switching from downlink to uplink is inserted. Subsequently, a Short PUCCH and/or a sounding reference signal (SRS) are transmitted at the end of the slot. A total of 4 OFDM symbols are used for such transmission, and the remaining 10 OFDM symbols are used for transmission of a Long PUCCH.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example configuration of Long PUCCH for the case of one slot including 7 OFDM symbols. In the example configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (A), 7 OFDM symbols are used for transmission of a Long PUCCH. In the example configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (B), 4 OFDM symbols are used for transmission of a Long PUCCH.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">It is possible to multiplex UCI for a plurality of terminal apparatuses in one RB included in a Long PUCCH. This multiplexing is realized with different combinations of a cyclic shift and an orthogonal cover code used by respective terminals. In the present example embodiments, a multiplexing method for PUCCH format 1/1a/1b of LTE is assumed for description.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">First, multiplexing by cyclic shifting is realized by using a Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) sequence for transmission of UCI and RSs. A CAZAC sequence has a property of an autocorrelation value being zero in case that a cyclic shift value is not zero. Cyclic shifting represents shift processing which shifts an element at the end of a sequence to the beginning in order. One example of a CAZAC sequence is a Zadoff-Chu sequence. Furthermore, in LTE, computer generated sequences (CGS) are used as CAZAC sequences for the case that a sequence length is 12 or 24.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0070">In case that a one-twelfth of a time period of one OFDM symbol excluding a CP part is expressed by &#x394;T, it is possible to multiplex a maximum of twelve UCI and RSs by performing cyclic shifting of u&#xd7;&#x394;T (u is an integer between 0 and 11). Here, in order to maintain orthogonality between terminals, it is necessary that a minimum gap between cyclic shifts is larger than a maximum delay path of a propagation channel. In LTE, a minimum gap between cyclic shifts &#x394;<sub>shift</sub>&#xd7;&#x394;T is adjusted by using a parameter common within a cell &#x394;<sub>shift </sub>(&#x394;<sub>shift</sub>=1, 2, 3). Therefore, the maximum number of multiplexing by cyclic shifting is 12/&#x394;<sub>shift</sub>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0071">Multiplexing by orthogonal cover codes is realized by performing block-spreading of UCI and RSs over a plurality of OFDM symbols. Using orthogonal cover codes enables multiplexing of the same number of complex symbols as its sequence length by block-spreading. Here, orthogonal cover codes are applied independently to respective UCI and RSs before and after frequency hopping, and its sequence length is equal to the number of OFDM symbols allocated to each. As a result, a maximum multiplexing number is a minimum value of the number of OFDM symbols allocated to respective UCI and RSs before and after frequency hopping.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0072">The maximum number of multiplexing by orthogonal cover codes is 3 in case of the example configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (A) and is 2 in case of the example configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (B). On the other hand, in the example configurations illustrated respectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (A) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (B), multiplexing by orthogonal cover codes is not performed because an RS includes a single OFDM symbol after frequency hopping.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0073">The number of multiplexed UCI per one RB of Long PUCCH, denoted as N, is expressed by a product of a maximum multiplexing number by cyclic shifting and a maximum multiplexing number by orthogonal cover codes. For example, when a maximum multiplexing number by cyclic shifting is 4 (i.e. &#x394;<sub>shift</sub>=3) and a maximum multiplexing number by orthogonal cover codes is 3, 4&#xd7;3=12 pieces of UCI can be multiplexed per one RB.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating examples of combinations of A shift, cyclic shift number u, and orthogonal cover code number c. It is possible to perform numbering of resources which can be multiplexed per one RB of Long PUCCH by selecting one of the combinations as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is one example, and for example different numbering per cell is possible.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram for the case of one terminal apparatus transmitting HARQ-ACK information on a Long PUCCH. A base station transmits data for a terminal apparatus on a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), and transmits downlink control information (DCI) including allocation information for the data on a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). On the other hand, the terminal apparatus receives the data on the PDSCH based on the DCI after receiving the DCI for the terminal apparatus on the PDCCH. Then, the terminal apparatus transmits, on a Long PUCCH in an uplink slot, HARQ-ACK information indicating whether the data is correctly decoded or not.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0076">In NR, for a terminal apparatus, bandwidth part(s) including contiguous RBs is set for uplink and downlink respectively. Note that the number of RBs set for a bandwidth part is equal to or less than a maximum bandwidth supported by respective terminal apparatuses. One or more bandwidth parts are set for respective terminals. A terminal apparatus receives downlink signals within an active downlink bandwidth part of the set bandwidth part(s), and transmits uplink signals using an active uplink bandwidth part of the set bandwidth part(s).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">2. Overview of Example Embodiments of the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0077">First, an overview of example embodiments of the present disclosure is described.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">(1) Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0078">As maximum transmission bandwidths of respective terminal apparatuses may be different in NR as described above, a hopping gap in frequency domain may differ from terminal apparatus to terminal apparatus when frequency hopping is performed in transmission of a Long PUCCH. For example, a terminal apparatus whose maximum transmission bandwidth is smaller than an uplink system bandwidth may perform frequency hopping to a region other than edges of an uplink system band for transmission of a Long PUCCH.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a specific example of resource positions with which frequency hopping is performed respectively by terminal apparatuses A-D whose maximum transmission bandwidths are smaller than an uplink system bandwidth. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, fragmented resources may exist. Existence of such fragmented resources may cause flexibility of PUSCH resource allocation to be decreased.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">In addition, it is agreed in NR to use both of Cyclic Prefix-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) and Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) as an uplink transmission waveform. Furthermore, only contiguous RB allocation is assumed to be supported when DFT-s-OFDM is used as a transmission waveform of PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081">Here, in case of DFT-s-OFDM, the number of contiguous RBs which can be allocated to one terminal apparatus is limited in light of existence of fragmented RBs illustrated in the above described <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In addition, in case of CP-OFDM, although allocation of non-contiguous RBs is possible, resource allocation which utilizes all fragmented RBs is difficult in light of overhead of resource allocation information. Therefore, there may be a possibility that the number of unused RBs increases and use efficiency of radio resources is decreased.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0082">As a method to prevent occurrence of the above described fragmented resources, it is proposed, for example as disclosed in the following reference document, that a PUCCH is transmitted on a resource which exists at the edge of a subband by setting a plurality of subbands in an uplink system band.<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0083">[reference document] CMCC &#x201c;Discussion on subband-based PUCCH resource allocation and indication&#x201d;, 3GPP TSG RAN WG1 Meeting NR Ad-Hoc #2. Qingdao, China, 27-30 Jun. 2017. R1-1710782</li></ul></p><p id="p-0074" num="0084">However, in the above reference document, there is no disclosure of setting a limitation on the number of RBs and a start position in frequency domain for a subband. Therefore, overhead for notifying a terminal apparatus of information on a subband will be high if a subband with any number of RBs can be located at any position in frequency domain.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0085">Here, a terminal apparatus whose maximum transmission bandwidth is smaller than an uplink system bandwidth can perform frequency hopping using both edges of an uplink system band by performing retuning which switches transmission bands within an uplink system band. However, a time period between 50 microseconds and 200 microseconds for example would be necessary for retuning which is accompanied by a change of a center frequency. In order to perform such retuning, for example, insertion of a guard period would be necessary, and the number of OFDM symbols available for transmission of a Long PUCCH would decrease, which may cause a reduction of coverage.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">(2) Technical Features</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0086">According to example embodiments of the present disclosure, for example, a base station includes a communication processing unit configured to communicate with a first terminal apparatus in a bandwidth part of an uplink system band, the bandwidth part being used by the first terminal apparatus, wherein the bandwidth part includes a physical uplink control channel region used by the first terminal apparatus.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0087">Furthermore, according to example embodiments of the present disclosure, for example, a first terminal apparatus includes a communication processing unit configured to communicate with a base station in a bandwidth part of an uplink system band, the bandwidth part being used by the first terminal apparatus, wherein the bandwidth part includes a physical uplink control channel region used by the first terminal apparatus.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0088">According to the example embodiments, for example, it is possible for a first terminal apparatus to transmit a physical uplink control channel to a base station without retuning regardless of a bandwidth part used by the first terminal apparatus.

The first terminal apparatus (the communication processing unit <b>231</b> of the terminal apparatus <b>200</b>A) communicates with the base station <b>100</b> in the bandwidth part.

In this case, as one example, the first physical uplink control channel region and the second physical uplink control channel region are located within different subbands. That is, the first physical uplink control channel region is located within one subband out of the two or more subbands included in the bandwidth part, and the second physical uplink control channel region is located within one subband out of the two or more subbands included in the bandwidth part, the one subband being different from a subband within which the first physical uplink control channel region is located.
