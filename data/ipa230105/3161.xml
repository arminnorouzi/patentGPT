Base walls of this type form respective end walls, which close off the interior of the muffler housing in the direction of a housing longitudinal axis from the outside, in the two axial end regions of the circumferential wall. Base walls of this type form respective intermediate walls, which separate chambers formed inside the muffler housing from one another, in that region of the muffler housing which is situated between the two end walls. Such chambers can be interconnected via openings provided in a respective intermediate wall but can also form a resonator chamber for a Helmholtz resonator.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to be able to pass an exhaust pipe, which can also provide a resonator neck for such Helmholtz resonance, through such a base wall, it is known, by forming a passage, to form an opening edge region which surrounds a base wall opening and extends from an essentially plane region of a respective base wall in the direction of an opening center axis of a respective base wall opening. This opening edge region has an essentially cylindrical structure and receives an exhaust pipe. Such base wall openings which are surrounded by a respective opening edge region are oversized with regard to their external dimensions, that is, for example the external diameter of an exhaust pipe constructed with an essentially circular cross-section, such that an exhaust pipe can be received in such a base wall opening with a small amount of play and can thus be brought into an installed position provided for it. In this position, a respective exhaust pipe is then connected, generally by welding, to the base wall through which it passes to make a firm bond.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a muffler for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, and a method for producing such a muffler, by which a connection can be effected between a base wall and an exhaust pipe passing through the latter which prevents the generation of noise.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, this object is achieved by a muffler for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, comprising a muffler housing with a circumferential wall which extends longitudinally in the direction of a housing longitudinal axis and at least one base wall which is surrounded by the circumferential wall or/and retained on the circumferential wall and delimits a chamber in the muffler housing, wherein at least one base wall opening, which is surrounded by an opening edge region which is bent at an essentially plane base wall region of the base wall essentially in the direction of the housing longitudinal axis, and receives an exhaust pipe with a press fit, is provided in at least one base wall.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of the muffler according to the disclosure, at least one exhaust pipe is retained in an assigned base wall opening by a press fit, as a result of which, on the one hand, a stable bond is achieved and, on the other hand, the creation of relative movements between the base wall and the exhaust pipe which passes through it, which can cause impact noises or rattling noises, is prevented because of constantly present bearing contact which is under pressure or pretension. Further measures for providing a firm bond are in principle not required, wherein, however, a material connection, for example a connection by welding, can be provided in addition to retention by a press fit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular when it is intended to obtain a gastight closure in the region of the connection of a base wall to an exhaust pipe, for example to provide a Helmholtz resonator, it is advantageous if the opening edge region is configured so that it runs completely circumferentially about an opening center axis of the base wall opening.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an alternative embodiment, the opening edge region can be configured so that is interrupted circumferentially about an opening center axis of the base wall opening. For example, it can be implemented by the opening edge region comprising a plurality of opening edge region segments arranged spaced apart from another circumferentially about an opening center axis of the base wall opening.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment which can be implemented cost-effectively and is at the same time resistant to high temperatures and aggressive constituents of exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine, the at least one base wall can be configured as a deformed sheet-metal part. In particular when it is intended that the opening edge region is closed circumferentially, in order for example also to obtain an essentially gastight closure, it is advantageous if at least one base wall has a wall thickness of no more than 1 mm, preferably no more than 0.6 mm. In this case, the base wall can also be sufficiently deformable in the region of its elastic deformability, also in the region of the closed opening edge region in order to generate the press fit when pushing or pressing the exhaust pipe into the base wall opening, to be able to receive an exhaust pipe and to be able to generate a sufficiently high contact pressure against its outer circumferential surface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The opening edge region can have a first edge section adjoining the essentially plane base wall region in a first bending region and a second edge section adjoining the first edge section in a second bending region, wherein a radial spacing of the first edge section from an opening center axis of the base wall opening decreases preferably essentially constantly in the direction from the first bending region to the second bending region. The region of the minimum spacing of the opening edge region from the opening center axis can then be provided in the region of the second bending region.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A radial spacing of the second edge section from the opening center axis can be essentially constant in a direction away from the second bending region such that an essentially cylindrical region is formed in which a flat bearing contact is formed between the opening edge region and the exhaust pipe. A material connection, that is, for example a welded connection, between the base wall and the exhaust pipe, can, for example, be produced at am end side of this cylindrical section.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment which assists in particular the easy pressing of the exhaust pipe into a base wall opening which receives it and which prevents the occurrence of jamming when an exhaust pipe is pushed into a base wall opening, a radial spacing of the second edge section from the opening center axis can increase preferably essentially constantly in the direction away from the second bending region.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It can furthermore be provided that the opening edge region runs in bent form from a first axial end region, adjoining the essentially plane region of the base wall, of the opening edge region to an axial region of the opening edge region with a minimum spacing from an opening center axis of the base wall opening.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, if the opening edge region here runs in bent form from the region of the opening edge region with a minimum spacing from the opening center axis of the base wall opening to a second axial end region, remote from the essentially plane region of the base wall, of the opening edge region, the whole opening edge region can be provided, for example, as a deforming region, with an approximately constant radius of curvature in the axial direction, of the base wall.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The at least one base wall can be an intermediate wall separating two chambers in the muffler housing from each other. Alternatively, the at least one base wall can be an end wall arranged at an axial end region of the circumferential wall. It should be pointed out that of course one or more intermediate walls and one or both end walls can be configured in a muffler as a base wall with the above described structure. It should furthermore be pointed out that it is also possible for a plurality of base wall openings, one or possibly several or all of which can have the above described structure for receiving a respective exhaust pipe with a press fit, to be formed in one or more such base walls.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further aspect, the object stated at the beginning is achieved by a method for producing a muffler for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, in particular of a muffler constructed according to the disclosure, comprising the steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">a) Providing at least one base wall for a muffler housing in such a way that at least one base wall opening formed in the base wall is surrounded by an opening edge region bent away from an essentially plane base wall region essentially in the direction of an opening center axis in such a way that the base wall opening has a predetermined internal dimension, preferably an internal diameter,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">b) Providing an exhaust pipe, to be received in the base wall opening surrounded by the opening edge region, with a predetermined external dimension, preferably an external diameter, wherein the predetermined external dimension of the exhaust pipe is greater than the predetermined internal dimension of the base wall opening,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0020">c) Introducing the exhaust pipe into the base wall opening surrounded by the opening edge region in such a way that the exhaust pipe is retained in the base wall opening surrounded by the opening edge region by a press fit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">It should be pointed out that the dimensions which need to be provided so that they are specifically harmonized with each other need to be considered in those regions which interact with each other when the muffler is assembled.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">This means that the exhaust pipe is oversized, in the region in which it traverses a base wall when the muffler is assembled, compared with the base wall opening formed to receive this exhaust pipe in the base wall, but in other longitudinal regions it can have, for example, a smaller dimension in cross-section, or possibly an even larger dimension in cross-section, than this base wall opening.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">It should furthermore be pointed out that, in the case of a muffler constructed according to the disclosure or the method to be performed according to the disclosure, such a base wall opening and an exhaust pipe to be received therein are preferably in each case formed with a circular cross-section such that the internal dimension can be represented, for example, by the internal diameter and the external dimension can be represented, for example, by the external diameter.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">In step a), the opening edge region can be provided so that it runs completely circumferentially about the opening center axis. Alternatively, it can be provided that, in step a), the opening edge region is provided so that it is interrupted in at least one circumferential region. The opening edge region can, for example, be configured here with a plurality of opening edge region segments arranged spaced apart from one another circumferentially about the opening center axis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">In step a), the opening edge region be provided, starting from the essentially plane region of the base wall, with a spacing from the opening center axis which decreases as far as an axial region of the opening edge region with a minimum spacing from the opening center axis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">Furthermore, in step a), the opening edge region can be provided with an essentially constant spacing from the opening center axis from the region of the opening edge region with a minimum spacing from the opening center axis as far as a free axial end region of the opening edge region. Alternatively, in step a), the opening edge region be provided with a spacing from the opening center axis which increases from the region of the opening edge region with a minimum spacing from the opening center axis as far as the free axial end region of the opening edge region.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">In order, on the one hand, to enable the introduction of an exhaust pipe into a base wall opening and, on the other hand, to obtain a sufficiently firm press fit, it is proposed that a difference between the predetermined external dimension of the exhaust pipe and the predetermined internal dimension of the base wall opening provided to receive the exhaust pipe is in the range from 0.2 mm to 0.6 mm, preferably is approximately 0.4 mm. For this purpose, it can furthermore be provided that, in step a), the at least one base wall is provided as a deformed sheet-metal part or/and with a wall thickness of no more than 1 mm, preferably no more than 0.6 mm.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">Moreover, in order to obtain a stable bond, a step d) can be provided for connecting the exhaust pipe to the opening edge region by a material connection, preferably welding.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0029">The invention will now be described with reference to the drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a partial axial view of a base wall for a muffler in the region of a base wall opening;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a partial axial view in section of the base wall of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a partial view of the base wall of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> in the region of the base wall opening traversed by an exhaust pipe;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, of an alternative embodiment;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a further schematic diagram, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, to explain the size ratios;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a further diagram, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, of an alternative embodiment; and,</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram in longitudinal section of a muffler comprising a plurality of base walls.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0037">Before different embodiments and details of embodiments of a base wall of a muffler for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, for example in a vehicle, are explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, an example of a fundamental structure of a muffler <b>10</b>, which includes a total of four base walls <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> in the example illustrated, is first explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

It should be pointed out that an edge region bent away in the direction of the housing longitudinal axis L can also be formed in the radially outer region, that is, where the base wall <b>14</b> is retained on the circumferential wall <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">In the embodiment of the base wall <b>14</b>, which separates two chambers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> which are connected to each other to exchange exhaust gas, the opening edge region <b>50</b> can be interrupted circumferentially and, for example, be constructed with four opening edge region segments <b>52</b> following one another circumferentially and arranged with a circumferential spacing from one another, between which respective circumferential cutouts <b>54</b>, via which the two chambers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> separated from each other by the base wall <b>14</b> can be connected to each other to exchange exhaust gas, are formed in the base wall <b>14</b> or the essentially plane base wall region <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">If it is intended to provide a gastight closure by such a base wall, as is the case for example in connection with the base walls <b>12</b>, <b>18</b> providing end walls or alternatively the base wall <b>16</b> providing an intermediate wall, the opening edge region <b>50</b> can be configured as an opening edge region so that it runs completely circumferentially about a respective opening center axis M of the respective base wall opening <b>34</b>, <b>40</b> or <b>38</b> and is not interrupted circumferentially.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the opening edge region <b>50</b> has a first edge section <b>58</b> adjoining the essentially plane base wall region <b>48</b> in a first bending region <b>56</b>. The first edge section <b>58</b> has a structure which tapers essentially conically or frustoconically with respect to the opening center axis</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">M, starting from the first bending region <b>56</b>, such that, starting from the first bending region <b>56</b>, the spacing of the first edge section <b>58</b> from the opening center axis M decreases essentially constantly. This means that the first edge section <b>58</b>, viewed in an axial direction, is essentially not curved and of course has, for example, a circularly curved structure about the opening center axis M. A second edge section <b>62</b> adjoins the first edge section <b>58</b> in a second bending region <b>60</b>. The second edge section <b>62</b> similarly has a conical or frustoconical structure such that its radial spacing from the opening center axis M increases essentially constantly starting from the second bending region <b>60</b>. The opening edge region <b>50</b> thus has a structure which is essentially V-shaped in longitudinal section between a first axial end region <b>64</b> adjoining the essentially plane base wall region <b>48</b> in the region of the first bending region <b>56</b> and a second axial end region <b>66</b>, remote from the base wall region <b>48</b>, of the latter.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">Where the two edge sections <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> adjoin each other, that is, essentially in the region of the second bending region <b>60</b>, the opening edge region <b>50</b> has a minimum spacing from the opening center axis M of the base wall opening <b>36</b>. In the situation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in which the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> does not yet traverse the base wall <b>14</b> or the base wall opening <b>36</b> formed therein, this minimum spacing corresponds to a predetermined internal dimension a which, in particular in an essentially circular embodiment of the base wall opening <b>36</b>, can represent the radius of the base wall opening <b>36</b> with respect to the opening center axis M or the internal diameter, that is, twice the radius.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">The exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is dimensioned in such a way that its predetermined external dimension A, for example also represented by the radius or twice the radius, that is, the diameter, of the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> configured, for example, with a circular cross-section is greater than the corresponding predetermined internal dimension a of the base wall opening <b>36</b>. For example, the external dimension A, that is, the diameter, corresponding to twice the radius R, of the exhaust pipe <b>42</b>, can be formed so that it is oversized within a range of 0.2 mm to 0.6 mm, preferably approximately 0.4 mm, with respect to the corresponding internal dimension a, that is, for example the internal diameter of the base wall opening <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0052">When the muffler <b>10</b> is assembled, after the base wall <b>14</b> has been provided with the form provided therefor and possibly surrounded by the circumferential wall <b>22</b>, the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is introduced into the base wall opening <b>36</b> in the direction of the opening center axis M or the housing longitudinal axis L. Because the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is oversized with respect to the base wall opening <b>36</b> receiving the latter, when the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is introduced, the opening edge region <b>50</b> is spread out radially somewhat such that the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is retained in the base wall opening <b>36</b> by a press fit and hence by a force fit. The opening edge region <b>50</b> which is spread out radially in the region of its elastic deformability, or its opening edge region segments <b>52</b>, press radially inward against the outer circumference of the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> with a force F such that, on the one hand, the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is retained in a defined position with respect to the base wall <b>14</b> and, on the other hand, a defined bearing contact on the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is generated by the opening edge region segments <b>52</b> pressing against the outer circumference of the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> with the force F such that the occurrence of rattling noises can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0053">By virtue of the embodiment of the opening edge region <b>50</b> with its two edge sections <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> which provide essentially a V-shaped contour of the opening edge region <b>50</b>, an introduction slope, which enables the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> to be introduced easily into the base wall opening <b>36</b> and prevents it getting caught because of sharp-edged bearing contact, is formed for the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> to be received in the base wall opening <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0054">It is also possible in the case of an embodiment of the opening edge region <b>50</b> with an uninterrupted form in the circumferential direction, that is, as a circumferentially continuous opening edge region, for the latter to be spread out radially when the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is introduced into the base wall opening <b>36</b>. In the case of a circumferentially closed structure of the opening edge region <b>50</b>, it is advantageous if the base wall <b>14</b> is provided with a relatively low wall thickness W of no more than 1 mm, preferably no more than 0.6 mm.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0055">In the case of such a thin-walled configuration of the base wall <b>14</b>, it is ensured that, when the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is introduced into the base wall opening <b>36</b>, the circumferentially closed opening edge region <b>50</b> is correspondingly spread out because the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> is slightly oversized and, because of its elasticity, the force F which then acts radially inward essentially uniformly over the whole circumference is exerted on the exhaust pipe <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0056">An alternative embodiment of the base wall <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The opening edge region <b>50</b> is configured in this embodiment too with two edge sections <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>. The edge section <b>58</b> adjoins the essentially plane base wall region <b>48</b> in the axial end region <b>64</b> of the opening edge region <b>50</b>, whilst the edge section <b>62</b> provides the second axial end region <b>66</b> remote from the base wall region <b>48</b>. Both edge sections <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> are configured so that they are curved in the axial direction and have a considerably larger radius of curvature than, for example, the two bending regions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. For example, an essentially constant radius of curvature as far as the region <b>68</b> with the minimum diameter of the opening edge region <b>50</b> could be provided in each of the edge sections <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, and the radii of curvature in the two edge sections <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> could, for example, be the same as each other but of course could also be configured to be different. For example, the radius of curvature in the radial section <b>62</b> could be smaller than the radius of curvature in the edge section <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0057">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> too, the opening edge region <b>50</b> could be closed circumferentially, as is required, for example, in the region of the base walls <b>12</b>, <b>40</b> providing respective end walls in order to obtain a gastight closure, but it could alternatively also be provided with the above described circumferentially segmented embodiment on the one hand to provide increased flexibility in the region of the base wall opening, and on the other hand to enable gas to pass through the base wall opening in this region.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0058">A further alternative embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the opening edge region <b>50</b> again has the two edge sections <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> which adjoin the essentially plane base wall region <b>48</b> or each other. The edge section <b>58</b> has, for example, the conical or frustoconical structure which can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with an essentially constant decrease in the spacing from the opening center axis M between the two bending regions <b>56</b>, <b>60</b>. The second edge section <b>62</b> has an essentially cylindrical structure and thus has an essentially constant spacing from the opening center axis M between the second bending region <b>60</b> and the second axial end region <b>66</b> such that the minimum spacing from the opening center axis M is provided between the second bending region <b>60</b> and the second axial end region <b>66</b>. In this embodiment, an essentially flat bearing region, extended axially and therefore further, is provided between the opening edge region <b>50</b> and the exhaust pipe <b>42</b>. This is suitable for providing, in addition to the press fit generated by the radially inward exerted force F, a firm connection between the base wall <b>14</b> and the exhaust pipe <b>42</b> by a material connection, for example by a circumferentially peripheral weld seam <b>70</b> which can be configured as a fillet seam between an essentially axially oriented end surface of the second edge section <b>62</b> and the outer circumferential surface of the exhaust pipe <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0059">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> too, the opening edge region <b>50</b> can be configured so that it runs circumferentially, that is, uninterrupted, or can be provided as an opening edge region interrupted circumferentially at least at one point, for example as an opening edge region with a plurality of opening edge region segments following one another circumferentially.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0060">It should finally be pointed out again that the structure, described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, of a base wall opening or of an opening edge region surrounding the latter can be provided for each base wall traversed by an exhaust pipe, wherein base wall openings or opening edge regions provided in different base walls can of course also be provided with different structures. It can, for example, be chosen depending on what diameter an exhaust pipe traversing a respective base wall has or on whether it is intended to obtain a gastight closure in the region of a base wall opening traversed by an exhaust pipe or it is intended that the passage of exhaust gas is possible.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0061">In each of the above described embodiments of a base wall, it is possible to push an exhaust pipe easily by hand or using a machine through a respective base wall and introduce it into a base wall opening provided to receive an exhaust pipe, wherein the respective opening edge region is spread out and the force fit required to generate the press fit is created. When a muffler constructed in this way is operating, the different components of the latter heat up and expand such that the press fit or the force exerted on an assigned exhaust pipe by a respective opening edge region increases and an even stronger retaining effect is generated.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0062">It is understood that the foregoing description is that of the preferred embodiments of the invention and that various changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
