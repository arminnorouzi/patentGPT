num="0000">The present disclosure describes the generation and the use of Ad variants (Ad) possessing any combination of mutations in genes that code for the hexon, penton, fiber, and non-structural proteins, where simultaneous modification of hexon and penton are made to avoid the trapping of Ad in the liver and to reduce toxicity after intravascular virus administration. Such liver de-targeted Ad can be useful tool for selective and specific gene delivery to extra-hepatic tissues and cells, including disseminated metastatic cancer cells.</p></abstract><drawings

FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the field of gene therapy, and in particular, to novel Adenovirus (Ad) vectors, which escape sequestration in the liver tissue at a physical particle level and induce diminished inflammatory response upon intravascular injection. These vectors can be a safe and useful tool for infecting cells in vivo for gene therapy, including for treatment of localized and disseminated metastatic cancers, in any organ of the body, including of the hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Adenoviruses (Ads) are promising vectors for therapeutic interventions in humans (Thomas et al., 2003). Despite significant knowledge regarding the biology of Ad interactions with cells in vitro, the molecular mechanisms governing in vivo Ad infectivity and bio-distribution remain poorly understood (Baker, 2007; Khare et al.). This poses significant risks for their intravascular administration and represents the major hindrance for safe, selective, and efficient Ad targeting to specific cell and tissue types in vivo.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pharmacokinetic studies of Ad vectors after intravascular delivery demonstrate that the majority of an administered virus dose is rapidly sequestered from the circulation by the liver (Alemany and Curiel, 2001; Di Paolo et al., 2009b; Khare et al., 2011a). Through comprehensive in vivo analyses, it was found that the general molecular mechanisms that mediate Ad sequestration by liver tissue operate in a redundant and synergistic manner (Di Paolo et al., 2009b). Specifically, it is currently believed that Ad particles are distributed in liver tissue amongst three distinct cellular compartments, namely i) parenchymal liver cells&#x2014;hepatocytes, ii) hepatic residential macrophages, Kupffer cells, and iii) hepatic sinusoid endothelial cells. Importantly, the ablation of Ad interaction with only one of these cellular compartments cannot prevent virus trapping the liver and results in compensatory re-distribution of the virus among two remaining cellular compartments, functionally ensuring the quantitative removal of the virus from the blood (Di Paolo et al., 2009b). Despite of this general understanding of the redundancy of mechanisms that may operate to remove Ad particles from the blood and trap them in the liver after intravascular virus administration, the exact molecular mechanisms guiding Ad interactions with liver cells in vivo remain controversial (Baker et al., 2013). This controversy and the lack of understanding of mechanisms that operate to trap Ad particles in the liver is ultimately manifested in the fact that to date, no Ad vector configurations were reported that would, based on purely genetic (and not chemical) modification of Ad capsid proteins, allow for generation of Ads, which would escape being sequestered in the liver at a physical particle level after intravascular virus delivery. Ad trapping in the liver is deleterious for gene therapy and cancer therapy applications, since Ad particles sequestered in the liver become destroyed, necessitating high virus doses to achieve transduction of any extra-hepatic cells. High Ad doses injected intravenously activate severe systemic inflammatory response that can be fatal (Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2004; Raper et al., 2003; Raper et al., 2002). What is needed are new Ad vectors that avoid liver sequestration and activation of inflammation and methods of accomplishing the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">III. SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides for novel modified Ad vectors that contain simultaneous genetic modifications in Ad penton and hexon proteins, which are introduced to prevent virus binding to liver cells, including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells, and allow for virus to exhibit greatly reduced or completely eliminated trapping in the liver tissue and inflammatory responses after virus particles circulate in the blood.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The one embodiment of the invention are isolated Ads with a mutation in the RGD motif of the penton protein, wherein the mutation causes reduced binding of &#x3b2;3 integrins of a host cell in vivo, such as macrophages or endothelial cells, and induce significantly reduced inflammatory responses after virus circulate in blood in vivo.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The preferred embodiment of the invention provide for novel Ad vectors where, as an example in a context of the most commonly used in gene therapy applications human species C serotype Ad5-based vectors, three simultaneous mutations are necessary and sufficient to prevent virus binding to liver cells in vivo&#x2014;one mutation is in the Ad penton RGD loop and two mutations are in Ad hexon hypervariable loops, specifically in the loops HVR1 and HVR7.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also the example of the embodiment of the invention is isolated nucleic acids encoding an Ad penton protein, the penton protein comprising a mutation in the RGD motif of the penton protein, wherein the mutation causes reduced binding of a host cell &#x3b2;3 integrin proteins in vivo, when expressed in an Ad.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention also provides methods of administering an Ad such that the Ad virions evade sequestration in a host's liver in vivo, wherein the method comprises the steps of: a) providing an Ad with a mutation in the RGD motif of the penton protein, wherein the mutation causes reduced binding of &#x3b2;3 integrins of a host normal liver cells; b) reducing the binding of the Ad with a vitamin K dependent clotting factor in the host; and, c) reducing the binding of the Ad to Kupffer cells.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention also provides methods of delivering a gene to a non-hepatic mammalian cell, including localized and disseminated metastatic cancer cells, wherein the method comprises the steps of: a) providing an Ad with a mutation in the RGD motif of the penton protein, wherein the mutation causes reduced binding of &#x3b2;3 integrins of a host of the normal liver cell in vivo; b) providing an Ad with a mutation in Ad hexon protein hypervariable region 1, HVR1; c) providing an Ad with a mutation in Ad hexon protein hypervariable region 7, HVR7; and d) contacting the host cell with the Ad in vivo.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">IV.

Adenovirus</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Adenovirus (also referred to herein as &#x201c;Ad&#x201d;) is a ubiquitous pathogen causing a wide range of human diseases, which include respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis, hemonhagic cystitis, and gastrointestinal diseases (Shenk, 1996, 2001). In immunocompetent patients, Ad infection is self-limited, and after resolution of the acute infection, the virus remains latent in lymphoid and renal tissues. In contrast, in immunocompromized patients Ad may cause life threatening or even fatal fulminant hepatitis and disseminated infection of other tissues (Kojaoghlanian et al., 2003).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">There are currently 60 characterized human Ad serotypes which are divided into seven species (formally subgroups) from A to G (Alonso-Padilla et al., 2015). Eighty percent pediatric patients develop antibodies to at least one of many Ad serotypes by the age of 5 (Barouch et al., 2011; Bradley et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2006) The prevalence of human Ad species C-specific antibodies in these populations reaches as high as 50 to 80 (Alonso-Padilla et al., 2015; Barouch et al., 2011). Although various Ad serotypes may initiate infection via different transmission routes, and by utilizing distinct virus attachment receptors, the host factors and cell types controlling tissue specificity of Ad infection in vivo remain insufficiently understood.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The Ad genome is a double-stranded linear DNA molecule of about 36 kilobases containing genes encoding the viral proteins. At the ends of the Ad genome, inverted repeats (also referred to as inverted terminal repeats or ITRs) contain replication and the encapsidation regions. The early genes are distributed in four regions dispersed in the Ad genome (designated E1 to E4). The early genes are expressed in six transcriptional units. The late genes (designated Li to L5) partly overlap with the early transcription units and are generally transcribed from the major late promoter (referred to as MLP) (Shenk, 2001).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The Ad infectious cycle occurs in two steps. The early phase precedes the initiation of replication and makes it possible to produce the early proteins regulating the replication and transcription of the viral DNA. The replication of the genome is followed by the late phase during which the structural proteins that constitute the viral particles are synthesized. The assembly of the new virions takes place in the host cell nucleus. In a first stage, the viral proteins assemble so as to form empty capsids of icosahedral structure into which the genome is encapsidated. The assembled virus includes a penton base and fiber. The Ads liberated are capable of infecting other permissive cells. The fiber and the penton base present at the surface of the capsids play a role in the cellular attachment of the virions and their internalization.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In vitro studies demonstrated that Ad infection starts with the virus binding to a high affinity primary attachment receptor on the cell surface (Nemerow, 2000). The trimeric Ad fiber protein mediates this interaction when its distal knob domain binds to a specific cellular receptor. For binding to cells, species A, C, D, E, and F human Ad may utilize the coxsackievirus and Ad receptor (CAR) (Roelvink et al., 1998); however, the majority of human species B Ad utilize CD46 as a high affinity cellular attachment receptor (Gaggar et al., 2003). In this regard, soluble Ad fiber or anti-fiber antibodies can inhibit infection by the Ad. Fiber-mediated binding of Ad to cells is followed by RGD motif-mediated binding of the viral penton base protein to cellular integrins (e.g., &#x3b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x3b2;<sub>3 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x3b2;<sub>5</sub>) (Nemerow and Stewart, 1999). This interaction induces integrin activation and cytoskeleton rearrangement that facilitates internalization of the virus particle into the cell. Based in part on this knowledge, previous disclosure provided Ad vectors that were designed to change Ad interactions with integrins in the in vitro cell culture systems. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,136, which is incorporated by reference herein. However the patent above does not teach of constructing Ads for in vivo applications, capable of escaping liver sequestration after intravascular administration and triggering reduced inflammatory responses. Importantly, Ads vectors comprising only a mutated penton protein are trapped in the liver tissue at levels identical to the wild type virus and therefore cannot be used for efficient infecting of extra-hepatic cells.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Ads are used in an increasing number of applications for gene transfer. Ads have been identified in numerous animal species. They exhibit low pathogenicity in immune-competent individuals, and replicate both in dividing and quiescent cells. Ads generally exhibit a broad host spectrum and are capable of infecting a very large number of cell types, such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, myocytes, hepatocytes, nerve cells, and synoviocytes, among many other cell types.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Recombinant Ad vectors are derived from Ads and usually include cis acting regions that are necessary for the replication of the virus in the infected cell (e.g., the ITRs and encapsidation sequences). Recombinant Ad vectors can also contain substantial internal deletions designed to remove or modify viral genes, to allow for the insertion of a heterologous gene(s) for gene transfer. To accommodate heterologous genes, Ads used in gene transfer protocols can be made deficient for replication by deletion of at least the E1 region and are propagated in a complementation host cell line that provides the deleted viral function(s) in trans. One commonly used host cell line, the 293 line, was established from human embryonic kidney cells and provides the Ad E1 function in trans.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Gene delivery systems based on human species C Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) are among the most frequently used in clinical studies, which aim to correct human genetic and acquired diseases, including cancer. The extreme propensity of the virus for hepatocyte infection following its intravascular delivery has made Ad5 the vector of choice for applications requiring high level transgene expression in hepatocytes in vivo. However, the efficient interaction between Ad5 and liver cells, which sequester over 90 of the delivered vector dose (Alemany and Curiel, 2001; Alemany et al., 2000; Worgall et al., 1997), represents a significant hindrance if gene delivery to extra-hepatic cells and tissues, such as disseminated metastatic cancer cells and tissues, is required. From in vitro analyses it was found that Ad5 infection is initiated when the minor capsid protein, fiber, binds to CAR on the cell surface (Bergelson et al., 1997). Subsequent binding of the penton base protein to cellular integrins facilitates internalization of the attached particle into the cell (Wickham et al., 1993). Although both CAR and integrin binding are important for cell infection in vitro, neither of these interactions are essential for Ad5 entry into hepatocytes in vivo (Alemany and Curiel, 2001; Shayakhmetov et al., 2004).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Ad sequestration in liver resident macrophages, Kuppffer cells (Lieber et al., 1997), and macrophages residing in other organs of the body, such as spleen (Di Paolo et al., 2009a), leads to activation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, induction of pro-inflammatory-type of cell death (Manickan et al., 2006), rapid release on polymorphonuclear leukocytes from the bone marrow into the blood (Di Paolo N C, 2014) and systemic toxicity manifested by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the blood, systemic complement activation, followed by leukocytopenia. Acute systemic inflammatory response associated with intravenous administration of Ad represents the key barrier for escalating Ad doses to a level that is therapeutic in gene transfer applications or transduction of metastatic tumors.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The transduction of hepatocytes and the sequestration of Ad virions in the liver tissue after intravascular virus injection are governed by distinct molecular mechanisms. The liver residential macrophages, Kupffer cells, were thought to play the dominant role amongst factors contributing to the sequestration of blood-born Ad virions in the liver. Indeed, when Ad is injected into mice intravenously, Kupffer cells rapidly accumulate large amounts of virus particles (Di Paolo et al., 2009b). Moreover, elimination of Kupffer cells from the liver after treatment of mice with ether clodronate liposomes or gadolinium chloride results in a marked increase in the levels of hepatocyte-specific Ad-mediated gene transfer (Wolff et al., 1997; Worgall et al., 1997), suggesting that significant amounts of infectious virus particles can be trapped by Kupffer cells.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Binding of blood coagulation factor X to Ad5 hexon leads to efficient hepatocyte transduction (Kalyuzhniy et al., 2008; Waddington et al., 2008). However, the sequestration in the liver of Ad5 hexon mutant, which was unable to bind coagulation factors and transduce hepatocytes, was relatively unchanged compared to control unmodified vectors (Kalyuzhniy et al., 2008).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">This invention provides for novel genetically-modified Ad vectors that contain mutations, which simultaneously structurally and functionally diminish or abrogate specific virus interactions with liver cells in a host in vivo and also demonstrate greatly attenuated systemic toxicity and inflammation. One example comprises capsid-modified Ad vectors, wherein a hexon gene is mutated such that Ad interaction with blood factors, including vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors, is abrogated. In another example, a capsid-modified Ad vector comprises a mutated penton gene, such that the Ad interaction in vivo with classes of natural Ad-interacting cellular integrins is diminished or reduced. In another example, the hexon and penton mutations are combined in one vector, leading to the production of the vector suitable for intravascular administration and demonstrating greatly attenuated systemic toxicity and inflammation.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The best mode to carry the invention and as an ultimate and preferred example of embodiment of the novel vector, in addition to mutations in the penton and within the coagulation factor-binding site in the hexon, a third mutation is introduced in the hexon surface-exposed hyper-variable loop 1 (HVR1) that ablates virus interaction with Kupffer cells, resulting in generation of the vector containing three mutations simultaneously. This novel vector, possessing three mutations simultaneously (one in penton and two in hexon hyper variable loops to ablate coagulation factor binding and to prevent virus sequestration in Kupffer cells), escapes sequestration in the liver tissue and demonstrates greatly attenuated systemic toxicity after intravascular administration.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to mutations in hexon and/or penton genes as described above, the Ad vectors described herein can comprise mutations in a gene that encodes for the fiber protein, protein IX, and/or other structural or non-structural proteins.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, the hexon and/or penton mutations can be employed along with administration of one or more substances that further reduce Ad targeting and sequestration in the liver of the host. In one example, warfarin can be used to reduce the interaction of blood cells and blood coagulation factors with the Ad vectors. In another example, the host can be clodronate liposome-treated such that Kupffer cells are killed and eliminated from the liver.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, the Ad vectors, as described herein, can carry one or more transgenes that, for example, exhibit anti-tumor, tumor-suppressor, and/or immune-stimulatory activities or one or more genetic mutations, which enable tumor-selective virus replication. Further, the recombinant Ads as described herein provide a novel design of functionally-distinct and defined sets of mutations, which enable the virus of escaping interaction with host proteins and factors and thereby avoid trapping of the virus in the liver after intravascular delivery.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Ads vectors based on non-Ad5 human serotypes or animal serotypes exhibit differential ability to interact with host proteins and factors, including but not limited to vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors, after intravascular administration (Kalyuzhniy et al., 2008). This disclosure and the molecular mechanisms and functional interactions described here in, provide rationale and methods for modification of non-human Ad5-based vectors to allow their escape from being sequestered in the liver after intravascular delivery. If the non-Ad5-based vector is naturally unable to interact with vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors (such as human Ad serotypes Ad9, Ad50, Ad26, Ad48, Ad51 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>, continued)), then their trapping in the liver after intravascular administration can be prevented via mutations in the penton and/or Kupffer-cell-targeting hexon hyper-variable loops (HVRs). When the non-Ad5-based vector naturally unable to interact with both, the blood factors and Kupffer cells due to natural variation in amino acid sequence of hexon HVRs, the introduction of mutation in penton only is sufficient to allow the virus to escape from the liver sequestration after intravascular administration.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The modified Ad vectors, as described herein, can be employed in one or more methods. In one such method, one or more of the Ad vectors are employed in a method for delivering a transgene or being designed as replicating oncolytic virus targeted to a non-liver cell or both, wherein the target cell can be present within the body of the host. One or more of the Ad vectors can be employed in a method of administering an Ad such that the Ad virions evade sequestration in a host's liver. Such liver detargeted replicating or non-replicating Ad vectors can be useful for use in delivering one or more predetermined transgenes to non-hepatic cells within the body of the host, wherein the transgene is configured to correct a genetic, biochemical, or physiological defect in the host cell or host body or they can be used for eliminating localized or metastatic cancer or treat both solid or hematologic malignancies.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As noted above, the present invention provides for novel modified Ad vectors for the generation and use of Ad vectors comprising modified hexon and/or penton capsid proteins, where the modifications are made to avoid the trapping of Ad in the liver after intravenous virus administration. Additionally, the Ad vectors described herein can comprise genetic mutations in virus-encoded structural and non-structural proteins to enable tumor cell-specific infection and replication of the virus.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In particular, the present invention provides for a recombinant, double-stranded, Ad vector where the single virus genomic DNA molecule comprising genetic mutations in a hexon gene and/or a penton gene. The first type of hexon mutations are configured to reduce or ablate virus interaction with blood coagulation factors, including coagulation factors (F) FX, FIX, FVII, Protein C and Protein S. The second type of hexon mutations are confined to reduce or ablate virus interaction with Kupffer cells, either directly or indirectly, when the virus is administered or reaches into the bloodstream and, therefore, can be present in a complex with blood proteins, other than coagulation factors. The penton mutations are configured to reduce or ablate Ad interactions with cellular integrins, in particular of &#x3b2;3 class.

For human Ad5 serotype, a single amino acid substitution T425A in hexon HVR7 is sufficient to ablate interaction of the virus with blood coagulation factor X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>,<b>14</b></figref>) (Doronin et al., 2012). For other human and animal Ad serotypes, coagulation blood factor-ablating mutation can be introduced into either HVR3 or HVR7 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), depending on where the favorable amino acid sequence for coagulation factor binding is located (Kalyuzhniy et al., 2008).

The gene of interest can encode, for example and without limitation, one of the following polypeptides: cytokines or lymphokines (&#x3b1;-, &#x3b2;- or &#x3b3;-interferon, interleukins (e.g., IL-1&#x3b1;, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-15R, and IL-24), tumor necrosis factors (TNF), colony stimulating factors (e.g., GM-CSF, C-CSF, M-CSF, or the like)); cellular or nuclear receptors (e.g., those recognized by pathogenic organisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria or parasites)); proteins involved in activation of innate immune signaling of prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin (e.g. bacterial flagellin, or the like); proteins involved in triggering a genetic diseases (e.g., factor VII, factor VIII, factor IX dystrophin or minidystrophin, insulin, CFTR protein (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)); growth hormones (e.g., insulin, hGH or the like); enzymes (e.g., urease, renin, thrombin, or the like); enzyme inhibitors (e.g., al&#x2014;antitrypsin, antithrombin III, viral protease inhibitors, or the like); polypeptides with antitumor effect (e.g., which are capable of at least partially inhibiting the initiation or the progression of tumors or cancers), such as antibodies, inhibitors acting on cell division or transduction signals, products of expression of tumor suppressor genes (specifically, but without limitation, p53 or pRb), proteins stimulating the immune system, or the like); proteins of the class I or II major histocompatibility complex or regulatory proteins acting on the expression of the corresponding genes; polypeptides capable of inhibiting a viral, bacterial or parasitic infection or its development (e.g., antigenic polypeptides having immunogenic properties, antigenic epitopes, antibodies, transdominant variants capable of inhibiting the action of a native protein by competition, or the like); toxins (e.g., herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1-TK), ricin, cholera toxin, diphtheria toxin, or the like) or immunotoxins; markers (13-galactosidase, luciferase, Green Fluorescent Protein, or the like); polypeptides having an effect on apoptosis (e.g., inducer of apoptosis: Bax, or the like, inducer of apoptosis Bcl2, Bclx, or the like); cytostatic agents (e.g., p21, p16, Rb, or the like); apolipoproteins (e.g., apoE or the like); superoxide dismutase, catalase, nitric oxide synthase (NOS); growth factors (e.g., Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factors (VEGFs), insulin, or the like), or others genes having therapeutic or research interest. It should be noted that this list is not limiting and that other genes can also be used. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide of interest is not a marker (e.g., &#x3b2;-galactosidase, luciferase, Green Fluorescent Protein, or the like).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">The Ad optionally can include a selectable gene which allows for selection or identification of the infected cells. Suitable selectable genes include, for example, Neo (encoding neomycin phosphotransferase), DHFR (Dihydrofolate Reductase), CAT (Chlorainphenicol Acetyl transferase), PAC (Puromycin Acetyl-Transferase), GPT (Xanthine Guanine Phosphoriboxyl Transferase), or the like. In other embodiments, the Ad is free of selectable genes.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">In certain embodiments, the gene of interest can optionally include elements necessary for the expression of the gene in a host cell. Such elements include, for example, elements facilitating transcription of the gene into RNA and/or the translation of an mRNA into a protein. Suitable promoters include, for example, those of eukaryotic or viral origin. Suitable promoters can be constitutive or regulatable (e.g., inducible). A promoter can be modified to increase promoter activity, suppress a transcription-inhibiting region, make a constitutive promoter regulatable, or the like, introduce a restriction site, or the like. Examples of suitable promoters include, for example, the CMV (Cytomegalovirus) viral promoter, the RSV (Rous Sarcoma Virus) viral promoter, the promoter of the HSV-1 virus TK gene, the early promoter of the SV40 virus (Simian Virus 40), the Ad MLP promoter, the eukaryotic promoters of the murine or human genes for PGK (Phospho Glycerate kinase), MT (metallothionein), utl-antitrypsin and albumin (liver-specific), immunoglobulins (lymphocyte-specific), a tumor-specific promoter (e.g., a-fetoprotein AFP (see, e.g., Ido et al., Cancer Res. 55:3105-09 (1995)); MLJC-1; prostate specific antigen (PSA) (see, e.g., Lee et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:4561-68 (1996)); and flt1 specific for endothelial cells (e.g., Morishita et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:27948-53 (1995)).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">A gene of interest can also include additional elements for the expression (e.g., an intron sequence, a signal sequence, a nuclear localization sequence, a transcription termination sequence, a site for initiation of translation of the IRES type, or the like), for its maintenance in the host cell, or the like.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Also provided are methods of preparing a human or non-human Ad vector according to the present disclosure. Such methods can include, for example, transfecting the genome of the Ad (encoding a mutant Ad hexon protein) into an appropriate cell line and culturing the transfected cell line under appropriate conditions in order to allow the production of the Ad. The Ad optionally can be recovered from the culture. In certain embodiments, e.g. for gene therapy and cancer therapy, the Ad is substantially purified.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">The cell line can be selected according to the deficient functions in the Ad, as applicable. A complementation host cell line capable of providing in trans the deficient fimction(s) can be used. In certain embodiments, the 293 line is used for complementing the E1 function (see, e.g., Graham et al., I Gen. Virol. 36:59-72 (1977) (Graham and van der Eb, 1973)). A complementation host cell line also can complement multiple Ad gene deficiencies, such as, for example, a deficiency of the E1 and E2 or E4. In certain embodiments, a helper virus can be used to complement the defective Ad in a host cell. Methods of propagating defective Ads are known in the art (see, e.g., Graham and Prevec, Methods in Molecular Biology (ed. E. J. Murey, The Human Press Inc.), vol. 7, p. 190-128 (1997)). The Ad genome also can be reconstituted in vitro in, for example, <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>E. coli</i>) by ligation and/or by homologous recombination.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Further provided herein is a host cell infected with an Ad according to the present disclosure or capable of being obtained by a method according to the present invention. The infected host cell can be, for example, a mammalian cell, such as a human cell, or a nonhuman, animal cell. An infected host cell also can be, for example, a primary or tumor cell and of any suitable origin, for example, of hematopoietic (e.g., a totipotent stem cell, leukocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte or macrophage, or the like), muscle (e.g., a satellite cell, myocyte, myoblast, smooth muscle cell), cardiac, nasal, pulmonary, tracheal, hepatic, epithelial or fibroblast origin.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">In addition to the examples of the embodiment of Ads and Ad vectors, provided herein are isolated nucleic acids encoding an Ad penton protein, the penton protein comprising a mutation in the RGD motif of the penton protein, wherein the mutation causes reduced binding of a host cell &#x3b2;3 integrin proteins in vivo, when expressed in an Ad. In a further aspect, disclosed herein are isolated nucleic acids, wherein the nucleic acid additionally encodes an Ad hexon protein, the hexon protein comprising a mutation in the HVR3, HVR5, or HVR7 region of the hexon protein, wherein the mutation causes reduced binding of a vitamin K dependent clotting factor in vivo when expressed in an Ad.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">ii. Nucleic Acids</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0093">The provided nucleic acids are made up of for example, nucleotides, nucleotide analogs, or nucleotide substitutes. Non-limiting examples of these and other molecules are discussed herein. It is understood that for example, when a vector is expressed in a cell, that the expressed mRNA will typically be made up of A, C, G, and U. Likewise, it is understood that if, for example, an antisense molecule is introduced into a cell or cell environment through for example exogenous delivery, it is advantageous that the antisense molecule be made up of nucleotide analogs that reduce the degradation of the antisense molecule in the cellular environment.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">A nucleotide is a molecule that contains a base moiety, a sugar moiety and a phosphate moiety. Nucleotides can be linked together through their phosphate moieties and sugar moieties creating an internucleoside linkage. The base moiety of a nucleotide can be adenin-9-yl (A), cytosin-1-yl (C), guanin-9-yl (G), uracil-1-yl (U), and thymin-1-yl (T). The sugar moiety of a nucleotide is a ribose or a deoxyribose. The phosphate moiety of a nucleotide is pentavalent phosphate. An non-limiting example of a nucleotide would be 3-AMP (3&#x2032;-adenosine monophosphate) or 5&#x2032;-GMP (5&#x2032;-guanosine monophosphate).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">It is understood that nucleotide analogs need only contain a single modification, but may also contain multiple modifications within one of the moieties or between different moieties.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">ii. Expression Systems</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0096">The nucleic acids that are delivered to cells typically contain expression controlling systems. For example, the inserted genes in viral and retroviral systems usually contain promoters, and/or enhancers to help control the expression of the desired gene product. A promoter is generally a sequence or sequences of DNA that function when in a relatively fixed location in regard to the transcription start site. A promoter contains core elements required for basic interaction of RNA polymerase and transcription factors, and may contain upstream elements and response elements.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">1. Viral Promoters and Enhancers</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Preferred promoters controlling transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells may be obtained from various sources, for example, the genomes of viruses such as: polyoma, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), Ad, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably cytomegalovirus, or from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g. beta actin promoter. The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication (Fiers et al., <i>Nature, </i>273: 113 (1978)). The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment (Greenway, P. J. et al., <i>Gene </i>18: 355-360 (1982)). Of course, promoters from the host cell or related species also are useful herein.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Enhancer generally refers to a sequence of DNA that functions at no fixed distance from the transcription start site and can be either 5&#x2032; (Laimins, L. et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. </i>78: 993 (1981)) or 3&#x2032; (Lusky, M. L., et al., <i>Mol. Cell Bio. </i>3: 1108 (1983)) to the transcription unit. Furthermore, enhancers can be within an intron (Banerji, J. L. et al., <i>Cell </i>33: 729 (1983)) as well as within the coding sequence itself (Osborne, T. F., et al., <i>Mol. Cell Bio. </i>4: 1293 (1984)). They are usually between 10 and 300 bp in length, and they function in cis. Enhancers function to increase transcription from nearby promoters. Enhancers also often contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Promoters can also contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Enhancers often determine the regulation of expression of a gene. While many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, -fetoprotein and insulin), typically one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus for general expression. Preferred examples are the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and Ad enhancers.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">The promotor and/or enhancer may be specifically activated either by light or specific chemical events which trigger their function. Systems can be regulated by reagents such as tetracycline and dexamethasone. There are also ways to enhance viral vector gene expression by exposure to irradiation, such as gamma irradiation, or alkylating chemotherapy drugs.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">In certain embodiments the promoter and/or enhancer region can act as a constitutive promoter and/or enhancer to maximize expression of the region of the transcription unit to be transcribed. In certain constructs the promoter and/or enhancer region be active in all eukaryotic cell types, even if it is only expressed in a particular type of cell at a particular time. A preferred promoter of this type is the CMV promoter (650 bases). Other preferred promoters are SV40 promoters, cytomegalovirus (full length promoter), and retroviral vector LTR.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">It has been shown that all specific regulatory elements can be cloned and used to construct expression vectors that are selectively expressed in specific cell types such as melanoma cells. The glial fibrillary acetic protein (GFAP) promoter has been used to selectively express genes in cells of glial origin.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human or nucleated cells) may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription which may affect mRNA expression. These regions are transcribed as polyadenylated segments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding tissue factor protein. The 3&#x2032; untranslated regions also include transcription termination sites. It is preferred that the transcription unit also contains a polyadenylation region. One benefit of this region is that it increases the likelihood that the transcribed unit will be processed and transported like mRNA. The identification and use of polyadenylation signals in expression constructs is well established. It is preferred that homologous polyadenylation signals be used in the transgene constructs. In certain transcription units, the polyadenylation region is derived from the SV40 early polyadenylation signal and consists of about 400 bases. It is also preferred that the transcribed units contain other standard sequences alone or in combination with the above sequences improve expression from, or stability of, the construct.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">2. Markers</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0103">The viral vectors can include nucleic acid sequence encoding a marker product. This marker product is used to determine if the gene has been delivered to the cell and once delivered is being expressed. Preferred marker genes are the <i>E. Coli </i>lacZ gene, which encodes &#x3b2;-galactosidase, and green fluorescent protein.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">In some embodiments the marker may be a selectable marker. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidine kinase, neomycin, neomycin analog G418, hydromycin, and puromycin. When such selectable markers are successfully transferred into a mammalian host cell, the transformed mammalian host cell can survive if placed under selective pressure. There are two widely used distinct categories of selective regimes. The first category is based on a cell's metabolism and the use of a mutant cell line which lacks the ability to grow independent of a supplemented media. Two examples are: CHO DHFR-cells and mouse LTK-cells. These cells lack the ability to grow without the addition of such nutrients as thymidine or hypoxanthine. Because these cells lack certain genes necessary for a complete nucleotide synthesis pathway, they cannot survive unless the missing nucleotides are provided in a supplemented media. An alternative to supplementing the media is to introduce an intact DHFR or TK gene into cells lacking the respective genes, thus altering their growth requirements. Individual cells which were not transformed with the DHFR or TK gene will not be capable of survival in non-supplemented media.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">The second category is dominant selection which refers to a selection scheme used in any cell type and does not require the use of a mutant cell line. These schemes typically use a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells which have a novel gene would express a protein conveying drug resistance and would survive the selection. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, (Southern P. and Berg, P., <i>J. Molec. Appl. Genet. </i>1: 327 (1982)), mycophenolic acid, (Mulligan, R. C. and Berg, P. <i>Science </i>209: 1422 (1980)) or hygromycin, (Sugden, B. et al., <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>5: 410-413 (1985)). The three examples employ bacterial genes under eukaryotic control to convey resistance to the appropriate drug G418 or neomycin (geneticin), xgpt (mycophenolic acid) or hygromycin, respectively. Others include the neomycin analog G418 and puramycin.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">iv. Sequence Similarities</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0106">It is understood that as discussed herein the use of the terms homology and identity mean the same thing as similarity. Thus, for example, if the use of the word homology is used between two non-natural sequences it is understood that this is not necessarily indicating an evolutionary relationship between these two sequences, but rather is looking at the similarity or relatedness between their nucleic acid sequences. Many of the methods for determining homology between two evolutionarily related molecules are routinely applied to any two or more nucleic acids or proteins for the purpose of measuring sequence similarity regardless of whether they are evolutionarily related or not.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">In general, it is understood that one way to define any known variants and derivatives or those that might arise, of the disclosed genes and proteins herein, is through defining the variants and derivatives in terms of homology to specific known sequences. This identity of particular sequences disclosed herein is also discussed elsewhere herein. In general, variants of genes and proteins herein disclosed typically have at least, about 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent homology to the stated sequence or the native sequence. Those of skill in the art readily understand how to determine the homology of two proteins or nucleic acids, such as genes. For example, the homology can be calculated after aligning the two sequences so that the homology is at its highest level.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">Another way of calculating homology can be performed by published algorithms. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman <i>Adv. Appl. Math. </i>2: 482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, <i>J. MoL Biol. </i>48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. </i>85: 2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">It is understood that any of the methods typically can be used and that in certain instances the results of these various methods may differ, but the skilled artisan understands if identity is found with at least one of these methods, the sequences would be said to have the stated identity, and be disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">For example, as used herein, a sequence recited as having a particular percent homology to another sequence refers to sequences that have the recited homology as calculated by any one or more of the calculation methods described above. For example, a first sequence has 80 percent homology, as defined herein, to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using the Zuker calculation method even if the first sequence does not have 80 percent homology to the second sequence as calculated by any of the other calculation methods. As another example, a first sequence has 80 percent homology, as defined herein, to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using both the Zuker calculation method and the Pearson and Lipman calculation method even if the first sequence does not have 80 percent homology to the second sequence as calculated by the Smith and Waterman calculation method, the Needleman and Wunsch calculation method, the Jaeger calculation methods, or any of the other calculation methods. As yet another example, a first sequence has 80 percent homology, as defined herein, to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using each of calculation methods (although, in practice, the different calculation methods will often result in different calculated homology percentages).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">v. Pharmaceutical Carriers/Delivery of Pharmaceutical Products</heading><p id="p-0113" num="0111">In one aspect, it is understood and herein contemplated that the novel Ads of the present invention and nucleic acids can be used as a component in a pharmaceutical composition for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes. In one aspect, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising any of the Ads, Ad vectors, and nucleic acids disclosed herein. It is understood and herein contemplated that for reasons well-known in the art, it may be advantageous for any pharmaceutical composition to comprise a replication-defective or replication-attenuated recombinant Ad. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise an Ad, wherein the Ad is a replication-competent or replication-restricted to replicate in tumor cells only recombinant Ads.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">Further provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic or prophylactic agent, a host cell or an Ad, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, the composition can be used for preventive and/or treatment of diseases, such as genetic diseases (e.g., hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, Duchenne's myopathy or Becker's myopathy, or the like), localized and disseminated metastatic cancers of solid or hematologic origin, including those induced by oncogenes or viruses, viral diseases, such as hepatitis B or C and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from HIV infection), recurring viral diseases, such as viral infections caused by the herpesvirus and cardiovascular diseases including restenosis.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">Accordingly, the compositions can also be administered in vivo in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be administered to a subject, along with the nucleic acid or vector, without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained. The carrier would naturally be selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject, as would be well known to one of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">The compositions may be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., intravenously), by intramuscular injection, by intraperitoneal injection, transdermally, extracorporeally, topically or the like, including topical intranasal administration or administration by inhalant. As used herein, &#x201c;topical intranasal administration&#x201d; means delivery of the compositions into the nose and nasal passages through one or both of the nares and can comprise delivery by a spraying mechanism or droplet mechanism, or through aerosolization of the nucleic acid or vector. Administration of the compositions by inhalant can be through the nose or mouth via delivery by a spraying or droplet mechanism. Delivery can also be directly to any area of the respiratory system (e.g., lungs) via intubation. The exact amount of the compositions required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, weight and general condition of the subject, the severity of the allergic disorder being treated, the particular nucleic acid or vector used, its mode of administration and the like. Thus, it is not possible to specify an exact amount for every composition. However, an appropriate amount can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">Parenteral administration of the composition, if used, is generally characterized by injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. A more recently revised approach for parenteral administration involves use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant dosage is maintained. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,610,795, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">The materials may be in solution, suspension (for example, incorporated into microparticles, liposomes, or cells). These may be targeted to a particular cell type via antibodies, receptors, or receptor ligands. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Senter, et al., <i>Bioconjugate Chem., </i>2:447-451, (1991); Bagshawe, K. D., <i>Br. J. Cancer, </i>60:275-281, (1989); Bagshawe, et al., <i>Br. J. Cancer, </i>58:700-703, (1988); Senter, et al., <i>Bioconjugate Chem., </i>4:3-9, (1993); Battelli, et al., <i>Cancer Immunol. Immunother., </i>35:421-425, (1992); Pietersz and McKenzie, <i>Immunolog. Reviews, </i>129:57-80, (1992); and Roffler, et al., <i>Biochem. Pharmacol, </i>42:2062-2065, (1991)). Vehicles such as &#x201c;stealth&#x201d; and other antibody conjugated liposomes (including lipid mediated drug targeting to colonic carcinoma), receptor mediated targeting of DNA through cell specific ligands, lymphocyte directed tumor targeting, and highly specific therapeutic retroviral targeting of murine glioma cells in vivo. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Hughes et al., <i>Cancer Research, </i>49:6214-6220, (1989); and Litzinger and Huang, <i>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, </i>1104:179-187, (1992)). In general, receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis, either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin-coated pits, enter the cell via clathrin-coated vesicles, pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted, and then either recycle to the cell surface, become stored intracellularly, or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions, such as nutrient uptake, removal of activated proteins, clearance of macromolecules, opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins, dissociation and degradation of ligand, and receptor-level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway, depending on the cell type, receptor concentration, type of ligand, ligand valency, and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis has been reviewed (Brown and Greene, <i>DNA and Cell Biology </i>10:6, 399-409 (1991)).</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">1. Pharmaceutically Acceptable Carriers</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0117">The compositions, including antibodies, can be used therapeutically in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy </i>(19th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. 1995. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier include, but are not limited to, saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of composition being administered.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">Pharmaceutical carriers are known to those skilled in the art. These most typically would be standard carriers for administration of drugs to humans, including solutions such as sterile water, saline, and buffered solutions at physiological pH. The compositions can be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Other compounds will be administered according to standard procedures used by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">Pharmaceutical compositions may include carriers, thickeners, diluents, buffers, preservatives, surface active agents and the like in addition to the molecule of choice. Pharmaceutical compositions may also include one or more active ingredients such as antimicrobial agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anesthetics, and the like.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">The pharmaceutical composition may be administered in a number of ways depending on whether local or systemic treatment is desired, and on the area to be treated. Administration may be topically (including ophthalnically, vaginally, rectally, intranasally), orally, by inhalation, or parenterally, for example by intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection. The disclosed antibodies can be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, or transdermally.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples ofnon-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like.

Example 1: Blood-Born Ad Virions are Efficiently Sequestered in the Liver Independently of the Virus Fiber Structure or RGD Motif-Mediated Penton Binding to Integrins</heading><p id="p-0137" num="0135">To assess the potential role of the Ad fiber structure or an RGD motif-mediated penton binding to cellular integrins in mediating the sequestration of the blood-born virus particles in the liver, a set of the previously constructed Ad5-based vectors which possessed mutated fibers or RGD motif deletion within the penton base was utilized. Ad5 and Ad5&#x394;RGD vectors were able to bind CAR as a primary virus attachment receptor. Ad5/35L, Ad5/35L&#x394;RGD, Ad5*F and Ad5*F&#x394;RGD possessed the fiber knob domains that were unable to bind CAR due to a single point mutation within the Ad5 fiber knob that abrogates its binding to CAR (for Ad5*F and Ad5*F&#x394;RGD), or due to the substitution of an entire Ad5 fiber knob domain for a fiber knob domain derived from Ad35, which binds human CD46 as a primary attachment receptor (for Ad5/35L, Ad5/35L&#x394;RGD). Ad5/35S vector possesses a wild type Ad5 capsid except for the fiber shaft and knob domains that were derived from Ad35. All these vectors were injected intravenously into C57BL6/J mice and 1 h later, livers were harvested and the amount of Ad DNA trapped in the liver for each of the vectors was analyzed using Southern blotting. This analysis revealed that independently of modifications of the fiber or the RGD motif deletion in the penton base, all vectors accumulated at comparable levels in the liver (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). This example provides direct evidence that the prior art disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,136 does not teach on or enable the construction of the Ad of the present invention that escapes sequestration in the liver after intravascular administration in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">ii. Example 2: Inactivation of the Blood Factor Pathway of Hepatocyte Transduction does not Prevent Blood-Born Ad Virion Sequestration in the Liver or Virus Accumulation in Kupffer Cells</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0136">When Ad5 is injected intravenously, virus hexon protein binds coagulation factor X with very high affinity and that this interaction leads to efficient virus entry into hepatocytes and hepatocyte transduction in vivo. To better understand whether inactivation of this in vivo pathway of Ad virion entry into hepatocytes would result in the reduction of the amounts liver-sequestered Ad particles after intravenous virus injection, unmodified Ad virus as administered into control untreated mice and mice treated with warfarin, which inactivates all vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors. Analysis of Ad DNA trapped in the liver 1 h after intravenous virus injection showed that warfarin treatment did not result in a significant reduction of Ad virion sequestration in the liver at this time point (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">After intravenous injection, large amounts of Ad virions are known to be trapped by liver residential macrophages, Kupffer cells. To assess whether the Kupffer cell capacity to trap blood-born Ad particles is changed in mice treated with warfarin, Ad5 was administered intravenously and 1 h later analyzed the co-localization of virus particles with Kupffer cells by immunostaining and fluorescent microscopy. This analysis revealed that in the control and warfarin-treated mice, Kupffer cells were present in the liver (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Importantly, when liver sections of mice were co-stained with Ad5 hexon-specific antibody and F4/80 antibodies, a clear co-localization of Ad hexon-specific staining was observed with Kupffer cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), indicating that warfarin treatment of mice did not ablate the Kupffer cell capacity to trap blood-born Ad.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">Different wild type human Ad serotypes show high variability in Kds of FX binding to their capsids. To further evaluate whether variations in amino acid composition of the exposed regions of hexon and Kds of FX binding can affect the efficacy of Ad virion sequestration in the liver, mice were injected intravenously with wild type human Ad serotypes Ad3, Ad14, Ad16, and Ad35. Herein it is shown that Ad16 has 1.67 nM Kd of FX binding, while Ad3 has Kd of FX binding equal 3000 nM and Ad35 did not demonstrate FX binding at all. The evaluation of sequestration of these viruses in the liver after intravenous administration showed no difference in the amounts of Ad3 and Ad16 and higher levels of Ad35 DNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), indicating that virus binding to FX cannot be the only important pathway mediating the sequestration of the blood-born Ad virions in the liver.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">To analyze whether the treatment of mice with warfarin had any effect on the Ad-mediated hepatic cell transduction, control mice and warfarin-treated mice were administered Ad5RFP vector, possessing unmodified wild type Ad5 capsid, but expressing red fluorescent protein under the control of CMV promoter. Histological evaluation of liver sections for RFP expression showed that Ad5RFP transduced hepatocytes with very high efficiency in control mock-treated mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> upper panels). Also, the treatment of mice with warfarin completely abrogated Ad5-mediated hepatocyte transduction. Surprisingly, detailed evaluation of liver sections also revealed that in the warfarin-treated group, Ad5RFP also transduced sinusoid endothelial cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, lower panels, and <b>3</b>B). Although the level of RFP expression in these cells was quite low, RFP expression was detected in 10.8% of all analyzed cells. CD31/RFP-double positive cells represented 17% of all CD31-positive endothelial cells. In contrast, RFP expression was not observed in &#x3b2;2-integrin-positive cells of hematopoietic origin, including circulating and residential monocytes and macrophages (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Collectively, the data indicate that although warfarin-mediated inactivation of the blood factor pathway of hepatocyte infection completely abrogates Ad virions hepatocyte transduction, it does not appreciably affect Ad virions sequestration in the liver after intravenous virus injection. Moreover, wild type human Ad serotypes that vary dramatically in their Kds of FX binding accumulate in the liver at comparable levels after intravenous virus administration. The treatment of mice with warfarin did not prevent Ad accumulation in Kupffer cells; however, it allowed for re-direction of Ad infection from hepatocytes to sinusoid endothelial cells.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">iii. Example 3: The Depletion of Kupffer Cells has No Effect on Ad Sequestration in the Liver</heading><p id="p-0142" num="0140">Kupffer cells are known to accumulate large amounts of Ad particles shortly after intravenous virus administration. Polyinosinic acid, poly(I), administration into mice prior to Ad injection drastically reduces the capacity of Kupffer cells to trap blood-born Ad in vivo. This data suggest that a poly(I)-specific receptor, scavenger receptor A, can be involved in sequestering Ad virions from the blood after its intravenous injection. To evaluate this possibility, Ad5-based vectors were administered into wild type or scavenger receptor A knockout mice (SR-A-KO) and analyzed both virus DNA deposition in the liver by Southern blotting and virus trapping in Kupffer cells by fluorescent microscopy. These analyses showed that in both control wild type mice and SR-A-KO mice, Kupffer cells retained the capacity to accumulate Ad particles after intravenous virus administration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). It was also found that the amount of Ad vector DNA that could be recovered from the liver after intravenous virus injection was virtually identical in wild type and SR-A-KO mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>), indicating that SR-A is not, or at least cannot be, the only receptor responsible for the Kupffer cells capacity to trap blood-born Ad in vivo.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">Next, whether the depletion of these phagocytic cells can reduce the liver's capacity to sequester the blood-born Ad was analyzed. To deplete Kupffer cells, macrophage elimination by a single dose clodronate liposome injection was used. Intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes into mice resulted in complete elimination of Kupffer cells from the liver (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). However, the Southern blot analysis of Ad DNA amounts in the livers of clodronate liposome-treated mice or control mice treated only with PBS showed no difference in the amounts of Ad trapped in the liver independently of the presence of Kupffer cells in liver parenchyma (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">iv. Example 4: Simultaneous Treatment of Mice with Warfarin and Clodronate Liposomes Results in an Only Partial Reduction in Liver Capacity to Sequester Blood-Born Ad</heading><p id="p-0144" num="0142">The findings that inactivation of blood factor pathway or depletion of Kupffer cells resulted in no measurable reduction in the amounts of Ad DNA trapped in the liver after intravenous virus administration were rather unexpected, since large amounts of Ad particles accumulate in Kupffer cells and Ad DNA persists long-term in transduced hepatocytes. The data indicates that a dynamic balance can exist between the mechanisms of the Ad sequestration by Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in vivo. This data also indicates that the mechanisms of sequestration of blood-born Ad can work in a redundant and synergistic manner. To evaluate this possibility, the sequestration of Ad DNA in the livers of mice treated with both the warfarin and clodronate liposomes prior to Ad administration was analyzed. This analysis revealed that when harvested at 1 h after intravenous Ad injection, the amount of virus DNA trapped in the liver was 35% lower in mice treated with both warfarin and clodronate liposomes, compared to mice treated with warfarin only (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B</figref>). Although the difference between these two experimental groups was statistically significant, it was not dramatic. Close evaluation of Ad distribution in the livers of mice treated with warfarin and clodronate liposomes showed abundant punctuate Ad-specific staining localized to liver sinusoids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). Because this type of Ad distribution in the livers of mice treated with either warfarin or clodronate liposomes independently was not observe, the data indicate that yet another mechanism of Ad sequestration became engaged when both Kupffer cells and the blood factor pathway are inactivated. Because Ad particles might accumulate in platelets, liver sections were stained with a platelet-specific anti-CD41 antibody. Using this approach, Ad hexon-specific staining was found to be co-localized with CD41-specific staining in very few areas, while the vast majority of punctuate Ad hexon-specific staining was not overlapping with CD41 staining.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">To better define the localization of Ad particles in the liver sinusoids of mice treated with warfarin and clodronate liposomes, transmission electron microscopy was employed. One hour after virus injection, liver tissue was harvested, fixed, and processed for ultra-thin sectioning. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that cytoplasmic organization of hepatocytes was highly distorted in warfarin-treated mice, indicating a major cytotoxic effect of this drug on hepatic cells. Ad particles were easily identifiable on thin sections and were localized to the Disse space, the anatomical area underneath and between sinusoid endothelial cells and the hepatocyte surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). As expected, Ad particles were present in liver sinusoids as free particles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">Collectively, this data indicates that under the conditions when sequestration mechanisms mediated by Kupffer cells and blood coagulation factors are not functioning, Ad trapping in the Disse space between liver sinusoids endothelial cells and hepatocytes can become the major mechanism responsible for trapping large amounts of blood-born Ad in the liver.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">v. Example 5: RGD Motif-Mediated Ad Interaction Play a Major Role in Sequestering Blood-Born Ad in the Liver when Other Virus Clearance Mechanisms have been Inactivated</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0145">The Ad internalization into cells is facilitated by the penton base RGD motif-mediated binding to cellular integrins. Many RGD motif-interacting integrins were shown to serve as functional co-receptors, capable of facilitating Ad internalization into different kinds of cells. Moreover, it was shown that Ad interaction with integrins can mediate both the virus attachment to and internalization into cells. Because RGD motif-interacting &#x3b2;3-integrin is a subunit &#x3b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x3b2;3 integrin expressed on endothelial cells, sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver can be reduced in mice that are knockout for &#x3b2;3-integrin gene. To evaluate this further, &#x3b2;3-KO mice were administered with Ad5 with or without treatment with warfarin and clodronate liposomes and analyzed the virus DNA deposition in the liver by Southern blotting. This analysis revealed that although the accumulation of Ad5 in the livers of wild type control and &#x3b2;3-KO mice was comparable, the treatment of &#x3b2;3-KO mice with warfarin and clodronate liposomes resulted in a significantly greater reduction in levels of Ad trapped in the liver after intravenous virus injection, compared to wild type animals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>). The analysis of Ad trapping in Kupffer cells after intravenous virus administration showed that in both strains of mice, Kupffer cells were capable of trapping blood-born Ad (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>), indicating that &#x3b2; integrin is unlikely to contribute significantly to the capacity of Kupffer cells to trap blood-born Ad particles.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">To further evaluate if Ad penton RGD motif-mediated interactions are responsible for Ad retention in the Disse space, wild type mice were injected with an Ad5&#x394;RGD vector, possessing a three amino acid deletion in the penton base. Using Southern blotting, a major reduction in levels of Ad DNA was observed to be recovered from the livers of wild type mice treated with warfarin and clodronate liposomes that were injected with Ad5&#x394;RGD vector (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). The levels of Ad5&#x394;RGD DNA associated with the liver were 30%, compared to the levels of Ad5 DNA in mice treated with both warfarin and clodronate liposomes, and were 18% compared to Ad5 DNA levels in the mock-treated control group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). The analysis of Ad5&#x394;RGD distribution in the livers of mice treated with warfarin and clodronate liposomes using fluorescent microscopy showed a complete lack of Ad-specific staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">To further verify the role of the Ad penton RGD motif in mediating the trapping of blood-born Ad in the liver, and to assess the engagement order of pathways governing this process, Ad5&#x394;RGD was administered into mice treated with either warfarin or clodronate liposomes alone. The analysis of Ad DNA deposition in the livers of these mice showed that, similarly to mice injected with control unmodified Ad5, treatment with either warfarin or clodronate liposomes alone did not result in a measurable reduction of vector DNA trapped in the liver after intravenous injection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). However, the combination of pharmacological treatment of mice simultaneously with warfarin and clodronate liposomes and the ablation of RGD motif-mediated interactions resulted in a major reduction in the amount of vector DNA associated with liver tissue, providing the evidence for the redundancy and synergism of molecular mechanisms that operate in the liver and enable quantitative removal of the Ad from the blood and trapping it in the liver tissue after intravenous Ad injection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">vi.

Another example of a modification that can ablate coagulation factor binding is the insertion of positively-charged amino acids (R, K, H) in HVR7 or HVR3, thus mimicking the natural geometrical arrangement of amino acids in Ad3 and Ad5, which do not bind FX efficiently, although they possess canonical FX binding TDT sequence in HVR3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>, continued).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">Specific minimal mutation of Ad hexon allowing for complete ablation of Ad interaction with coagulation factors, including but not limited to FX and FVII, is a single amino acid substitution of Threonine (425) for Alanine (T425A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>A</figref>,B).

This data is consistent with finding from mice pharmacologically conditioned with warfarin (to inactivate blood coagulation factors) and injected with Ad5&#x394;RGD and demonstrated no reduction in the levels of virus particles sequestered in the liver, compared to unmodified virus or saline-conditioned mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">Ad2-M virus was used as a platform, and additional novel deletion was introduced into hexon HVR1 loop (SEQ ID No.: 5), which was empirically found to allow for the virus to escape being trapped in Kupffer cells after intravascular virus administration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>).

This data shows an equifunctional role of three distinct hepatocellular compartments in enabling Ad trapping in the liver after intravascular administration and implicates specific molecular mechanisms in mediating virus-hepatic cell interaction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>). This model necessitates the introduction of three specific mutations into Ad5-based vectors to allow for virus escape from being sequestered by the liver after intravascular administration, as exemplified for the preferred embodiment of this invention, Ad-3M vector (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">Upon targeting to extrahepatic (tumor cells and metastases in other organs) or non-hepatic cells in the liver (tumor metastases in the liver) via fiber modifications or by other means (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>), the virus dose that is therapeutic for the described penton and hexon-mutated vectors, can be much lower and resulting in viral safety being much higher, due to the low acute systemic toxicity of such a virus, compared to unmodified virus variants.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">ix. Example 9: Discussion</heading><p id="p-0163" num="0161">Ad is a non-enveloped virus with a double-stranded linear DNA genome (Shenk, 2001). The susceptibility of cells to virus infection in vitro was ascribed, at least in part, to efficient Ad fiber binding to a specific attachment receptor on the cell surface (Nemerow, 2000). For human species A, C, D, E, and F Ad serotypes, CAR was shown to bind the fiber knob domain and mediate efficient virus entry into cells in vitro (Roelvink et al., 1998). For the majority of human species B serotypes, CD46 was identified as a high affinity virus attachment receptor (Gaggar et al., 2003). The fiber binding to the virus attachment receptor is followed shortly by the RGD motif dependent interaction of a penton base protein to cellular integrins (Wickham et al., 1993). This interaction promotes Ad particle internalization into the cell as well as initiates the virus capsid disassembly program. Different Ad serotypes infect a variety of cells in vitro and in vivo with high efficiency. Based on this property of Ad, numerous Ad-based vectors have been developed for gene transfer and vaccination studies (Thomas et al., 2003). However, when Ad vectors were delivered at high doses or via routes not associated with natural Ad infection, the infectivity and tissue bio-distribution did not correlate with the levels of the fiber attachment receptors (Alemany and Curiel, 2001). Specifically, after intravenous injection of human Ad5-based vectors, 99% of the delivered vector dose is rapidly sequestered in the liver (Khare et al., 2011a). Moreover, ablation of both CAR and integrin interactions through mutation of Ad fiber and penton proteins did not prevent virus accumulation in the liver and efficient hepatocyte transduction (Shayakhmetov et al., 2004). The efficient interaction between Ad and liver cells causes clinically significant hepatotoxicity and represents a major hindrance if gene delivery to extra-hepatic cells and tissues, such as disseminated metastatic tumors, is required.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">The liver residential macrophages, Kupffer cells, are amongst the most studied factors contributing to rapid sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver (Di Paolo et al., 2013; Di Paolo et al., 2009b; Khare et al., 2011b; Lieber et al., 1997; Manickan et al., 2006; Wolff et al., 1997; Worgall et al., 1997). After intravenous virus injection, Kupffer cells trap large amounts of virus particles. This accumulation of Ad particles in Kupffer cells causes a non-linear dose response for Ad vector-mediated transgene delivery into hepatocytes. Ad interactions with Kupffer cells induce activation of inflammatory responses. Recent data suggests that high dose intravenous Ad administration can induce rapid Kupffer cell death that might also contribute to activation of pro-inflammatory host responses (Di Paolo et al., 2013). On the other hand, it was also shown that inactivation of Kupffer cells prior to intravenous Ad administration significantly increases the levels of circulating virus and transduction of hepatic and extra-hepatic cells (Khare et al., 2013; Khare et al., 2011b; Wolff et al., 1997). Although Kupffer cells can accumulate large amounts of blood-born Ad, virus entry into Kupffer cells does not lead to their transduction in vivo, indicating that Kupffer cells represent a poor niche for Ad propagation. Instead, Kupffer cell rapidly die via a necrotic type of cell death (Di Paolo et al., 2013; Manickan et al., 2006). Collectively, these data strongly indicated that Ad rapping by Kupffer cells is the first in line of the potential mechanisms mediating sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">The data obtained in this study indicates however, that the Ad trapping by Kupffer cells is not the only mechanism responsible for the sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver. Surprisingly, complete elimination of Kupffer cells from the liver parenchyma after clodronate liposome administration led to no reduction in Ad DNA sequestered in the liver after intravenous virus injection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). This data indicates that functional inactivation of Kupffer cells with gadolinium chloride also failed to reduce the amount of Ad DNA trapped in the liver shortly after intravenous virus injection. Because elimination of Kupffer cells leads to marked increase in the level of Ad-mediated hepatocyte transduction, the data indicates that the vector particles that escaped sequestration by Kupffer cells are now efficiently entered hepatocytes, resulting in greatly increased levels of transgene expression.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">The earlier data suggested that the entry of Ad5 into hepatocytes is mediated by blood factors and does not depend on virus interactions with CAR or integrins (Kalyuzhniy et al., 2008; Waddington et al., 2008). Recent studies clearly demonstrated that high affinity Ad5 hexon binding to coagulation factor X is sufficient to mediate hepatocyte transduction with Ad5 vectors in vivo. Parker at al., have shown that the treatment of mice with the drug warfarin, inactivating all vitamin-K blood coagulation factors, ablates hepatocyte transduction with intravenously injected Ad5 vectors (Parker et al., 2006). Although warfarin treatment of mice completely abrogated hepatocytes transduction with Ad5 vectors in this study (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), it was found that the amount of Ad DNA sequestered in the liver was similar in warfarin-treated and control mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The earlier studies showed that when liver tissue is perfused with Ad5 in situ in blood-free conditions, Kupffer cells can accumulate Ad particles in a blood factor (FIX)-dependent manner (Shayakhmetov et al., 2005).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">Here, it was found that in warfarin-treated mice, Kupffer cells retain the capacity to trap blood-born Ad, indicating that the blood factor-mediated pathway of Ad entry in Kupffer cells is not the only one to control Ad-Kupffer cell interactions. This observation indicates that Kupffer cells can bind Ad via SR-A, since pre-injection of mice with SR-A-specific ligand poly(I) drastically reduced Ad accumulation in Kupffer cells after intravenous virus injection (Haisma et al., 2008). The quantitative analysis of Ad accumulation in the liver and qualitative evaluation of Ad trapping in Kupffer cells using SR-A-KO mice showed that both the amounts of Ad DNA and the capacity of Kupffer cells to accumulate Ad particles were similar in SR-A-KO and control mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The data presented herein strongly indicates that the SR-A-dependent mechanism is unlikely to play a dominant role in mediating Ad interaction with Kupffer cells. The effect of poly(I) on Ad trapping in Kupffer cells can be explained by alternate indirect mechanisms, where the signaling downstream of SR-A, upon its binding to poly(I), can block or interfere with Kupffer cell phagocytic function or endosome formation.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">The lack of a significant reduction in the amounts of Ad DNA sequestered in the livers of Kupffer cell-depleted or warfarin-treated mice, when compared to control animals, indicates that a previously unknown redundancy and synergism between different mechanisms controlling sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver exists. To evaluate this further, mice were treated with both warfarin and clodronate liposomes and analyzed Ad sequestration in the liver after intravenous virus injection. The studies unexpectedly revealed only a modest reduction in the amounts of Ad DNA sequestered in the livers of mice treated with the combination of drugs. While 35% less Ad DNA was trapped in livers of mice treated with both warfarin and clodronate liposomes, 65% of Ad DNA still remained trapped in livers of mice that lacked Kupffer cells and possessed no coagulation factors in blood (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). This data that Ad sequestration mechanisms likely operate in a redundant and synergistic manner and an unknown sequential order of engagement of these mechanisms to ensure efficient clearance of blood-born Ad from circulation. The detailed analyses of Ad particle distribution in the liver parenchyma using fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy revealed abundant dispersed Ad particles localized to liver sinusoids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Because this type of virus distribution was not observed in livers of mice treated with each drug independently, or in mock-treated animals, this data indicates that new interactions of Ad with liver cells become activated only under the condition when other sequestration mechanisms have been inactivated.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">In this study, it was demonstrated that Ad penton RGD motifs contribute to virus trapping in the space of Disse that separates liver sinusoid endothelial cells from hepatocytes. The analysis of Ad deposition in the livers of &#x3b2;3-integrin-knockout mice indicates that &#x3b2;3-integrin, contributes to this interaction. Because &#x3b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x3b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin is expressed on endothelial cells, when Ad particles cannot enter hepatocytes, they can bind RGD-interacting integrins with &#x3b2;3-integrin subunit on sinusoid endothelial and thus become retained in the Disse space, leading to eventual internalization into endothelial cells or hepatocytes, and virus clearance from circulation. The data, demonstrating low level sinusoid endothelial cell transduction with Ad in mice treated with warfarin, supports this idea (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">The data uncovered a previously unknown redundancy and synergism in mechanisms mediating the sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver. A model was proposed for sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). This conceptual model indicates that a defined set of specific molecular mechanisms become engaged in a redundant, synergistic, and orderly manner to ensure the clearance of blood-born Ad from circulation. When small amounts of Ad particles appear in blood, the virus trapping by Kupffer cells works as a fist dominant mechanism, mediating Ad sequestration in the liver. When the Ad dose exceeds the capacity of Kupffer cells to trap the virus, hepatocytes absorb blood-born Ad particles in a blood factor-dependent manner, serving as a second dominant mechanism mediating sequestration of blood-born Ad. However, when the Ad dose is high and both the Kupffer cells and blood-factor pathways are inactivated, sinusoid endothelial cells and the anatomical architecture of liver sinusoids become the third line of defense that sequesters Ad particles in an RGD motif-dependent manner.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">To test this model and reduce to practice Ad variant capable of escaping of being sequestered in the liver after intravascular delivery, a set of mutated Ad5-based vectors was developed, where specific mutations ablating interactions with hepatic cells were introduced for some or all of the pathways mediating Ad trapping in the liver (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>). It is important to note that in the exemplary context of Ad5-based vectors, possessing individual mutations ablating only one or two of the mechanisms that mediate virus trapping in the liver, the sequestration of Ad particles in the liver after intravascular virus administration cannot be prevented. Indeed, Ad vectors ablated either for binding to blood coagulation factors due to T425A hexon mutation (Ad-TEA), or ablated for interaction with RGD-specific cellular integrins due to substitution of RGD penton loop for human laminin-derived peptide (Ad-Lam), or their combination in the single Ad-2M virus, containing both of these mutations simultaneously, all of these vectors were still trapped in the liver tissue one hour after intravenous virus injection as efficiently as non-modified wild type Ad5 virus, Ad-WT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>C</figref>, SEQ ID No.: 1). However, the best way to carry the invention is the incorporation of the third and novel mutation in hexon HVR1 in addition to T425A hexon and Lam penton mutations into one and the same vector, Ad-3M, which revealed remarkable property of the resultant triple-mutant virus, which was able to escape liver sequestration following its intravascular injection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0170">In addition to its reduced sequestration in the liver tissue, intravenous injection of the triple-mutated Ad-3M vector exhibited remarkably lower inflammatory cytokine and chemokine activation in the spleen, compared to unmodified Ad-WT virus. Unlike unmodified Ad-WT vector, Ad-3M virus also failed to trigger rapid necrotic death of liver macrophages, Kupffer cells, providing direct evidence for greatly improved safety profile, compared to Ad5-WT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>D and <b>23</b>E</figref>). These properties of the virus arise from mutations introduced into Ad5 penton which abrogate its interaction with cellular integrins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>) and in hexon, which ablates virus interaction with coagulation factor FX (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0171">This study is the first demonstration of the Ad vector design for ablating the sequestration of blood-born Ad in the liver based on specific genetic inactivation of a defined set of mechanisms that control this process.
