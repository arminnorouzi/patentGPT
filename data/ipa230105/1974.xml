description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to the technical field of vehicles for children, and in particular the field of convertible vehicles for small children.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Convertible vehicles can be used in at least two distinct configurations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Children's vehicles are already known in the state of the art, for example tricycles, comprising a seat on which a safety element is mounted to surround the body of a child. The safety element in particular makes it possible to prevent the child from falling out of the seat. This type of vehicle also comprises a handlebar intended to be grasped by the child, with or without the possibility of controlling the steering of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the children's vehicle as known from the state of the art has the defect of being very bulky when the vehicle is in operation and/or stored.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the invention is to provide a children's vehicle that is compact while providing good protection for the child.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To this end, the object of the invention is a vehicle for children comprising a vehicle body on which are mounted:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a front wheel and at least one rear wheel,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a steering sub-assembly comprising a steering column linked to the front wheel and a handlebar,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a seat configured to accommodate a child,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a safety element configured to surround at least a first area of the child's body when it is installed on the seat,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">the handlebar being removable between:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a first configuration in which the handlebar is remote from the safety element, and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a second configuration in which the handlebar is close to the safety element and surrounds a second area of the child's body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;handlebar&#x201d; is understood to mean a tube provided with handles controlling the steering of the vehicle, or at least comprising two branches arranged on either side of the steering column.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is understood that the vehicle is a convertible vehicle. It can assume two distinct operational configurations, that is to say, two different configurations of the vehicle, used by the child while he is installed on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is understood that in the first configuration, the handlebar does not surround the second area of the child's body.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The two different configurations of the handlebar allow a single element to be used to ensure the function of guiding the vehicle and the function of protecting the child. Indeed, when the handlebar is in the first configuration, the vehicle is better suited to a child who is able to use the handlebar to control the steering of the moving vehicle; when the handlebar is in the second configuration, the vehicle is better suited to a young child requiring body protection to prevent any potential fall of the child out of the seat. The handlebar that performs these two functions makes the whole vehicle compact and reduces the number of parts needed to manufacture the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to other optional features of the invention, taken alone or in combination:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The children's vehicle comprises attachment means configured to connect the handlebar and the safety element, so that they delimit a closed space in the second configuration.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As a result, the child sitting on the seat is better protected from a potential fall.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The attachment means comprise a protuberance and a cavity configured to receive the protuberance by snap-fastening, the protuberance and the cavity being arranged one on the handlebar and the other on the safety element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The handlebar comprises two branches arranged on either side of the steering column, each branch being rotatably mounted about an axis of rotation substantially perpendicular to the steering column.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The axes of rotation of the branches are normal to planes that intersect one another.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each branch therefore forms a non-right angle with the median plane of the vehicle. This makes it possible to bring the branches closer to the safety element in the second configuration of the handlebar. In addition, the branches can be arranged so that they are closer to the body of the child so that he can grasp them with his hands.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The handlebar is rotatably mounted on the steering column about a vertical axis of rotation, the vertical axis of rotation being included in the plane of symmetry of the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To do this, the handlebar may have a shape allowing both configurations. For example, the handlebar can have a half-circle or a crescent shape.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The child vehicle comprises a lock button configured to lock the handlebar in the first configuration or in the second configuration.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The lock button can be, for example, a push button arranged so that the movement of the handlebar is authorized when the button is actuated and the movement of the handlebar is locked when the button is released.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The children's vehicle comprises a backrest connected to the seat, the safety element comprising two arms having the shape of an arc arranged on either side of the backrest, each arm comprising an end provided with a protuberance.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The safety element is rotatably mounted on the backrest about a horizontal axis of rotation, the safety element being movable between a safety position and a retracted position.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is understood that the safety position is a position where the safety element is capable of forming a closed space with the handlebar and that the retracted position is a position where the safety element is substantially in the plane of the backrest.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rotation of the safety element is achieved, for example, by a ball joint.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The safety element is detachable from the vehicle for better compactness of the vehicle when it is stored, for example, by folding the backrest toward the seat.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The invention will be better understood upon reading the description that follows, given solely by way of example and with reference to the appended drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a children's vehicle comprising a handlebar in the second configuration;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of part of the children's vehicle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of another part of the children's vehicle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a detail of the handlebar.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref> show a children's vehicle, designated by general reference <b>1</b>, according to one embodiment of the invention. The vehicle comprises a vehicle body <b>10</b> on which are mounted a front wheel <b>31</b> and two rear wheels <b>32</b> to form a tricycle. A steering sub-assembly <b>20</b> is arranged at the front of the vehicle and comprises a steering column <b>21</b> linked to the front wheel <b>31</b> and a handlebar <b>22</b>. The children's vehicle <b>1</b> further comprises an operating rod <b>70</b> that is placed at the rear of the vehicle. The rod <b>70</b> comprises a control handle <b>11</b> for control of the vehicle by an accompanying adult. The rod <b>70</b> is engaged in a housing arranged at the rear of the vehicle body <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the vehicle comprises a seat <b>41</b> sized to receive a child, the seat <b>41</b> being connected to the vehicle body <b>10</b> by a mounting tube <b>21</b> passing through a hole provided on the vehicle body <b>10</b>. A backrest <b>42</b> is rotatably mounted relative to the seat <b>41</b> and comprises a safety element <b>50</b> consisting of two arms <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> having an arc shape arranged on either side of the backrest <b>42</b>. Thus, the arms <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> are capable of surrounding a first area of the child's body, for example an area encompassing the child's back and ribs, when he is installed on the seat <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this illustrated embodiment, the arms <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> are rotatably mounted on the backrest <b>42</b> about a horizontal axis of rotation (A<b>4</b>) and are movable between a safety position, as visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, and a retracted position, where the arms <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> are rotated about the horizontal axis of rotation (A<b>4</b>) until they are substantially parallel to the backrest <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment of the handlebar <b>22</b> comprising two branches <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> arranged on either side of the steering column <b>21</b>. Each branch <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> is rotatably mounted about an axis of rotation (A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>) substantially perpendicular to the steering column <b>21</b>. Furthermore, the axes of rotation (A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>) are normal to planes that intersect one another.
