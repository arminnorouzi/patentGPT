for shipping produce, e.g., bananas, utilize ventilation structures that allow for ventilation therethrough. A method of assembling produce boxes provides for cutouts that serve as ventilation structures in the boxes. When the produce boxes are stacked such as on a shipping pallet, the ventilation structures allow for ventilation of through the stacked boxes. Produce may be packed in a bag, which is closed with a rip cord and inserted into a produce box. The rip cord may be accessed when the box is in a stack such as on a shipping pallet, such that the rip cord may be pulled thereby opening the bag, without removing the box from the stack.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="119.21mm" wi="151.05mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="168.57mm" wi="116.25mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="114.38mm" wi="109.81mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="219.54mm" wi="161.12mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="187.54mm" wi="145.88mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="183.90mm" wi="157.14mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="140.46mm" wi="153.08mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="169.16mm" wi="164.42mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="225.89mm" wi="79.16mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="224.62mm" wi="75.78mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="227.25mm" wi="81.70mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-D00011" he="200.66mm" wi="166.12mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-D00012" he="208.70mm" wi="161.37mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-D00013" he="187.79mm" wi="116.92mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00014" num="00014"><img id="EMI-D00014" he="198.80mm" wi="156.46mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00014.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00015" num="00015"><img id="EMI-D00015" he="213.70mm" wi="153.16mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00015.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00016" num="00016"><img id="EMI-D00016" he="141.14mm" wi="155.28mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00016.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00017" num="00017"><img id="EMI-D00017" he="109.56mm" wi="108.54mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00017.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00018" num="00018"><img id="EMI-D00018" he="188.89mm" wi="108.46mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00018.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00019" num="00019"><img id="EMI-D00019" he="213.28mm" wi="73.15mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00019.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00020" num="00020"><img id="EMI-D00020" he="200.74mm" wi="72.05mm" file="US20230002107A1-20230105-D00020.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/625,588, entitled &#x201c;Optimized System, Box and Bag for Packing, Shipping, Storing and Displaying Produce,&#x201d;

For this reason, produce is packaged in boxes that protect the produce during shipment, while allowing for sufficient ventilation of the produce to control air flow, moisture and/or ripening, which may impact shelf life.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bananas may be packed and shipped in corrugated boxes, such as box <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. For instance, box <b>50</b> comprises a base <b>51</b> and a lid <b>53</b> positionable over base <b>51</b>. Base <b>51</b> and/or lid <b>53</b> typically comprise ventilation structures <b>57</b> (e.g., holes, cut-outs, etc.), on a side, top, and/or bottom surface of the base <b>51</b> and/or lid <b>53</b> to provide ventilation. For added protection of the bananas <b>100</b>, a flexible plastic bag <b>54</b> comprising a plurality of ventilation slits may be placed in the base <b>51</b> of the box <b>50</b>. Hands of bananas <b>100</b> are typically placed inside of the bag <b>54</b> in upper and lower rows. The lower rows may be covered with a paper tunnel pad to improve pack stability, and to protect the lower rows from damage, abrasion and/or scarring that could be caused by the two upper rows. Once the bananas <b>100</b> are packed into the bag <b>54</b>, the plastic bag <b>54</b> is gathered and folded so that the unfilled portion of the bag <b>54</b> overlaps the fruit. In the alternative, the open edges of the bag <b>54</b> are gathered together and closed with twine <b>55</b> above the fruit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The box <b>50</b> is then closed by telescopically sliding the lid <b>53</b> of the box over the base <b>51</b> of the box <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once the box <b>50</b> is closed, it may be stacked onto a shipping pallet <b>52</b>, along with other packed and closed boxes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the lid <b>53</b> typically comprises flaps <b>59</b> extending along the length of each sidewall of the box <b>50</b>, which are folded over to form the top surface of the lid <b>53</b>. One or more boxes <b>50</b> can thereby be stacked on top of one another by placing the base <b>51</b> of a first box <b>50</b> onto the top surface formed by flaps <b>59</b> of a second box <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Boxes <b>50</b> are then stacked onto the shipping pallet <b>52</b> such that ventilation structures <b>57</b> in the boxes <b>50</b> align with each other. Alignment of ventilation structures of boxes when they are on the pallet, allows air to circulate through all of the boxes on the pallet, which in turn allows for an optimal banana temperature (for transportation, storage and ripening) to be reached, and provides for uniformity of the temperature across the pallet (thereby minimizing banana color differentials across the pallet). To keep the boxes <b>50</b> in place on the pallet <b>52</b> during shipment, plastic corner-boards and straps may be placed around the boxes <b>50</b> and the pallet <b>52</b> as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Once bananas (or other fruits) have been shipped to their destination, they may be ripened while on the pallets in a ripening room. Once the bananas are ripe, the straps and corner-boards may be removed from the pallet and the required number of boxes may be sent to the point of purchase. When the pallet arrives at a store, the plastic overwrap is opened and/or removed, to access the boxes. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a shipping pallet <b>52</b> of prior art banana boxes <b>50</b> after the plastic overwrap (not shown) has been removed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To display bananas, a prior art banana box <b>50</b> may be removed from the pallet <b>52</b> and the lid <b>53</b> of the box <b>50</b> may be cut open, or in the alternative, the lid <b>53</b> can be removed and inverted and the base <b>51</b> of the box <b>50</b> can be telescopically slid into the lid <b>53</b>. The plastic bag <b>54</b> inside the box <b>50</b> may then be opened. The opened plastic bag <b>54</b> may be draped over the sides of the box <b>50</b> to return the box <b>50</b> to the opened configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, so the bananas <b>100</b> can be easily removed from the box <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary display <b>1100</b> of bananas <b>100</b> in a store is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As bananas <b>100</b> are sold, bananas are replenished on the display <b>1100</b> throughout the course of the day. To make the re-stocking process easier, opened boxes <b>50</b> may be stored at or near the display <b>1100</b>, or under the display <b>1100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. If there is not sufficient space to store some or all of the opened boxes <b>50</b> near the display <b>1100</b>, then some or all of the opened boxes <b>50</b> may be stored on the shipping pallet <b>52</b> until needed. To keep the stored bananas from ripening prematurely and shortening their shelf-life, each opened box <b>50</b> is re-placed onto the shipping pallet <b>52</b> in a cross-stack as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The steps of removing an overwrap from a pallet load of boxes, removing boxes from the pallet, opening the boxes and the plastic bags contained therein to prepare the boxes, and, in some instances, cross-stacking the prepared boxes back onto the pallet is labor intensive and time consuming. Thus, there is a need for an improved banana box and plastic bag that allows for maintenance of favorable shipping and storage conditions, while providing for improved handling and storage at the point of purchase. The need is particularly felt for bananas, but also applies to other produce, including other fruits and vegetables, which require similar handling, and may also have varying requirements during the packing, shipping and storing processes.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present disclosure is directed to improved boxes, improved plastic bags, systems comprising them and methods of their use. As described in further detail below, the boxes comprise a substantially rigid outer lid portion and a substantially rigid base portion. When in an assembled state, the lid portion of the box telescopically slides over the base portion of the box. The lid portion of the box comprises corner tabs that are joined together to form platforms supported by the side walls of the lid portion. The platforms provide a surface onto which other boxes may be stacked, such as on a pallet. The platforms and tops of the side walls of the box define an opening in the lid portion, such that produce (e.g., bananas) inside the box are visible and/or accessible through the opening, in contrast to the prior art box, which requires removal of the lid portion of the box to access the produce (e.g., bananas) that are inside the box.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with the present disclosure, bananas may be packed into an improved bag that is draped over the sides of the base of the box during the packing process as described above. Once the bananas are packed into the bag, it is closed using a ripcord that is tied in a knot around the opening in the bag. The improved bag comprises perforations as described below, that allow the bag to easily be opened by pulling on the ripcord. One or more ends of the ripcord may extend through an opening (e.g., a handle) of the box, thereby allowing the bag to be opened without opening the box.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The improved box and bag may provide the following advantages:</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Like prior art produce boxes and bags, the improved box and bag protect bananas during shipment, while allowing for adequate ventilation through the box and bag, and throughout the stacked boxes on a pallet. At the point of purchase, and after the plastic overwrap has been cut open and/or removed from the palletized boxes, the bags in the boxes may be opened by pulling the ripcords extending through an opening (e.g., the handle) of the box. Thus, the improved box and bag eliminate the need to remove each box from the pallet and/or to open the box, prior to opening the bag. Since there is adequate ventilation throughout the ventilation structures of the improved boxes when they are stacked boxes on a pallet, there is no need to remove the boxes from the pallet, open them, open the bags and then cross-stack the boxes back onto the pallet for storage. But rather, to store bananas in improved boxes on a pallet at the point of purchase, only two steps are needed, removal or opening of the plastic overwrap from the pallet and pulling the ripcord to open each of the improved bags, while leaving the improved boxes closed and stacked on the pallet.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described below, some exemplary boxes comprise an opening in its top portion that is large enough to permit removal of the bananas from the box without opening the box, such as by cutting it open, or removing the lid. Bananas packed inside these exemplary boxes may be readily removed from the box by simply pulling the ripcord to open the improved bag. Thus, these exemplary boxes can be moved from a pallet nearer to the point of purchase display and bananas readily removed therefrom, without any further processing of the box, including opening the box.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Reference will now be made in detail to the aspects of the disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like numerals indicate the same elements throughout the views.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referencing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, an exemplary box <b>10</b> for produce, particularly bananas, is provided. Produce box <b>10</b> comprises a base <b>12</b> and a lid <b>32</b> that may be positioned over base <b>12</b>. Each of these components will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows base <b>12</b> of produce box <b>10</b> in an unassembled state. In the unassembled state, the base <b>12</b> comprises a first side panel <b>11</b>, a front panel <b>13</b>, a second side panel <b>15</b> and a rear panel <b>17</b> aligned longitudinally with each other. Each panel <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> comprises a respective flap <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> extending outwardly from each panel <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>. In the illustrated example, the flaps <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> each extend from the bottom edge of each panel <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> such that each flap <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> is longitudinally aligned with each other. A tab <b>29</b> is further positioned adjacent to the first side panel <b>11</b>. In the illustrated example, a score line <b>22</b> is provided between each panel <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>, flap <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, and tab <b>29</b> to allow for easier assembly of base <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">To assemble base <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the panels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> are folded along the score lines <b>22</b> such that the side panels <b>11</b>, <b>15</b> are substantially parallel with each other and the front and rear panels <b>13</b>, <b>17</b> are substantially parallel with each other. Tab <b>29</b> may be folded inwardly and positioned against the interior surface of rear panel <b>17</b>. In some versions, tab <b>29</b> is adhered to the rear panel <b>17</b> to maintain the base <b>12</b> in an assembled configuration. Panels <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> thereby form an opening <b>24</b> through the top surface of the base <b>12</b>.

For instance, exemplary boxes may have defined dimensions such that the boxes may fit snugly on a pallet without overhanging the edges of the pallet, thereby protecting the fruit from damage during shipping. The boxes <b>10</b> are generally made from corrugated cardboard, but can be made from any material typically used for making shipping boxes.

Referencing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, boxes <b>10</b> are structured so that air can circulate through all of the boxes <b>10</b> when they are stacked on top of each other, such as on a shipping pallet. This can allow for the boxes to be stacked on a pallet, e.g., in 8 layers of 6 boxes for a regular shipping pallet, or in 4 layers of 6 boxes for a &#x201c;half-pallet,&#x201d; while allowing for adequate ventilation through the palletized boxes. Ventilation and air flow serve two important functions with regard to boxes <b>10</b> stacked on a shipping pallet: (1) they allow for efficient air flow which may provide an optimal banana temperature (for transportation, storage and ripening) to be reached; and (2) they provide for uniformity of that temperature across the pallet (thereby minimizing banana color differentials across the pallet). Ventilation and air flow are usually achieved by placing apertures and/or cutouts in boxes which are not blocked (and allow air flow) when individual boxes are stacked on top of each other and adjacent to one another. Examples of such banana boxes ventilation systems, which may be of use in the improved systems of the present disclosure, are described in PCT Published Patent Application WO 2004/045972, published Jun. 3, 2004; and U.S. Published Patent Application 2003/0198714, published Oct. 23, 2003; each of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Produce, particularly bananas, may be packed into the improved boxes in any suitable fashion.

This inner wrap may be a bag made of plastic with a plurality of ventilation slits provided about the surface of the bag. The bag is typically placed in the base portion of a box, and the open edges of the bag are draped over its sidewalls. In this fashion, fruit, such as bananas, placed inside the bag, such as by being layered therein. Once fruit is packed into the bag, the plastic bag may be gathered and folded so that the unfilled portion of the bag overlaps the fruit. In the alternative, the open edges of the bag <b>54</b> may be gathered together and closed with twine <b>55</b> above the fruit (for example, as shown in relation to the prior art box and plastic bag <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Improved plastic bag <b>70</b> according to the present disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, improved plastic bag <b>70</b> comprises an open top end <b>76</b>, a closed bottom end <b>78</b>, and a plurality of perforations <b>71</b> through the sidewalls of the bag <b>70</b>.
