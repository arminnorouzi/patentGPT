Many high-speed digital signals are transmitted between analog and/or digital chips. High-speed inter-chip links can significantly reduce the total number of signal traces between chips in a system. In such applications, overall system performance decreases as the communication speed between chips in the system increases. For a given data rate, multi-level signaling can be used to reduce the channel symbol rate. Multi-level signaling also lowers the required maximum on-chip clock frequency, intersymbol interference (ISI), and crosstalk.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a signaling system with edge enhancement for the signal transmitter, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> are &#x201c;eye&#x201d; diagrams of a 4-PAM signaling system, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are block diagrams illustrating circuitry for controlling an output impedance of a signal transmitter circuit for use in edge enhancement, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a circuit for controlling an amount of current with which a signal is transmitted for use in edge enhancement, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method of edge enhancement for a signal transmitter, according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a computing environment with a memory controller configured to use edge enhancement when transmitting signals to a memory system, according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following description sets forth numerous specific details such as examples of specific systems, components, methods, and so forth, in order to provide a good understanding of several embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that at least some embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known components or methods are not described in detail or are presented in simple block diagram format in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present disclosure. Thus, the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Particular implementations may vary from these exemplary details and still be contemplated to be within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The increasing demand for data bandwidth in computing systems, memory devices, etc., has driven high-speed serial link standards to move to multi-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signaling. Multi-level PAM signaling schemes are specified in part by the number of voltage levels used to represent symbols. For example, a &#x201c;4-PAM&#x201d; system uses 4 levels; a &#x201c;6-PAM&#x201d; system uses 6 levels, etc. One of the main challenges in multi-level PAM signaling is that transitions from different levels take different amounts of time due to the driver slew rate. For example, a transition from the lowest voltage level (referred to herein as &#x201c;&#x2212;3&#x201d; in a 4-PAM system) to the highest voltage level (referred to herein as &#x201c;+3&#x201d; in a 4-PAM system) may take considerably longer than a transition from an intermediated level (referred to herein as &#x201c;&#x2212;1&#x201d; or &#x201c;+1&#x201d; in a 4-PAM system) to the highest voltage level. This is evident when an &#x201c;eye&#x201d; diagram of the signal is generated illustrating that the signal transitions cross the threshold of each eye (referred to herein as the zero crossing) at different times causing a horizontal eye closure (i.e., a reduced timing margin). Since the amount of eye closure is a function of the driver slew rate at the output, it may be desirable to use the edge enhancement techniques described herein to increase the eye width.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For a driver with a fixed output impedance and capacitive load, the slew rate is fixed and does not vary as the data rate increases or decreases. Accordingly, when the data rate increases, the relative eye closure per unit interval due to slew rate gets worse. To alleviate this problem, edge enhancement can be used to increase the slew rate, thereby reducing the rise and fall times of the multi-level signal. Enhancements to the edges of the transmitter output signal can require various tradeoffs, including increased power usage and circuit complexity, and may not consider the optimum amount of edge enhancement for each individual signal transition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Aspects of the present disclosure can address the above and other considerations by, in some implementations, adjusting one or more parameters that impact the slew rate of the signal transmitter only during certain transitions from one voltage level to another and only by a designated amount. For example, the transmitter may include a slew rate control circuit configured to opportunistically adjust the output impedance of the signal transmitter or to inject a specific amount of current into the signal during the relevant transition periods. The desired output impedance and/or amount of current is determined in order to maximize, or at least improve, the eye width (e.g., timing margin) of a 4-PAM transmitter output by using different slew rates for different transitions. By adjusting the parameters only during certain transitions, the output swing and return loss will not be significantly affected. In addition, the proposed edge-enhancement circuitry can be modified so that it can be used for swing enhancement and fine transmit equalization (TxEQ) without losing the swing. This allows the transmitter to be configured for any combination of swing-enhancement, TxEQ-enhancement, and edge-enhancement to achieve the best performance. Additional details of edge enhancement for a signal transmitter are provided below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a data transmission system <b>100</b> with edge enhancement for the signal transmitter, according to an embodiment. Transmitting device <b>102</b>, which could be any kind of digital or analog processing system, provides signals <b>103</b> to output driver <b>110</b>. Signals <b>103</b> typically include data to be transmitted. In some embodiments, a system clock (&#x201c;SysClk&#x201d;) may also be provided from transmitting device <b>102</b> to output driver <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, transmitting device <b>102</b> and output driver <b>110</b> receive a system clock SysClk from external clock circuitry (not depicted). Output driver <b>110</b> drives one or more symbols onto channel <b>114</b>. Channel <b>114</b> can be any one of a number of types of links, including, but not limited to, coaxial cable, a trace or series of traces (e.g., metallic traces) on a printed circuit board, a set of twisted pair wires, a complicated signal path from a daughtercard onto a motherboard and back to another daughtercard, a path through which microwave or radio frequency signals propagate, or any one of a number of other physical environments over which data transmission is to be achieved. Typically, transmitting device <b>102</b> and output driver <b>110</b> are embodied on a single printed circuit board <b>106</b> (e.g., embodying a signal transmitter circuit). In some embodiments, transmitting device <b>102</b> and output driver <b>110</b> may be embodied on the same integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The symbols propagate on channel <b>114</b>, and are received by receiver <b>120</b>. Receiver <b>120</b> decodes the symbols and provides resulting signals <b>105</b> to receiving device <b>104</b>. Typically, signals <b>105</b> include data decoded from the symbols. Additionally, signals <b>105</b> may also contain a receiver clock (&#x201c;RxClk&#x201d;). Some embodiments include, as part of channel <b>114</b>, a dedicated line for symbols representing the receiver clock RxClk. The receiver clock, in other embodiments, is received directly as part of the symbols. In some embodiments, the receiver clock, RxClk, is derived from the symbols by receiver <b>120</b>. In these embodiments, receiver <b>120</b> typically includes clock recovery circuitry. Receiving device <b>104</b> could be any kind of analog or digital processing unit. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, receiving device <b>104</b> and receiver <b>120</b> are embodied on a single printed circuit board <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, receiving device <b>104</b> and receiver <b>120</b> are embodied on a single integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the operation of output driver <b>110</b> is influenced by slew rate control circuit <b>116</b>. For example, the rate of output of the one or more symbols and the modulation scheme by which the symbols encode data in signals <b>103</b> may vary depending on the state of one or more mode signals provided to output driver <b>110</b> by slew rate control circuit <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> may reside on printed circuit board <b>106</b> (e.g., as part of the signal transmitter circuit). In other embodiments, however, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> may reside elsewhere, such as on printed circuit board <b>108</b>, partially on printed circuit board <b>106</b> and partially on printed circuit board <b>108</b>, or on neither printed circuit board <b>106</b> nor printed circuit board <b>108</b>. Depending on the embodiment, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> may optionally influence the operation of receiver <b>120</b>. For example, receiver <b>120</b> may contain a plurality of subcircuits configured to decode symbols modulated by various modulation schemes. Slew rate control circuit <b>116</b>, in some embodiments, provides one or more mode signals to receiver <b>120</b> over signal line <b>118</b>, allowing receiver <b>120</b> to disable any subcircuits not needed to decode symbols in the present modulation scheme, saving power. In some embodiments, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> determines a state of one or more mode signals, at least in part, based on information provided by receiver <b>120</b>. Receiver <b>120</b> provides information about the received symbols to slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> over bi-directional signal line <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the information provided refers to various aspects of the timing of received symbols including, but not limited to, jitter, rise time, fall time, overshoot, and undershoot, or a subset of these. Depending on the embodiment, signal line <b>118</b> may be a separate signal line or may be part of channel <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, a second implementation of the slew rate control circuit (i.e., slew rate control circuit <b>126</b>) may be present on printed circuit board <b>108</b>. Slew rate control circuit <b>126</b> may be either the same as slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> or may include different circuitry and/or logic. In this embodiment, slew rate control circuit <b>126</b> may receive information from receiver <b>120</b> and may provide said information to slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> over signal line <b>118</b>. Depending on the embodiment, the information provided by receiver <b>120</b> may include, for example, signal parameters including the level of slew rate, output impedance, or injected current, and/or crossing point information indicating where the signal transmitted on channel <b>114</b> crosses a threshold voltage when transitioning from one voltage level to another. For example, receiver <b>120</b> may indicate through the provided information whether an increase or decrease in transmit equalization (TXEQ) for the transmitted signal would be preferred. Slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> may use the information provided by receiver <b>120</b> (optionally provided through slew rate control circuit <b>126</b>) to adjust the slew rate of the transmitted signal, as described herein. As another example, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> may direct output driver <b>110</b> to drive a predetermined test sequence of data as symbols onto channel <b>114</b>. Receiver <b>120</b> then decodes the symbols which, when received, have undergone various types of distortion imparted by channel <b>114</b>. Receiver <b>120</b> then may provide the decoded data to slew rate control circuit <b>116</b>. Based on differences between the test data and received data, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> may then change the state of a mode signal to achieve lower error-rate transmission through channel <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> selects a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) scheme in this way.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, output driver <b>110</b> transmits a signal over channel <b>114</b> using a multi-level PAM scheme comprising a plurality of discreet signal levels. PAM is one of a number of digital modulation schemes (others including pulse duration modulation (PDM) and pulse position modulation (PPM)) used to transmit analog and/or digital data over a channel. A multi-level version of this modulation scheme provides a means of increasing the amount of data that may be transmitted without increasing the frequency of transmitted symbols. Hereinafter, a PAM modulation scheme in which a symbol may assume any one of N levels will be referred to as N-PAM. Thus, in a 4-PAM modulation scheme, a symbol may assume any one of four levels. For example, relative to a maximum reference voltage Vref, data could be gray coded in a 4-PAM scheme. In an exemplary gray coded 4-PAM modulation scheme, the symbol representing the bit-pair (00) has an ideal voltage level of 0, the symbol representing the bit-pair (01) has an ideal voltage level of Vref/3, the symbol representing the bit-pair (11) has an ideal voltage level of 2*Vref/3, and the symbol representing the bit-pair (10) has an ideal voltage level of Vref. In some embodiments, symbols are encoded and driven as various currents on a pair of conductors in the transmission channel (differential current-mode signaling). In other embodiments, the symbols are driven as currents on one or more conductors (single-ended or differential current-mode signaling). In still other embodiments, the symbols are driven as voltage levels on one or more conductors.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Traditional 2-PAM modulation schemes drive symbols that assume one of only two distinct levels. Each symbol in a 4-PAM serial link carries twice as much data as each symbol in a 2-PAM scheme. For a fixed maximum signal level, 2-PAM has traditionally yielded optimal data transfer rates, as larger noise margins exist amongst possible symbol levels. The larger noise margins, in turn, permit higher levels of noise to corrupt the signal before ambiguity exists in decoding the symbol.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As system designers move to serial link technologies operating above 1 Gbps, however, multi-level signaling schemes offer a convenient means of either increasing data transmission rates while sending symbols at a fixed symbol rate or maintaining a given data transmission rate while sending symbols at a lower symbol rate. This flexibility allows minimization of bit-error rates (i.e., the probability with which the receiver incorrectly decodes a symbol). At higher data and symbol rates, various sources of signal degradation complicate the choice of the optimal number of levels for PAM modulation. As with the other problems, the higher the frequency, in general, the greater the signal loss.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When using the multi-level PAM scheme (e.g., 4-PAM), output driver <b>110</b> varies the voltage level of the signal depending on what value is being transmitted.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, output driver <b>110</b> initiates transitions of the signal from one level to another according to the value. For ease of explanation herein, in a 4-PAM scheme, the lowest signal level may be referred to as &#x201c;&#x2212;3,&#x201d; the next signal level may be referred to as &#x201c;&#x2212;1,&#x201d; the third signal level may be referred to as &#x201c;+1,&#x201d; and the highest signal level may be referred to as &#x201c;+3.&#x201d; The transition from any one of these signal levels to another may have a corresponding transition time. Thus, the transition from &#x2212;3 to +3, for example, may take a longer period of time than the transition from +1 to +3. In one embodiment, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> can adjust one or more parameters of the signal transmitter circuit that impact the transition time only during certain transitions from one voltage level to another and only by a designated amount. For example, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> may adjust the output impedance of the output driver <b>110</b> or may inject a specific amount of current into the signal during the relevant transition periods. The desired output impedance and/or amount of current is determined in order to increase the eye width (e.g., timing margin) of the signal output by using different slew rates for different transitions. Either so-called edge enhancement technique is designed to cause the signal to reach a designated threshold voltage level (sometimes referred to herein as the &#x201c;zero crossing&#x201d;) at a certain period of time after the transition is initiated, regardless of which levels the signal transition is occurring between. Additional details regarding the operation of slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> are provided below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The data transmission system <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> represents only one of many typical systems in which high data-rate signaling over a complex communications channel <b>114</b> is possible. For example, in other data transmission systems, channel <b>114</b> is bidirectional, capable of propagating symbols in both directions along its length. In some of these systems, devices on opposite ends of the channel (e.g. printed circuit board <b>106</b> and printed circuit board <b>108</b>) each send and receive symbols to the other. These systems may exploit the bidirectionality of the channel <b>114</b> by simultaneously propagating symbols in both directions on channel <b>114</b>. In other systems, symbols travel only in one direction at any given time on channel <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, printed circuit board <b>106</b> and printed circuit board <b>108</b> each include an output driver <b>110</b> and a receiver <b>120</b>.

A multi-level PAM signal, such as a 4-PAM signal may be characterized by its eye diagram, such as eye diagrams <b>200</b> and <b>250</b>. The eye diagrams represent the ranges of transmission voltages and signal transmission times for a signal when data transmission is successful. An eye diagram, in essence, is an overlay of the time history of a plurality of received symbols in a data transmission system, such as data transmission system <b>100</b>. After determining the &#x201c;eye&#x201d; for each transition of the signal, the corresponding eye patterns are overlaid to generate the overall device performance characteristics. The height and width of the &#x201c;eye&#x201d; <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, or <b>206</b> serves as a figure of merit for the transmission system, as these determine the level of complexity required to unambiguously decode the symbols. The width of each &#x201c;eye&#x201d; represents the range of signal transition times, which still results in successful data transmission. The height of each &#x201c;eye&#x201d; represents the amount of voltage error and noise that the system can tolerate. In general, the larger the &#x201c;eye,&#x201d; the better the device characteristics. A larger &#x201c;eye&#x201d; means larger timing and voltage margins and increased tolerance to noise and timing skew.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the 4-PAM system depicted by the eye diagram <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the symbol width is defined by the interval between time <b>210</b> and time <b>220</b>. Symbols in a 4-PAM system have one of four levels: <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, or <b>236</b>. The widths of eyes <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b> are each less than the symbol width due to a variety of effects including, but not limited to, slew rate, timing jitter, intersymbol interference (ISI), and dispersion in the transmission channel. The heights of eyes <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b> are all less than the magnitude difference between signal levels due to a number of effects, many of which are related to losses in a band limited transmission channel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the eye width (also referred to herein as the &#x201c;horizontal eye opening&#x201d;) is measured at a threshold voltage or &#x201c;zero crossing.&#x201d; In one embodiment, the threshold voltage may be positioned at the midpoint between any two voltage levels. For example, the threshold voltage <b>240</b> is located at the midpoint between signal levels <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. As illustrated in eye diagram <b>200</b>, the signal transitions from signal levels <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b> to signal level <b>230</b> all reach the threshold voltage <b>240</b> at different points in time. For example, the transition from signal level <b>232</b> to signal level <b>230</b> reaches the threshold voltage <b>240</b> at time <b>212</b>, the transition from signal level <b>234</b> to signal level <b>230</b> reaches the threshold voltage <b>240</b> at time <b>214</b>, and the transition from signal level <b>236</b> to signal level <b>230</b> reaches the threshold voltage <b>240</b> at time <b>216</b>. Since time <b>216</b> is the latest, the transition from signal level <b>236</b> to signal level <b>230</b> defines the leftmost boundary of eye <b>202</b>. The rightmost boundary of eye <b>202</b> is defined by the transition from signal level <b>230</b> to signal level <b>236</b> which crosses threshold voltage <b>240</b> at time <b>218</b>. Thus, the width of eye <b>202</b> spans from time <b>216</b> to time <b>218</b>. As can be seen, the width of eye <b>202</b> is considerably less than the symbol width (defined by the interval between time <b>210</b> and time <b>220</b>.)</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, when the edge enhancement techniques described herein are implemented, such as by slew rate control circuit <b>116</b>, the width of the eyes <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b> can be increased, as shown in eye diagram <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. For example, slew rate control circuit <b>116</b> can control at least one parameter of the signal transmitter circuit, such as an output impedance of the output driver <b>110</b> or an amount of current injected into the signal, to adjust the slew rate during the transition. Adjusting the slew rate during the transition can cause the signal to reach a threshold voltage, such as threshold voltage <b>240</b>, at a first time after the transition is initiated. In one embodiment, when edge enhancement is performed, regardless of which signal level the signal is transitioning from and which signal level the signal is transitioning to, the signal may reach the corresponding threshold voltage at the same point in time relative to when the corresponding transition was initiated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in eye diagram <b>250</b>, the signal transitions from signal levels <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b> to signal level <b>230</b> all reach the threshold voltage <b>240</b> at approximately the same point in time (i.e., time <b>262</b>).

This indicates that the slew rate for the transition from signal level <b>232</b> to signal level <b>230</b> was left unchanged, while the slew rate for the transition from signal level <b>234</b> to signal level <b>230</b>, and the slew rate for the transition from signal level <b>236</b> to signal level <b>230</b> were both increased. As a result, the width of eye <b>202</b> in eye diagram <b>250</b> spans from time <b>262</b> to time <b>264</b>.

In another embodiment, time <b>262</b> may occur after time <b>212</b>, such as between time <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>. This indicates that the slew rate for the transition from signal level <b>232</b> to signal level <b>230</b> was decreased, while the slew rate for the transition from signal level <b>234</b> to signal level <b>230</b>, and the slew rate for the transition from signal level <b>236</b> to signal level <b>230</b> were both increased. In other embodiments, time <b>262</b> may occur approximately equal to time <b>214</b>, or between times <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate transitions to signal level <b>230</b> from each of signal levels <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b>, it should be understood that transitions to any signal level from any other signal level are possible.

The signal transitions from signal levels <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> to signal level <b>230</b> both reach the threshold voltage <b>240</b> at approximately the same point in time (i.e., time <b>274</b>).
