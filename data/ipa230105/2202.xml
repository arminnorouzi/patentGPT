Configuration of Lift Carrier</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a configuration of a lift carrier <b>1</b> according to the embodiment. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lift carrier <b>1</b> is configured to transport a four-wheeled vehicle. The lift carrier <b>1</b> includes a traveling unit <b>10</b> and a carrier body <b>20</b> including a carrier frame <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The traveling unit <b>10</b> is connected to a front end portion of the carrier frame <b>21</b> and functions as a traveling device that tows and moves the carrier body <b>20</b>. That is, in the lift carrier <b>1</b>, the traveling unit <b>10</b> corresponds to a tractor unit, and the carrier body <b>20</b> corresponds to a trailer unit. The lift carrier <b>1</b> moves in the longitudinal direction of the carrier frame <b>21</b>. In the following description, the direction of movement of the lift carrier <b>1</b> (longitudinal direction of a vehicle) is defined as X direction, the lateral direction of the lift carrier <b>1</b> (lateral direction of the vehicle) is defined as Y direction, and the vertical direction of the lift carrier <b>1</b> is defined as Z direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The traveling unit <b>10</b> includes, for example, a drive device, a braking device, and a steering device. The drive device is, for example, an electric motor, and the electric motor drives front carrier wheels <b>12</b>. Two front carrier wheels <b>12</b> are arranged in the Y direction. The braking device applies braking force to the front carrier wheels <b>12</b>. The steering device controls the turning angle of the front carrier wheels <b>12</b>. The configuration for the traveling unit <b>10</b> to function as a traveling device is not particularly limited, and a known configuration is applied.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The traveling unit <b>10</b> includes a first lifting device <b>14</b> and has a function to lift and lowers the carrier frame <b>21</b>. The first lifting device <b>14</b> lifts and lowers the front end portion of the carrier frame <b>21</b>. More specifically, in the example of the lift carrier <b>1</b>, the carrier frame <b>21</b> is lifted and lowered by the first lifting device <b>14</b> and a second lifting device <b>70</b> (a pair of lifting units <b>72</b>) included in the carrier body <b>20</b>. The second lifting device <b>70</b> will be described later. The configuration of the first lifting device <b>14</b> is not particularly limited. The first lifting device <b>14</b> may use, for example, a hydraulic cylinder or an air pressure to lift or lower the carrier frame <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The traveling unit <b>10</b> further includes a power source and a control device that are not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The power source supplies power to various actuators included in the lift carrier <b>1</b>. The power source is, for example, a battery, and is electrically connected to each of the actuators by a wire harness.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control device outputs control signals for controlling the various actuators included in the lift carrier <b>1</b>. The actuators operate according to the control signals. For example, the control device is electrically connected to each of the actuators by a wire harness. The control device may be provided outside the lift carrier <b>1</b>. More specifically, the control device may be configured to transmit control signals to the actuators using wireless communication. The traveling unit <b>10</b> may be configured to move the carrier body <b>20</b> by remote control or autonomous traveling.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The carrier body <b>20</b> includes a first arm group <b>30</b> and a second arm group <b>50</b>. The lift carrier <b>1</b> inserts the carrier frame <b>21</b> under a vehicle <b>2</b> to be transported (hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as the &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d;) in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle <b>2</b> (X direction) (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> that will be described later). The lift carrier <b>1</b> then supports the vehicle <b>2</b> by holding front wheels <b>3</b> and rear wheels <b>4</b> of the vehicle using the first arm group <b>30</b> and the second arm group <b>50</b>, respectively. As an example, the lift carrier <b>1</b> inserts the carrier frame <b>21</b> from the front of the vehicle <b>2</b>. In this example, the first arm group <b>30</b> holds the front wheels <b>3</b> of the vehicle <b>2</b>, and the second arm group <b>50</b> holds the rear wheels <b>4</b> of the vehicle <b>2</b> to support the vehicle <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the lift carrier <b>1</b> can also support the vehicle <b>2</b> after inserting the carrier frame <b>21</b> from the rear of the vehicle <b>2</b>. The lift carrier <b>1</b> lifts the carrier frame <b>21</b> and moves with the vehicle <b>2</b> lifted from a road surface <b>5</b> to transport the vehicle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The operation of holding the front and rear wheels (four wheels) <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> of the vehicle <b>2</b> by the first arm group <b>30</b> and the second arm group <b>50</b> is implemented by first arm actuators <b>32</b> and second arm actuators <b>52</b>, respectively. The first arm group <b>30</b> includes fixed arms <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and movable arms <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. The fixed arm <b>34</b> and the movable arm <b>38</b> form a pair, and the fixed arm <b>36</b> and the movable arm <b>40</b> form a pair, each pair holding the front wheel <b>3</b> therebetween (more specifically, holding the front and rear of the tire tread). The fixed arms <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are fixed so as to project in the Y direction from the carrier frame <b>21</b>. Therefore, the front wheels <b>3</b> are held and released according to the movement of the movable arms <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. The movable arms <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> are moved by the first arm actuators <b>32</b>.
