num="0000">Disclosed herein is an adjustable shoring beam having a hook assembly configured to mate with E-track mating features. The adjustable shoring beam can be adjusted over a predetermined length range by adjusting the tube assembly and the rod assembly. In some embodiments, the extension length is fixed using a fixing clamp coupled to the tube assembly and the rod assembly. A connecting clamp and bracket may be used to couple a first adjustable shoring beam to a second adjustable shoring beam.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

This invention is intended to be used with E-track mating features such as those found on the vertical posts and decks of a movable platform described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,279,955, issued May 7, 2019, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety. The adjustable shoring beam may engage surfaces containing E-track mating features which are parallel and/or perpendicular to the length of the beam.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Adjustable shoring beams are used in securing freight in trailers or on loading platforms. Current adjustable shoring beams typically rely on a rudimentary locking system, if any, to maintain the adjustable shoring beam at a fixed length. These shoring beams can be difficult to adjust. Further, the use of the adjustable shoring beams is limited to horizontal use between mating features due to their design. Therefore, there exists a need for an adjustable shoring beam that can easily be adjusted and secured in a variety of configurations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed herein is an adjustable shoring beam configured to mate with E-track mating features. The adjustable shoring beam can be adjusted over a predetermined length range by adjusting the tube assembly and the rod assembly. In some embodiments, the extension length is fixed using a fixing clamp coupled to the tube assembly and the rod assembly. A connecting clamp and bracket may be used to couple a first adjustable shoring beam to a second adjustable shoring beam.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

<b>100</b>. Conventional shoring beams are common load-bearing freight securement devices that extend and retract with ends that lock into track systems, i.e. E-track and A-track. Adjustable shoring beam <b>100</b> is adjustable by sliding rod assembly <b>102</b> within tube assembly <b>104</b> to accommodate a range of usable lengths.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Rod assembly <b>102</b> and tube assembly <b>104</b> are depicted as having circular cross-section. However, it should be apparent that any cross-section can be utilized as long as rod assembly <b>102</b> can slide within tube assembly. Other possible compatible cross-section shapes include square, rectangular, oval, quadrilateral, round in square, oval in rectangle, etc.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Rod assembly <b>102</b> is coupled to a first hook assembly <b>106</b> and tube assembly <b>104</b> is coupled to a second hook assembly <b>108</b>. First hook assembly <b>106</b> and second hook assembly <b>108</b> are used to secure adjustable shoring beam <b>100</b> to a movable platform. Rod assembly <b>102</b>, first hook assembly <b>106</b>, tube assembly <b>104</b>, and second hook assembly <b>108</b> are all preferably formed from steel, such as ASTM A36 steel. However, it should be obvious that any industrial grade metal (or even strong plastic) can be used in their construction.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">First hook assembly <b>106</b> is preferably coupled to rod assembly <b>102</b> through welding. Similarly, second hook assembly <b>108</b> is preferably coupled to tube assembly <b>104</b> through welding. However, any connection method may be used in place of welding.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> depict tube assembly <b>104</b> in isolation without first hook assembly <b>106</b>.
