description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The embodiment relates to a fingerprint recognition module and an electronic device including the fingerprint recognition module.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A fingerprint recognition sensor is a sensor for detecting fingerprints of a human finger, and is recently widely used as a means for enhancing security in portable electronic devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. That is, by performing a user registration or security authentication procedure through the fingerprint recognition sensor, the data stored in the portable electronic device may be protected and a security incident may be prevented in advance. In general, the smartphone has a home key at a bottom front. The home key realizes various functions of the smartphone in a one-touch manner, thereby improving convenience of use. Meanwhile, the tablet computer has a home key on the bottom front of a main body, similar to the smartphone described above. In this way, on the smartphones and tablet computers, the home key allows the portable device to perform a set operation. For example, when using a portable electronic device, pressing or touching the home key provides a convenient function such as returning to an initial screen.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Meanwhile, a fingerprint recognition module has a structure in which a fingerprint recognition sensor and an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) are mounted on a substrate. However, such a fingerprint recognition module may not be directly connected to a main board. That is, a printed circuit board is required between the fingerprint recognition module and the main board.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electronic device having a display unit requires a plurality of printed circuit boards, and thus there is a problem that a thickness is increased. In addition, sizes of the plurality of printed circuit boards may be a limitation on miniaturization of the electronic device. Further, poor bonding of the plurality of printed circuit boards may deteriorate reliability of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the fingerprint recognition module performs a high-temperature bonding process at 250&#xb0; C. or higher for mounting the fingerprint recognition sensor on a substrate. However, the fingerprint recognition sensor as described above is a sensor containing a polymer compound, and thus has a characteristic vulnerable to high temperature. Accordingly, when bonding the fingerprint recognition sensor at a high temperature as described above, there is a problem in that the function of the sensor is lost due to thermal shock or parts change due to high temperature and misalignment of the bonding position occur.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, a fingerprint recognition module of a new structure that may solve such a problem is required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment provides a fingerprint recognition module including a flexible circuit board for chip on film that may be directly connected to a main board of an electronic device while a fingerprint recognition sensor and an ASIC are mounted on a single substrate, and an electronic device including the fingerprint recognition module.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the embodiment provides a fingerprint recognition module in which a low-temperature curing type anisotropic conductive adhesive is used to mount the fingerprint recognition sensor on a substrate, and thus the anisotropic conductive adhesive has a structure surrounding a side surface of the fingerprint recognition sensor, and an electronic device including the fingerprint recognition module.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is to be understood that the technical objectives to be achieved by the embodiments are not limited to the technical matters mentioned above and that other technical subjects not mentioned are apparent to those skilled in the art to which the embodiments proposed from the following description belong.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A fingerprint recognition module according to an embodiment includes a substrate;

However, unlike a silicon-based chip having stable characteristics even at high temperatures, the eutectic bonding method of 250&#xb0; C. or higher cannot be used in order to bond a sensor containing an unstable polymer compound at a high temperature. This is because sensors containing polymer compounds have thermal deformation or functional problems at high temperatures.

When the wiring pattern layer includes copper (Cu), the wiring pattern layer may not be directly bonded to the first chip C<b>1</b>, and a separate bonding process may be required. On the other hand, when the plating layer disposed on the wiring pattern layer is formed in a single layer, the copper (Cu) of the wiring pattern layer is diffused to the plating layer in a plating process, thereby causing a defect upon bonding with a chip. Since a plating layer of two layers is further formed on the plating layer of one layer, an amount of copper (Cu) on a surface bonded to a chip is none or reduced, thereby facilitating chip bonding.

At this time, when the distance between the first chip C<b>1</b> and the second chip C<b>2</b> is too narrow, widths of the first and second non-bending regions may be narrowed. In this case, when the substrate is bent, damage may be applied to the mounted first chip C<b>1</b> or the second chip C<b>2</b>, and thus cracks of the bonding portion may occur. Therefore, the distance between the first chip C<b>1</b> and the second chip C<b>2</b> should have a minimum distance so that the cracks may not occur. At this time, after bending, a distance W<b>3</b> between the first chip C<b>1</b> and a bent end should be at least 1.6 mm to prevent the occurrence of the cracks.

However, when the distance between the second chip and the third chip C<b>3</b> is too close, a reliability problem may occur in a mounting process between the second chip C<b>2</b> and the third chip C<b>3</b>. That is, in general, after the second chip C<b>2</b> is mounted, the mounting process of the third chip C<b>3</b> is performed. At this time, when the distance between the second chip C<b>2</b> and the third chip C<b>3</b> is too close, during bonding the third chip C<b>3</b>, a phenomenon in which the second connection portion <b>160</b> that has been bonded melts occurs, and accordingly, a problem that the position of the second chip C<b>2</b> is displaced occurs. Therefore, the distance W<b>2</b> between the second chip C<b>2</b> and the third chip C<b>3</b> is set to be at least 1.0 mm so that the problem that may occur may be solved. In addition, when the distance W<b>2</b> between the second chip C<b>2</b> and the third chip C<b>3</b> exceeds 5 mm, a loss in the signal between the second chip C<b>2</b> and the third chip C<b>3</b> may occur.
