The government has certain rights in the invention.</p><?federal-research-statement description="Federal Research Statement" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Imide molecules, such as thalidomide and its analogs, bind to Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate adaptor for the ubiquitously expressed cullin ring ligase 4 (CUL4)-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CUL4CRBN) E3 ligase (Kronke et al., Science 343:301-305 (2014); Ito et al., Science 327:1345-1350 (2010)). This results in the recruitment, ubiquitination, and the subsequent proteasomal degradation of neo-substrates, namely Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), but not any other members of the IKZF zinc finger transcription factor family. CC-885, an imide analog, is predicted to have some activity in inducing Helios degradation, but also induces degradation of GSPT1, a key translation termination factor (Matyskiela et al., Nature 535:252-257 (2016)).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Helios (IKZF2), a member of the IKZF family, is a critical regulator of T cell activity and function. Genetic deletion of Helios resulted in an enhanced anti-tumor immune response (Kim et al., Science 350:334-339 (2015)). Notably, Helios is highly expressed in regulatory T cells (Elkord et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 12:1423-1425 (2012)), a subpopulation of T cells that restricts the activity of effector T cells. Selective deletion of Helios in regulatory T cells resulted in both loss of suppressive activity and acquisition of effector T cell functions (Najagawa et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 113:6248-6253 (2016); Yates et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 115:2162-2167 (2018)). Therefore, Helios is a critical factor in restricting T cell effector function in Tregs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Helios expression has also been reported to be upregulated in &#x2018;exhausted&#x2019; T cells, in the settings of both chronic viral infections (Crawford et al., Immunity 40:289-302 (2014), Doering et al., Immunity 371130-1144 (2012); Scott-Browne et al., Immunity 45:1327-1340 (2016)) and tumors (Martinez et al., Immunity 42:265-278 (2015); Mognol et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 114:E2776-E2785 (2017); Pereira et al., J. Leukoc. Biol. 102:601-615 (2017); Singer et al., Cell 166:1500-1511 (2016); Schietinger et al., Immunity 45:389-401 (2016)), as well as in dysfunctional chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (Long et al., Nat. Med. 21:581-590 (2015)) 16). Overexpression or aberrant expression of Helios and various splice isoforms have been reported in several hematological malignancies, including T cell leukemias and lymphomas (Nakase at al., Exp. Hematol. 30:313-317 (2002); Tabayashi et al., Cancer Sci. 98:182-188 (2007); Asanuma et al., Cancer Sci. 104:1097-1106 (2013)). Moreover, knockdown of Helios in a model of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-driven myeloid leukemia potently suppressed proliferation and increased cell death (Park et al., J. Clin. Invest. 125:1286-1298 (2015); Park et al., Cell Stem Cell 24:153-165 (2019)).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a compound having a structure represented by formula (I):</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="39.37mm" wi="73.74mm" file="US20230002397A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">wherein R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>&#x2032;, R<sub>5</sub>, R<sub>5</sub>&#x2032;, R<sub>6</sub>, and n<sub>1 </sub>are as defined herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">A second aspect of the present invention is directed to a compound having a structure represented by formula (II):</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="27.86mm" wi="62.31mm" file="US20230002397A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0012" num="0000">wherein L and R<sub>2 </sub>are as defined herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0008">Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition that includes a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; in the context of a salt refers to a salt of the compound that does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively non-toxic, i.e., the compound in salt form may be administered to a subject without causing undesirable biological effects (such as dizziness or gastric upset) or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable salt&#x201d; refers to a product obtained by reaction of the compound of the present invention with a suitable acid or a base. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic bases such as Li, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Al, Zn and Mn salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, 4-methylbenzenesulfonate or p-toluenesulfonate salts and the like. Certain compounds of the invention can form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various organic bases such as lysine, arginine, guanidine, diethanolamine or metformin. Suitable base salts include aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, or zinc salts.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0085">Compounds of the present invention may have at least one chiral center and therefore may be in the form of a stereoisomer, which as used herein, embraces all isomers of individual compounds that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. The term stereoisomer includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers which include the (R-) or (S-) configurations of the compounds), mixtures of mirror image isomers (physical mixtures of the enantiomers, and racemates or racemic mixtures) of compounds, geometric (cis/trans or E/Z, R/S) isomers of compounds and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another (diastereoisomers). The chiral centers of the compounds may undergo epimerization in vivo; therefore, for these compounds, administration of the compound in its (R-) form is considered equivalent to administration of the compound in its (S-) form. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention may be made and used in the form of individual isomers and substantially free of other isomers, or in the form of a mixture of various isomers, e.g., racemic mixtures of stereoisomers.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0086">In some embodiments, the compound is an isotopic derivative in that it has at least one desired isotopic substitution of an atom, at an amount above the natural abundance of the isotope, i.e., enriched. In one embodiment, the compound includes deuterium or multiple deuterium atoms. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. <sup>2</sup>H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and therefore may be advantageous in some circumstances.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0087">Compounds of formulas (I) and (II) may also be in the form of N-oxides, crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), active metabolites of the compounds having the same type of activity, prodrugs, tautomers, and unsolvated as well as solvated (e.g., hydrated) forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, of the compounds.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0088">The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by crystallization under different conditions and may exist as one or a combination of polymorphs of the compound. For example, different polymorphs may be identified and/or prepared using different solvents, or different mixtures of solvents for recrystallization, by performing crystallizations at different temperatures, or by using various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallizations. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffractogram and/or other known techniques.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0089">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a co-crystal of an inventive compound. The term &#x201c;co-crystal&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a stoichiometric multi-component system comprising a compound of the invention and a co-crystal former wherein the compound of the invention and the co-crystal former are connected by non-covalent interactions. The term &#x201c;co-crystal former&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to compounds which can form intermolecular interactions with a compound of the invention and co-crystallize with it. Representative examples of co-cyrstal formers include benzoic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, glutaric acid, trans-cinnamic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, glycolic acid, trans-2-hexanoic acid, 2-hydroxycaproic acid, lactic acid, sorbic acid, tartaric acid, ferulic acid, suberic acid, picolinic acid, salicyclic acid, maleic acid, saccharin, 4,4&#x2032;-bipyridine p-aminosalicyclic acid, nicotinamide, urea, isonicotinamide, methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, adipic acid, terephthalic acid, resorcinol, pyrogallol, phloroglucinol, hydroxyquinol, isoniazid, theophylline, adenine, theobromine, phenacetin, phenazone, etofylline, and phenobarbital.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Methods of Synthesis</heading><p id="p-0128" num="0090">In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for making an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof. Broadly, the inventive compounds or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically related compounds. The compounds of the present invention will be better understood in connection with the synthetic schemes that described in various working examples and which illustrate non-limiting methods by which the compounds of the invention may be prepared.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Pharmaceutical Compositions</heading><p id="p-0129" num="0091">Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition that includes a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,&#x201d; as known in the art, refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, suitable for administering compounds of the present invention to mammals. Suitable carriers may include, for example, liquids (both aqueous and non-aqueous alike, and combinations thereof), solids, encapsulating materials, gases, and combinations thereof (e.g., semi-solids), and gases, that function to carry or transport the compound from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. A carrier is &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; in the sense of being physiologically inert to and compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the subject or patient. Depending on the type of formulation, the composition may also include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0092">Broadly, compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, prodrugs, stereoisomers, or tautomers may be formulated into a given type of composition in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice such as conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping and compression processes (see, e.g., Remington: <i>The Science and Practice of Pharmacy </i>(20th ed.), ed. A. R. Gennaro, Lippincott Williams &#x26; Wilkins, 2000 and <i>Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology</i>, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York). The type of formulation depends on the mode of administration which may include enteral (e.g., oral, buccal, sublingual and rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.), and intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques, intra-ocular, intra-arterial, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, interdermal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, mucosal, nasal, intratracheal instillation, bronchial instillation, and inhalation) and topical (e.g., transdermal). In general, the most appropriate route of administration will depend upon a variety of factors including, for example, the nature of the agent (e.g., its stability in the environment of the gastrointestinal tract), and/or the condition of the subject (e.g., whether the subject is able to tolerate oral administration). For example, parenteral (e.g., intravenous) administration may also be advantageous in that the compound may be administered relatively quickly such as in the case of a single-dose treatment and/or an acute condition.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0093">In some embodiments, the compounds are formulated for oral or intravenous administration (e.g., systemic intravenous injection).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0094">Accordingly, compounds of the invention may be formulated into solid compositions (e.g., powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories), liquid compositions (e.g., solutions in which the compound is dissolved, suspensions in which solid particles of the compound are dispersed, emulsions, and solutions containing liposomes, micelles, or nanoparticles, syrups and elixirs); semi-solid compositions (e.g., gels, suspensions and creams); and gases (e.g., propellants for aerosol compositions). Compounds may also be formulated for rapid, intermediate or extended release.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0095">Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with a carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and an additional carrier or excipient such as a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as crosslinked polymers (e.g., crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone (crospovidone), crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (croscarmellose sodium), sodium starch glycolate, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also include buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings. They may further contain an opacifying agent.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0096">In some embodiments, compounds of the invention may be formulated in a hard or soft gelatin capsule.

Gelatin shells may include gelatin, titanium dioxide, iron oxides and colorants.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0097">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include solutions, suspensions, emulsions, micro-emulsions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the compound, the liquid dosage forms may contain an aqueous or non-aqueous carrier (depending upon the solubility of the compounds) commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Oral compositions may also include an excipients such as wetting agents, suspending agents, coloring, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0098">Injectable preparations for parenteral administration may include sterile aqueous solutions or oleaginous suspensions. They may be formulated according to standard techniques using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. The effect of the compound may be prolonged by slowing its absorption, which may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension or crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. Prolonged absorption of the compound from a parenterally administered formulation may also be accomplished by suspending the compound in an oily vehicle.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0099">In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention may be administered in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the conjugate directly into an organ, often in a depot preparation or sustained release formulation. In specific embodiments, long acting formulations are administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactide-polyglycolides, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). The rate of release of the compound may be controlled by varying the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. Furthermore, in other embodiments, the compound is delivered in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with organ-specific antibody. In such embodiments, the liposomes are targeted to and taken up selectively by the organ.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0100">The compositions may be formulated for buccal or sublingual administration, examples of which include tablets, lozenges and gels.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0101">The compounds of the invention may be formulated for administration by inhalation.

Pharmaceutical compositions may be delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In some embodiments, the dosage unit of a pressurized aerosol may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. In some embodiments, capsules and cartridges including gelatin, for example, for use in an inhaler or insufflator, may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0102">Compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration which as used herein, refers to administration intradermally by invention of the formulation to the epidermis. These types of compositions are typically in the form of ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions and sprays.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0103">Representative examples of carriers useful in formulating compounds for topical application include solvents (e.g., alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils, plasters, liposomes, powders, emulsions, microemulsions, and buffered solutions (e.g., hypotonic or buffered saline). Creams, for example, may be formulated using saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, palmito-oleic acid, cetyl, or oleyl alcohols. Creams may also contain a non-ionic surfactant such as polyoxy-40-stearate.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0104">In some embodiments, the topical formulations may also include an excipient, an example of which is a penetration enhancing agent. These agents are capable of transporting a pharmacologically active compound through the stratum corneum and into the epidermis or dermis, preferably, with little or no systemic absorption. A wide variety of compounds have been evaluated as to their effectiveness in enhancing the rate of penetration of drugs through the skin. See, for example, <i>Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers</i>, Maibach H. I. and Smith H. E. (eds.), CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. (1995), which surveys the use and testing of various skin penetration enhancers, and Buyuktimkin et al., <i>Chemical Means of Transdermal Drug Permeation Enhancement in Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems</i>, Gosh T. K., Pfister W. R., Yum S. I. (Eds.), Interpharm Press Inc., Buffalo Grove, Ill. (1997).

Suitable solubilizing agents include quaternary ammonium chlorides, cyclodextrins, benzyl benzoate, lecithin, and polysorbates. Suitable skin protectants include vitamin E oil, allatoin, dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0106">Transdermal formulations typically employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches wherein the compound is formulated in lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Transdermal delivery of the compounds may be accomplished by means of an iontophoretic patch. Transdermal patches may provide controlled delivery of the compounds wherein the rate of absorption is slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Absorption enhancers may be used to increase absorption, examples of which include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents that assist passage through the skin.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0107">Ophthalmic formulations include eye drops.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0108">Formulations for rectal administration include enemas, rectal gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, and retention enemas, which may contain conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration may also be formulated as suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compound with suitable non-irritating carriers and excipients such as cocoa butter, mixtures of fatty acid glycerides, polyethylene glycol, suppository waxes, and combinations thereof, all of which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the compound.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Dosage Amounts</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0109">As used herein, the term, &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount of an inventive compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof that is effective in producing the desired therapeutic response in a patient suffering from a disease or disorder involving IKZF2 (Helios) and would benefit from IKZF2 degradation.

Individual dosages may be formulated to contain the desired dosage amount depending upon the number of times the compound is administered per day. By way of example, capsules may be formulated with from about 1 to about 200 mg of compound (e.g., 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg). In some embodiments, the compound may be administered at a dose in range from about 0.01 mg to about 200 mg/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, a dose of from 0.1 to 100, e.g., from 1 to 30 mg/kg per day in one or more dosages per day may be effective. By way of example, a suitable dose for oral administration may be in the range of 1-30 mg/kg of body weight per day, and a suitable dose for intravenous administration may be in the range of 1-10 mg/kg of body weight per day.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Methods of Use</heading><p id="p-0150" num="0112">In some aspects, the present invention is directed to methods of treating diseases or disorders involving IKZF2, that entails administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and/or (II), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, prodrug, stereoisomer, or tautomer thereof, to a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0113">Broadly, the diseases or disorders that may be amenable to treatment with compounds of the present invention involve IKZF2 or otherwise functionally abnormal IKZF2 activity relative to a non-pathological state. A &#x201c;disease&#x201d; is generally regarded as a state of health of a subject wherein the subject cannot maintain homeostasis, and wherein if the disease is not ameliorated then the subject's health continues to deteriorate. In contrast, a &#x201c;disorder&#x201d; in a subject is a state of health in which the subject is able to maintain homeostasis, but in which the subject's state of health is less favorable than it would be in the absence of the disorder. Left untreated, a disorder does not necessarily cause a further decrease in the subject's state of health. In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) and (II) may be useful in the treatment of cell proliferative diseases and disorders (e.g., cancer or benign neoplasms). As used herein, the term &#x201c;cell proliferative disease or disorder&#x201d; refers to the conditions characterized by deregulated or abnormal cell growth, or both, including noncancerous conditions such as neoplasms, precancerous conditions, benign tumors, and cancer.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0114">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; (or &#x201c;patient&#x201d;) as used herein includes all members of the animal kingdom prone to or suffering from the indicated disease or disorder.

num="0212">IKZF1, IKZF2, GSPT1 were sub-cloned into mammalian pcDNAS/FRT Vector (Ampicillin and Hygromycin B resistant) modified to contain MCS-eGFP-P2A-mCherry. Stable cell lines expressing eGFP-protein fusion and mCherry reporter were generated using Flip-In 293 system. Plasmid (0.3 &#x3bc;g) and pOG44 (4.7 &#x3bc;g) DNA were preincubated in 100 &#x3bc;L of Opti-MEM I (Gibco&#xae;, Life Technologies&#x2122;) media containing 0.05 mg/mL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen&#x2122;) for 20 min and added to Flip-In 293 cells containing 1.9 mL of DMEM media (Gibco&#xae;, Life Technologies&#x2122;) per well in a 6-well plate format (Falcon&#xae;, 353046). Cells were propagated after 48 h and transferred into a 10 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>plate (Corning, 430165) in DMEM media containing 50 &#x3bc;g/mL of Hygromycin B (REF 10687010, Invitrogen&#x2122;) as a selection marker. Following 2-3 passages, cycle FACS (FACSAria&#x2122; 11, BD) was used to enrich for cells expressing eGFP and mCherry.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0213">Cells stably expressing the IKZF1, IKZF2 or GSPT1 GFP fusions with mCherry reporter were seeded at 30-50% confluency in 384-well plates with 50 &#x3bc;L FluoroBrite&#x2122; DMEM media (Thermo Fisher Scientific A18967) containing 10% FBS per well a day before compound treatment. Compound titrations were dispensed using a D300e Digital Dispenser&#xae; (HP), normalized to 0.5% DMSO, and incubated with cells for 5 hours.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0214">The assay plate was imaged immediately using an Acumen&#xae; High Content Imager (TTP Labtech) with 488 nm and 561 nm lasers in 2 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;1 &#x3bc;m grid per well format. The resulting images were analyzed using CellProfiler&#x2122;. A series of image analysis steps (&#x2018;image analysis pipeline&#x2019;) was constructed. First, the red and green channels were aligned and cropped to target the middle of each well (to avoid analysis of heavily clumped cells at the edges). A background illumination function was calculated for both red and green channels of each well individually and subtracted to correct for illumination variations across the 384-well plate from various sources of error. An additional step was then applied to the green channel to suppress the analysis of large auto fluorescent artifacts and enhance the analysis of cell specific fluorescence by way of selecting for objects under a given size, 30 A.U., and with a given speckle shape. mCherry-positive cells were then identified in the red channel filtering for objects between 8-60 pixels in diameter and using intensity to distinguish between clumped objects. The green channel was then segmented into GFP positive and negative areas and objects were labeled as GFP positive if at least 40% of it overlapped with a GFP positive area. The fraction of GFP-positive cells/mCherry-positive cells in each well was then calculated, and the green and red images were rescaled for visualization. The concentrations that lead to half degradation at 5 h (DC<sub>50</sub>, 5 h) were calculated using the nonlinear fit variable slope model (GraphPad Software).</p><p id="p-0254" num="0215">The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>.

The resulting HiBiT-Helios stable cell line was treated with the following compounds in triplicates following a 13-point concentration scheme ranging from 10 &#x3bc;M to 0.00026 &#x3bc;M. At the indicated timepoints, the Nano-Glo&#xae; HiBiT Lytic Detection System (Promega&#x2122;) was utilized for detecting bioluminescence of the HiBiT tag in treated cells: abundance of the tag is proportionate to the level of luminescence. Following normalization to DMSO, dose-response curves were plotted (GraphPad Prism) to determine the concentration points at which 50% of HiBiT-Helios degradation was achieved by each compound. The extent of degradation (range of luminescence) from the highest to lowest concentration points was calculated to determine the D<sub>max</sub>.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0000"><tables
