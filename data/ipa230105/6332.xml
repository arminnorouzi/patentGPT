level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of antenna technologies, and in particular, to an antenna apparatus applied to an electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A multiple-input multiple-output (multi-input multi-output, MIMO) technology plays a very important role in a 5th generation (5th generation, 5G) wireless communications system. However, it is still a big challenge that an electronic device, for example, a mobile phone, obtains good MIMO performance. One reason is that the very limited space inside the electronic device limits a frequency band that can be covered by a MIMO antenna and high performance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, with development of the mobile internet, there are more user use scenes of the electronic device, for example, a call scene, a landscape/portrait game scene, a landscape video and audio scene, and a portrait internet surfing scene. In different user use scenes, a posture in which a user grips the electronic device, for example, the mobile phone changes. It is also an important problem of equalizing antenna performance in cases of a left hand grip and a right hand grip in different user use scenes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention provide an antenna apparatus, to implement a wideband antenna design in which two resonant modes of a slot antenna are both a common mode. There is a same radiation pattern, performance in a case of a left hand grip and performance in a case of a right hand grip are equivalent, and SAR values in the two modes are close.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an electronic device. The electronic device includes a PCB, a metal frame, and an antenna apparatus. The antenna apparatus may include a slot, a first feeding point, a second feeding point, and a bridge structure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The slot may be disposed between the PCB and a first section of the metal frame. Two ends of the slot may be grounded. The slot may include a first side edge and a second side edge, the first side edge may consist of one side edge of the PCB, and the second side edge may consist of the first section of the metal frame.
