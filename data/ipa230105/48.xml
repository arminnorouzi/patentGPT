Additionally, the harvesting process typically includes shaking or dumping out the cardboard or plastic boxes and manually collecting or picking out the live insects. This is a time consuming and labor intensive activity that is further subject to human error and may result in substantial economic loss and wastage.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The detailed description is set forth with reference to the accompanying figures.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Described herein are implementations and techniques for providing an automated systems for sorting, incubating, and harvesting insects. For example, the system may include apparatuses to separate live insects from dead insects or other waste. In other examples, the system may include apparatuses for counting and isolating eggs or insect larva for placement in growing or cultivating habitats. In still other examples, the system may include apparatuses for separating the insects into parts for further processing such as the production of flour, chitin, or various vitamins or minerals.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In general, the systems are designed to improve the efficiency of raising and harvesting live insects, such as crickets, grasshoppers, mealworms, and other insects that have a flightless stage, and to minimize the insect's exposure to human interaction or contact in addition to reducing exposure to invasive pathogens. In some implementations, the apparatuses may be configured to separate the egg or larvae insects from the medium in which the eggs or larvae are incubated in. Separation of the eggs from the medium is also useful for accurate measurement of eggs and tracking of population die off during cultivation. In some cases, a die off rate above a threshold may indicate a contaminated habitat that may need to be discarded or destroyed rather than harvested. The apparatus may also be configured to select or group eggs based on a desired population of adult insects within a habitat, in addition to reducing inbreeding depression for the purpose of improving multi-generational fitness. Overpopulating a habitat results in too many adult insects and leads to massive losses of product as the insects die off until a stable population is achieved.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A sieve apparatus may be utilized to separate the eggs or larvae from the medium in which the eggs are incubated. For instance, the medium may be a fine grain sand that may pass through openings that are too small for the eggs. Thus, a sieve including a screen or mesh may be provided to first separate the medium from the eggs. The eggs may then be collected from the screen. For instance, the screen or mesh portion of the sieve may retract or tilt to cause the eggs to roll or fall into a collection bin or container located separate from the bin or container used to collect the medium. In one particular case, the mesh or screen is a conveyor belt which may move the eggs into a collection container or to a second apparatus for sorting.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another example, the medium may include a dissolvable foam. In this example, the eggs may be injected into the foam and incubated. When the eggs are ready to hatch, the eggs may be moved to a separating apparatus. In some cases, the separating apparatus may include a multi-chambered stack. The egg-filled foam may be moved over the multi-chambered stack via, for example, a conveyor belt and a first retractable panel may be opened to allow the egg-filled foam to fall into a first chamber of the multi-chambered stack. The first chamber may be filled with a solvent that is safe for the eggs, such as water, other liquids, a gas, or a gaseous mixture, among others. In other instances, the first chamber may be equipped with light sources tuned to produce a specific wavelengths of light that will cause the foam to dissolve. In yet other instances, the first chamber may be configured to vibrate or apply mechanical motion to the foam in a way to break up or dissolve the foam. The first chamber may then be drained leaving the eggs behind.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Once the foam is removed, a second retractable panel may be opened to allow the eggs to fall into a second chamber of the multi-chambered stack. The second chamber may include a scale or weighing device to allow the eggs to be counted prior to separation and placement in habitats. Alternatively, the second chamber may be a collection area in which the eggs may be stored prior to counting, separation, and placement in habitats. In one example, the second chamber may include a retractable floor or other type of opening. The opening may be connected to a tube or cone having a gradually reducing size. Sensors may be placed within the tube to count the eggs as the eggs slide past. The end of the tube may include multiple storage compartments. Each of the storage compartments may receive a desired number of eggs based on a size of a habitat allocated to cultivate the adult insects. Once full, the storage compartment may be closed and the next compartment may be filled.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one specific example, the storage compartments may be removable and a mechanical arm or other conveyor may move each of the storage compartments into a habitat, release or open the storage compartment, and deposit the eggs into a second medium within the habitat where the eggs will ultimately hatch and the adult insects will be cultivated.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some implementations, rather than counting and separating eggs from the medium in which the eggs are laid, the egg laying process may be controlled to result in a particular egg to medium density or an egg to adult habitat ratio. For example, a breeding enclosure may be equipped with environmental controls and or sensors. For example, the environmental controls may be used to stimulate or sedate the breeding insects to increase or decrease the number of eggs being laid within the breeding enclosure. In one example, the density of eggs laid per unit of volume of breeding insects (or egg laying females) given particular environmental settings (e.g., temperature, moisture, humidity, wind, light, etc.) may be known. Thus, the environmental controls within the breeding enclosure may be set to encourage a particular egg density.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sensors may include image sensors, thermal sensors, weight sensors, etc. that may track groups of insects or individual insects. For instance, a thermal sensor may be utilized to distinguish egg bearing females from other insects and the image sensors may be used to track or identify each egg laying event, such that a number of egg bearing females or eggs may be determined within the breeding enclosure. Alternatively, the image data may be used to distinguish male from female insects (e.g., based on features such as size, color, movement pattern, activity, etc.), determine female egg laying viability (e.g., based on size and other distinguishable features) track the female insects, and identify egg laying events. The environmental controls may then activate based upon an analysis of the sensor data to control the number of eggs laid within the breeding enclosure. Once a desired amount of eggs are achieved the breeding insects and/or the egg laying medium may be removed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another example, an amount of medium having a known weight may be placed in a breeding enclosure for a period of time. In some cases, the period of time may be selected to achieve a desired egg density (for example, using the environmental controls and sensor data described above). The egg bearing medium may then be removed and weighed. Using an average weight per egg and the known weight of the medium, the number of eggs may be determined. The medium may be divided and placed into individual habitats to achieve a desired adult insect population. In some cases, medium from multiple breeding enclosures may be combined and mixed to achieve an approximate medium to egg density ratio. The mixed medium is then divided and placed into the habitats in amounts selected to achieve the desired adult insect populations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some instances, rather than sorting eggs and/or egg bearing medium into the adult habitats, newly hatched insects may be herded, counted, separated, and placed in the habitats. In this manner, the number of live insects per habitat is more easily achieved as a number of the eggs typically fail to hatch or do not produce viable offspring. Thus, by introducing live insects into the habitats the desired population may be more accurately achieved. Unfortunately, the newly hatched insects are easily crushed when handled. Thus, some implementations described herein include apparatus for herding the newly hatched insects into adult habitats. For instance, in one example, egg bearing media or boxes filled with the egg bearing medium may be placed within a separation enclosure. The separation enclosure may include an opening connected to a funnel or cone having a gradually reducing size.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As the newly hatched insects move around the separation enclosure, each viable newly hatched insects eventually enters the opening and is processed via the funnel. Thus, the viable newly hatched insects separate themselves from the non-viable newly hatched insects. Sensors may be placed within the funnel to count the newly hatched insects as the newly hatched insects move past. The end of the funnel may include multiple storage compartments. Each of the storage compartments may receive a desired number of newly hatched insects based on a size of a habitat allocated to cultivate the adult insects. Once full, the storage compartment may be closed and the next compartment may be filled. In one specific example, the storage compartments may be removable and a mechanical arm or other conveyor may move each of the storage compartments into a habitat and release or open the storage compartment to deposit the newly hatched insects into the habit.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another examples, the egg bearing medium may be placed in a separation enclosure. The separation enclosure may include an air source, such as a vent, fan, propeller, or jet to apply directional air flow over the egg bearing medium. The air flow may cause newly hatched insects to be pushed, moved, or herded into a collection chute or funnel, as discussed above. In some cases, the air flow may blow the newly hatched insects that escape the medium (e.g., the newly hatched insects with enough viability to burrow out of the medium) down the chute for collection, counting, and separation.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another implementation, the insects are separated from waste product. In some cases, the insects may be raised on a habitat insert that is removed from the habitat and may be shaken over an empty collection bin to dislodge the insects from the insert. In this manner, the waste remains in the habitat and the live insects are deposited into the collection bins for further processing. In general, the habitat inserts may include a grid or matrix of vertical walls that provide living space for the insects and increase the overall surface area of the habitat, thereby, increasing the overall population density of the habitat. In other cases, the inserts may include horizontal walls, sloping walls or angular walls depending on the type and developmental level of the insects. In some cases, the inserts may also include perforations to allow the insects to move between sections of the habitat.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one example, when the habitats are ready to be harvested, the habitat may be moved or placed upon a conveyor (such as a belt or track) which may move the habitats past a robotic arm. The robotic arm may be configured to attach or secure to the habitat insert, remove the insert from the habitat, position the insert over a collection bin, and vibrate or actuate the insert to cause the insects to dislodge from the insert and deposit the insects within the collection bin. During the period at which the robotic arm is collecting the insects within the collection bin, the conveyor may cause the habitat to flip over or upside-down to cause the remaining waste within the habitat to be dumped or removed. In some cases, the conveyor may vibrate or actuate to cause the habitats to vibrate and further assist with the waste removal. The habitats may then be moved to a wash station which may remove any remaining waste prior to having an insert placed back within the habit. The habitat may be moved to a position within the system at which the newly hatched insects or eggs may then be placed and a new population of insects cultivated within.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another example, the inserts may be configured to attach or secure to the habitat (such that the inserts may be removed for cleaning or remain within the habitat when the habitat is flipped over). In this example, rather than utilizing a robotic arm to remove the insert and place the insects into a collection bin, a vacuum may be configured to run either the width or length (it can also be smaller and moved similar to a computer numerical control (CNC) mill) of the habitat. The habitat, including the insert, may be passed under the vacuum (or alternatively, the vacuum is moved over a stationary habitat). The vacuum may be configured to suction out the insects located on the walls of the habitat as the habitat moves under the vacuum. The suction level of the vacuum may be configured based on a depth of the habitat such that material within the bottom 1%, 5%, 10% or 15% remains in the habitat while material within the top portion of the habitat is removed. Thus, the waste deposited at the bottom of the habitat while the insects grow within the habitat remains within the habitat and the insects located on the walls of the inserts are removed. The vacuum system may include a tube connected to one or more collection bins for depositing the insects within the collection bins for further processing. Additionally, the insects have a lower density than the waste product the insects create and, thus, are removed from the habitat via a lower suction level than the waste product.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one specific example, the vacuum or the habitats may include a sensor system that allows the system to determine the level of waste within the habitat and to adjust the suction of the vacuum to substantially optimize the removal of live insects while preventing waste from being deposited into the collection bins. In some cases, the vacuum may be sized to seal with the habitat. The vacuum system may be configured with a gas applicator to inject a gas (such as carbon dioxide CO2 or freezing air) into the sealed habitats to kill the insects prior to removing via the vacuum. In some cases, the vacuum may make several passes with respect to the habitat to ensure that substantially all of the live insects are removed. For example, the vacuum and/or the habitat may include a motion sensor (or an image sensor, thermal sensor, other imaging device, or other sensor) able to detect the movement of the insects. The vacuum may make additional passes with respect to the habitat until a level of motion determined based on the data collected by the motion sensor indicates the motion is below a motion threshold.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another example, because only insects alive at the time of harvesting are desirable for some uses (such as using the insects for human consumption). In these uses, various compounds may be added into the insect foods. For instance, the food may include fluoresce additives or dyes to improve the ability to track the movement of the live insects within the habit, ferrous material such that a magnet may be used to remove the insects in lieu of the vacuum.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some specific examples, the habitat inserts may be configured to provide an electric charge which attracts and holds the insects to the insert walls prior to removal by the robotic arm or vacuum system. In another example, the walls of the inserts may be configured to release a chemical compound to attract the insects to the walls or a chemical additive that causes the insects to stick or adhere to the walls during a period of time prior to and during removal of the inserts. For instance, the walls of the inserts may include pores that allow chemicals stored or injected into the walls to seep out during the removal process.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some implementations, rather than removing insects from the habitat the insects may be encouraged or herded into the collection bins. For example, the contents of the habitat may be dumped or deposited onto a mesh or screen that allows some material to pass but retains the live insects. The mesh or screen may be surrounded by or adjacent to a collection area, tube, or funnel that the live insects eventually move into. The live insects may then be transferred to the collection bin (e.g., by sliding down the tube having a low friction wall). After a period of time following the placement of the contents on to the mesh or screen, the screen may open and the remaining material may be deposited with the other waste. Thus, at least a portion of the live insects migrate into the collection tubes.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some examples, an agitator, such as light, air, temperature, gas or sound, may be introduced via an environmental stimulus device to the insects to cause the insects to move in a particular direction away from the environmental stimulus device towards the collection area. For example, a strobe light may be utilized to cause the insects to move in the opposite direction from the source. In some cases, the screen or floor the insects are placed on may vibrate in sections or irritate the insects to cause them to move toward the collection area. In another example, an attractor, such as pheromones or food, may be introduced via an attractor device at a location to cause the insects to move toward the attractor device and the collection area.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Once the insects are collected within bins, the insects may be placed into various harvesting apparatus to remove or separate, for example, the chitin, appendages, or exoskeleton from the remainder of the insects, such that the chitin, appendages, or exoskeleton may be processed to produce various supplements, such as B12, iron, calcium, omega-6, amino acids, tryptophan, combinations thereof, or others. The remainder of the insect (e.g., the abdomens) may then be processed to produce a flour that may be used for cooking.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one implementation, a tumbler may be associated with one or more of the collection bins or the collection tubes/areas as described above. For example, a majority of the chitin is present in the limbs and head of the insects. Thus the tumbler may include an inner section with corrugated exterior portions (the size of the corrugation to allow the limbs portion to pass but not the bodies). The inner section may be configured to spin and as the insects spin the limbs and heads to become detached from the abdomens. The limbs may fall through the corrugation on the exterior portion. Thus, the tumbler may utilize a combination of gravity and centrifugal force to separate the limbs and heads of the insects from the abdomens of the insects. The limbs may then be removed from the tumbler. After tumbling, the remaining abdomens and heads may be released from the inner section into a powdering section. The powdering section may include an environmental stimulus that powderizes the abdomens as the tumbler spins. As the abdomens are softer than the heads, the heads remain intake during the powderization. The bottom of the tumbler may then open to a screen or mesh to allow the powder to be removed from the tumbler leaving behind the heads. The screen may then release to collect the heads. In this manner, the limbs, heads, and abdomens may be separated and processed into different components.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another implementation, a vibration plate may be used to separate the limbs, heads, and abdomens of the insects. For example, the vibration plate may utilize a combination of friction and movement to separate the limbs and head from the abdomens. In one case, a conveyor or belt may move over a plurality of vibrating plates/sections that vibrate a different frequencies to cause the body parts to separate. The conveyor or belt may include a fine mesh that allows the limbs or appendages of the insects to pass through following separation. The heads and abdomens may be passed into a tumbler to powderize the abdomens as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In another example, rather than using a tumbler, a centrifuge device may apply large centripetal forces to the insects. The centrifuge may also be lined with a screen or mesh that allows the limbs to pass and retains the abdomens and heads. In some cases, the large centripetal forces applied from the mesh onto the insects cause them to reduce in size based on the sizing of the mesh. In one example, the centripetal forces may be controlled such that different density and structurally rigid components of the insects are separated at different instances. Thus, the different components may be collected independently from one another. Similarly, some types of insects shed exoskeletons as the insects mature. The exoskeletons (or chitins) collect with the waste in the habitat. In some examples, the waste material may be placed in the centrifuge to remove the waste product leaving behind the chitinous material, which may be processed for various supplements and compounds as described above.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In yet another implementation, the limbs, head, and abdomens may be separated via alignment slicing. Alignment slicing is the process of translationally and rotationally adjusting insects such that each insect shares an orientation. Once the specific orientation is achieved, the insects can be separated mechanically via cutting and/or slicing. In one example, the insect moves across a conveyor. As the insect moves translationally each insect impacts geometry (e.g., a wall with specific orientation) that forces the insect to orient to a specific direction. Once oriented, the insects are moved into a slicing/cutting device. The slicing/cutting device separates the insect into portions by slicing the limbs or appendages and head from the abdomens.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In another example, the insects or parts of insects may be processed chemically to separate the limbs, head, or abdomens. For example, the insects may be treated with specific chemicals, including plant-based oils, to separate limbs and appendages from the abdomens of an insect. In one example, the insects may be herded or passed through a chemical bath or spray via a conveying system. After the chemical treatment, the remaining portions of the insect may be separated by component using the system described above, such as a sieve system. Similarly, some types of insects shed exoskeletons as the insects mature. The exoskeletons (which consist of chitin) collect with the waste in the habitat. In some examples, the waste material may be treated with chemicals to dissolve the waste product leaving behind the chitinous material, which may be processed for various supplements and compounds as described above.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some cases, oils may be removed from the insects or portions of the insects, such as the appendages, head, or abdomens. In these cases, the insects or portions of the insects may be pressed or compressed by a pressing machine. For example, the pressing machine may include a screw or twist based system that closes, exerts pressure on, or presses the insects placed within the press. As the insects are compressed, the oils are released and may be collected in the bottom of the pressing machine or escape into a collection area through opening in the bottom of the pressing machine. In some instances, the pressing machine may produce the oil and the insect remains may be processed to produce products that are relatively oil free when compared to similar insect based products.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> for cultivating and harvesting insects according to some implementations.
