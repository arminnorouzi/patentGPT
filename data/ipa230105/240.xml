For example, intricate designs and theatrical makeup are typically applied by certified makeup professionals. Additionally, self-application can be a challenge generally for those with limited mobility or vision. Currently, handheld tools, such as cartridge-plus-dispenser solutions, typically implement printed and/or patterned makeup application through a unitary printing head to apply the final design directly to the skin. Despite representing a technological alternative to brushes, such tools are limited by cartridge sizes, cleaning methods, inability to mix or blend colors, short battery life, and lack of location awareness. Also, by depending on a handheld device, such tools do not address accessibility concerns.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Techniques are described for applying a cosmetic design guide to a target body surface of a biological subject, such as a subject's face or other region of interest, using an applicator array device. Described embodiments employ electrical and/or mechanical actuation to initialize an applicator array including multiple applicator elements that each include an applicator member defining an applicator surface, to which a pigment may be applied. Subsequent initialization, a pigment may be selectively applied to a subset of the applicator elements in accordance with a cosmetic design or cosmetic design guide. Transferring the cosmetic design guide to the target body surface aids in the application of cosmetics in accordance with a cosmetic design. The techniques, therefore, improve the manual application of cosmetics.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Described embodiments include using image sensors to define one or more contour mappings of the target body surface using a 3D mapping of the target body surface. Described embodiments are useful in many contexts, including cosmetics or body art applications, skin feature mapping or monitoring, dermatological diagnosis or treatments, or telehealth applications. In the context of such applications, described embodiments provide precision and greater ease of use over complex manual routines.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The forthcoming description focuses on embodiments of a system for applying cosmetic designs and/or cosmetic design guides, but embodiments are not limited as such. In some embodiments, the systems, methods, and materials described include techniques for applying cosmetic treatments to a target body surface. The cosmetic treatments may include, but are not limited to, cosmetic treatments directed at reducing the appearance of skin lines, wrinkles, loose skin, acne, scars, or other aesthetic treatments. The cosmetic treatments may be implemented through application of active ingredients additionally or alternatively to cosmetic pigments. For example, devices described herein may apply ultraviolet-absorber material, antipruritic material, and/or antiseptic materials, as part of a cosmetic design to conceal and treat features including, but not limited to blemishes, acne, cuts, or scars. In this way, the cosmetic treatments may impart similar cosmetic benefits as treatments employing both cosmetic formulations and active ingredients.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an example system <b>100</b> for application of cosmetic designs, in accordance with various embodiments. The example system <b>100</b> includes an applicator array device <b>110</b>, a pigment applicator <b>120</b>, one or more client computing devices <b>130</b>, a camera <b>140</b>, and one or more remote computer systems <b>160</b>, also referred to as server(s). As part of the example system <b>100</b>, the constituent system components may be operably coupled through wireless communication and/or through wired communication. In some embodiments, constituent components may communicate directly through wireless pairing (e.g., Bluetooth) and/or via a local wireless network (e.g., through a wireless router). In some embodiments, constituent components may communicate over one or more networks <b>170</b>, which may be or include a public network (e.g., the internet) or a private network (e.g., an intranet). In this way, the example system <b>100</b> may include multiple distinct devices configured to communicate electronic information through wireless connections. Additionally or alternatively, some of the constituent components may be integrated into a single device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an illustrative example, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may integrate the client computing device <b>130</b> and/or the camera <b>140</b>. Similarly, the client computing device <b>130</b> may incorporate the camera <b>140</b> and/or the pigment applicator <b>120</b>. Similarly, the example system <b>100</b> may include multiple client computing devices <b>130</b>, where a first client computing device <b>130</b> is a mobile electronic device (e.g., a tablet, smartphone, or laptop) that is configured to host user interface elements and to connect to the server(s) <b>160</b> over the network(s) <b>170</b>, while a second client computing device <b>130</b> is integrated with the pigment applicator <b>120</b> and the camera <b>140</b> and is configured to coordinate the operation of the applicator array device <b>110</b> with the first client computing device <b>130</b>. As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the constituent components of the example system <b>100</b> may be provided with computer-executable instructions (e.g., software, firmware, etc.) to implement and coordinate the operation of one or more features of the example system <b>100</b>. In this way, the operation of the example system <b>100</b> may be coordinated via a user interface, accessed via one or more of the constituent components.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the applicator array device <b>110</b> may incorporate electronic components including, but not limited to, control circuitry, power supply circuitry, and communication circuitry. In some embodiments, the applicator array device <b>110</b> receives a cosmetic design from one or more constituent components of the example system <b>100</b> and initializes an applicator array <b>111</b> in accordance with the cosmetic design. The applicator array device <b>110</b> may receive the cosmetic design through communication with one or more of the constituent components of the example system <b>100</b>, for example, through wireless communication circuitry <b>113</b>, including but not limited to a near-field radio transmitter/receiver (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.), an infrared optical link, or other data transmission techniques. In some embodiments, the applicator array device <b>110</b> may receive the cosmetic design(s) from the client computing device <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the applicator array device <b>110</b> may receive the cosmetic design(s) from the client computing device <b>130</b> via a link with the pigment applicator <b>120</b>. For example, the applicator array device <b>110</b> and the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may communicate automatically (e.g., without human intervention) either wirelessly or through a reversible physical coupling (e.g., through communication circuitry including electrical contacts). In this way, cosmetic design data may be transferred either directly to the applicator array device <b>110</b> (e.g., over the network <b>170</b> or through a wireless pairing with the client computing device(s) <b>130</b>), or indirectly via the pigment applicator <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The applicator array device <b>110</b> may include electronic circuitry to individually address multiple applicator elements that together define the applicator array <b>111</b>, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. The applicator elements may include applicator members that are individually addressed and may be actuated between a raised position and a neutral or recessed position. In this way, the cosmetic designs received by the applicator array device <b>110</b> may be or include an array of binary values (e.g., a &#x201c;true&#x201d; value and a &#x201c;false&#x201d; value) corresponding to the applicator elements making up the applicator array <b>111</b>.

For example, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may be or include an applicator <b>123</b> including a pigment applicator pad, positioned such that only the applicator element(s) that are in the raised position (e.g., the &#x201c;true&#x201d; position in the cosmetic design) are contacted during the reversible coupling with the applicator array device <b>110</b>. In this way, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may provide a controlled application of pigment to each applicator member that corresponds to a true position in the cosmetic design while leaving applicator members corresponding to a &#x201c;false&#x201d; position in the design substantially free of pigment. In this context, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is used to describe a condition where a limited or a negligible amount of pigment remains or is deposited on elements not directly contacting the pigment applicator pad.

For example, the applicator <b>123</b> may include multiple applicator pads corresponding to different colors or types of pigments and may include mechanisms for exchanging the applicator pads between an operative position and an inoperative position. In this way, the pigment applicator <b>120</b> may initialize the applicator <b>123</b> by selecting an appropriate pigment corresponding to a received cosmetic design but may also change pigments during application of pigment to the applicator array <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the applicator <b>123</b> includes a controllable pigment applicator head.

In an illustrative example, the pigment includes charged components, such as ionic species, and the pigment is applied to the applicator element(s) through reversible application of an electric field using the pigment applicator head. In another example, the pigment applicator head may include a ribbon saturated with the pigment that is impacted by a driven tip, such that the ribbon is between the driven tip and the applicator member.

The depth sensor <b>143</b> may generate a surface mapping <b>183</b> of the target body surface <b>181</b>. Contours and depth information for the target body surface <b>181</b> may vary over time or between users, and the camera may generate the surface mapping <b>183</b> as part of operations for modifying and/or generating a cosmetic design by the client computing device(s) <b>130</b>. The depth sensor <b>185</b> may be an image sensor and may capture images within a field of view <b>185</b> including the target body surface <b>181</b>. The depth sensor <b>143</b> may be or include, but is not limited to, a laser-based sensor (e.g., LiDAR), a time-of-flight camera, a vSLAM sensor assembly, or an ultrasound-based sensor assembly, such that the camera <b>140</b> may generate the surface mapping <b>183</b>. For example, where the depth sensor is an infrared depth sensing camera, the source of invisible EM radiation <b>145</b> may be or include an infrared source that exposes the biological subject <b>180</b> including the target body surface <b>181</b> to invisible infrared radiation. In another example, where the depth sensor is a LiDAR system or a time-of-flight camera, the source of invisible EM radiation <b>145</b> may be or include an infrared diode laser.

In this way, the operations may be or include operations performed by one or more processors of a computer system (e.g., applicator array device <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in response to execution of computer-readable instructions stored on non-transitory memory of the computer system. While the operations are illustrated in a particular order, the example technique <b>200</b> may include more or fewer operations, and the order of operations may vary. In some embodiments, one or more operations are performed by multiple components of a system, as described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, some operations may be performed by different components interchangeably or may be performed by coordinated operation of two or more components.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At operation <b>201</b> the example technique <b>200</b> includes receiving a cosmetic design <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the cosmetic design <b>210</b> is a design guide including multiple points of pigment to be transferred onto a surface <b>211</b> (e.g., target body surface <b>181</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of a biological subject (e.g., biological subject <b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as a human. In some embodiments, the cosmetic design <b>210</b> is a complete cosmetic design that may include multiple colors and/or shades corresponding to different regions of the surface.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the cosmetic design <b>210</b> is received by an applicator array device <b>220</b> (e.g., applicator array device <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) as a numerical representation of the design, including a dataset of true values and false values corresponding to a number of applicator elements <b>231</b> that together define an applicator array <b>230</b> of the applicator array device <b>220</b>. The applicator array <b>230</b> may include the applicator elements <b>231</b> arranged in one or more configurations. As illustrated, the applicator array <b>230</b> includes applicator elements <b>231</b> arranged in a rectangular matrix. In some embodiments, the applicator elements <b>231</b> are arranged in configurations including, but not limited to ellipsoidal or circular arrays, triangular arrays, square arrays, pentagonal arrays, hexagonal arrays, heptagonal arrays, octagonal arrays, or higher order polygonal arrays. The configurations are not limited to regular polygons and include oblong arrays and irregular polygons. For example, the applicator array <b>230</b> may be configured as a trapezoidal array of applicator elements <b>231</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Operations for receiving the cosmetic design may include one or more data transfer techniques including, but not limited to, wireless communication or wired communication. For example, the applicator array device <b>220</b> may communicate wirelessly with a client computing device (e.g., client computing device <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to receive the cosmetic design <b>210</b> as a wireless transmission. In another example, the applicator array device <b>220</b> may communicate through a temporary physical coupling with a pigment applicator (e.g., pigment applicator <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to receive the cosmetic design <b>210</b> via electronic transfer (e.g., through a Universal Serial Bus-type connection).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cosmetic design <b>210</b> may be or include information describing a neutral position <b>233</b> of a first subset of the applicator elements <b>231</b> and a raised position <b>235</b> of a second subset of the applicator elements <b>231</b>. The terms &#x201c;neutral&#x201d; and &#x201c;raised&#x201d; are used here to describe a &#x201c;false&#x201d; and &#x201c;true&#x201d; value in the cosmetic design <b>210</b>, respectively, rather than an absolute position. For example, the &#x201c;raised&#x201d; position may describe a default position of an applicator element <b>231</b>, while the &#x201c;neutral&#x201d; position may describe a recessed position beneath an outer surface of the applicator array. In this way, the default position of the applicator elements <b>231</b> may be the neutral position <b>233</b> or the raised position <b>235</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Illustrative examples of the cosmetic design <b>210</b> are described in reference to a binary dataset. In some embodiments, the cosmetic design <b>210</b> includes additional intermediate states between true and false states that correspond to intermediate positions of the applicator elements <b>231</b> between the neutral position <b>233</b> and the raised position <b>235</b>. In this way, the cosmetic design <b>210</b> may also include information for shading, shaping, color, as well as other aesthetic features. In an illustrative example the cosmetic design <b>210</b> may include one or more portions in a lighter shade or with smaller points, to indicate a lighter application of cosmetic formulation or a different color.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the example technique <b>200</b> may optionally include cleaning the applicator array <b>230</b> at operation <b>202</b>. Cleaning the applicator array <b>230</b> may include, but is not limited to, applying a solvent or other removal formulation to the applicator array <b>230</b>, at least partially submerging the applicator array <b>230</b> in a bath of the solvent or other removal formulation, exposing the applicator array <b>230</b> to ultrasonic energy (e.g., pulsed ultrasound) through a liquid that may include the solvent or other removal formulation, and/or mechanical removal such as wiping, scrubbing or pressing. In some embodiments, the pigment applicator incorporates circuitry and components to facilitate cleaning operations. For example, the pigment applicator may include a reservoir of cleaning fluid and an ultrasonic resonator (e.g., a sonic bath) to which the applicator array device <b>220</b> can reversibly couple, at least partially submerging the applicator array <b>230</b>. In this way, residual pigment may be removed from the applicator array <b>230</b> and its constituent applicator elements <b>231</b>. While cleaning is described as an optional operation of the example technique <b>200</b>, it is understood that cleaning may also be included as part of initializing the applicator array <b>230</b>. For example, where some of the operations of the example technique <b>200</b> are performed while the applicator array device <b>220</b> is reversibly coupled with the pigment applicator, cleaning and initializing may be performed concurrently (e.g., at least partially overlapping in time), under the control of one or more processors of the pigment applicator and/or the applicator array device <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Subsequent receiving the cosmetic design <b>210</b>, the example technique <b>200</b> includes mapping the surface at operation <b>205</b>.

The contour map, thus generated, may be used to project and/or modify the received cosmetic design, as an approach to improving the precision and accuracy of the cosmetic design. In an illustrative example, a length of each applicator member of the applicator elements together defining the applicator array may be defined by the contour map, such that the applicator array may define a negative surface that complements the target body surface. Additionally or alternatively, modifying the cosmetic design may include re-assigning one or more of the applicator elements from a false value to a true value, or vice versa, based on a prediction of accuracy or precision of the transferred pigment pattern. For example, in some cases the contour map may indicate that two applicator surfaces may overlap or otherwise be unresolved when contacting the surface. To address the potential consequent loss of design resolution, a subset of the applicator elements may be modified from true to false, such that the design may be cleanly transferred to the target body surface.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Subsequent mapping the surface, the example technique <b>200</b> may optionally include initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> at operation <b>206</b>. Prior to operation <b>206</b>, the applicator elements <b>231</b> may be in various positions, for example, resulting from a previous iteration of the example technique <b>200</b>. In this way, initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> refers to one or more processes to place the applicator elements <b>231</b> of the applicator array <b>230</b> into the positions corresponding to the cosmetic design <b>210</b>. For example, initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> may describe repositioning a subset of the applicator elements <b>231</b> from the raised position <b>235</b> to the neutral position <b>233</b>. Similarly, initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> may describe repositioning a subset of the applicator elements <b>231</b> from the neutral position <b>233</b> to the raised position <b>235</b>. In some embodiments, initializing the applicator array <b>230</b> includes returning the applicator elements <b>231</b> to a default position or to a cleaning position prior to switching the applicator elements <b>231</b> to the neutral or raised positions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Subsequent mapping the surface, the example technique <b>200</b> includes applying a pigment <b>237</b> to a portion of the applicator array <b>230</b> at operation <b>207</b>. Applying the pigment <b>237</b> may include selectively applying pigment(s) <b>237</b> to the applicator elements <b>231</b> in the raised position <b>235</b>, in accordance with the cosmetic design <b>210</b>. In this context, &#x201c;selectively&#x201d; may refer to passively applying pigment to the applicator elements <b>231</b> that contact a pigment source (e.g., a pigment pad), but may also refer to an active process where an addressable applicator head may be automatically directed to apply the pigment <b>237</b> to the applicator elements <b>231</b> in the raised position <b>235</b>. As described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pigment applicator may facilitate the active process by incorporating the addressable applicator head, which may be controlled by circuitry of the pigment applicator and/or the applicator array device <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the example technique <b>200</b> may optionally include applying the cosmetic design <b>210</b> to the surface <b>211</b> at operation <b>208</b>.

Precise application may be facilitated by making reference to features <b>213</b> of the surface <b>211</b> or near the surface <b>211</b> that guide or otherwise align the applicator array <b>230</b> relative to the features <b>213</b>. For example, a mapping of the surface <b>211</b> may be generated and may detect edges, depth information, and/or contours of the surface <b>211</b>. The mapping may be referenced to register where on the surface <b>211</b> to apply the pigment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, one or more registration marks <b>215</b> may be placed on the surface <b>211</b>, for example, by manually indicating one or more of the features <b>213</b>.

In some embodiments, the registration mark(s) <b>215</b> may be applied to the surface <b>211</b> within the area described by the cosmetic design <b>210</b>. In this way, the registration mark(s) <b>215</b> may be occluded by the eventual deposition of pigment in accordance with the cosmetic design <b>215</b>, after the applicator array device <b>220</b> has been applied to the surface <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the applicator array device <b>220</b> includes one or more emitters <b>221</b> to project the registration mark(s) <b>215</b> onto the surface <b>211</b>. An emitter <b>221</b> may be or include, but is not limited to, a projector, a coherent radiation source (e.g., a laser), or a collimated source (e.g., a light-emitting diode configured with beam-shaping optics). The emitter(s) <b>221</b> may be calibrated to emit one or more patterns onto the surface <b>211</b> to indicate the position of the applicator array <b>230</b> relative to the surface <b>211</b>. In an illustrative example, the emitter <b>221</b> may emit a line onto the surface <b>211</b> indicative of the application position of the applicator array <b>230</b>. In this way, the applicator array <b>230</b> may be guided to the correct position on the surface by aligning the projection generated by the emitter <b>221</b> with the registration mark <b>215</b>. While an emitter <b>221</b> is illustrated external to the applicator array <b>230</b>, the emitter(s) <b>221</b> may be disposed between the applicator elements <b>231</b> of the applicator array <b>230</b>. For example, an emitter <b>221</b> may be a calibrated to emit one or more patterns or beams onto the surface <b>211</b> from a point- and/or line-source located on the operative surface of the applicator array <b>230</b> (e.g., a beam-forming optic being optically coupled to one or more light-emitting diodes positioned within the body of the applicator array device <b>220</b>).

In some embodiments, the registration elements may be spring-loaded retract once in contact with the surface <b>211</b>. In this way, the applicator array <b>230</b> may contact the surface <b>211</b> after depressing the registration elements, as an approach to improving precision of applying the cosmetic design <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the emitter(s) <b>221</b> project the registration mark(s) <b>215</b> to indicate to a user where to place the registration element(s) <b>223</b> on the surface <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, applying the design includes multiple iterations of the operations of example technique <b>200</b>.

The applicator array device may include an applicator array <b>330</b> including applicator array elements <b>331</b> that together define the applicator array <b>330</b>.

In some embodiments, mapping the surface includes modifying the design received to reflect the contours of the target surface.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The applicator elements <b>331</b> may be in any position relative to the surface of the applicator array prior to initialization. For example, a subset of the applicator elements <b>331</b> may be in a neutral or recessed position <b>333</b> and a different subset may be in a raised position <b>335</b>. Initializing the applicator array <b>330</b> may include repositioning at least some of the applicator elements <b>331</b> between the neutral or recessed position <b>333</b> and the raised position <b>335</b>, in accordance with the cosmetic design received at operation <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Subsequent mapping/initializing the applicator array <b>330</b>, the example technique <b>300</b> includes applying a bistable pigment <b>337</b> at operation <b>305</b>. In this context, the term &#x201c;bistable&#x201d; refers to a polymeric material that absorbs electromagnetic radiation at a characteristic energy (hv) to form crosslinking bonds that may be reversed upon exposure to different EM radiation in the UV/visible spectral ranges. Formation of the temporary crosslinking bonds may shift the bistable pigment <b>337</b> from a fluid <b>341</b> to a solid <b>343</b>, and removal of crosslinking bonds may shift the bistable pigment <b>337</b> from a solid <b>343</b> to a liquid <b>341</b>. In some embodiments, the fluid <b>341</b> may be characterized by a viscosity that permits the bistable pigment <b>337</b> to transfer to the surface (e.g., surface <b>211</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In contrast, the solid <b>343</b> may be or include a solid and or a viscous fluid, either of which may be resistant to transfer onto the surface. In this way, the resulting applicator array <b>330</b> may be patterned by localized exposure to the activation wavelength to switch the bistable pigment <b>337</b> from one phase to another, leaving a subset of the applicator elements <b>331</b> with bistable pigment <b>337</b> as liquid <b>341</b>. In some embodiments, the cosmetic design is formed by patterning the bistable pigment <b>337</b> without initializing the applicator array <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Without being bound to a physical mechanism of action, the bistable pigment <b>337</b> may be or include a polymer matrix incorporating a thioester functional group. The thioester functional group may participate in an exchange reaction with free thiol as promoted by a base catalyst. The exchange reaction may be modulated by mild basic or mild acidic catalysts, which are released by exposure of the polymer matrix to EM radiation at the characteristic activation wavelength(s) at operation <b>307</b>. Examples of the characteristic activation wavelength may include, but are not limited to, wavelengths in a range from 300 nm to 500 nm. For example, the characteristic activation wavelength may be 320 nm, 330 nm, 340 nm, 350 nm, 360 nm, 370 nm, 380 nm, 390 nm, 400 nm, 410 nm, 420 nm, 430 nm, 440 nm, 450 nm, 460 nm, 470 nm, 480 nm, 490 nm, 500 nm, 510 nm, 520 nm, 530 nm, 540 nm, 550 nm, or interpolations thereof (e.g., 455 nm). Furthermore, the photo-mediated release of acid/base catalysts may exhibit spatial and temporal localization of phase-switching of the bistable pigment <b>337</b>. In this way, phase-switching may be localized to the applicator elements <b>331</b> in the raised position <b>335</b> from solid <b>343</b> to liquid <b>341</b>, or may be localized to the applicator elements <b>331</b> in the neutral or recessed position <b>333</b> from liquid <b>341</b> to solid <b>343</b>.

In response to closing the circuit, thereby applying the voltage across the electroactive polymer layer <b>810</b>, the example electroactive polymer cell <b>800</b> may shift to a second morphology, as a result of forces (F<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub>, F<sub>z</sub>) generated by changes in the polymer structure.

For example, conductive polymers and IPMC may respond to a relatively lower activation voltage, as compared to PVDF, dielectric elastomers, or ferroelectric polymers, while dielectric elastomer, ferroelectric, and/or PVDF may generate a relatively stronger actuation force at a relatively higher voltage.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The magnitude of the voltage may be influenced by the chemical structure and/or the physical dimensions of the electroactive polymer layer <b>810</b>.

Such concerns may increase the complexity of the electronic components of the applicator array device, and may reduce performance. In this way, the example electroactive polymer cell <b>800</b> may be configured to apply the voltage to induce an effective change in morphology, without also introducing negative effects.
