Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The following describes embodiments of golf club heads in the context of an iron-type golf club and a metal-wood-type golf club, but the principles, methods and designs described may be applicable in whole or in part to utility golf clubs (also known as hybrid golf clubs), driver-type golf clubs, putter-type golf clubs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The various embodiments of a golf club head described herein utilizes a peripheral weld to secure a strike plate to a body of the golf club head. Welding the strike plate to the body of the golf club head, as opposed to integrally forming the strike plate and the body as a one-piece construction (such as by casting) allows the strike plate to be made from a different material or made by a different manufacturing process than the body. Additionally, welding the strike plate to the body promotes the ability to make golf club head with unique and complex shapes and geometries. However, welding together the strike plate and the body also introduces certain consequences, such as the development of heat effected zones and stress risers in the weld, which ultimately weakens the golf club head, and stiffness of the strike face of the golf club head. The peripheral weld of the golf club head disclosed herein introduces portions of the outer peripheral edge of the strike plate that are not welded to the body, thereby increasing the strength of the golf club head compared to golf club heads with continuous or 360-degree welds welding the strike plate to the body. Additionally, introducing non-welded portions of the outer peripheral edge of the strike plate also promotes flex in the strike face of the golf club head, which promotes forgiveness and feel.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The discovered advantages of introducing non-welded portions in the outer peripheral edge of the strike plate outweigh the potential negative consequences of such non-welded portions that would otherwise discourage the use of non-welded portions in the outer peripheral edge. For example, non-welded portions in an outer peripheral edge of a strike plate may increase the potential for rust at the non-welded portions and stress risers at the intersection of non-welded and welded portions of the outer peripheral edge. As another example, the chrome plating often used to plate a golf club head may crack or phantom lines may develop at the non-welded portions. Notwithstanding the potential disadvantages of introducing non-welded portions of a strike plate, the ability to reduce stress risers along the non-welded portions and promote the flex of the strike face through the use of non-welded portions, as discovered by the inventors of the present disclosure, encourages the use of non-welded portions in the outer peripheral edge of a strike plate.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, one embodiment of a golf club head <b>100</b> includes a body <b>102</b> and a strike plate <b>104</b> welded to the body <b>102</b>. The body <b>102</b> has a toe portion <b>114</b>, a heel portion <b>112</b>, a top portion <b>116</b> (e.g., top-line portion for iron-type golf club heads and crown portion for driver-type, hybrid-type, and metal-wood-type golf club heads), and a sole portion <b>118</b> (e.g., bottom portion). The body <b>102</b> additionally includes a hosel <b>108</b> extending from the heel portion <b>112</b>. The hosel <b>108</b> is configured to receive and engage with a shaft and grip <b>110</b> of a golf club <b>101</b>. The shaft extends from the hosel <b>108</b> and the grip is secured to the shaft at a location on the shaft opposite that of the golf club head <b>100</b>. The strike plate <b>104</b> includes at least a portion of a strike face <b>106</b> designed to impact a golf ball during a normal golf swing. In some implementations, the strike plate <b>104</b> include an entirety of the strike face <b>106</b>. Generally, the strike plate <b>104</b> is defined as any piece of the golf club head <b>100</b> that is welded to a body <b>102</b> of the golf club head <b>100</b> and includes at least a portion of the strike face.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Generally, for many iron-type golf club heads, such as the golf club head <b>100</b>, the strike face <b>106</b> has a planar surface that is angled relative to a ground plane when the golf club head <b>100</b> is in an address position to define a loft of the golf club head <b>100</b>. In other words, the strike face <b>106</b> of an iron-type golf club head generally does not include a curved surface. Accordingly, the strike face <b>106</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> of the iron-type golf club head <b>100</b> is defined as the portion of the strike face <b>106</b> with an outwardly facing planar surface. In other words, although a strike plate <b>104</b> may include a curved surface, such as an outer surface of a sole wrap portion <b>122</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b>, the strike face <b>106</b> does not include such a curved surface. In contrast, the strike face of a metal-wood, driver, or hybrid golf club head does have a curved surface that curves around a substantially upright axis. Because the sole wrap portion <b>122</b> wraps around a substantially horizontal axis, the strike face of the strike plate of the metal-wood, driver, and hybrid golf club head is defined as the portion of the strike face <b>106</b> with an outwardly facing surface curved about an upright axis, as opposed to a horizontal axis.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The strike plate <b>104</b> further includes grooves <b>107</b> formed in the strike face <b>106</b> to promote desirable flight characteristics (e.g., backspin) of the golf ball upon being impacted by the strike face <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the strike plate <b>104</b> is formed separately from the body <b>102</b> and is separately attached to the body <b>102</b>. The body <b>102</b> and the strike plate <b>104</b> can be formed using the same type of process or different types of processes. In the illustrated embodiment, the body <b>102</b> is formed to have a one-piece monolithic construction using a first manufacturing process and the strike plate <b>104</b> is formed to have a separate one-piece monolithic construction using a second manufacturing process. However, in other embodiments, one or both of the body <b>102</b> and the strike plate <b>104</b> has a multiple-piece construction with each piece being made from the same or a different material. Additionally, the body <b>102</b> can be formed of the same material as or a different material than the strike plate <b>104</b>. The body <b>102</b> is made from a first material and the strike plate <b>104</b> is made from a second material. Separately forming and attaching together the body <b>102</b> and the strike plate <b>104</b> and making the body <b>102</b> and the strike plate <b>104</b> from the same or different materials, which allows flexibility in the types of manufacturing processes and materials used, promotes the ability to make a golf club head <b>100</b> that achieves a wide range of performance, aesthetic, and economic results.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some implementations, the first manufacturing process is the same type of process as the second manufacturing process. For example, both the first and second manufacturing processes are casting processes in one implementation. As another example, both the first and second manufacturing processes are forging processes in one implementation. According to yet another example, both the first and second manufacturing processes are machining processes in one implementation.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, in some other implementations, the first manufacturing process is a different type of process than the second manufacturing process. The first manufacturing process is one of a casting process, a machining process, and a forging process and the second manufacturing process is another of a casting process, a machining process, and a forging process in some examples. In one particular example, the first manufacturing process is a casting process and the second manufacturing process is a forging process. The first manufacturing process and/or the second manufacturing process can be a process as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,044,653, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, such as hot press forging using a progressive series of dies and heat-treatment.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Whether the first and second manufacturing processes are the same or different, the first material of the body <b>102</b> can be the same as or different than the second material of the strike plate <b>104</b>. A first material is different than a second material when the first material has a different composition than the second material. Accordingly, materials from the same family, such as steel, but with different compositional characteristics, such as different carbon constituencies, are considered different materials. In one example, the first and second manufacturing processes are different, but the first and second materials are the same. In contrast, according to another example, the first and second manufacturing processes are the same and the first and second materials are different. According to yet another example, the first and second manufacturing processes are different and the first and second materials are different. In some implementations, the first and second materials are different, but come from the same family of similar materials, such as steel. For example, the first material can be 8620 carbon steel and the second material can be 1025 carbon steel. The first material being within the same family as the second material promotes the quality of the weld between the body <b>102</b> and the strike plate <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The strike plate <b>104</b> can be made from maraging steel, maraging stainless steel, or precipitation-hardened (PH) stainless steel. In general, maraging steels have high strength, toughness, and malleability. Being low in carbon, they derive their strength from precipitation of inter-metallic substances other than carbon. The principle alloying element is nickel (15% to nearly 30%). Other alloying elements producing inter-metallic precipitates in these steels include cobalt, molybdenum, and titanium. In one embodiment, the maraging steel contains 18% nickel. Maraging stainless steels have less nickel than maraging steels but include significant chromium to inhibit rust. The chromium augments hardenability despite the reduced nickel content, which ensures the steel can transform to martensite when appropriately heat-treated. In another embodiment, a maraging stainless steel C455 is utilized as the strike plate <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the strike plate <b>104</b> is a precipitation hardened stainless steel such as 17-4, 15-5, or 17-7.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The body <b>102</b> of the golf club head <b>100</b> is made from 17-4 steel in one implementation. However another material, such as carbon steel (e.g., 1020, 1030, 8620, or 1040 carbon steel), chrome-molybdenum steel (e.g., 4140 Cr&#x2014;Mo steel), Ni&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Mo steel (e.g., 8620 Ni&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Mo steel), austenitic stainless steel (e.g., 304, N50, or N60 stainless steel (e.g., 410 stainless steel) can be used.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition to those noted above, some examples of metals and metal alloys that can be used to form the components of the parts described include, without limitation: titanium alloys (e.g., 3-2.5, 6-4, SP700, 15-3-3-3, 10-2-3, or other alpha/near alpha, alpha-beta, and beta/near beta titanium alloys), aluminum/aluminum alloys (e.g., 3000 series alloys, 5000 series alloys, 6000 series alloys, such as 6061-T6, and 7000 series alloys, such as 7075), magnesium alloys, copper alloys, and nickel alloys.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In still other embodiments, the body <b>102</b> and/or the strike plate <b>104</b> of the golf club head <b>100</b> are made from fiber-reinforced polymeric composite materials, and are not required to be homogeneous. Examples of composite materials and golf club components comprising composite materials are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/111,715, filed May 19, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The strike plate <b>104</b> is welded to the body <b>102</b> via a peripheral weld <b>120</b>. The peripheral weld <b>120</b> is peripherally discontinuous because it extends about less than all of the outer periphery of the strike plate <b>104</b> such that at least one portion of the outer periphery of the strike plate <b>104</b> is not welded to the body <b>102</b>. In other words, the peripheral weld <b>120</b> extends about only a portion of an outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b>. Accordingly, less than 360-degrees of the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> is welded to the body <b>102</b>. The peripheral weld <b>120</b> can be considered a discontinuous weld because it has an ending point that is different than it's starting point.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The portion or portions of the outer periphery of the strike plate <b>104</b> not being welded to the body <b>102</b> promotes an increase in the flexibility of the strike plate <b>104</b> relative to the body <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the entirety of the portion of the outer periphery of the strike plate <b>104</b> that defines the strike face <b>106</b> is welded to the body <b>102</b> via the peripheral weld <b>120</b>. Moreover, the portion of the outer periphery of the strike plate <b>104</b> not welded to the body <b>102</b> is located along the sole wrap portion <b>122</b>. More specifically, an outer peripheral edge <b>133</b>, or perimeter, of the strike plate <b>104</b> defined along the sole wrap portion <b>122</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> is not welded to the body <b>102</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, not only is the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> not welded to the body <b>102</b>, but the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> is spaced apart from the body <b>102</b> such that a gap is defined between the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> and the body <b>102</b>. The gap defines a sole slot <b>126</b> of the golf club head <b>100</b>. Generally, the sole slot <b>126</b> is a groove or channel formed in a sole of the golf club head <b>100</b>. The sole slot <b>126</b> is elongate in a lengthwise direction substantially parallel to the strike face <b>106</b> and has a length LSS (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, in some implementations, the sole slot <b>126</b> is a through-slot, or a slot that is open on a sole portion side of the sole slot <b>126</b> and open on an internal cavity side or interior side of the sole slot <b>126</b>. However, in other implementations, the sole slot <b>126</b> is not a through-slot, but rather is closed on an internal cavity side or interior side of the sole slot <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sole slot <b>126</b> can be any of various flexible boundary structures (FBS) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,044,653, filed Mar. 14, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Additionally, or alternatively, the golf club head <b>100</b> can include one or more other FBS at any of various other locations on the golf club head <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some implementations, the sole slot <b>126</b> is filled with a filler material <b>128</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>11</b></figref>). The filler material <b>128</b> is made from a non-metal, such as a thermoplastic material, thermoset material, and the like, in some implementations. In other implementations, the sole slot <b>126</b> is not filled with a filler material <b>128</b>, but rather maintains an open, vacant, space within the sole slot <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to one embodiments, the filler material <b>128</b> is initially a viscous material that is injected or otherwise inserted into the sole slot <b>126</b>. Examples of materials that may be suitable for use as a filler to be placed into a slot, channel, or other flexible boundary structure include, without limitation: viscoelastic elastomers; vinyl copolymers with or without inorganic fillers; polyvinyl acetate with or without mineral fillers such as barium sulfate; acrylics; polyesters; polyurethanes; polyethers; polyamides; polybutadienes; polystyrenes; polyisoprenes; polyethylenes; polyolefins; styrene/isoprene block copolymers; hydrogenated styrenic thermoplastic elastomers; metallized polyesters; metallized acrylics; epoxies; epoxy and graphite composites; natural and synthetic rubbers; piezoelectric ceramics; thermoset and thermoplastic rubbers; foamed polymers; ionomers; low-density fiber glass; bitumen; silicone; and mixtures thereof. The metallized polyesters and acrylics can comprise aluminum as the metal. Commercially available materials include resilient polymeric materials such as Scotchweld&#x2122; (e.g., DP-105&#x2122;) and Scotchdamp&#x2122; from 3M, Sorbothane&#x2122; from Sorbothane, Inc., DYAD&#x2122; and GP&#x2122; from Soundcoat Company Inc., Dynamat&#x2122; from Dynamat Control of North America, Inc., NoViFIex&#x2122; Sylomer&#x2122; from Pole Star Maritime Group, LLC, Isoplast&#x2122; from The Dow Chemical Company, Legetolex&#x2122; from Piqua Technologies, Inc., and Hybrar&#x2122; from the Kuraray Co., Ltd. In some embodiments, a solid filler material may be press-fit or adhesively bonded into a slot, channel, or other flexible boundary structure. In other embodiments, a filler material may poured, injected, or otherwise inserted into a slot or channel and allowed to cure in place, forming a sufficiently hardened or resilient outer surface. In still other embodiments, a filler material may be placed into a slot or channel and sealed in place with a resilient cap or other structure formed of a metal, metal alloy, metallic, composite, hard plastic, resilient elastomeric, or other suitable material.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the body <b>102</b> is configured to receive the portions of an outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b>, to be welded to the body <b>102</b> via the peripheral weld <b>120</b>, in seated engagement. More specifically, the body <b>102</b> includes a plate opening <b>176</b> defined between the toe portion <b>114</b>, the heel portion <b>112</b>, the top portion <b>116</b>, and the sole portion <b>118</b> of the body <b>102</b>. Generally, the plate opening <b>176</b> receives the strike plate <b>104</b> and helps to secure the strike plate <b>104</b> to the body <b>102</b>. The plate opening <b>176</b> extends from a front side of the body <b>102</b> to a back side of the body <b>102</b>. The body <b>102</b> additionally includes a plate interface <b>132</b> formed in the body <b>102</b> along at least a portion of the periphery of the plate opening <b>176</b>. Generally, the plate interface <b>132</b> promotes attachment of the strike plate <b>104</b> to the body <b>102</b> by supporting the strike plate <b>104</b> against the body <b>102</b> and promoting the formation of a peripheral weld <b>120</b> between the strike plate <b>104</b> and the body <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the plate interface <b>132</b> is formed along at least the portion or portions of the periphery of the plate opening <b>176</b> that will be welded to the strike plate <b>104</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, because the strike plate <b>104</b> is not welded to the body <b>102</b> at the sole portion <b>118</b> of the body <b>102</b>, the plate interface <b>132</b> does not extend along the periphery of the plate opening <b>176</b> at the sole portion <b>118</b> of the body <b>102</b>. However, in the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, because the peripheral weld <b>120</b> is formed between the strike plate <b>104</b> and the body <b>102</b> continuously along the heel portion <b>112</b>, the toe portion <b>114</b>, and the top portion <b>116</b>, the plate interface <b>132</b> is formed in and extends continuously along the portions of the periphery of the plate opening <b>176</b> at the heel portion <b>112</b>, the toe portion <b>114</b>, and the top portion <b>116</b>. According to other embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, because the peripheral weld does not extend along one or more portions of one or more of the heel portion <b>112</b>, the toe portion <b>114</b>, and the top portion <b>116</b>, although not shown, an plate interface may not be present along corresponding portions of the periphery of the plate opening.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the plate interface <b>132</b> includes a rim <b>136</b> and a ledge <b>138</b>. The rim <b>136</b> defines a surface that faces an interior of the body <b>102</b> and the ledge <b>138</b> defines a surface that faces the front of the body <b>102</b>. The rim <b>136</b> is transverse relative to the ledge <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The rim <b>136</b> is sized to be substantially flush against or just off of the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b>. The fit between the rim <b>136</b> of the plate interface <b>132</b> and the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> facilitates the butt welding together of the rim <b>136</b> of the body <b>102</b> and the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> with the peripheral weld <b>120</b>. In other words, the peripheral weld <b>120</b> is located between and welds together the rim <b>136</b> of the plate interface <b>132</b> and the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the rim <b>136</b> may extend beyond the plate interface <b>132</b>, such as along the sole portion <b>118</b> of the body <b>102</b>, to facilitate welding of the welded portions <b>134</b> of the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> located on the sole wrap portion <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The peripheral weld <b>120</b> is formed using any of various welding techniques, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,353,785, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Moreover, the characteristics and type (e.g., bead, groove, fillet, surface, tack, plug, slot, friction, and resistance welds) of the peripheral weld <b>120</b> can be that same or analogous to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,353,785. For example, in one implementation, the peripheral weld <b>120</b> is formed using one or more of a tungsten inert gas (TIG) or metal inert gas (MIG) welding technique. In other implementations, the peripheral weld <b>120</b> is formed using one or more of a laser welding technique or a plasma welding technique.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The ledge <b>138</b> abuts a back surface of the strike plate <b>104</b> to support the strike plate <b>104</b> in place on the body <b>102</b>. Additionally, the ledge <b>138</b>, being abutted against the strike plate <b>104</b>, facilitates the transfer of ball-striking loads from the strike plate <b>104</b> to the body <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the body <b>102</b> further includes a back portion <b>129</b> coupled to and extending rearwardly from the sole portion <b>118</b>. The back portion <b>129</b> is also coupled to and extends rearwardly from lower parts of the heel portion <b>112</b> and the toe portion <b>114</b>. The back portion <b>129</b> includes a sole bar <b>131</b>, which is located in a low, rearward portion of the golf club head <b>100</b>. The sole bar <b>131</b> has a relatively large thickness in relation to the strike plate and other portions of the golf club head <b>100</b>, thereby accounting for a significant portion of the mass of the golf club head <b>100</b>, and thereby shifting a center of gravity (CG) of the golf club head <b>100</b> relatively lower and rearward. The back portion <b>129</b> also includes a lower shelf <b>130</b> and an upper shelf <b>140</b> protruding forwardly of the sole bar <b>131</b>. The lower shelf <b>130</b> and the upper shelf <b>140</b> are spaced rearwardly of the strike plate <b>104</b> such that a gap is defined between each of the lower shelf <b>130</b> and the upper shelf <b>140</b> of the back portion <b>129</b>. Defined between the lower shelf <b>130</b> and the upper shelf <b>140</b> is a portion of an internal cavity <b>142</b>, which may extend upwards to the top portion <b>116</b>. In the illustrated implementation, the internal cavity <b>142</b> is open to the sole slot <b>126</b>. The plate opening <b>176</b> is partially open to the back of the body <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a slot edge <b>144</b> is formed in the sole portion <b>118</b> of the body <b>102</b>. The slot edge <b>144</b> is elongate and extends lengthwise along the sole portion <b>118</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the strike face <b>106</b>. The slot edge <b>144</b> is open to or faces the plate opening <b>176</b>. However, as shown, in some implementations, opposing ends of the slot edge <b>144</b> may have a substantially button-hook shape such that opposing end portions of the slot edge <b>144</b> face away from the plate opening <b>176</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the strike plate <b>104</b> has a back surface <b>154</b> that opposes the strike face <b>106</b>. The strike plate <b>104</b> includes an inverted cone <b>152</b> protruding from the back surface <b>154</b>. Generally, the inverted cone <b>152</b> is aligned with an ideal striking location on the strike face <b>106</b>. The inverted cone <b>152</b> promotes a larger sweet spot for the golf club head <b>100</b>, which facilitates a reduction in loss of distance on mishits. The outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> extends along and defines that outermost periphery of the strike plate <b>104</b>. The outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> includes at least one welded portion <b>134</b> and at least one non-welded portion <b>150</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the welded portion <b>134</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> is a continuous edge that extends from one end of the non-welded portion <b>150</b>, along the sole wrap portion <b>122</b>, around the strike face <b>106</b>, and along an opposite end of the non-welded portion. The non-welded portion <b>150</b> extends along an entire length of the sole wrap portion <b>122</b> and faces a direction that is substantially perpendicular to that of the welded portion <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the sole wrap portion <b>122</b> effectively wraps around the sole portion <b>118</b> of the body <b>102</b> to define a portion of the bottom of the golf club head <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the sole wrap portion <b>122</b> is angled relative to the strike face <b>106</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the sole wrap portion <b>122</b> also effectively wraps around the lower shelf <b>130</b> of the back portion <b>129</b>. The non-welded portion <b>150</b> of the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> faces the slot edge <b>144</b> of the body <b>102</b>. In one implementation, the non-welded portion <b>150</b> is parallel to the slot edge <b>144</b> and has a length LNW (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The gap defined between the non-welded portion <b>150</b> of the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> and the slot edge <b>144</b> defines the sole slot <b>126</b> of the golf club head <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the non-welded portion <b>150</b> defines a forward slot wall of the sole slot <b>126</b> and the slot edge <b>144</b> defines a rearward slot wall of the sole slot <b>126</b>. There is no weld between the non-welded portion <b>150</b> of the outer peripheral edge <b>133</b> of the strike plate <b>104</b> and the slot edge <b>144</b>.

The filler material <b>128</b> may also help to achieve other desired performance objectives, including desired changes to the sound and feel of the club head by damping vibrations that occur when the club head strikes a golf ball. Because the filler material <b>128</b> does not fuse with either the body <b>102</b> or the strike plate <b>104</b>, the filler material <b>128</b> is not considered a weld. Moreover, because the filler material <b>128</b> is considerably weaker than either the body <b>102</b> or the strike plate <b>104</b>, the filler material <b>128</b> is not considered a weld.
