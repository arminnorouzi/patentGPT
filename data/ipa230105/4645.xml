The energy meter <b>10</b> can be divided into two sections&#x2014;a section <b>12</b> related to &#x2018;legally important&#x2019; features and a section <b>14</b> related to &#x2018;legally non-important&#x2019; features.

These terms will be discussed in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the example energy meter <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, section <b>12</b> of the energy meter <b>10</b> can include a group of functionalities, features or components such as a first function <b>16</b>, a second function <b>18</b>, and a third function <b>20</b>. An access controller <b>22</b> can control access to the first function <b>16</b>, the second function <b>18</b>, the third function <b>20</b>, and so on. Note that in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, only three functions <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b> are shown. It can be appreciated, however, that fewer or more functions can be implemented in the context of an energy meter such as the energy meter <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first function <b>16</b>, the second function <b>18</b>, and the third function <b>20</b> are considered &#x2018;legally important&#x2019; or &#x2018;legally relevant&#x2019; functions. In some cases, the first function <b>16</b>, the second function <b>18</b>, and the third function <b>20</b> may include or involve certified features or components (as opposed to non-certified features or components). The access controller <b>22</b> can be configured to dynamically control access to firmware running one or more certified features and/or non-certified features in the energy meter <b>10</b>. This access can be based on a bifurcation between the certified feature and the non-certified feature running in the energy meter <b>10</b> on one or more, for example, a single microcontroller or a group of different microcontrollers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The term &#x2018;firmware&#x2019; as utilized herein can relate to a class or computer software can provide low-level control for specific hardware associated with the energy meter <b>10</b>. Such firmware can either provide a standardized operating environment for more complex device software associated with the energy meter <b>10</b>, or for a less complex energy meter, can act as the device's complete operating system, performing all or most control, monitoring and data manipulation functions. The access controller <b>22</b> can be implemented through the use of such firmware.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term &#x2018;microcontroller&#x2019; as utilized herein can be referred to as an MCU (for &#x2018;microcontroller unit&#x2019;) and can be implemented as a small computer on a single metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip. A microcontroller or MCU can contain one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of, for example, ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM may be included on the chip, as well as a small amount of RAM. An example of a microcontroller is the MCU <b>37</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, arrow <b>24</b> represents a request to change a setting (or feature) associated with the energy meter. This request can be received by the energy meter <b>10</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>26</b>, and transmitted to the access controller <b>22</b>. Such a request may involve a request for access to the firmware associated with the energy meter <b>10</b>. The access controller can permit access to such firmware, in response to determining that the request relates to a certified feature. Such firmware may operation or process one or more features or functions as function <b>16</b>, function <b>18</b>, function <b>20</b>, and so on.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Assuming, for example, that a function or component such as function <b>16</b>, for example, is certified, the access controller would allow access to function <b>16</b> in response to the request. Assuming, however, that that function <b>18</b> is not certified, the access controller may not allow access to function <b>18</b>. In this example scenario, the access controller <b>22</b> would receive the request for access to the firmware, and then deny access to the firmware, in response to a determination that the request relates to a non-certified feature.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Arrow <b>24</b> thus represents a request by a user (e.g., a customer) to change a setting of a feature or functionality associated with or more functionalities such as function <b>16</b>, function <b>18</b>, function <b>20</b>, etc. The information related to the request can be fed to the access controller <b>22</b> (also referred to as an &#x2018;ACCESS CONTROL object&#x2019;), which holds or maintains the bifurcation between the legally important or non-important features.

Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the disclosed method and system may be practiced with other computer system configurations, such as, for example, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, data networks, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, networked PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, servers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Note that the term module as utilized herein may refer to a collection of routines and data structures that perform a particular task or implements a particular data type. Modules may be composed of two parts: an interface, which lists the constants, data types, variable, and routines that can be accessed by other modules or routines, and an implementation, which may be private (e.g., accessible only to that module) and which can include source code that actually implements the routines in the module. The term module can also relate to an application, such as a computer program designed to assist in the performance of a specific task, such as implementing the steps, operations or instructions described herein.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">The method <b>180</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> can be implemented at least in part by a module (or group of modules). For example, the instructions, steps or operations depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> with respect to blocks <b>190</b>, <b>192</b>, <b>194</b>, <b>196</b>, <b>198</b>, and <b>200</b> can be implemented by a module such as the module <b>452</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">Similarly, the method <b>220</b> of data access control flow depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> can be implemented as a module or a group of modules. For example, the instructions, steps or operations depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> with respect to blocks <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, and <b>238</b> can be implemented by a module such as the module <b>452</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The access controller <b>22</b> may also be implemented by or as a module.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">It will be appreciated that variations of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. It will also be appreciated that various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
