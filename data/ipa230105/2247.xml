In the illustrated implementation, system <b>100</b> is implemented on a trailer <b>102</b> that includes at least one set of wheels <b>104</b>, so that the trailer <b>102</b> can travel around on the wheels <b>104</b> to any desired location. The trailer <b>102</b> can be connected to a vehicle, such as a truck, SUV, etc., so that the trailer <b>102</b> can be towed to the desired location. In some implementations, the trailer <b>102</b> has a width of about 6 feet (2 meters), a length of about 8 feet (2.7 meters), and a height of about 6 feet (2 meters).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The system <b>100</b> further includes a storage tank <b>106</b>, a pump <b>108</b>, a tubing system <b>110</b>, and one or more faucets (or spigots) <b>112</b> that can be stored within the trailer. The pump <b>108</b>, the tubing system <b>110</b>, and the faucets <b>112</b> can form a water dispensing system <b>101</b> that is fluidly coupled to the storage tank <b>106</b>. Water from any source (such as a well, a river, a lake, a pond, a stream, floodwater, external spigots or faucets, rainwater, etc.) can be stored in the storage tank <b>106</b>. The storage tank <b>106</b> can have any suitable capacity, and may be selected based on the size of the trailer. The system <b>100</b> is able to dispense about 2,000 gallons per day, or about 7,570 liters. In some implementations, the storage tank <b>106</b> has a capacity of about 2,000 gallons, or about 7,570 liters. In other implementations, the storage tank <b>106</b> has a smaller capacity, but can be re-filled one or more times per day.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The tubing system <b>110</b> is fluidly coupled to at least the storage tank <b>106</b>, the pump <b>108</b>, and the faucets <b>112</b>. The pump <b>108</b> can be operated to transport the water through the tubing system <b>110</b>, from the storage tank <b>106</b> to the faucets <b>112</b>. The faucets <b>112</b> are positioned at the end of the tubing system <b>110</b>, where users of the system <b>100</b> can access the water. The pump <b>108</b> can include any suitable type of pump, and can include one pump or a plurality of pumps. In some implementations, the pump <b>108</b> is a &#xbe; horsepower pump. The tubing system <b>110</b> can include any number of tubes in any length as required to transport water through the system <b>100</b> to the faucets <b>112</b>. The tubes can be plastic, metal, or any other suitable material. The faucets <b>112</b> can include any suitable number of faucets. In some implementations, faucets <b>112</b> includes four faucets spaced apart so that four different people can simultaneously use the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The system <b>100</b> further includes a solar panel <b>114</b> that is attached to the trailer <b>102</b>. The solar panel <b>114</b> converts sunlight into electrical energy that is used to power various components of the system <b>100</b>, including the pump <b>108</b>. The electrical energy produced by the solar panel <b>114</b> can directly power the components of the system <b>100</b>, but can additionally or alternatively be stored in one or more batteries that may be located on the trailer <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the solar panel <b>114</b> has a generally rectangular shape, with a first dimension of about 9 feet (3 meters), and a second dimension of about 12 feet (3.7 meters). The solar panel <b>114</b> is able to produce enough electricity to power the system <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the solar panel <b>114</b> is a 5 kW solar panel, and the system <b>100</b> uses about 5 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, the solar panel <b>114</b> is movably attached to the trailer <b>102</b>, so that the solar panel <b>114</b> can move between a stowed position and a deployed position. The solar panel <b>114</b> can be moved to the stowed position when the system <b>100</b> is being transported (e.g., when the trailer <b>102</b> is attached to a vehicle and towed to a desired location), and then moved to the deployed position once the system <b>100</b> is in the desired location. In the stowed position, the solar panel <b>114</b> is positioned generally horizontal on top of the trailer <b>102</b>. In the deployed position, the solar panel <b>114</b> is generally extended away from the top of the trailer <b>102</b>, and is positioned at an angle relative to the top of the trailer <b>102</b>. In the deployed position, the solar panel <b>114</b> is positioned at a desired angle such that as much sunlight is possible is incident on the solar panel <b>114</b> at a desired angle. In some implementations, the solar panel <b>114</b> is attached to the trailer <b>102</b> via telescoping rods that are extended to move the solar panel <b>114</b> to the deployed position. The solar panel <b>114</b> can be rotatably attached to distal ends of the telescoping rods to allow the angle of the solar panel <b>114</b> to be adjusted. In the deployed position, the highest point of the solar panel <b>114</b> is about 9 feet (3 meters) high.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, the trailer <b>102</b> includes one or more motors that can be operated to move the solar panel <b>114</b> between the stowed position and the deployed position. The one or more motors can also be operated to move the solar panel <b>114</b> through various angles relative to the sunlight when in the deployed position. In some implementations, the one or more motors are operated manually. In some implementations, the one or more motors can be operated automatically. For example, the trailer <b>102</b> may include a device that determines the position of the sun in the sky, and causes the one or more motors to move the solar panel <b>114</b> to a desired angle relative to the position of the sun. This device (sometimes referred to as a sunfinder or a solar tracker) can include a GPS unit and one or more processing devices. In some implementations, the one or more motors are incorporated into the device. In some implementations, the device includes one or more actuators (such as hydraulic cylinders) that can be operated to move the solar panel <b>114</b>. In some implementations, the weight of the trailer <b>102</b> and the solar panel <b>114</b> is about 2,000 kg (about 4,444 pounds). The system <b>100</b> generally includes one or more batteries to store electrical energy generated by the solar panel <b>114</b>. Further, while generally referred to as a singular solar panel <b>114</b>, solar panel <b>114</b> may actually be a plurality of solar panels.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations, the solar panel includes a tracking mechanism that can track the position of the sun and automatically move the solar panel to track the sun. The tracking mechanism can be an active tracking mechanism or a passive tracking mechanism. An active tracking mechanism includes a mechanical structure driven by a motor, and one or more sensors. The solar panel is mounted on the mechanical structure, and when the sensors detect the position of the sun, the motor can be driven to move the solar panel to track the sun. A passive tracking mechanism can use a gas system to move the solar panel. The solar panel is mounted on a mechanical structure that is filled with gas. The gas is heated by the sunlight and expands, which causes the mechanical structure to move the solar panel and track the sun. As the sun moves, the gas cools down and contracts, which again causes the solar panel to move and track the sun. Generally, the tracking mechanism is configured to move the solar panel so that the amount of sunlight that is incident on the solar panel at the desired angle is kept at high levels at all times, or at most of the time.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The system <b>100</b> further includes a water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> that is fluidly coupled to some combination of the storage tank <b>106</b>, the pump <b>108</b>, the tubing system <b>110</b>, and the faucets <b>112</b>. The water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> includes a variety of different filtering and treatment mechanisms used to remove particulate matter, pathogens, chemicals, etc. from the water. In the illustrated implementation, the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> includes a screening filter <b>116</b>, a sand filter <b>118</b>, a sediment filter <b>120</b>, a carbon filter <b>122</b>, a water softener <b>124</b>, a reverse osmosis filter <b>126</b>, a granular activated carbon (GAC) filter <b>128</b>, and an ultraviolet (UV) filter <b>130</b>. These filters are used to remove undesirable solids, particulates, chemicals, etc. from the water source, before being dispensed to users through the faucets <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> also includes pre-filters that perform an initial amount of filtering before the water from the source is stored in the storage tank <b>106</b>. The tubing system <b>110</b> is used to transport the water from the storage tank <b>106</b>, through the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>, and to the faucets <b>112</b>. The system <b>100</b> may include a variety of sealing components (such as o-rings) positioned at the junctions between different components (for example, where tubing connects to one of the filters) to minimize the amount of water lost during use of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> is generally compliant with all applicable regulations, including those issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In some implementations, the water is retrieved from a source (such as a well, a river, a lake, a pond, a stream, floodwater, external spigots or faucets, rainwater, etc.), and then passed through the filters of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>. The filtered and treated water can then be stored in the storage tank <b>106</b>. In other implementations, the storage tank <b>106</b> may comprise multiple separate storage tanks. One of these storage tanks is a raw water storage tank that stores water before it is filtered and treated, and the other storage tank is a purified water storage thank that stores water after the water has been filtered and treated. In some implementations, the water passes through a portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> and is stored in the storage tank <b>106</b>. Then, as the water is dispensed from the storage tank <b>106</b> to the users, the water passes through the rest of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The screening filter <b>116</b> is a mechanical filter designed to filter out larger objects, such as rocks, sticks, branches, leaves, grass, dirt, etc. The screening filter <b>116</b> can include a screen with openings large enough to be visible to the human eye. The sand filter <b>118</b> includes a volume of sand that the water filters through. In some implementations, the sand filter <b>118</b> is a 20-micron sand filter, which may be capable of removing about 85% of material that is 20 microns or larger, or removing about 99.9% of material that is 20 microns or larger.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The sediment filter <b>120</b> is generally a mechanical filter formed from a membrane having openings defined therein. The openings are smaller than the individual particles to be filtered out. In some implementations, the sediment filter <b>120</b> is a 5-micron filter, which is designed to remove matter that is 5 microns or larger. In some implementations, the 5-micron sediment filter removes about 85% of the matter that is 5 microns or larger. In other implementations, the 5-micron sediment filter removes about 99.9% of the matter that is 5 microns or larger. The sediment filter <b>120</b> can be formed from a variety of different materials, such as string, cord, polypropylene, polyester, cellulose, ceramic, glass fiber, cotton, etc. The carbon filter <b>122</b> uses carbon to unwanted material from the water. In some implementations, the carbon filter <b>122</b> uses charcoal to filter the water.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The water softener <b>124</b> is used to remove metal ions from the water, such as calcium and magnesium. In some implementations, the water softener <b>124</b> uses ion-exchange materials, which donate sodium ions or potassium ions to the water in exchange for the metal cations. In these implementations, the ion-exchange material can include ion-exchange resin formed into bead shapes. In some of these implementations, the water softener <b>124</b> is a duplex system that contains two reservoirs of the ion-exchange material. Only the first reservoir of ion-exchange material is initially used to soften the water, and once the ion-exchange material in the first reservoir is exhausted, the first reservoir can be swapped with the second reservoir. The ion-exchange material in the second reservoir is then used to soften the water while the ion-exchange material in the first reservoir is recharged. The first reservoir and the second reservoir can continue to be alternated in this fashion, such that the water softener <b>124</b> does not have to be taken offline. In other implementations, the water softener <b>124</b> can uses a variety of different techniques or substances to soften the water, such as lime, chelating agents, washing soda (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), or distillation techniques.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The reverse osmosis filter <b>126</b> uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions and other molecules from the water. In the reverse osmosis filter <b>126</b>, the water is forced through a semipermeable membrane, which removes solutes dissolved in the water. The semipermeable membrane generally includes holes that are about 0.0001 microns in diameter. After the water passes through the reverse osmosis filter <b>126</b>, the water can be storage in the storage tank <b>106</b> until it is ready to be dispensed. When the water is dispensed, it passes through the GAC filter <b>128</b> and the UV filter <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The GAC filter <b>128</b> uses granulated activated carbon to remove unwanted material from the water. Generally, the GAC filter <b>128</b> is made from organic material that have a high concentration of carbon, such as coconut shells, coal, wood, lignite (sometimes referred to as brown coal), and/or petroleum products. The organic material in the GAC filter <b>128</b> will have pores of a certain size that remove material from the water. In some implementations, the GAC filter <b>128</b> is a 5-micron GAC filter, which may be capable of removing about 85% of material that is 5 microns or larger, or removing about 99.9% of material that is 5 microns or larger.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The UV filter <b>130</b> uses UV light to destroy living organisms in the water, such as bacteria and viruses. The UV filter <b>130</b> generally includes a UV lamp housed in a quartz sleeve. The UV light emitted by the UV lamp can have a wavelength in a range of between about 10 nanometers and about 400 nanometers. In some implementations, the UV lamp emits UV-C light, which has a wavelength between about 254 nanometers and about 265 nanometers. In some implementations, the UV lamp emits light that has a wavelength of about 254 nanometers. The UV light has sufficient energy to destroy any living organisms in the water, so that the organisms cannot reproduce and spread in the water. Example organism that can be destroyed using the UV filter <b>130</b> include <i>Cryptosporidium, Giardia</i>, dysentery bacilli, <i>Salmonella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus, E. coli</i>, hepatitis B, cholera, algae, fungi, and some viruses.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, the tubing system <b>110</b> includes a variety of different portions that fluidly couple together different components of the system <b>100</b>. A first portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> can be fluidly coupled to a first portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>. One end of the first portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> can be immersed in the water of the water source (e.g., into a river or a lake), while the other end of the first portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> is coupled to the first portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>. In turn, the first portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> can be fluidly coupled to the storage tank <b>106</b> via a second portion of the tubing system <b>110</b>, and the storage tank <b>106</b> can be fluidly coupled to a second portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> via a third portion of the tubing system <b>110</b>. Thus, water from the water source travels through the first portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> before being stored in the storage tank <b>106</b>. This water then travels through the second portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> before being dispensed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> can include the screening filter, the sand filter <b>118</b>, the sediment filter <b>120</b>, the carbon filter <b>122</b>, the water softener <b>124</b>, and the reverse osmosis filter <b>126</b>. The second portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> can include the GAC filter <b>128</b> and the UV filter <b>130</b>. The second portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> is fluidly coupled to the faucets <b>112</b> via a fourth portion of the tubing system <b>110</b>. The pump <b>108</b> can be fluidly coupled in-line at any point within the system <b>100</b> to pump water through the system <b>100</b>. In some implementations, pump <b>108</b> includes multiple pumps that can be placed at different points within the system <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the tubing system <b>110</b> includes individual tubing segments between each of the components of the first and second portions of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>, to allow water to flow therethrough. Each portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> can include one or more tubes.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> is designed to remove a variety of different matter from the water, such as sand, silt, rust, pathogens (such as bacteria or protozoa), chemicals (including organic chemicals), disinfection byproducts, organic contaminants (such as chlorinated solvents), pesticides, arsenic, lead, mercury, chromium, copper, uranium, and other materials.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The trailer <b>102</b> may include any combination of the illustrated components of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>. For example, in some implementations the trailer <b>102</b> includes the screening filter <b>116</b>, and the sand filter <b>118</b>, and the sediment filter <b>120</b>. In other implementations, the trailer <b>102</b> may include these components, as well as the carbon filter <b>122</b>, the water softener <b>124</b>, the GAC filter <b>128</b>, and the UV filter <b>130</b>. In further implementations, the trailer <b>102</b> further includes the reverse osmosis filter <b>126</b>. In some implementations, the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> may include additional chemicals that can be added to the water, such as chemicals that cause smaller particles within the water to stick together and form larger particles, which are then more easily filtered out of the water.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The system <b>100</b> can be adapted to collect water from a variety of sources. For example, in some implementations, the first portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> can be used to collect water simply by placing an end of the first portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> into a natural water source (e.g., into a well, a river, a lake, a pond, a stream, floodwater etc.). In other implementations, the end of the first portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> can be coupled to an artificial water source (such as a faucet or spigot), for example by screwing onto the faucet. In some implementations, the tubing system <b>110</b> may have multiple first portions, where one is used to collect water from a natural water source and another is used to collect water from an artificial water source. In other implementations, the tubing system <b>110</b> may only have a single first portion, which can be placed into a natural water source (e.g., into a well, a river, a lake, a pond, a stream, floodwater etc.), but also coupled to an artificial water source that may require such coupling (such as a faucet or a spigot). The system <b>100</b> may also include additional components that aid in collecting water from other sources. For example, the system <b>100</b> may include a plurality of basins that can be used to collect rainwater. The basins can be fluidly coupled to the first portion of the tubing system <b>110</b>, the additional portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> (if such additional portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> exists), and/or the first portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> can also include storage for a variety of different components, including filters, replacement parts, etc. This storage can be formed on the trailer <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the trailer <b>102</b> also stores components needed for real-time monitoring of the system <b>100</b>, and testing of the water after it travels through the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>. For example, the system <b>100</b> can include a pH meter to test the pH of the water, and various materials to adjust the pH of the water may also be stored directly on the trailer <b>102</b> itself. The system <b>100</b> may also include a variety of drainage component designed to catch any water that exits the faucets <b>112</b> but is inadvertently not collected by the users. The system <b>100</b> could also include an electronic chlorine dosing pump to provide residual post-treatment disinfection of the water. The system <b>100</b> can also include an automated backwash function that ensures timely cleaning of the various filters in the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>. The backwash system flows water through the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> in reverse order to clean the filters. The backwash interval can be adjusted based on the quality of the source water.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some implementations, all of the components of the system <b>100</b> that come into contact with water are formed from food-grade materials. In some implementations, the food-grade material includes silicone, nylon, acetal, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene fluoride, or combinations thereof. Other materials can also be used. In some implementations, any components of the system <b>100</b> that comes into contact with the water after the water has been fully filtered and treated (e.g., after the water has passed through all of the filters and the water softener) are made from food-grade materials. In these implementations, any portion of the storage tank <b>106</b>, the pump <b>108</b>, at least a portion of the tubing system <b>110</b>, and the faucets <b>112</b> can be made from food-grade material.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In operation, the trailer <b>102</b> can be towed to a suitable source of water and parked, where the solar panel <b>114</b> is deployed. Water can begin to be collected from the source and stored in the storage tank <b>106</b>. Generally, between about 30 minutes and 2 hours elapses until enough water has been collected, and the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b> can be activated. The treatment process generally takes a maximum of about 1 hour before the filtered and treated water can be dispensed through the faucets <b>112</b>. The maximum flow rate of water through the faucets <b>112</b> is about 1.5 gallons per minutes. The maximum amount of water that can be filtered and dispensed is about 2,000 gallons per day.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some implementations, the system <b>100</b> can include additional or alternative energy sources. For example, the system could include any number of small wind turbines/fans that can convert wind to electrical energy. The system could also include any number of small water turbines that convert moving water to electrical energy. Water turbines may be particularly useful if the system <b>100</b> is deployed near a river. In still other implementations, the system <b>100</b> could include components necessary for manual production of energy, such as a human-operated crank. In any of these implementations, the system <b>100</b> may include one or more small electromagnetic generators that can be coupled to the turbines (or the human-operated crank) to produce the electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some implementations, one or more of the components of the system <b>100</b> can be removable from the trailer <b>102</b> itself. For example, the pump <b>108</b>, the faucets <b>112</b>, and at least a portion of the tubing system <b>110</b> can be removed from the trailer <b>102</b> and positioned outside of the trailer <b>102</b> when the system <b>100</b> is operation. This allows users to dispense water at the faucets <b>112</b> without actually entering the trailer <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate different implementations of the system <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes a single solar panel <b>114</b> mounted onto the trailer <b>102</b> via telescoping rods <b>132</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> also illustrates a dispensing housing <b>134</b>, which can house at least a portion of the water dispensing system <b>101</b>. In the illustrated implementation, the dispensing housing <b>134</b> houses the faucets <b>112</b> and at least a portion of the tubing system <b>110</b>. The dispensing housing <b>134</b> can also house the pump <b>108</b>, and in some implementations some portion of the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes three different solar panels <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B, and <b>114</b>C mounted to the trailer <b>102</b> via a single mounting post <b>136</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the system includes three different solar panels <b>114</b>D, <b>114</b>E, and <b>114</b>F that extend both on one side of the trailer <b>102</b>, and above the top of the trailer <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Thus, system <b>100</b> provides a mobile, solar-powered water purification, treatment, and dispensing system that can provide clean water for multiple users. The system <b>100</b> allows for easy collection and purification of the water via the storage tank and the water filtration and treatment system <b>115</b>, which includes a multi-stage purification system. The system <b>100</b> also include multiple faucets for easy dispensing to multiple users, which allows water to be collected and used for a variety of purposes, including washing, rinsing, filling of drinking containers, etc. All of the components needed for the collection, purification, and dispensing of the water can be contained within a trailer that can be towed to any desirable location.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although the disclosed embodiments have been illustrated and described with respect to one or more implementations, equivalent alterations and modifications will occur or be known to others skilled in the art upon the reading and understanding of this specification and the annexed drawings.
