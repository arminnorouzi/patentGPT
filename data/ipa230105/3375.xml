Such an arrangement provided visibility to the helmet and wearer of the helmet. Visibility may be desirable for rescue helmets, fire helmets, police helmets, military helmets, vehicle (motorcycle, bicycle) helmets or sports helmets, for example and without limitation. The basic arrangement of lights, wiring, controllers and batteries can be the same as or similar to those described in Applicant's U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,845,816; 8,192,043 and 8,608,333, the entireties of which are incorporated by reference herein. The basic arrangements disclosed in those patents can be modified as described below.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0000">Helmet with Integrated Lighting System</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> illustrate a helmet with an integrated lighting system <b>10</b> can include a plurality of lights, which can comprise one or more solid (non-flashing or non-strobe) lights <b>12</b> and one or more strobe lights <b>14</b>. For example, the helmet <b>10</b> can include seven (or another number of) solid lights <b>12</b>, which can be oriented in a diamond shape, and four strobe lights <b>14</b>. The solid lights <b>12</b> can be positioned in pairs on the top and each side of the helmet <b>10</b>. The strobe lights <b>14</b> can be positioned on a front, rear and each side (e.g., rearward side) of the helmet <b>10</b>. However, other numbers and/or orientations of the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can be used. In some configurations, the helmet <b>10</b> includes one or more headlights <b>16</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, the helmet <b>10</b> includes a headlight <b>16</b> on each side of the helmet <b>10</b>. The headlights <b>16</b> can pivot relative to the helmet <b>10</b> about one or more axes of rotation, such as a horizontal and/or vertical axis. Each of the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> can comprise any suitable light source, such as one or more light emitting diodes or devices (LED), for example and without limitation. The lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> can be any suitable color, such as green for the solid lights <b>12</b> and white for the strobe lights <b>14</b> and headlights <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">The illustrated helmet <b>10</b> includes user interfaces, such as three button switches <b>18</b>. In other arrangements, other numbers of switches <b>18</b> can be provided depending on, for example, the number of systems or components employed or the number of systems or components for which individual control is desired. In the illustrated arrangement, the switches <b>18</b> comprise one switch for headlights <b>16</b>, one switch for green lights <b>12</b>, and one switch for strobe lights <b>14</b>. Other suitable controls can be provided in addition or in the alternative. For example, a remote control can be provided and, in some configurations, can be configured for connection to the user's wrist, like a watch or sleeve. If desired, the helmet <b>10</b> (or other system or shell disclosed herein) can be configured for connection to a smart device (e.g., phone, watch or tablet) or other connectable device capable of communication and control of the helmet <b>10</b> via a suitable protocol (e.g., Bluetooth or another wireless protocol). In some configurations, one or more features of the helmet <b>10</b> can be configured to be activated in response to input received by a sensor, such as a motion, light, touch (e.g., capacitive) or water sensor, for example and without limitation. In some configurations, such as helmets <b>10</b> intended for sports applications (e.g., hockey and football), one or more features (e.g., one or more lights) of the helmet <b>10</b> can be activated in response to an impact force received by the helmet <b>10</b> or a wearer of the helmet <b>10</b>. For example, an accelerometer or acceleration sensor can be employed to sense acceleration events and a processor can be employed to determine impact forces resulting from the output of the accelerometer or other acceleration sensor. The remote control can be operated by a third person or can be operated by an automated system, which could incorporate sensors (e.g., proximity sensor). For example, the one or more features of the helmet <b>10</b> (e.g., one or more lights) can be configured to activate if the wearer of the helmet <b>10</b> crosses a line (e.g., a goal line) that incorporates a sensor configured to detect the helmet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">In the illustrated arrangement, the helmet <b>10</b> comprises multiple layers that enclose the lighting system such that the helmet <b>10</b> is waterproof. That is, the helmet <b>10</b> is capable of using the lighting system in a water environment. In the illustrated arrangement, the helmet <b>10</b> includes a structural layer or shell <b>20</b>, which can be the toughest or strongest layer of the helmet <b>10</b> and, in some cases, can provide a substantial portion or an entirety of the structure necessary to allow the helmet <b>10</b> to meet applicable impact or other standards for the intended purpose. In some configurations, the structural shell <b>20</b> includes openings <b>22</b> that accommodate the lights <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Preferably, the helmet <b>10</b> includes at least one additional layer on one or both sides of the structural shell <b>20</b>. In the illustrated configurations, the helmet <b>10</b> includes an outer cover layer <b>24</b> on the outside of the structural shell <b>20</b> and an inner cover layer <b>26</b> on the inside of the structural shell <b>20</b>. However, in other arrangements, one of the cover layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can be omitted. For example, the inner cover layer <b>26</b> could be omitted and the lighting system or portions thereof can be encapsulated between the structural shell <b>20</b> and the outer cover layer <b>24</b> in a manner similar to the arrangements disclosed in Applicant's related patents identified above. In the illustrated configuration, the outer cover layer <b>24</b> is spaced from the structural shell <b>20</b> at least a small distance to accommodate the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">The inner cover layer <b>26</b> is tight against an interior of the structural shell <b>20</b>, in at least some locations, and secures one or more of wiring, controllers or circuit boards and batteries in place on the inside of the structural shell <b>20</b>. For example, the inner cover layer <b>26</b> can be tight against the shell <b>20</b> except for intervening components, such as wiring, controllers, circuit boards or batteries. Although not shown, one or more of padding, foam or other energy absorbing or dissipating layers or materials, or other liner can be placed within the structural shell <b>20</b> and inner cover layer <b>26</b>. Such materials and arrangements are well-known in the art.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The structural shell <b>20</b> and additional layers <b>24</b> or <b>26</b> can be made from any suitable material or combination of materials. For example, in some configurations, the structural shell <b>20</b> can be constructed from a rigid material, such as a rigid plastic or composite (e.g., fiberglass or carbon fiber). In some configurations, one or both of the outer cover layer <b>24</b> and inner cover layer <b>26</b> is constructed in whole or in part of PETG material. Preferably, at least the outer cover layer <b>24</b> is clear to permit the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to be visible through the outer cover layer <b>24</b>. Portions of the outer cover layer <b>24</b> can be painted or otherwise covered with portions overlapping the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> left clear. Other suitable materials can also be used. In the illustrated arrangement, the PETG material is vacuum formed against the inside surface of the structural shell <b>20</b> to form the inner cover layer <b>26</b>. The PETG material is vacuum formed against a mold to create the outer cover layer <b>24</b>, which is then coupled to the structural shell <b>20</b> and/or the inner cover layer <b>26</b>. The outer cover layer <b>24</b> and inner cover layer <b>26</b> are coupled to one another, such as along the edges of the helmet <b>10</b> and at vent openings <b>28</b> of the helmet <b>10</b>, if present, to create a dust encased, waterproof casing for the lights and/or other electronics. Alternatively, the outer cover layer <b>24</b> and inner cover layer <b>26</b> can be coupled to the structural shell <b>20</b>. In either case, the space between the outer cover layer <b>24</b> and inner cover layer <b>26</b> is sealed to substantially inhibit or prevent the ingress of water into the space between the layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> at least for a desired service period within a water environment, which may be at least several hours, several days or longer. That is, the lights and/or other electronics can be encased between outer and inner layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of PETG or other suitable material. The lights and/or other electronics can be attached to or within openings <b>22</b> of the helmet shell <b>20</b> prior to the application of the outer and inner layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. In other arrangements, the PETG or other material of the outer and/or inner layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can be otherwise applied to the helmet shell <b>20</b>, such as by injection molding, for example and without limitation.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">In some configurations, a helmet similar to that described herein includes an outer skin of latex, rubber (or another suitable, preferably stretchable, material) that is permanently adhered or otherwise attached to the exterior PETG (or other material) layer of the helmet, which can include windows in the latex or rubber that conform to the shell. A conduit can permit air or another gas to be introduced into and evacuated from a space between the helmet exterior and the latex or rubber layer to allow the helmet to be partially or completely buoyant. The air or other gas can be introduced into or evacuated from the space manually or automatically (e.g., via a compressed gas charge triggered by a water sensor). In some configurations, a plurality of smaller inflation spaces are provided to provide the helmet with buoyancy, as described further below.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an interior of a helmet <b>10</b>, which includes one or more batteries <b>30</b>, one or more circuit boards <b>32</b> and wiring <b>34</b> that couples the batteries <b>30</b> and circuit boards <b>32</b> to one another and/or to the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The batteries <b>30</b> can be positioned at a rear of the helmet <b>10</b>. At least one circuit board <b>32</b> can be positioned at the top of the helmet <b>10</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, one circuit board <b>32</b> is positioned near or is integrated with a battery <b>30</b> at the rear of the helmet <b>10</b>. In at least some configurations, there is a charger port <b>36</b> at, for example, the rear of the helmet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> illustrate wiring diagrams for each of the solid lights <b>12</b>, strobe lights <b>14</b> and headlights <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> illustrate wiring diagrams for each light <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> as a separate circuit; however, in other configurations, two or more of the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> can be included in a single circuit or as an integrated electronic system, as described further below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a circuit for the solid lights <b>12</b> (illustrating one solid light <b>12</b> as an example) and includes a battery <b>30</b>, a DC protection board <b>32</b>, a switch or button <b>18</b>, a charger plug <b>36</b> and a resistor <b>40</b>. Electrical wiring <b>34</b> or other means of transmitting electrical signals connects the above-mentioned components. The DC protection board <b>32</b> protects the battery <b>30</b>, the lights <b>12</b> and possibly other components of the system from damage, such as voltage or current spikes or electrical shorts. The DC protection board <b>32</b> can also control charging of the battery <b>30</b>. The button <b>18</b> is a user interface or control that connects or disconnects the battery <b>30</b> to or from the lights <b>12</b> and allows a user to operate the lights <b>12</b>. The circuit includes a resistor <b>40</b> that can be selected to influence or determine the electrical current within the circuit.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a wiring diagram of the strobe lights <b>14</b>. The circuit of the strobe lights <b>14</b> is substantially similar to the circuit of the solid lights <b>12</b> described above. However, the strobe lights <b>14</b> are connected to the battery <b>30</b> and/or other portions of the circuit via a strobe microcontroller <b>32</b>, which can replace the resistor <b>40</b> of the prior circuit. The strobe microcontroller <b>32</b> is configured to operate the strobe lights <b>14</b>. In particular, the strobe microcontroller <b>32</b> can control the strobe function of the strobe lights <b>14</b>, or turn the strobe lights <b>14</b> on and off. One or both of the protection board <b>32</b> and the strobe microcontroller <b>32</b> can be configured to reduce or minimize power usage, as described further below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a wiring diagram of the headlights <b>16</b>. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is identical to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, except the solid lights <b>12</b> are replaced with the headlights <b>16</b>. Other suitable arrangements can also be employed, such as integrating portions of the separate circuits illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> illustrate a wiring diagram for the overall lighting system. The illustrated circuit includes a power source, such as one or more batteries <b>30</b>, a protection board <b>32</b><i>a</i>, a strobe microcontroller <b>32</b><i>b</i>, a switch or button <b>18</b> for each light <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, a charger plug <b>36</b> and one or more resistors <b>40</b>, in addition to the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, the power source comprises multiple (e.g., three) batteries <b>30</b>, such as three 3.7V batteries. However, other numbers or types of batteries could also be used, such as those described elsewhere herein or other suitable batteries or power sources.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">The strobe microcontroller <b>32</b><i>b </i>can be configured to control the strobe lights <b>14</b> in a manner to reduce power consumption and, therefore, increase battery life. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) can be used in controlling power output using a microcontroller. The strobe microcontroller <b>32</b><i>b </i>has many applications, including controlling the power of the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, PWM is used to control LED power, including fading out the LED strobe lights <b>14</b> for the strobe effect, rather than just turning them on and off. Advantageously, using PWM results in a very low power loss in the switching devices. When a switch is off there is practically no current, and when it is on and power is being transferred to the load, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. Therefore, utilizing PWM in controlling the strobe lights <b>14</b> allows the battery <b>30</b> to last longer per charge duty cycle. While it is possible to get PWM controls to work with LEDs using pure guess work, calculating the desired optimum values makes more efficient use of the available processor resources allowing both doing more with the microcontroller and/or controlling more LEDs simultaneously from the same chip.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a strobe light <b>14</b>, which comprises a board or substrate <b>50</b> that supports a plurality of individual LEDs <b>52</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, <b>24</b> individual LEDs are provided; however, in other arrangements, other numbers of LEDs or other light sources could be used. The strobe light <b>14</b> includes electrical wiring <b>54</b> and a connector <b>56</b> that permits the LEDs <b>52</b> to be connected to the electrical circuit of the lighting system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a solid light <b>12</b>, which comprises a board or substrate <b>60</b> that supports a plurality of individual LEDs <b>62</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, nine individual LEDs are provided; however, in other arrangements, other numbers of LEDs or other light sources could be used. The solid light <b>12</b> includes electrical wiring <b>64</b> and a connector <b>66</b> that permits the LEDs <b>62</b> to be connected to the electrical circuit of the lighting system.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a switch or button assembly <b>18</b> that can be used to activate the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The button <b>18</b> includes a body <b>70</b> having a button <b>72</b> and electrical contacts or connectors <b>74</b>. A retaining ring <b>76</b> is connectable to the body <b>70</b> (such as via a threaded connection) such that the structural shell <b>20</b>, outer layer <b>24</b> and/or inner layer <b>26</b> can be received between the body <b>70</b> and the retaining ring <b>76</b>. Accordingly, the button <b>18</b> can be coupled to the helmet <b>10</b>. The button <b>18</b> also comprises a cap <b>78</b> that can inhibit or prevent water, dirt or other debris from entering the button <b>72</b> or other working portions of the button assembly <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">An example of a lighted helmet <b>10</b> and process for constructing the helmet <b>10</b> is described below. As described above, in some configurations, a water proof helmet <b>10</b> comprises an inner layer <b>26</b> and an outer layer <b>24</b> that, in some configurations, encapsulate a stock helmet shell <b>20</b>. In other arrangements, only the inner layer <b>26</b> and the outer layer <b>24</b> can be provided, at least one of which has the desired structural characteristics of the shell <b>20</b> of the helmet <b>10</b>. In yet other arrangements, a shell assembly comprising the inner layer <b>26</b> and the outer layer <b>24</b> can be constructed as described below and configured for attachment to an underlying helmet <b>10</b>. Such a shell can cover an entirety or a portion of the underlying helmet.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The disclosure below is provided in the context of utilizing a stock helmet. However, the helmet <b>10</b> can also be constructed from the ground up utilizing one, two or all three of an inner layer <b>26</b>, an outer layer <b>24</b> and a helmet or structural shell layer <b>20</b>. The first step is to remove all inner linings and padding from the helmet <b>10</b>. Then, holes are cut in the helmet shell <b>20</b> in the desired location of the lights <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Preferably, the holes are just big enough to fit the particular light <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, yet sized so that the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> could be glued into place without being too loose in the openings.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The fitting of the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, batteries <b>30</b> and electronics <b>32</b> is done by any suitable arrangement. For example, the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are hot glued into the hole openings and the batteries <b>30</b> and electronic components <b>32</b> are strategically glued into the interior of the helmet shell <b>20</b>. The lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are brought to the surface of the open holes, but preferably do not protrude significantly further such that the outer layer <b>24</b> does not need to be space significantly from the shell <b>20</b> to accommodate the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">A mold is provided to create the outer shell <b>24</b> of the helmet <b>10</b> (the inner shell <b>26</b> is described later). To make the mold, the actual helmet shell <b>20</b> is filled with plaster. The outer helmet shell <b>24</b> needs to be bigger than the actual helmet so the actual helmet can be inserted into the shell. To hide a seam going across the top of the helmet, it is filled with a filler material (e.g., auto body putty) that hardens and is sculpted to create a smooth appearance on the outer shell <b>24</b>. When the sculpting was done a layer of &#x215b; inch styrene plastic is vacuum formed over the helmet <b>10</b> to create the space required between the actual helmet shell <b>20</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> required to slide the actual helmet shell <b>20</b> into the outer shell <b>24</b> as it is being worked on.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">At this point the mold was ready for vacuum forming of the outer shell <b>24</b>. The vent holes in the top of the actual helmet shell <b>20</b> were widened to allow room for the vacuum formed vent holes of the outer shell <b>24</b> to fit into the helmet <b>10</b> for sealing later. The outer shell <b>24</b> is vacuum formed in the mold using, for example, 0.090 inch thick PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) sheet material. PETG is a clear thermoplastic material. In some configurations, PETG is selected because of clarity for the lights <b>12</b>, <b>24</b> to shine through and for durability. After the outer shell <b>24</b> is vacuum formed, it is pulled off the mold and trimmed to &#xbd; inch beyond the edge of the actual helmet shell <b>20</b>. The outer shell <b>24</b> is left long for later trimming.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In some configurations, before anything else is done, the actual helmet shell <b>20</b> is drilled out for three light switches <b>18</b>, two head lights <b>16</b> and the visor <b>19</b>. In some configurations, the light switches <b>18</b> are mounted in line horizontally just behind the front side edge of the helmet shell <b>20</b> and the headlights <b>16</b> are drilled out at or near the bottom curve of the ear guard. In some cases, the headlight <b>16</b> on the right side of the helmet <b>10</b> is positioned forward of the light switches or buttons <b>18</b>. The light switches <b>18</b> are glued into the inside of the helmet shell <b>20</b> with the button portion of each switch <b>18</b> sticking through the wall of the helmet shell <b>20</b> and, ultimately, the outer shell <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The vacuum-formed clear helmet outer shell <b>24</b> is drilled out where the switches <b>18</b> line up on the helmet shell <b>20</b>. Similarly, the position for the headlights <b>16</b> will be where holes were drilled in the helmet <b>20</b>. Two through holes for screws for the headlight assemblies <b>16</b> to attach and a through hole for wires from the headlights <b>16</b> are drilled for each headlight <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">The headlights <b>16</b> can be off-the-shelf rotating LED lights that get customized. They are disassembled and the stock battery wiring will be replaced by a resistor and long leads that are later fed through the side of the helmet shell <b>20</b>. The spring assembly that allows the lights <b>16</b> to swivel is reworked. The central post on which the final assembly pivots, is cut down so the spring will fit over the post. The existing brass threaded insert is drilled and tapped for a larger screw (e.g., <b>2</b>-<b>56</b> threads) so a screw can be installed. This will become the pivot point of the light <b>16</b> and will hold the final assembly together.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">The electronics inside the customized headlight <b>16</b> are waterproofed with urethane, such as Ultralane <b>780</b>, a product of Specialty Polymers and Services, Inc. of Valencia, CA. Preferably, all wires and connections are covered, as well as the leads of the LED in the front of the case. Caution must be taken to position the wires sticking out so later they can be fed through the hole in the headlight assembly <b>16</b>. Next, a hole is drilled and tapped &#xbc; inch behind the pivot screw with 2-56&#x2033; threads to position the stop screw for the rotation of the headlights <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">A custom spacer piece <b>16</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) is utilized for mounting the headlights. The spacer can be a black anodized aluminum cylinder that is machined to allow room for the wire to move, room for the spring and a relief. The relief is machined to allow the headlights to rotate 120 degrees and stop at both ends of travel. Next a stainless steel 2-56&#x2033; socket-head machine screw is inserted into the bottom of the headlight <b>16</b> base. This screw will move in the relief slot and produce the stop for rotation of the headlight. A 2-56&#x2033; nut is turned onto the end protruding into the inner part of the headlight to secure the cap screw. Next the base of the headlight and the custom spacer piece and spring are assembled with another 2-56&#x2033; machine screw. This screw serves as the pivot for the headlight and holds the headlight and spacer piece together. The wires are fed down through a hole in the bottom part of the headlight and through a hole in the spacer. The spacer also has two 2-56&#x2033; tapped holes in the outside of the spacer so it can be assembled to the outside of the helmet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">To assemble the headlight assembly <b>16</b> onto the helmet <b>10</b>, in some cases, utilizes three more pieces. Two washers made from soft urethane and a flat washer made of brass. The urethane rubber washers have a hole for the wires that lines up with the hole in the custom spacer and clearance holes for 2-56&#x2033; screws. The brass outer washer has a clearance hole for 2-56&#x2033; screws and the wires. After this process, the headlight <b>16</b> is ready for assembly onto the helmet <b>10</b>. One rubber washer is placed between the assembly of the headlight <b>16</b> and headlight spacer <b>16</b> and the plastic outer shell <b>24</b> of the helmet <b>10</b>. The other rubber washer is lined up on the inside of the helmet <b>10</b> and the brass washer is lined up with the holes in the headlight assembly, the outside washer, the helmet, the inside rubber washer and the brass plate. The two wires from the headlight <b>16</b> are fed through the holes in all pieces to allow them to be connected to internal electronics later. Two 2-56&#x2033; screws are inserted through the clearance holes and threaded into the holes in the headlight spacer, these screws are tightened down and the headlight <b>16</b> is mounted onto the side of the helmet. This process is repeated for the headlight <b>16</b> on the other side of the helmet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">After the headlights <b>16</b> are secure, the three electronic button switches <b>18</b> that control the headlights <b>16</b>, the green lights <b>12</b> and the white flashing or strobe lights <b>14</b> are assembled onto the side right side of the helmet <b>10</b>. The button portion of the switches <b>18</b> are fed through the holes in the helmet shell <b>20</b> and outer shell <b>24</b>. The three switches <b>18</b> are positioned in the center of their respective holes and fastened together in line to hold their positions while being glued on the inside of the helmet shell <b>20</b>. The switches <b>18</b> are glued in position with a suitable glue or adhesive, such as 3M Scotch-Weld DP 605. This is a tough, polyurethane adhesive that has excellent impact resistance and cures in about 6 hours. The adhesive preferably is suitable to securely hold the buttons <b>18</b> from pushing into the inside of the helmet <b>10</b> when pressed. At this point the headlights <b>16</b> can be soldered to the leads in the wire harness and tested.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Before the inner shell <b>26</b> of the helmet <b>10</b> is vacuum formed, the headlights <b>16</b> and switches <b>18</b> preferably are sealed with urethane. This process keeps any water from coming in around the wires or through the buttons <b>18</b> or screws. A layer of sealant, such as urethane <b>780</b>, is applied to the inside of the headlights <b>16</b> covering the brass washers, screw heads and the hole where the wires are fed through to the inside of the helmet <b>10</b>. A bead of material is also applied around the switches <b>18</b> that were glued in previously to ensure that area is waterproof.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Next, the headlights <b>16</b> and electronic switches <b>18</b> are mounted onto the helmet shell <b>20</b> and outer shell <b>24</b>. The outer shell <b>24</b> has been trimmed to &#x215c; to &#xbd; inch beyond the lower edge of the helmet shell <b>20</b> and is ready to have the inside shell <b>26</b> vacuum-formed over the internal electronics. In some configurations, the edge of the outer shell <b>20</b> of the helmet <b>10</b> is covered with aluminum tape to keep it from distorting during the internal shell <b>26</b> vacuum form process. A mold is utilized to hold the helmet <b>10</b> during this process. This mold holds the helmet <b>10</b> inverted so the plastic can be pulled down into the helmet <b>10</b>. The helmet <b>10</b> is placed into the mold and clay is applied between the outer edge of the helmet <b>10</b> and the inner edge of the mold. This is to prevent the hot plastic from warping the edge of the outer shell <b>24</b> and to shape the edge of the vacuum formed piece for trimming.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Before vacuum forming the plastic into the inside of the helmet <b>10</b>, the wires are properly positioned or checked for proper positioning so no wires are laying over an area that will expose the wires to an area that will need to be sealed with urethane later. Hot glue can be used to position and hold wires in place during vacuum forming the interior of the helmet <b>10</b>. The holes to mount the visor <b>19</b> have been enlarged to allow for a nut and bolt to hold the visor on. This area will be assisted in the vacuum forming process so the inner shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> are actually touching each other. Such an arrangement allows the shells <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to be sealed together with a sealant (e.g., urethane) and creates a strong, relatively flat surface for the nut and bolt to tighten without creating stress between the layers of plastic. A sheet of, for example, 0.060 inch thick sheet of PETG or other suitable material is then drawn down into the helmet <b>10</b> by a vacuum forming process. Excess material around the edge of the inner layer <b>26</b> is trimmed off even with the trimmed edge of the outer shell <b>24</b>, each of which preferably extend beyond the edge of the helmet shell <b>20</b>. That is, during the vacuum forming process, the inner shell <b>26</b> has created a flange that matches up to the outer edge of the outer shell <b>24</b>. This area is then sealed, such as with a suitable adhesive (e.g., <b>780</b> urethane). In other configurations, the edges of the inner shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> can be sealed by other suitable processes, such as thermal or radio-frequency welding of the layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. In the mold for the outer shell <b>24</b> there are deep slots where the water vent holes are in the helmet shell <b>20</b>. During the vacuum forming of the internal shell <b>26</b> it is desirable to make sure the internal plastic shell <b>26</b> touches the inside of the external shell <b>24</b> at these points. This area is a sensitive area for later sealing with the urethane, other adhesive or other sealing process. Once the inner shell <b>26</b> is formed, the headlights <b>16</b>, wires <b>34</b> and switches <b>18</b> have been substantially sealed inside the inner shell <b>26</b> between the inner shell <b>26</b> and the helmet shell <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Before the sealing process between the shells <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> begins, the vent holes <b>28</b> in the top of the helmet <b>10</b> are pre-trimmed. This can be done by cutting a slot through where the inner shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> are in contact within the vent holes <b>28</b>. This operation creates the vents to later be widened a bit after sealing and creates a place where the <b>780</b> urethane or other sealant can be squeezed in between the inside shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> to seal the vent holes <b>28</b> of the helmet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">In some configurations, the perimeter of the inner shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell is sealed, such as by using an adhesive or other method to join the shells <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to inhibit or prevent entry of water or other foreign material between the shells <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. In some configurations, before mixing the A and B portions of the <b>780</b> urethane (for example and further references herein are also intended to cover other suitable sealants), a thickening additive, such as a fumed silica (also known as pyrogenic silica) sold under the tradename CAB-O-CIL&#xae;, is added to the mixture to make it less viscous. By thickening the mixture, the urethane doesn't run into the areas of the helmet <b>10</b> where it is not necessary. A needle syringe or other suitable applicator filled with the <b>780</b> urethane (for example) mixture and is inserted between the edges of the inner shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> where they come together (e.g., at the edges of the helmet <b>10</b> and within the vents <b>28</b>).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">As material is squeezed out of the syringe, it is dispensed along the outer edge of the helmet <b>10</b>. After the outer edge is sealed, the vents <b>28</b> are sealed&#x2014;or vice-versa. The needle bottle, syringe or other applicator tip is inserted between the inner shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> openings at the vents <b>28</b> and the <b>780</b> urethane is inserted watching to make sure the urethane is continuous along the perimeter of the vent <b>28</b> (or edge) such that it creates a seal. After material is inserted inside the helmet vents <b>28</b>, a bead of <b>780</b> urethane is applied around to individual vents <b>28</b> on the outside of the holes further sealing the inner shell <b>26</b> and the outer shell <b>24</b> at the vent holes <b>28</b>. In some configurations, the last area to be sealed is the button switches <b>18</b>. A very thin bead of <b>780</b> urethane (for example) is applied around the outside of the buttons <b>18</b> to assure the rubber covers (<b>78</b>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) are sealed.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">After allowing time for the urethane to set properly, preferably for a minimum of 24 hours, final assembly can begin. Three black vinyl rings (<b>76</b>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) are applied around the three button switches <b>18</b>. Black vinyl edging <b>29</b> (for example) is applied around the perimeter of the helmet <b>10</b>. Velcro is attached to the head padding and to corresponding locations on the inside of the helmet <b>10</b> to affix the padding to the helmet <b>10</b>. Other suitable methods can also be used.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Once trimmed, the location for the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> mounted into the helmet shell <b>20</b> are identified from the outside of the clear, vacuum formed outer shell <b>24</b>. This is done by placing tape around the lights. Next the area of the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is masked off on the inside of the tape that designates the internal space for the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The reason for this step is because the inside of the helmet <b>10</b> can be painted black or another dark color and the areas where the lights <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> shine through on the outer layer <b>24</b> preferably remain clear.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">The above-described process is in the context of a prototype or relatively low volume manufacturing environment. However, in higher volume manufacturing scenarios, the process can be modified as appropriate, such as by replacing vacuum molding of the shells <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> with injection molding.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Shell Mounted to Helmet</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0093">As described above, the lighting system can be in the form of a shell or module <b>100</b> that attaches to an underlying helmet <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>19</b></figref> illustrate a helmet <b>10</b> having a lighting system shell or module <b>100</b> coupled thereto.

The shell <b>100</b> can be self-contained. In some configurations, the lights, wiring, buttons or switches and headlamps are contained within or directly supported by the shell <b>100</b>. However, not all of the components are necessarily contained within or directly supported by the shell <b>100</b> that is on the exterior surface of the helmet <b>10</b>.

As described above, the system <b>200</b> comprises several components that make up an illumination system designed, in some configurations, to identify or indicate the presence of the wearer to other persons, as well as provide supplemental lighting for the wearer.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">One design specification of an embodiment of the system <b>200</b> is the protection of the components from the harsh elements that the users would likely experience in the performance of their duties. In some configurations, the system <b>200</b> is designed to be resistant to one or more of water and moisture, chemicals, heat, flame exposure and impact.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">Each of the main components of the system is encased in an enclosure <b>210</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>, which can be a urethane rubber material. In some configurations, this material is Ultralane <b>722</b> A/B from Specialty Polymers and Services of Valencia, CA. Ultralane <b>722</b> is a water-clear urethane based rubber with a Shore A hardness of about 75 when fully cured. The components (A/B) of the rubber are mixed according to manufacturer's instruction at a ratio of <b>1</b>:<b>1</b> by weight or volume. In order to achieve colored castings, the SO-STRONG and UVO family of pigments and dyes from Reynolds Advanced Materials, North Hollywood, CA can be used, for example. The ratio of dyes and pigments vary according to the amount of material being mixed and the color desired. Since the above-identified urethane rubber is water clear, the color is adjusted by sight during the mixing process to achieve the desired tone, as the curing process of the rubber does not significantly alter the color.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Preferably, each lighting component is full assembled, wired and tested for proper operation, as described above. A form is created that will produce the final desired shape of the component (e.g., light pod <b>202</b> or light strip <b>204</b>) once fully encapsulated. A tooling mold is made from the form to create a cavity that will accept the completed component. The silicone rubber mold is cured and the tooling form is removed. In other configurations, the tooling mold can be made without a form. For example, the mold can be machined in accordance with a CAD model of the component. In such an arrangement, the tooling mold can be made from a suitable material, such as aluminum. In some cases, the tooling mold may have a minimum of <b>1</b>/<b>16</b>th of an inch of additional clearance.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">In some configurations, the enclosure <b>210</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> or <b>218</b> is constructed as a single, unitary structure or by a single pour or injection into the mold. In such a configuration, the component can be suspended by any one of a variety of suitable means to center the component within the mold without touching the sides. Part B of the Ultralane urethane rubber is weighed out, dyes and pigments are added to areas where color and opacity are required. If component is to remain clear, the mixture is used as-is. Part A is added in a 1:1 ration AB mix. The material is mechanically mixed and then vacuum degassed to 29 inHg as per manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting degassed mixture is poured into the mold such that it surrounds the component. The assembly can then be left to cure for an appropriate period of time at an appropriate temperature (e.g., 2 hours at room temperature). The component and enclosure <b>210</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> or <b>218</b> assembly can be post-cured in a curing oven for an appropriate period of time at an appropriate temperature (e.g., a minimum of 2 hours at 100 Degrees F). The assembly can be cooled at room temperature for <b>24</b> hours to achieve final properties.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">Preferably, special attention is paid to the creation of the mold tools used in areas where clear/translucent properties are desired, such as in the areas from which lights will be emitted. The surface should be very clean and/or shiny in order for the clarity of the rubber to be suitable or optimum. Care preferably should be taken with respect to switches and moving components to adjust for the density of the urethane rubber in areas where buttons <b>18</b> must be operated through the rubber encapsulate in order that the function of the switches are not impaired. In areas where mobility and flexibility is desired, testing should be done to ensure that the rubber allows adequate flexibility. In some configurations, the buttons <b>18</b> can be partially exposed from the rubber encapsulate as long as a seal is maintained to an appropriate level for the desired application.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">Preliminary testing indicates that the Ultralane <b>722</b> urethane rubber will protect the interior components, when properly encapsulated, from water, and the rubber will not deform or self-ignite in tested levels of heat sufficient to meet rescue and fire helmet standards. The fully encapsulated component, cured as described, was submerged in <b>24</b> inches of plain tap water at room temperature for <b>48</b> hours. Sample was removed cloth-dried on the exterior and cut open. No moisture was readily apparent. A <b>2</b>&#x2033; cube of Ultralane <b>722</b> that was properly cured was placed on a wire metal rack inside a small oven. The oven was preheated to 500 degrees F. The cube was placed in the oven for 5 minutes. Sample removed and cooled. Sample exhibited a slight amount of discoloration around the edges. Sample remained in its original shape and did not auto-ignite under these testing conditions. The sample also did not auto-ignite when exposed to direct flame.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">In other configurations, the enclosure can be constructed in two (or more) parts or layers, or by two (or more) pours or injections into a mold by a process <b>400</b>. Such a process <b>400</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> for a light pod <b>202</b> or light strip <b>204</b>. However, the procedure can apply to other components of the system <b>200</b> and other enclosures <b>210</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> or <b>218</b>. With reference to block <b>402</b>, the dark or black tray element <b>233</b> (bottom surface portion of pod or strip lights <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>) is formed. For example, in one configuration, the mold cavities can be cleaned thoroughly with solvent and dried. A liberal, even coat of Ease-Release <b>2300</b> or other mold release can be applied to both surfaces of mold. In clean separate containers, a suitable amount (e.g., 30 grams) of both part A and Part B of S&#x26;S Ultralane <b>722</b> or another suitable material can be mixed. In Part B of the urethane material, a suitable amount (e.g., 1 gram) of a Silpak Black UD Dye or another suitable dye or colorant can be added and mixed thoroughly. Part A can be added to Part B and the combination can be mixed for a suitable amount of time, such as at least about 30 seconds, until the combination is well mixed.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">In some configurations, the mixture can be placed into a vacuum chamber for 1-3 minutes or until mixture has fully risen and fallen and majority of bubbles have been evacuated. The mixture can be removed from vacuum and poured slowly and evenly into the mold until the material fills the base, such as approximately &#x215b;&#x2033; full. A top or impression strip can be placed into the mold on top of the urethane material with one edge angled higher than the other to inhibit or prevent bubbles from becoming trapped underneath. Material may flow out into vents and possibly over the edges of the mold. Once the top is properly positioned, it can be secured in place. Excess plastic can be wiped from the edges of the mold where it has seeped out. The mold with the mixture can be placed into a drying oven for a suitable period of time (e.g., <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> hours) at a suitable temperature (e.g., 110 degrees) to assist in curing. Once fully cured, such as about 8-10 hours, the formed base <b>233</b> can be carefully removed from the mold. If necessary, excess flashing can be trimmed using scissors and/or a utility knife to form even, clean lines. Preferably, the base <b>233</b> is cleaned, such as with a 99% alcohol cleaner, to substantially or completely remove any mold release.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">The second stage of the casting is the clear or at least partially transparent lens section (the upper portion of the strips <b>204</b> and pods <b>202</b>). In summary, a suitable material (e.g., clear urethane) is poured into the mold with the black or other dark colored base <b>233</b>, over and onto the LED light strip <b>204</b> or pod <b>202</b>. The two sections will bond creating a durable, resistant assembly with the LED's completely encapsulated.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">In some configurations, the base <b>233</b> is mounted into the mold using, for example, &#xbd;&#x2033; double sided tape. Using the included adhesive or an applied adhesive on the LED strip <b>204</b> or pod <b>202</b>, mount the LED strip light <b>204</b> or pod <b>202</b> onto the base <b>233</b>, as illustrated at block <b>404</b>. In some configurations, the wires <b>230</b> will protrude from an edge of the mold configured to accommodate the wires <b>230</b>. It can be verified that the strip <b>204</b> or pod <b>202</b> is firmly adhered and flat to the base <b>233</b>, without any curling or gaps present.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">The exposed surfaces of the mold can be cleaned using, for example, a 99% alcohol solution or another suitable solvent. If desired, the mold can be sprayed to coat with a mold release product, such as ER <b>2300</b> mold release. A mixture of a suitable amount (e.g., <b>30</b> grams) of each of Part A and Part B of the Ultralane urethane plastic, or another suitable material, can be prepared as described above. However, in at least some configurations, the mixture is prepared without dye, taking care to not entrap bubbles. In some configurations, the mixture can be prepared with a dye or other colorant to produce a colored part. However, preferably, the color is selected such that the resulting enclosure <b>218</b> is at least partially transparent such that light can be transmitted from the light strip <b>204</b> or light pod <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">As illustrated at block <b>406</b>, the mixture can be poured, injected or otherwise introduced into the mold over the base <b>233</b> and light strip <b>204</b> or light pod <b>202</b>. The mixture can be allowed to stand a sufficient amount of time (e.g., <b>8</b>-<b>10</b> minutes) such that the assembly is cured enough to remove from mold. This standing time can be at room temperature without added heat. Flashing can be trimmed, if needed. The entire part can be cleaned with a suitable cleaner (e.g., a 99% alcohol solution) to remove substantially all mold release. The functioning of the light strip <b>204</b> or light pod <b>202</b> can be tested to verify that strip light is operating correctly. The assembly (enclosure <b>218</b>) can be assembled to other components of the system <b>200</b>, such as the components illustrated and described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">In the manufacture of the enclosure <b>218</b>, or other enclosures <b>210</b>, <b>214</b> or <b>216</b>, care should be taken to ensure bubble free castings (assuming poured moldings). Time under vacuum can vary depending on vacuum pump specifications and chamber size. With experience, a more defined measurement of the urethane mixture could be determined so the proper level with no overspill can be made consistently. In some configurations, finished pieces can be left in flat position to fully cure for a suitable period of time (e.g., <b>72</b> hours) to reach final performance specifications. The steps, times, temperatures, amounts and other specifics described above are exemplary in the context of the disclosed embodiment(s) and can be changed depending on the particular manufacturing method employed. Not all of the steps described above are necessary in all configurations&#x2014;some may be optional. The steps do not necessarily need to be performed in the order listed above. Ultralane <b>722</b>A/B is a presently preferred urethane casting resin available from SP&#x26;S, Valencia, Calif. This material is preferred because it is clear and has other desirable properties, such as fire/flame, impact and chemical resistance. Other suitable materials can also be used.

All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and protected by the following claims. Moreover, any of the steps described herein can be performed simultaneously or in an order different from the steps as ordered herein. Moreover, as should be apparent, the features and attributes of the specific embodiments disclosed herein may be combined in different ways to form additional embodiments, all of which fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0157">Conditional language used herein, such as, among others, &#x201c;can,&#x201d; &#x201c;could,&#x201d; &#x201c;might,&#x201d; &#x201c;may,&#x201d; &#x201c;e.g.,&#x201d; and the like, unless specifically stated otherwise, or otherwise understood within the context as used, is generally intended to convey that certain embodiments include, while other embodiments do not include, certain features, elements and/or states. Thus, such conditional language is not generally intended to imply that features, elements and/or states are in any way required for one or more embodiments or that one or more embodiments necessarily include logic for deciding, with or without author input or prompting, whether these features, elements and/or states are included or are to be performed in any particular embodiment.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0158">Moreover, the following terminology may have been used herein. The singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to an item includes reference to one or more items. The term &#x201c;ones&#x201d; refers to one, two, or more, and generally applies to the selection of some or all of a quantity. The term &#x201c;plurality&#x201d; refers to two or more of an item. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; means that quantities, dimensions, sizes, formulations, parameters, shapes and other characteristics need not be exact, but may be approximated and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting acceptable tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like and other factors known to those of skill in the art. The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; means that the recited characteristic, parameter, or value need not be achieved exactly, but that deviations or variations, including for example, tolerances, measurement error, measurement accuracy limitations and other factors known to those of skill in the art, may occur in amounts that do not preclude the effect the characteristic was intended to provide.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0159">Numerical data may be expressed or presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and thus should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also interpreted to include all of the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a numerical range of &#x201c;about 1 to 5&#x201d; should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 1 to about 5, but should also be interpreted to also include individual values and sub-ranges within the indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are individual values such as 2, 3 and 4 and sub-ranges such as &#x201c;about 1 to about 3,&#x201d; &#x201c;about 2 to about 4&#x201d; and &#x201c;about 3 to about 5,&#x201d; &#x201c;1 to 3,&#x201d; &#x201c;2 to 4,&#x201d; &#x201c;3 to 5,&#x201d; etc. This same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value (e.g., &#x201c;greater than about 1&#x201d;) and should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristics being described. A plurality of items may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary. Furthermore, where the terms &#x201c;and&#x201d; and &#x201c;or&#x201d; are used in conjunction with a list of items, they are to be interpreted broadly, in that any one or more of the listed items may be used alone or in combination with other listed items. The term &#x201c;alternatively&#x201d; refers to selection of one of two or more alternatives, and is not intended to limit the selection to only those listed alternatives or to only one of the listed alternatives at a time, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
