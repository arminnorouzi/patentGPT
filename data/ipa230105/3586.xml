To ensure a reliable thermal connection between the temperature sensor and the stator winding, the temperature sensor is attached to a mounting element with two struts.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The German patent application DE 10 2019 114 235 A1 relates to a method for initializing a temperature model of a friction clutch of a hybrid drive train of a motor vehicle with an electric machine with a stator and a rotor and a friction clutch arranged radially inside said electric machine, with an initial value of the friction clutch depending on the temperature of the electric machine is determined after a restart and used as a basis for the temperature model.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition to the model-based approaches to determining the temperature, which are therefore limited by the quality of the respective model, there is the possibility of directly measuring the temperature, of which the prior art mentioned above also contains examples.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thermistors, in particular NTC thermistors, are often used to measure temperature. The characteristic curve of these NTC thermistors, which indicates an output value, generally a voltage, as a function of the temperature, falls as the temperature increases, and the size of the gradient of the characteristic curve also decreases as the temperature increases. However, this means that the accuracy of the temperature determination from the output value of such an NTC thermistor decreases as the temperature increases, since the temperature change associated with a given change in the output value increases with increasing temperature. So, at higher temperatures, it becomes more difficult to resolve small temperature changes. NTC thermistors can be used in circuits which switch over at certain temperature values, so that a steeper characteristic curve is again available. In other words, such a circuit has the effect that the simple characteristic curve of an NTC thermistor is modified into a characteristic curve with a plurality of characteristic curve branches. In this case, each characteristic curve branch is assigned to a specific temperature range, and so a characteristic curve, namely the respective characteristic curve branch, with a sufficient gradient for determining the temperature, is available in each temperature range. What gradient is to be regarded as sufficient in each case depends on the respective accuracy requirements for the temperature measurement.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, the problem with the described approach is that more than one temperature value can be associated with an output value of a temperature sensor with a circuit of the type just mentioned. This is always the case when the output value in question occurs as an output value in more than one characteristic curve branch. It is then possible to detect temperature changes with sufficient accuracy, but it is not possible to say what temperature the temperature sensor is at.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is desirable to specify a method for temperature measurement and an associated system in which the problem of ambiguity in the output values of a temperature sensor, as just explained, is avoided.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method according to one exemplary embodiment of the disclosure relates to determining a temperature in an electric machine, for example in an electric machine of a motor vehicle. According to the method, a temperature-dependent output value of a first temperature sensor is determined. The first temperature sensor is assigned to the electric machine and has a characteristic curve with a plurality of characteristic curve branches, each characteristic curve branch being assigned to a specific temperature range. Each characteristic curve branch links a value of a temperature to an output value of the first temperature sensor. The assignment of the first temperature sensor to the electric machine means that the first temperature sensor is in thermal contact with the electric machine in order to ultimately measure a temperature of the electric machine.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A temperature-dependent output value of a second temperature sensor assigned to the electric machine is also determined. The assignment of the second temperature sensor to the electric machine means that the second temperature sensor is in thermal contact with the electric machine in order to ultimately measure a temperature of the electric machine. The output value of the second temperature sensor is used to determine a temperature range of the temperature ranges for the characteristic curve branches of the first temperature sensor, in which there is a temperature which corresponds to the output value of the second temperature sensor. The determination of this temperature range implies the selection of the characteristic curve branch corresponding to the temperature range. A temperature of the electric machine is then uniquely determined from the determined output value of the first temperature sensor and the characteristic curve branch selected in this way.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ambiguity of an output value of the first temperature sensor that exists according to the prior art is eliminated by including the output value of the second temperature sensor and the resulting selection of a temperature range and thus a characteristic curve branch. It should be noted that for the temperature determination carried out with the second temperature sensor to select the temperature range, a lower level of accuracy is sufficient than is sought for the temperature measurement with the first temperature sensor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The method is generally relevant to temperature measurements, but particularly for &#x201c;initial&#x201d; temperature measurements, such as when starting a technical system, since no information, such as from a previous temperature profile, is available to eliminate the ambiguity.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The method can be used in particular for temperature sensors in which the size of a gradient of each characteristic curve branch decreases as the temperature increases. The method can thus be used for temperature sensors based on an NTC thermistor, which include a circuit mentioned at the outset, which converts the simple characteristic curve of the NTC thermistor into a characteristic curve with a plurality of characteristic curve branches of the temperature sensor. Such a temperature sensor would be the first temperature sensor within the meaning of this application.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system according to the disclosure comprises an electric machine, a first temperature sensor and a second temperature sensor, which are assigned to the electric machine. The first temperature sensor has a characteristic curve with a plurality of characteristic curve branches, each characteristic curve branch being assigned to a specific temperature range. Each characteristic curve branch links a value of a temperature to an output value of the first temperature sensor.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system also comprises an evaluation unit that is configured to carry out the method described above. For this purpose, the evaluation unit has, for example, one or more processors and a memory in which instructions for the processors for carrying out the method are stored in the form of program instructions and parameters for the method. The evaluation unit can be implemented as a component of a more comprehensive control device for the electric machine, and can also use one or more processors and memories of this control device and can also be implemented entirely as software in such a control device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The disclosure and the advantages thereof are explained in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a characteristic curve with two characteristic curve branches.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a system according to the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The figures merely show exemplary embodiments of the disclosure and are therefore in no way to be construed as limiting the disclosure to the exemplary embodiments shown.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram <b>100</b>. Temperature T is shown on the x-axis <b>101</b> and an output value A of a first temperature sensor is shown on the y-axis <b>102</b>. The diagram <b>100</b> shows a first characteristic curve branch <b>103</b> and a second characteristic curve branch <b>104</b>. At a specific temperature U, a switchover is carried out between the characteristic curve branches <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>; the further progression of the characteristic curve branch <b>103</b> at temperatures greater than U is shown in dashed lines; this further progression is not used in determining a temperature to be measured. Accordingly, the characteristic curve branch <b>103</b> belongs to a temperature range <b>113</b> of temperatures lower than U, and branch <b>104</b> of the characteristic curve belongs to a temperature range <b>114</b> of temperatures higher than U.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As can be seen from the diagram, a unique temperature value T<b>0</b> belongs to an output value A<b>0</b>, since the output value A<b>0</b> only occurs on the branch <b>103</b> of the characteristic curve. On the other hand, the output value Al is associated with two temperature values, T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b>, since the output value A<b>1</b> occurs both on the characteristic curve branch <b>103</b> and on the characteristic curve branch <b>104</b>. Being unaware which of the characteristic curve branches <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> is to be used, meaning unaware of which of the temperature ranges <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> is the one currently valid, it is not possible to determine which of the temperature values T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> is the correct one for the output value A<b>1</b> of the first temperature sensor. According to the method according to the disclosure, an output value from a second temperature sensor, i.e., an independent second temperature measurement, is used in order to decide between the temperature ranges <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. Once the temperature range has been determined, it is also determined which of the characteristic curve branches <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> is valid. As a result, a decision can be made between the two options T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> for the output value Al and thus the temperature to be measured can be uniquely determined.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As one non-limiting example, the temperature ranges <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> together could cover a range from &#x2212;50&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., while the switchover could occur at 80&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should also be noted that the disclosure is not limited to the number of characteristic curve branches of the first temperature sensor being two. The disclosure also comprises embodiments with more than two characteristic curve branches, each with an associated temperature range, of the first temperature sensor. The temperature range present in each case, and thus the characteristic curve branch that is valid in each case, is determined by measuring the temperature with the second temperature sensor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of a system <b>10</b> according to the disclosure with an electric machine <b>3</b>, a first temperature sensor <b>1</b> and a second temperature sensor <b>2</b>.
