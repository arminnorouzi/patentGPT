end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The headings provided herein, if any, are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In many implementations of power amplifiers in wireless devices such as cellular phones, a power amplifier module being mounted on a phone-board often results in a load impedance presented to the power amplifier being quite different from a desired impedance (e.g. 50 Ohm). Such an impedance mismatch results in the power amplifier operating under a high voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) condition (e.g., high in-band VSWR). Such a high in-band VSWR condition often causes the power amplifier to oscillate, resulting in non-functionality or reduced-functionality of the power amplifier module.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Similarly, when a power amplifier is integrated in a front-end module with other components such as a filter and/or a duplexer, an out-of-band impedance (e.g., an impedance presented to the power amplifier outside of the corresponding frequency range) cannot be controlled accurately, or is difficult to control accurately. Such a situation leads to a high out-of-band VSWR being presented to the power amplifier, and the resulting high VSWR condition can cause the power amplifier to oscillate.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some techniques, improvement of in-band stability of power amplifier modules often involves adding more resistive loss in a radio-frequency (RF) signal path. Such a configuration typically leads to degraded collector efficiency in power amplifiers and increased DC power consumption. Other solutions include changing the values of bypass capacitors which can degrade memory effects in power amplifiers, typically resulting in reduced power capability for higher bandwidth modulations.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some techniques, and in an example context of a two-stage power amplifier, to obtain reduction of oscillations resulting from high out-of-band VSWR conditions, both inter-stage load-line and final stage load-line need to change. Unfortunately such a configuration can also severely impact the AMAM and AMPM characteristics of wide-band linear power amplifiers resulting in decreased linear power capability.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some implementations, the present disclosure relates to one or more circuit networks that can enable a power amplifier to operate under high in-band VSWR conditions and/or under high out-of-band VSWR conditions. In some embodiments, a power amplifier circuit having such network(s) can allow the power amplifier to operate under high in-band VSWR and/or high out-of-band VSWR conditions in a desirable manner in wireless applications such as 4G LTE and 5G designs.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a power amplifier circuit <b>100</b> that includes a power amplifier <b>102</b> and a VSWR management circuit <b>104</b> having one or more features as described herein. For the purpose of description, it will be understood that the VSWR management circuit <b>104</b> can be an assembly of one or more circuits.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is noted that various examples are described herein in the context of power amplifiers. However, it will be understood that one or more features of the present disclosure can also be implemented for other types of amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a conventional power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> configured to receive an RF signal at an input node RF_IN and provide an amplified RF signal at an output node RF_OUT. A power amplifier in such a circuit can include a first stage with a first amplifier transistor Q<b>1</b> and a second stage with a second amplifier transistor Q<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some embodiments, each of Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> can be a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and the first transistor Q<b>1</b> can receive the input signal at its base (e.g., from the input node RF_IN through a DC-block capacitance C<b>1</b>) and generate a partially amplified signal at its collector. The partially amplified signal from the collector of Q<b>1</b> can be provided to the base of Q<b>2</b> (e.g., through an inter-stage DC-block capacitance C<b>2</b>), and Q<b>2</b> can generate the amplified signal at its collector. The amplified signal from the collector of Q<b>2</b> can be provided to the output node RF_OUT through an output impedance matching circuit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a supply voltage for the first amplifier transistor Q<b>1</b> can be provided to the collector of Q<b>1</b> (e.g., VCC<b>1</b> through a choke inductance L<b>1</b>). Similarly, a supply voltage for the second amplifier transistor Q<b>2</b> can be provided to the collector of Q<b>2</b> (e.g., VCC<b>2</b> through a choke inductance L<b>2</b>). The supply voltages VCC<b>1</b> and VCC<b>2</b> may or may not be the same. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, although not shown, it will be understood that bias voltages can be provided to Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> through their respective bases.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> coupled to an antenna <b>22</b> for transmission of the amplified signal provided through the RF_OUT node. Typically, such an amplified signal passes through an RF component <b>20</b> before being provided to the antenna.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described herein, an impedance seen by the amplified signal (at the RF_OUT node, due to the antenna <b>22</b> and/or the RF component <b>20</b>, can be significantly mismatched from a desired impedance for which the amplified signal was generated. Accordingly, a significant value of VSWR can exist between the power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> and the RF component <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the wireless configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a wireless device <b>26</b> such as a cellular phone.

On such a phone board, a power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> can be provided, in the form of, for example, a semiconductor die, a packaged module, or some combination thereof. The phone board <b>24</b> also typically includes a matching circuit <b>20</b> implemented to be between the power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> and the antenna <b>22</b>. In such a wireless configuration, and by way of an example, a relatively high in-band VSWR of 6:1 between the power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> and the phone board matching circuit <b>20</b> is common.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the wireless configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a wireless device <b>26</b> such as a cellular phone.

The front-end module <b>28</b> also typically includes a filter <b>20</b> (e.g., a band-pass filter) implemented to be between the power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> and the antenna <b>22</b>. In such a wireless configuration, and by way of an example, a desirably low in-band VSWR of 2:1 between the power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> and the filter <b>20</b> is common; however, a high out-of-band VSWR of 10:1 between the power amplifier circuit <b>10</b> and the filter <b>20</b> is also common.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> show that in some embodiments, a power amplifier circuit <b>100</b> can include one or more VSWR management circuits <b>104</b> configured to provide one or more features as described herein.

In such an example two-stage configuration, a VSWR management circuit <b>104</b> can be provided on the input side of the second amplifier transistor Q<b>2</b> (as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), or on the output side of the second amplifier transistor Q<b>2</b> (as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).
