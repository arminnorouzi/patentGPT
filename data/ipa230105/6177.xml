OLED display apparatuses are very sensitive to water vapor and oxygen. In a case where the water vapor and oxygen enter the OLED display apparatus, organic materials of the OLED display apparatus are prone to decay, and thus a service life of the OLED display apparatus is shorten. Therefore, in order to prevent the entering of the water vapor and oxygen, it is necessary to encapsulate the OLED display apparatus, so as to prevent the entering of the water vapor and oxygen, thereby avoiding aging of the organic materials. As a result, the service life of the display apparatus is prolonged.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an aspect, a display panel is provided.

In this case, a color filter layer needs to be provided on the display substrate <b>101</b>. The color filter layer includes three types of photoresists (i.e., RGB photoresists) corresponding to three types of sub-pixels (i.e., RGB sub-pixels), so as to filter the white light emitted by the light-emitting devices <b>400</b> to convert the white light into light of three primary colors (i.e., light of RGB colors).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It will be understood that, in the case where the silicon-based backplane is used as the base substrate <b>300</b>, the plurality of light-emitting regions <b>011</b> may still include the red light-emitting regions R, the green light-emitting regions G, and the blue light-emitting regions B (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).

It will be noted that, the photolithography process typically refers to a process of forming a specific pattern by using a mask and removing photoresist. Forming the specific pattern includes coating a surface of a film with photoresist; exposing the photoresist; developing after exposing the photoresist; and etching regions of the film exposed by the photoresist, so as to form a required pattern.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The first inorganic layer <b>11</b> is made of a silicon nitride (SiNx) material, and may be manufactured by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) equipment.

In a manufacturing process of the color filter layer <b>121</b>, a process procedure and process parameters of the manufacturing process of the color filter layer <b>121</b> are particularly important, and fineness of the manufacturing process of the color filter layer <b>121</b> determines a resolution of a silicon-based display panel. Low temperature color filter technology is a color filter technology applied to the silicon-based display panel, which can achieve pixel processing accuracy of 1-2 microns. A problem of the low temperature color filter technology is that a low temperature curing process for curing the three photoresist materials (i.e., RGB photoresist materials) results in poor adhesion between the color filter layer <b>121</b> and the first organic layer <b>13</b>.
