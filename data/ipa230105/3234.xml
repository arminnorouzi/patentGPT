id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the general field of mounting on an aeronautical turbomachine, in particular a turbojet, the housing for driving accessories and associated pieces of hydraulic equipment, and it relates more particularly to a plate of pieces of equipment fixed to an accessory gearbox to form an accessories system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a turbojet, accessories such as pumps for production of hydraulic power, fuel supply and lubrication, electric generators for production of electric power, etc. are combined within a housing for driving (or relay) of accessories commonly called AGB (for &#x2018;Accessory GearBox&#x2019;) which is further enclosed by different pieces of equipment necessary for supply and servo-control of fuel or oil of the turbomachine but without mechanical link with the AGB. Such an accessory gearbox generally comprises one or more of the gear trains which are driven in rotation by power drawdown on a shaft of the turbojet and to which the different accessories are coupled.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These accessory gearboxes are generally mounted in the zone of the fan compartment of the turbojet. More precisely they are suspended on flanges formed on the metal housing for holding this fan compartment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, optimising the aerodynamic drag of the nacelle to limit the frontal surface of the nacelle means positioning pieces of equipment no longer in the nacelle (fan compartment) but in the so-called &#x2018;core&#x2019; compartment of the turbojet (see for example application FR2981986 in the name of the applicant), that is, an inter-channel compartment which separates the primary flow channel from the secondary flow channel of a dual-flow turbojet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, installation of all the pieces of equipment which have or do not have parts driven in rotation by the accessory gearbox raises another problem of the bulk of these pieces of equipment around this housing. This is the case in particular of pieces of fuel equipment, that is, those pieces of equipment which are typically assigned to the fuel circuit of the turbojet.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The main aim of the present invention is therefore to eliminate such a disadvantage by proposing a plate of pieces of hydraulic equipment which produces reduced bulk in the central compartment of the turbojet and therefore equally reduced weight for all these pieces of equipment. Another aim of the invention is to propose an accessories system incorporating an accessory drive gearbox which has fewer pieces relative to current solutions and therefore has a lower cost.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This aim is achieved by way of a plate of pieces of hydraulic equipment of an aeronautical turbomachine comprising channels for circulation of fluid entering and leaving each of said pieces of hydraulic equipment, characterised in that on the one hand it further comprises a support part of a housing body of each of said pieces of hydraulic equipment intended to receive fastening means to said pieces of hydraulic equipment and on the other hand a housing body part of at least one of said pieces of hydraulic equipment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an advantageous embodiment, the plate of pieces of hydraulic equipment intended to be fixed to an accessory drive gearbox, further comprises a part intended to be offset with respect to the accessory drive gearbox, said offset part of the plate allowing the fastening of pieces of hydraulic equipment on both faces.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, said pieces of hydraulic equipment are selected from the following pieces of equipment: a main fuel pump, a fuel dispenser, a main fuel filter, a fuel reheater, a main heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">When it comprises at least the main fuel filter, the housing body part of said hydraulic equipment is a base part of a bowl intended to receive a filter cartridge of the filter. It can therefore also comprise a differential pressure sensor (Delta/P) of the filter.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When it comprises at least the fuel reheater or the main heat exchanger, the housing body part of said hydraulic equipment is a lower part of the envelope of the reheater or of the exchanger intended to receive an exchange matrix. It can therefore also comprise a relief valve of the reheater or of the exchanger and a by-pass of the main heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">When it comprises at least the main fuel pump, the housing body part of said hydraulic equipment is a lower part of the pump body intended to support and guide a drive shaft of the pump.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention also relates to a system of accessories comprising a plate of pieces of hydraulic equipment such as described above, and an accessory drive gearbox on which the plate of pieces of hydraulic equipment is advantageously fixed in an offset manner.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will emerge from the description given hereinabove in reference to the appended drawings which illustrate an embodiment devoid of any limiting character and in which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an external view of an accessory drive gearbox mounted in the central compartment and to which a plate of pieces of equipment according to the invention is fixed,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an external view of a plate of pieces of equipment according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates, without its pieces of equipment, the plate of pieces of equipment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> mounted at the end of the accessory drive gearbox of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the network of internal channels and the different interfaces of the plate of pieces of equipment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an accessory drive gearbox <b>10</b> mounted in the central compartment (also known as &#x2018;core&#x2019;) of a turbojet and capable of integrating a plate of equipment according to the invention. Of course, the field of application of the invention can relate to types of aeronautical turbomachines other than a turbojet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">This type of accessory drive gearbox (or AGB) drives and supports for example, without this list being limiting, one or more electric generators <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, an alternator <b>16</b>, a lubrication group <b>18</b>, a starter <b>20</b>, a de-oiler <b>22</b> and other components (a hydraulic pump <b>24</b> for example) which constitute the pieces of auxiliary equipment of the engine and power generation of the aircraft. The housing <b>10</b> is coupled to the rotor <b>26</b> of the turbomachine by means of a radial transmission power shaft <b>28</b> via a corner return box <b>30</b>. The accessory drive gearbox <b>10</b> is typically suspended on a casing of the engine (not shown) via suspension links <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As is known per se, such a housing comprises one or more gear trains <b>36</b> which are each composed of several cogged wheels and which are driven in rotation by the radial transmission power shaft <b>28</b> coupled to the rotor <b>26</b> of the turbomachine. Each accessory is generally mounted against one of the lateral faces <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B substantially plane, of the housing <b>10</b> and comprises a drive shaft (for example <b>18</b>A) which is coupled to one of the cogged wheels (for example <b>36</b>A) of the gear train or gear trains. Apart from this support function for accessories, these lateral faces also ensure a support function for bearing, sealing or lubrication. During operation of the turbomachine, some of the mechanical power generated is withdrawn on the rotor <b>26</b> of the turbomachine and transmitted via the radial transmission power shaft <b>28</b> and the gear train or the gear trains <b>36</b> to the shafts for supplying the different accessories mounted on the housing <b>10</b> to drive them in rotation and accordingly actuate the function for which each of the accessories is intended.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the invention and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, it is intended that the pieces of fuel equipment are mounted on an independent plate <b>40</b> having two opposite faces <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B and one face of which is fixed in part to an end of a lateral face of the accessory drive gearbox <b>10</b> by fastening means <b>42</b> of bolt type for example, a part of this plate being offset from this accessory drive gearbox and therefore capable of receiving pieces of equipment on both faces (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Pieces of equipment fuel mean, without this list being limiting, the main fuel pump <b>44</b> (MFP), the fuel metering unit <b>46</b> (FMU), the main fuel filter <b>48</b> (MFF), the servo fuel heater <b>50</b> (SFH), the main heat exchanger <b>52</b> (MHX), the differential pressure sensor (Delta/P) of the fuel filter <b>54</b> (also called FFDP for &#x2018;Fuel Filter Differential Pressure sensor); (it is assumed here that this sensor is independent equipment and not an element of equipment, in this case the filter, in contrast to the relief valve or the by-pass, mentioned then). With the exception of the main fuel pump <b>44</b> which must be driven by the accessory drive gearbox <b>10</b>, the other pieces of equipment as above 46-54 offer the particular feature of not needing such driving and therefore distribution of power from the shaft of the turbomachine <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Combining the pieces of equipment fuel on the same plate, attached at an end of the accessory drive gearbox <b>10</b>, limits the support and the number of channels connecting these pieces of equipment. Furthermore, incorporating some of these pieces of equipment in the plate itself ensures maximal compacting of the installation or a certain gain in mass (for example of the order of 25%) as well as improved mounting/dismounting and maintenance.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates more particularly the plate <b>40</b> integrating all or some of these pieces of equipment in the region of its interfaces with these pieces of equipment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">More precisely, with respect to the fuel dispenser <b>46</b>, it is evident that, apart from the channels (not shown) for circulation of fluid entering and leaving the dispenser, the plate integrates a support <b>46</b>A (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the body of this dispenser intended to receive the fastening means plate/dispenser <b>46</b>B.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the contrary, with respect to the main fuel filter <b>48</b> it is evident that the plate also incorporates the channels <b>48</b>A for circulation of fluid entering and leaving for the filter cartridge of the filter and a support <b>48</b>B of the body of this filter intended to receive the plate/filter fastening means <b>48</b>C (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The plate further incorporates a part of the body of this filter <b>48</b>D (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), specifically the base of the bowl intended to receive the filter cartridge as well as the sensor delta/P <b>54</b>. On the one hand this transfer to the plate of the function of the fuel filter, and integration into the plate of the function of the sensor Delta/P, significantly contribute to a gain in mass.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Likewise, with respect to the fuel reheater <b>50</b> it is evident, apart from the channels <b>50</b>B for circulation of fluid entering and leaving the reheater and a support <b>50</b>C of the body of this reheater intended to receive the plate/reheater, that the plate incorporates fastening means <b>50</b>D (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), a part of the body of this reheater, specifically the lower part of the envelope <b>50</b>E (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the reheater intended to receive the exchange matrix of this reheater as well as its relief valve <b>50</b>A.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With respect to the main heat exchanger <b>52</b>, it is evident that, apart from the channels <b>52</b>C for circulation of fluid entering and leaving the exchanger and a support <b>52</b>D (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the body of this exchanger intended to receive the plate/exchanger fastening means <b>52</b>E (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the plate incorporates a part of the body of this exchanger, specifically the lower part of the envelope <b>52</b>F (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the exchanger intended to receive its exchange matrix as well as its relief valve <b>52</b>A and its by-pass <b>52</b>B.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For the two previous pieces of equipment, on the one hand transfer to the plate of the function of the fuel reheater or of the main heat exchanger, and integration into the plate of the function of the relief valve, significantly contribute to a gain in mass.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Finally, with respect to the main fuel pump <b>44</b>, it is evident, apart from the channels <b>44</b>A for circulation of fluid entering and leaving the pump, that the plate <b>40</b> incorporates a support <b>44</b>B (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the pump body intended to receive the plate/pump fastening means <b>44</b>C (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). It is clear that the drive shaft <b>44</b>D of the pump (seen in the exploded part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) passes through this plate <b>40</b>, and that in this way it ensures the centring (support and guiding) of this shaft <b>44</b>D intended to be connected to a sprocket of the accessory drive gearbox <b>10</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
