id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a resin composition for a solar cell encapsulant, a solar cell encapsulant, a manufacturing method of a solar cell encapsulant, and a solar cell module.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, the distribution of photovoltaic power generation as clean energy has been in progress. Photovoltaic power generation directly converts solar energy into electrical energy using a semiconductor (solar cell element) such as a silicon cell. In order to ensure the long-term reliability of the solar cell element, the solar cell element is sandwiched between encapsulants to protect the solar cell element and to prevent the incorporation of a foreign matter or the intrusion of moisture or the like into the solar cell element.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The solar cell element usually has a metal electrode for collecting electric charges that are obtained by photovoltaic power and is usually configured by connecting a plurality of cells for a solar cell with metal wiring in order to obtain a high electric output. In addition, it is known that there are cases where yellowing occurs in the solar cell encapsulants in the vicinity of the metal electrode or the metal wiring due to deterioration over time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The yellowing of these solar cell encapsulants reduces the amount of light received by the solar cell element. Therefore, the yellowing of the solar cell encapsulants causes a decrease in the power generation efficiency of solar cell modules, and a solar cell encapsulant capable of effectively preventing yellowing is desired.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of techniques for suppressing such yellowing of solar cell encapsulants include techniques described in Patent Document 1 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2014-107323) and Patent Document 2 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2018-174202).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1 discloses an encapsulating film for a solar cell containing an ethylene-based copolymer, a pigment, and a metal inactivating agent, in which the metal inactivating agent contains at least one kind of compound selected from the group consisting of a triazole-based compound, a benzotriazole-based compound, and a hydrazine compound. Patent Document 1 describes that such an encapsulating film for a solar cell is capable of suppressing the occurrence of yellowing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 2 discloses an encapsulant for a solar cell containing an ethylene-polar monomer copolymer, a cross-linking agent, an ultraviolet absorber, and a carbodiimide compound, in which the cross-linking agent has a specific structure, the ultraviolet absorber is a benzotriazole-based ultraviolet absorber, and the carbodiimide compound is a cyclic carbodiimide compound having a specific structure. Patent Document 2 describes that such an encapsulant for a solar cell is capable of maintaining an acid trapping function for a long period of time even in a high temperature and high humidity environment and in an environment exposed to ultraviolet rays for a long period of time, suppresses yellowing, and is highly transparent and excellent in terms of the cross-linking efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2014-107323</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">[Patent Document 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2018-174202</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">A demand for suppressing the yellowing of solar cell encapsulants is growing more intense.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances and provides a solar cell encapsulant having improved yellowing resistance.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0012">The present inventors repeated intensive studies to solve the above-described problems.
