The loss of insulin production in these patients results in an inability to process glucose without exogenous insulin delivery through daily subcutaneous injections, or by infusion with a pump into the subcutaneous tissue. Maintaining tight glycemic control is critical to prevent severe long-term side effects, such as kidney disease, heart disease, vision loss, and limb loss. Patients must deliver a carefully calculated bolus of insulin at mealtimes to reduce blood glucose excursions; however, insulin pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration are poorly matched to physiologic post-prandial requirements. Even current commercial &#x201c;rapid-acting&#x201d; insulin analogue formulations Humalog (insulin lispro), Novolog (insulin aspart) and Apidra (insulin glulisine) exhibit delayed onset of action of &#x2dc;20-30 min, peak action at &#x2dc;60-90 min and a total duration of action of &#x2dc;3-4 hours.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current &#x201c;fast-acting&#x201d; insulin analogues inhibit dimer formation and shift the equilibrium towards the monomeric state through amino acid modifications. However, the insulin monomer is unstable and rapidly aggregates to form amyloid fibrils. Insulin is primarily formulated as hexamers to prevent insulin aggregation. Novolog (aspart) and Humalog (lispro) are formulated in sodium phosphate buffer with a three-fold molar excess of zinc ion, relative to the insulin hexamer. Formulation with zinc stabilizes the hexameric state in the T<sub>6 </sub>formation, and dissociation of the hexamer is known to be the rate-limiting step for subcutaneous absorption and onset of action. In contrast, Apidra (glulisine) is a zinc-free formulation and is formulated with the surfactant polysorbate 20 as a stabilizing agent. Apidra demonstrates slightly faster onset of action, but overall similar control of glucose levels in vivo to Novolog and Humalog, indicating that the removal of zinc alone is not enough to achieve an ultra-fast acting monomeric insulin formulation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Excipients, the inactive ingredients in drug formulations, perform a number of functions and can facilitate improved protein stability, solubility and absorption. Formulations for insulin analogues contain multiple excipients including tonicity agents, preservatives, and stabilizing agents, which are selected to enhance insulin stability. Glycerol or sodium chloride are commonly added to insulin formulations as tonicity agents, whereas phenol and/or meta-cresol are added as parenteral preservatives. The inclusion of glycerol, a tonicity agent used in both Humalog and Novolog formulations, has been shown to increase insulin stability in formulation. Moreover, in addition to anti-microbial properties, phenol and meta-cresol stabilize the R<sub>6 </sub>insulin hexamer by forming hydrogen bonds between dimers. This suggests that even in the absence of zinc, the phenolic preservatives may contribute to higher order insulin structures that may slow absorption from the subcutaneous space.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Formulating monomeric insulin requires new excipients which do not promote the R<sub>6 </sub>hexamer, but still imbue insulin with sufficient stability to prevent aggregation and denaturation over time. Covalent PEGylation has been successful as a strategy to stabilize insulin in formulation, however, the extended pharmacokinetics in vivo associated with PEGylation is not desirable for rapid acting insulins. Recent research has demonstrated non-covalent modification of proteins as a strategy to enhance their stability in formulation. In particular, conjugation of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain to a cucubit[7]uril (CB[7]) creates a tool for non-covalent PEGylation using host-guest binding with the excipient CB[7]-PEG. CB[7]-PEG has strong binding affinities for terminal aromatic amino acids such the N-terminal phenylalanine found on insulin making it an ideal candidate for host-guest binding. The dynamic binding of CB[7]-PEG to insulin is promising as a strategy for stabilizing insulin without promoting the insulin hexamer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Understanding the excipient choices in current commercial formulations is a critical first step in designing the next generation of ultra-fast acting insulin formulations that have potential to more closely mimic endogenous pharmacokinetics to address the above-described unmet need.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed a stable monomeric insulin formulation that is achieved through selection of formulation excipients that promote the monomer state. In embodiments of the inventive approach, CB[7]-PEG can be used to stabilize these formulations so that the insulin/CB[7]-PEG complex has a faster diffusion rate than the insulin hexamer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Current &#x201c;fast-acting&#x201d; insulin analogues contain amino acid modifications meant to inhibit dimer formation and shift the equilibrium of association states towards the monomeric state. However, the insulin monomer is highly unstable and current formulation techniques require insulin to primarily exist as hexamers to prevent aggregation into inactive and immunogenic amyloids. Insulin formulation excipients have thus been traditionally selected to promote insulin aggregation into the hexameric form to enhance formulation stability. The inventive approach exploits a novel excipient for the supramolecular PEGylation of insulin analogues, including aspart and lispro, to enhance the stability and maximize the prevalence of insulin monomers in formulation. Using multiple techniques employing a formulation excipients (tonicity agents and parenteral preservatives) enables insulin analogue formulations with 70-80% monomer and supramolecular PEGylation imbued stability under stressed aging for over 100 h without altering insulin association state. Comparatively, commercial &#x201c;fast-acting&#x201d; formulations contain less than 1% monomer and remain stable for only 10 h under the same stressed aging conditions. The inventive formulation approach enables next-generation ultra-fast insulin formulations with short duration of action that can effectively reduce the risk of post-prandial hypoglycemia in the treatment of diabetes.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic illustrating the contributions of insulin association state on absorption kinetics;

Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a protein&#x201d; includes a mixture of two or more such proteins, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; particularly in reference to a given quantity, is meant to encompass deviations of plus or minus five percent.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terms &#x201c;variant,&#x201d; &#x201c;analog&#x201d; and &#x201c;mutein&#x201d; refer to biologically active derivatives of the reference molecule that retain desired activity, such as insulin or amylin activity for use in the treatment of type 1 or type 2 diabetes as described herein. In general, the terms &#x201c;variant&#x201d; and &#x201c;analog&#x201d; refer to compounds having a native polypeptide sequence and structure with one or more amino acid additions, substitutions (generally conservative in nature) and/or deletions, relative to the native molecule, so long as the modifications do not destroy biological activity and which are &#x201c;substantially homologous&#x201d; to the reference molecule as defined below. In general, the amino acid sequences of such analogs will have a high degree of sequence homology to the reference sequence, e.g., amino acid sequence homology of more than 50%, generally more than 60%-70%, even more particularly 80%-85% or more, such as at least 90%-95% or more, when the two sequences are aligned. Often, the analogs will include the same number of amino acids but will include substitutions, as explained herein. The term &#x201c;mutein&#x201d; further includes polypeptides having one or more amino acid-like molecules including but not limited to compounds comprising only amino and/or imino molecules, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), polypeptides with substituted linkages, as well as other modifications known in the art, both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring (e.g., synthetic), cyclized, branched molecules and the like. The term also includes molecules comprising one or more N-substituted glycine residues (a &#x201c;peptoid&#x201d;) and other synthetic amino acids or peptides. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,831,005; 5,877,278; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,301; Nguyen et al., Chem Biol. (2000) 7:463-473; and Simon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1992) 89:9367-9371 for descriptions of peptoids). Preferably, the analog or mutein has at least the same insulin or amylin biological activity as the native molecule. Methods for making polypeptide analogs and muteins are known in the art and are described further below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As explained above, analogs generally include substitutions that are conservative in nature, i.e., those substitutions that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Specifically, amino acids are generally divided into four families: (1) acidic&#x2014;aspartate and glutamate; (2) basic&#x2014;lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar&#x2014;alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, praline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar&#x2014;glycine, asparagme, glutamine, cysteine, senne threonine, tyrosine. Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified as aromatic amino acids. For example, it is reasonably predictable that an isolated replacement of leucine with isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar conservative replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid, will not have a major effect on the biological activity. For example, the polypeptide of interest may include up to about 5-10 conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, or even up to about 15-25 conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, or any integer between 5-25, so long as the desired function of the molecule remains intact. One of skill in the art may readily determine regions of the molecule of interest that can tolerate change by reference to Hopp/Woods and KyteDoolittle plots, well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">By &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; is intended any suitable modification of the native polypeptide of interest, of a fragment of the native polypeptide, or of their respective analogs, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, polymer conjugation (such as with polyethylene glycol), or other addition of foreign moieties, as long as the desired biological activity of the native polypeptide is retained. Methods for making polypeptide fragments, analogs, and derivatives are generally available in the art.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier&#x201d; refers to an excipient that may optionally be included in the compositions of the invention and that causes no significant adverse toxicological effects to the patient.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">&#x201c;Pharmaceutically acceptable salt&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, amino acid salts, salts prepared with inorganic acids, such as chloride, sulfate, phosphate, diphosphate, bromide, and nitrate salts, or salts prepared from the corresponding inorganic acid form of any of the preceding, e.g., hydrochloride, etc., or salts prepared with an organic acid, such as malate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, succinate, ethylsuccinate, citrate, acetate, lactate, methanesulfonate, benzoate, ascorbate, para-toluenesulfonate, palmoate, salicylate and stearate, as well as estolate, gluceptate and lactobionate salts. Similarly, salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable cations include, but are not limited to, sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, and ammonium (including substituted ammonium).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">By &#x201c;subject&#x201d; is meant any member of the subphylum chordata, including, without limitation, humans and other primates, including non-human primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses; domestic mammals such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals including rodents such as mice, rats and guinea pigs; birds, including domestic, wild and game birds such as chickens, turkeys and other gallinaceous birds, ducks, geese, and the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, existing insulin formulations contain a mixture of hexamers, dimers and monomers, which, upon subcutaneous injection, dissociate and are absorbed at different rates, shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Non-covalent PEGylation is enabled by the strong specific binding between CB[7]-PEG and the N-terminal phenylalanine on insulin (KD=0.5 &#x3bc;M). Under high concentrations in formulation insulin will be greater than 98% bound, but after dilution upon subcutaneous injection less than 1% of CB[7]-PEG will remain associated with insulin.

To engineer an insulin formulation that promotes the monomer state, the effects of excipients on insulin association state under zinc-free conditions must be understood. Characterization by size exclusion chromatography with multiple angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) allows us to determine insulin molecular weight in formulation and estimate the fraction of hexamers, dimers and monomers under formulation conditions. In these studies, insulin analogues lispro and aspart were formulated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to remove formulation zinc. EDTA forms strong complexes with zinc (K<sub>D</sub>&#x2dc;10&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;18 </sup>M) and addition of one molar equivalent of EDTA relative to the zinc ion in insulin formulations rapidly sequester the zinc, preventing it from interacting with the insulin and thus disrupting the insulin hexamer in solution. Zinc free insulin in pure water is completely monomeric (M<sub>n</sub>=5.7 kDa). However, it becomes a mixture of monomers, dimers and hexamers with the addition of buffering salts. To select for a mostly monomeric insulin formulation, we evaluated the effect of tonicity agents and preservatives on insulin association state.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate the zinc-free insulin lispro association states when formulated in (i) phosphate buffer, sodium chloride (0.9%) (LS), (ii) phosphate buffer with glycerol (2.6%) (LG), (iii) phosphate buffer with glycerol (2.6%) and meta-cresol (0.315%) (LGM), and (iv) phosphate buffer with glycerol (2.6%) and phenoxyethanol (0.85%) (LGPhE).

Formulations were compared against a formulation of commercial Novolog.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">Glycerol is the most commonly used tonicity agent in insulin formulations followed closely by sodium chloride. Zinc-free lispro or zinc-free aspart were formulated in phosphate buffer (pH=7.4) with either sodium chloride (0.9%) or glycerol (2.6%). Glycerol demonstrated a lower number average molecular weight and higher percentage of monomers for both lispro (MW=7.6 kDa; 89.2% monomer) and aspart (MW=7.4 kDa; 91.4% monomer) compared to sodium chloride formulations for lispro (MW=8.7 kDa; 55.0% monomer) and aspart (MW=13 kDa; 4.8% monomer). Therefore, glycerol was maintained as the tonicity agent when evaluating the effect of preservatives on insulin association state.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">While glycerol alone showed the highest proportion of monomers in formulation, insulin requires an antimicrobial preservative, because it is a multi-dose formulation. There are only several commercially used parenteral preservatives, the most common of which are benzyl alcohol, chloro-butanol, meta-cresol, phenol, methyl-paraben, propyl paraben, phenoxyethanol and thimerosal. Of these anti-microbial agents, only phenol and meta-cresol are currently used in commercial insulin formulations. However, phenolic preservatives are recognized for their promotion of R<sub>6 </sub>insulin hexamer formation through hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group on phenol and the insulin dimeric pocket. To create a monomeric insulin formulation it is imperative to reduce phenol promoted R<sub>6 </sub>hexamer formation, thus it is necessary to identify a different parenteral preservative for insulin formulations. Other research has indicated that ethanol may play a role in disrupting the insulin dimer, thus promoting the insulin monomer. This led to the selection of phenoxyethanol as an alternative anti-microbial agent. We hypothesized that the ethanol chain off the phenolic ring will create steric hindrance that disrupts the intermolecular forces leading to R<sub>6 </sub>hexamer formation and that the ethanol side chain could further promote monomer formation through the disruption of the insulin dimer. Indeed, after glycerol alone, phenoxyethanol demonstrated the lowest number average molecular weight and highest ratio of insulin monomers in both lispro (MW=8.2 kDa; 71.5% monomer) and aspart formulations (MW=7.4 kDa; 85.2% monomer) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C</figref>). In contrast, formulation of meta-cresol had increased number average molecular weight compared to phenoxyethanol for lispro (MW=9.0 kDa; 56.7% monomer) and aspart (MW=9.4 kDa; 71.0% monomer). Work by Gast et al. has shown that phenol shows a stronger affinity for hexamer formation than meta-cresol. Therefore, it is expected that phenoxyethanol would also have a higher monomer content than a phenol based formulation. While the proportion of hexamers between formulations with phenoxyethanol and meta-cresol were similar, meta-cresol formulations had a higher percentage of hexamers and dimers combined. Since the R<sub>6 </sub>hexamer is a dynamic structure held together by hydrogen bonds, insulin that originates as a hexamer may dissociate and appear in the dimer form in the SEC-MALS.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 2: Stability of Monomeric Insulin with CB[7]-PEG</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0067">As insulin monomer content increases, formulation stability becomes more challenging and alternative stabilizing excipients are needed to increase insulin stability in the absence of zinc. The current commercial zinc-free insulin analogue, Apidra, contains both meta-cresol and the surfactant polysorbate 20 which aid formulation stability, but meta-cresol promotes the R<sub>6 </sub>hexamer. Non-covalent PEGylation has potential as a stabilizing excipient that will not promote hexamer formation and will leave insulin monomers unmodified to act in vivo. Previous studies have shown that non-covalent PEGylation with cucurbit[7]uril-poly(ethylene glycol) (CB[7]-PEG) imbues long-term insulin stability without reducing insulin activity in vivo.

CB[7]-PEG was added to formulations in excess to insulin at either 3 molar equivalents or 5 molar equivalents.

Formulations comprising CB[7]-PEG could not be assessed with SEC-MALS on account of confounding alterations to the retention time of the insulin species on the chromatography column and in the light scattering. Formulating monomeric insulin analogues with CB[7]-PEG is expected to negligibly increase the diffusivity and corresponding hydrodynamic radius of the insulin in formulation compared to the insulin monomer alone on account of the highly dynamic nature of the CB[7]-insulin binding interaction. The diffusivities of the insulin molecules in zinc-free formulations of either LGPhE or AGPhE were compared against commercial Humalog and Novolog formulations. Humalog and Novolog both exhibited insulin diffusivities of 1.13&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>/s, corresponding to hydrodynamic radii of 2.2 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>), which is consistent with reported literature values. By using EDTA to remove zinc from commercial Novolog, the hydrodynamic radius remains unchanged at 2.2 nm, demonstrating that the absence of zinc alone it not sufficient to alter the insulin association state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). In contrast, the insulin molecules in zinc-free LGPhE and AGPhE formulations comprising CB[7]-PEG demonstrated increased diffusivities of 1.60&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>m<sup>2</sup>/s, corresponding to a hydrodynamic radius of 1.5 nm, which is significantly smaller than commercial insulin analogue formulations and approximately the same size as the reported literature value for the insulin monomer. (DOSY) provides insight into the formation of protein/CB[7]-PEG complexes and their rates of diffusion in formulation. Diffusion characteristics demonstrate that lispro and aspart diffuse at a similar rate under both commercial Humalog and Novolog in the presence of zinc ion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>) and LGPhE and AGPhE in the presence of CB[7]-PEG (0.6 eq) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>). Increased diffusion was observed for insulin LGPhE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>) and AGPhE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>) formulated with 0.6 eq. CB[7]-PEG compared to commercial formulation conditions. These observations suggest that while CB[7]-PEG stabilizes the monomeric form of insulin in formulation, the highly dynamic binding of CB[7]-PEG to insulin negligibly alters the diffusivity of the insulin molecule.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">Excipient choice in insulin formulations is critical in determining insulin association state, stability, and the rate of absorption in vivo. At present, there is a need for insulin formulations that more closely mimic endogenous secretion, which ultimately requires insulin formulations that are more mono-disperse and primarily contain insulin monomers. In order to engineer the next generation of monomeric insulin formulations, an understanding of the effect of excipient choices on insulin association state is necessary. In this study, commonly used parenteral preservatives were evaluated for their propensity to increase the ratio of insulin monomers in formulation, and with the assistance of a stabilizing excipient, CB[7]-PEG, enhance insulin stability. We have identified that a formulation containing glycerol as a tonicity agent and phenoxyethanol as a preservative is the optimal combination to promote the insulin monomer. whereby upwards of 85% of the insulin is in a monomer state. This formulation exhibits over 10-fold extended stability compared to commercial formulations when formulated with CB[7]-PEG. Moreover, DOSY NMR highlights that CB[7]-PEG binding to insulin does not significantly impact the diffusivity of insulin or its association state. The increased insulin monomer composition in these formulations can potentially enable ultra-fast onset of insulin action combined with short duration of action to allow for meal-time responsiveness with reduced post-prandial hypoglycemic events.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 4: CB[7]-PEG Preparation</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0074">CB[7]-PEG was prepared according to published protocols, with method modification to enable copper &#x201c;click&#x201d; chemistry following reported protocols.

(<i>P. Nat. Acad. Sci</i>. U.S.A 2016, 113, 14189). Briefly, formulation samples were plated at 150 &#x3bc;L per well (n=3/group) in a clear 96-well plate and sealed with optically clear and thermally stable seal (VWR). The plate was immediately placed into a plate reader and incubated with continuous shaking 37&#xb0; C. Absorbance readings were taken every 10 minutes at 540 nm for 100 h (BioTek SynergyH1 microplate reader). The aggregation of insulin leads to light scattering, which results in reduction of sample transmittance. The time for aggregation was defined as a&#x3e;10% increase in transmittance from the transmittance at time zero. Zinc(II) was removed from the insulin lispro and insulin aspart through competitive binding by addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which exhibits a dissociation binding constant approaching attomolar concentrations (K<sub>D</sub>&#x2dc;10<sup>&#x2212;18 </sup>M).<sup>[41, 42]</sup> EDTA was added to formulations (4 eq with respect to zinc) to sequester zinc from the formulation and then removed using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and then concentrated using Amino Ultra 3K centrifugal units (Millipore). Insulin lispro or aspart concentration was then measured by ELISA (Mercodia, Iso-Insulin ELISA) and then formulation excipients were added.
