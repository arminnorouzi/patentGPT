end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0009" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Embodiments are described in detail with reference to the drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it is readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the description in the following embodiments. Note that in the structures of the invention described below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in different drawings, and description thereof is not repeated.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, the position, size, range, and the like of each component illustrated in the drawings and the like do not represent the actual position, size, range, and the like in some cases for easy understanding of the invention. Therefore, the disclosed invention is not necessarily limited to the position, size, range, or the like disclosed in drawings and the like. For example, in an actual manufacturing process, a resist mask or the like might be unintentionally reduced in size by treatment such as etching, which might not be reflected in the drawings for easy understanding.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Furthermore, in a top view (also referred to as a &#x201c;plan view&#x201d;), a perspective view, or the like, the description of some components might be omitted for easy understanding of the drawings.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, in this specification and the like, the terms &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; and &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; do not functionally limit these components. For example, an &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; is used as part of a &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; in some cases, and vice versa. Furthermore, the term &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; or &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; also includes the case where a plurality of &#x201c;electrodes&#x201d; or &#x201c;wirings&#x201d; are formed in an integrated manner, for example.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In this specification and the like, a &#x201c;terminal&#x201d; in an electric circuit refers to a portion that inputs or outputs a current, inputs or outputs a voltage, or receives or transmits a signal. Accordingly, part of a wiring or an electrode functions as a terminal in some cases.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Note that the term &#x201c;over&#x201d; or &#x201c;under&#x201d; in this specification and the like does not necessarily mean that a component is placed directly over and in contact with or directly under and in contact with another component. For example, the expression &#x201c;electrode B over insulating layer A&#x201d; does not necessarily mean that the electrode B is formed on and in direct contact with the insulating layer A, and does not exclude the case where another component is provided between the insulating layer A and the electrode B.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition, functions of a source and a drain are interchanged with each other depending on operation conditions and the like, for example, when a transistor of different polarity is employed or when the current direction is changed in a circuit operation; therefore, it is difficult to define which is the source or the drain. Thus, the terms &#x201c;source&#x201d; and &#x201c;drain&#x201d; can be interchangeably used in this specification.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this specification and the like, the expression &#x201c;electrically connected&#x201d; includes the case where components are directly connected to each other and the case where components are connected through an &#x201c;object having any electric function&#x201d;. Here, there is no particular limitation on the &#x201c;object having any electric function&#x201d; as long as electric signals can be transmitted and received between components that are connected through the object. Thus, even when the expression &#x201c;electrically connected&#x201d; is used, there is a case where no physical connection portion is made and a wiring is just extended in an actual circuit.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, in this specification and the like, &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; indicates a state where two straight lines are placed at an angle of greater than or equal to &#x2212;10&#xb0; and less than or equal to 10&#xb0;, for example. Accordingly, the case where the angle is greater than or equal to &#x2212;5&#xb0; and less than or equal to 5&#xb0; is also included.

Oxide semiconductors are classified into a single crystal oxide semiconductor and a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor, for example. Examples of the non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include the above-described CAAC-OS and nc-OS. Other examples of the non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, an amorphous-like oxide semiconductor (a-like OS), and an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0436">Here, the above-described CAAC-OS, nc-OS, and a-like OS are described in detail.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">[CAAC-OS]</heading><p id="p-0439" num="0437">The CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor that has a plurality of crystal regions each of which has c-axis alignment in a particular direction. Note that the particular direction refers to the film thickness direction of a CAAC-OS film, the normal direction of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed, or the normal direction of the surface of the CAAC-OS film. The crystal region refers to a region having a periodic atomic arrangement. When an atomic arrangement is regarded as a lattice arrangement, the crystal region also refers to a region with a uniform lattice arrangement. The CAAC-OS has a region where a plurality of crystal regions are connected in the a-b plane direction, and the region has distortion in some cases. Note that the distortion refers to a portion where the direction of a lattice arrangement changes between a region with a uniform lattice arrangement and another region with a uniform lattice arrangement in a region where a plurality of crystal regions are connected. That is, the CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor having c-axis alignment and having no clear alignment in the a-b plane direction.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0438">Note that each of the plurality of crystal regions is formed of one or more fine crystals (crystals each of which has a maximum diameter of less than 10 nm). In the case where the crystal region is formed of one fine crystal, the maximum diameter of the crystal region is less than 10 nm. In the case where the crystal region is formed of a large number of fine crystals, the size of the crystal region may be approximately several tens of nanometers.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0439">In the case of an In&#x2014;M&#x2014;Zn oxide (the element M is one kind or two or more kinds selected from aluminum, gallium, yttrium, tin, titanium, and the like), the CAAC-OS tends to have a layered crystal structure (also referred to as a layered structure) in which a layer containing indium (In) and oxygen (hereinafter, an In layer) and a layer containing the element M, zinc (Zn), and oxygen (hereinafter, an (M,Zn) layer) are stacked. Indium and the element M can be replaced with each other. Therefore, indium may be contained in the (M,Zn) layer. In addition, the element M may be contained in the In layer. Note that Zn may be contained in the In layer. Such a layered structure is observed as a lattice image in a high-resolution TEM image, for example.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0440">When the CAAC-OS film is subjected to structural analysis by out-of-plane XRD measurement with an XRD apparatus using 0120 scanning, for example, a peak indicating c-axis alignment is detected at 20 of 31&#xb0; or around 31&#xb0;. Note that the position of the peak indicating c-axis alignment (the value of 29) may change depending on the kind, composition, or the like of the metal element contained in the CAAC-OS.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0441">For example, a plurality of bright spots are observed in the electron diffraction pattern of the CAAC-OS film. Note that one spot and another spot are observed point-symmetrically with a spot of the incident electron beam passing through a sample (also referred to as a direct spot) as the symmetric center.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0442">When the crystal region is observed from the particular direction, a lattice arrangement in the crystal region is basically a hexagonal lattice arrangement; however, a unit lattice is not always a regular hexagon and is a non-regular hexagon in some cases. A pentagonal lattice arrangement, a heptagonal lattice arrangement, and the like are included in the distortion in some cases. Note that a clear grain boundary cannot be observed even in the vicinity of the distortion in the CAAC-OS. That is, formation of a crystal grain boundary is inhibited by the distortion of lattice arrangement. This is probably because the CAAC-OS can tolerate distortion owing to a low density of arrangement of oxygen atoms in the a-b plane direction, an interatomic bond distance changed by substitution of a metal atom, and the like.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0443">A crystal structure in which a clear grain boundary is observed is what is called polycrystal. It is highly probable that the grain boundary becomes a recombination center and captures carriers and thus decreases the on-state current and field-effect mobility of a transistor, for example. Thus, the CAAC-OS in which no clear grain boundary is observed is one of crystalline oxides having a crystal structure suitable for a semiconductor layer of a transistor. Note that Zn is preferably contained to form the CAAC-OS. For example, an In&#x2014;Zn oxide and an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide are suitable because they can inhibit generation of a grain boundary as compared with an In oxide.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0444">The CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor with high crystallinity in which no clear grain boundary is observed. Thus, in the CAAC-OS, a reduction in electron mobility due to the grain boundary is unlikely to occur. Moreover, since the crystallinity of an oxide semiconductor might be decreased by entry of impurities, formation of defects, or the like, the CAAC-OS can be regarded as an oxide semiconductor that has small amounts of impurities and defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies). Thus, an oxide semiconductor including the CAAC-OS is physically stable. Therefore, the oxide semiconductor including the CAAC-OS is resistant to heat and has high reliability. In addition, the CAAC-OS is stable with respect to high temperature in the manufacturing process (what is called thermal budget). Accordingly, the use of the CAAC-OS for the OS transistor can extend the degree of freedom of the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0000">[nc-OS]</p><p id="p-0448" num="0445">In the nc-OS, a microscopic region (e.g., a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, in particular, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm) has a periodic atomic arrangement. In other words, the nc-OS includes a fine crystal. Note that the size of the fine crystal is, for example, greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, particularly greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm; thus, the fine crystal is also referred to as a nanocrystal. Furthermore, there is no regularity of crystal orientation between different nanocrystals in the nc-OS. Thus, the orientation in the whole film is not observed. Accordingly, the nc-OS cannot be distinguished from an a-like OS or an amorphous oxide semiconductor with some analysis methods. For example, when an nc-OS film is subjected to structural analysis using out-of-plane XRD measurement with an XRD apparatus using <b>0120</b> scanning, a peak indicating crystallinity is not detected. Furthermore, a diffraction pattern like a halo pattern is observed when the nc-OS film is subjected to electron diffraction (also referred to as selected-area electron diffraction) using an electron beam with a probe diameter larger than the diameter of a nanocrystal (e.g., larger than or equal to 50 nm). Meanwhile, in some cases, a plurality of spots in a ring-like region with a direct spot as the center are observed in the obtained electron diffraction pattern when the nc-OS film is subjected to electron diffraction (also referred to as nanobeam electron diffraction) using an electron beam with a probe diameter nearly equal to or smaller than the diameter of a nanocrystal (e.g., 1 nm or larger and 30 nm or smaller).</p><p id="p-0449" num="0000">[a-like OS]</p><p id="p-0450" num="0446">The a-like OS is an oxide semiconductor having a structure between those of the nc-OS and the amorphous oxide semiconductor. The a-like OS includes a void or a low-density region. That is, the a-like OS has low crystallinity as compared with the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS. Moreover, the a-like OS has a higher hydrogen concentration in the film than the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="2">&#x3c;&#x3c;Structure of Oxide Semiconductor&#x3e;&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0451" num="0447">Next, the above-described CAC-OS is described in detail.

Note that a state in which one or more metal elements are unevenly distributed and regions including the metal element(s) are mixed with a size greater than or equal to 0.5 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm, or a similar size in a metal oxide is hereinafter referred to as a mosaic pattern or a patch-like pattern.</p><p id="p-0453" num="0449">In addition, the CAC-OS has a composition in which materials are separated into a first region and a second region to form a mosaic pattern, and the first regions are distributed in the film (this composition is hereinafter also referred to as a cloud-like composition). That is, the CAC-OS is a composite metal oxide having a composition in which the first regions and the second regions are mixed.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0450">Note that the atomic ratios of In, Ga, and Zn to the metal elements contained in the CAC-OS in an In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide are denoted with [In], [Ga], and [Zn], respectively. For example, the first region in the CAC-OS in the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide has [In] higher than that in the composition of the CAC-OS film. Moreover, the second region has [Ga] higher than that in the composition of the CAC-OS film. For example, the first region has higher [In] and lower [Ga] than the second region. Moreover, the second region has higher [Ga] and lower [In] than the first region.</p><p id="p-0455" num="0451">Specifically, the first region includes indium oxide, indium zinc oxide, or the like as its main component.

The second region can be referred to as a region containing Ga as its main component.</p><p id="p-0456" num="0452">Note that a clear boundary between the first region and the second region cannot be observed in some cases.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0453">For example, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is used to obtain EDX mapping, and according to the EDX mapping, the CAC-OS in the In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn oxide has a structure in which the region containing In as its main component (the first region) and the region containing Ga as its main component (the second region) are unevenly distributed and mixed.</p><p id="p-0458" num="0454">In the case where the CAC-OS is used for a transistor, a switching function (on/off switching function) can be given to the CAC-OS owing to the complementary action of the conductivity derived from the first region and the insulating property derived from the second region. The CAC-OS has a conducting function in part of the material and has an insulating function in another part of the material; as a whole, the CAC-OS has a function of a semiconductor. Separation of the conducting function and the insulating function can maximize each function. Accordingly, when the CAC-OS is used for a transistor, high on-state current (Ion), high field-effect mobility (&#x3bc;), and excellent switching operation can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0455">An oxide semiconductor has various structures with different properties.

In order to reduce the carrier concentration of an oxide semiconductor film, the impurity concentration in the oxide semiconductor film is reduced so that the density of defect states can be reduced. In this specification and the like, a state with a low impurity concentration and a low density of defect states is referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic state.

The NOSRAM can perform writing and reading-out at extremely higher speed than a flash memory and perform writing at lower voltage than a flash memory, is less likely to deteriorate due to rewriting, and can retain data even after power supply is stopped; thus, an excellent nonvolatile memory that operates at high speed and consumes low power can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0550">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref>, the controller <b>901</b> includes a sensor chip <b>908</b>. In this example, ADXL<b>362</b> manufactured by ANALOG DEVICES was used as the sensor chip <b>908</b>, for example. ADXL<b>362</b> is a circuit including a MEMS acceleration sensor. In addition, ADXL<b>362</b> includes a 12-bit analog-digital converter circuit. Data sensed by the acceleration sensor is processed by the analog-digital converter circuit or the like of the sensor circuit and then supplied to the processor unit <b>907</b>.</p><p id="p-0555" num="0551">A battery is provided in the controller <b>901</b>.</p><p id="p-0556" num="0552">The data acquired by the sensor chip <b>908</b> is supplied to the processor unit <b>907</b>. The data supplied to the processor unit <b>907</b> is converted by multiplying parameters stored in a cache of the processor unit <b>907</b>. The value obtained by the conversion is supplied to the personal computer <b>903</b> through Bluetooth (registered trademark).</p><p id="p-0557" num="0553">When the controller <b>901</b> is tilted, the sensor chip <b>908</b> senses the orientation and the degree of the tilt and outputs a signal. For example, when the controller <b>901</b> is tilted backward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>A</figref>, the player object <b>905</b> moves forward, and the speed of the movement can be controlled by the tilt degree. When the controller <b>901</b> is tilted forward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>B</figref>, the player object <b>905</b> moves backward. When the controller <b>901</b> is tilted leftward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>C</figref>, the player object <b>905</b> rotates counterclockwise, and when the controller <b>901</b> is tilted rightward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>D</figref>, the player object <b>905</b> rotates clockwise. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>E</figref>, the player object <b>905</b> placed in a virtual space displayed on the monitor <b>904</b> moves by operation of the controller <b>901</b>.</p><p id="p-0558" num="0554"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>A</figref> shows an enlarged photograph of the controller <b>902</b>. A housing of the controller <b>902</b> has a mouse shape. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>B</figref>, the controller <b>902</b> includes the processor unit <b>907</b> and the sensor chip <b>908</b>.</p><p id="p-0559" num="0555">When the operation of the controller <b>901</b> or the controller <b>902</b> is suspended, the potential of an interrupt signal supplied from the sensor chip <b>908</b> to the processor unit <b>907</b> becomes a low potential, so that the processor unit <b>907</b> is brought into a resting state, resulting in a reduction in power consumption of the processor unit <b>907</b>. Thus, the life of the battery provided in the controller can be increased.</p><p id="p-0560" num="0556">When the controller <b>901</b> is operated, the sensor chip <b>908</b> senses the operation and then supplies a high-potential interrupt signal to the processor unit <b>907</b>, so that the processor unit <b>907</b> returns to a normal state.</p><p id="p-0561" num="0557">As described above, the
