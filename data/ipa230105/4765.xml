Specifically, the printer driver portion <b>255</b> changes a printing condition such that a print job output from the application portion <b>251</b> is set to be accumulated without being executed. The printer driver portion <b>255</b> controls the communication unit <b>205</b> to transmit a print job after a printing condition is changed to the MFP <b>100</b>. In a case in which the communication I/F unit <b>112</b> receives a print job, the MFP <b>100</b> stores the print job in the HDD <b>115</b> without executing the print job in accordance with a printing condition set in the print job.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">After an execution instruction is output by the execution instructing portion <b>265</b>, the job information acquiring portion <b>267</b> acquires job information relating to a print job stored in the MFP <b>100</b>. Specifically, the job information acquiring portion <b>267</b> controls the communication unit <b>205</b> to communicate with the MFP <b>100</b> and acquires job information from the MFP <b>100</b>. For example, the job information acquiring portion <b>267</b> acquires job information from the MFP <b>100</b> by communicating with the MFP <b>100</b> using a communication method defined by the IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) standard. Further, the job information acquiring portion <b>267</b> may acquire job information from the MFP <b>100</b> by communicating with the MFP <b>100</b> using PJL (Printer Job Language). Further, the job information acquiring portion <b>267</b> may communicate with the MFP <b>100</b>, request the MFP <b>100</b> to transmit an MIB (Management Information Base) and acquire job information from the MIB received from the MFP <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The deleting portion <b>271</b> deletes a print job from the MFP <b>100</b> in response to acquisition of job information by the job information acquiring portion <b>267</b>.

The printing condition determining portion <b>269</b> determines a printing condition based on the number of pages included in job information. The number of pages is a value set in the item for a document count of job information. Further, the printing condition determining portion <b>269</b> determines a printing condition in accordance with a predetermined default condition. A default condition includes a setting that causes images of a plurality of pages to be arranged on one recording medium. For example, suppose that a 2in1 printing condition in which images of two pages are arranged on one recording medium in a case in which the number of pages is smaller than 8 is defined as a first default condition, and a 4in1 printing condition in which images of four pages are arranged on one recording medium in a case in which the number of pages is equal to or larger than 8 is defined as a second default condition. In this case, in a case in which the number of pages defined by job information is smaller than 8, the printing condition determining portion <b>269</b> determines a condition defined by the first default condition as a printing condition.

For example, suppose that a third default condition defining that images are to be formed on both sides in a case in which the number of pages is an even number, and a fourth default condition defining that images are to be formed on one side in a case in which the number of pages is an odd number, are defined as default conditions. In this case, in a case in which the number of pages defined by job information is an even number, the printing condition determining portion <b>269</b> determines the condition for both sides defined by the third default condition as a printing condition. In a case in which the number of pages defined by job information is an odd number, the printing condition determining portion <b>269</b> determines the condition for one side defined by the fourth default condition as a printing condition. Further, the default condition may include a setting that defines a printing condition for each of a plurality of pages. For example, a default condition may be a condition defining that images are to be printed by 2in1 for pages from the first page to a certain page, and images are to be formed for each page (1in1) for the subsequent pages.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the printing condition determining portion <b>269</b> determines a printing condition based on data identification information (file name) for identifying application data set in the item for a job name included in job information. In a case in which data identification information includes a reserved word, a default condition that is defined for the reserved word is determined as a printing condition. A reserved word is preferably a word representing the purpose of use of a printed paper. The reserved words include words such as &#x201c;draft&#x201d; and &#x201c;test&#x201d; as words representing that a document is a trial document rather than a formal document, for example. Further, the reserved word may be a word predetermined by the user and is registered in the support portion <b>253</b> in advance.

In response to receiving the accumulation cancel command and the setting command, the printer driver portion <b>255</b> changes a printing condition for a print job to be subsequently input (step S<b>33</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">After outputting a setting instruction, the support portion <b>253</b> provides an instruction for re-outputting to the application portion <b>251</b> (step S<b>30</b>). Specifically, a re-output instruction is output to the application portion <b>251</b>. The re-output instruction is an instruction for re-outputting a print job. The application portion <b>251</b> that receives the re-output instruction outputs a print job to the printer driver portion <b>255</b> (step S<b>34</b>). The printer driver portion <b>255</b> that receives the print job changes a printing condition set in the print job to the printing condition set in the step S<b>33</b>, and transmits the print job in which the changed printing condition is set to the MFP <b>100</b> (step S<b>34</b>). The MFP <b>100</b> that receives the print job executes the print job without accumulating the print job (step S<b>44</b>). Thus, the user operating the PC <b>200</b> can receive a printed matter output by the MFP <b>100</b> that executes the print job (step S<b>05</b>).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Modified Examples</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">While controlling the printer driver portion <b>255</b> in the present embodiment, the support portion <b>253</b> may directly control the MFP <b>100</b> that executes a print job. Specifically, in the step S<b>23</b>, the support portion <b>253</b> controls the MFP <b>100</b> and performs setting such that a print job is accumulated without being executed (step S<b>23</b>). Further, in the step S<b>29</b>, the support portion <b>253</b> controls MFP <b>100</b> to perform setting such that a print job is executed without being accumulated and perform setting such that a printing condition for a print job externally received is changed to the printing condition determined in the step S<b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, the PC <b>200</b> in the present embodiment functions as the printing support device by execution of the printing support program by the CPU <b>111</b>. The PC <b>200</b> detects a print start instruction input by the user, performs setting such that a print job is accumulated without being executed by the MFP <b>100</b> in response to detection of the start instruction, acquires job information relating to the print job accumulated in the MFP <b>100</b> and deletes the print job accumulated in the MFP <b>100</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a print job having a printing condition set by the user from being executed in MFP <b>100</b>. Further, because the PC <b>200</b> determines a printing condition based on job information, printing can be performed in accordance with a printing condition corresponding to the purpose of use of a printed matter. Further, after a print job is set to be executed without being accumulated and then the job is set to be executed by the MFP <b>100</b> in accordance with a printing condition determined based on job information, the print job is re-output by a task for executing an application program. Therefore, a printing condition can be determined regardless of the type of an application program. Therefore, a user's error in setting a printing condition is reduced.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the PC <b>200</b> instructs the printer driver to accumulate a print job without execution by the MFP <b>100</b>, and instructs the printer driver to change the print job in accordance with a printing condition. Therefore, because the printer driver is controlled, it is not necessary to control the MFP <b>100</b>. Therefore, it is possible to reduce an error in setting a printing condition regardless of the type of the MFP <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, the PC <b>200</b> determines a printing condition based on the number of pages included in job information. Therefore, a printing condition can differ depending on the number of pages included in a print job.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, the PC <b>200</b> also determines a printing condition based on job identification information for identifying a print job included in job information. Therefore, because the purpose of use of a printed matter can be acquired from job identification information, it is possible to determine a printing condition in accordance with the purpose of use.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, the PC <b>200</b> also determines a printing condition in accordance with a predetermined default condition. Therefore, because prescribed conditions respectively corresponding to a plurality of purposes of use are defined, a printing condition can be easily determined.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, the default condition includes a setting that causes images of a plurality of pages to be arranged on one recording medium. Therefore, the number of pages to be arranged on one recording medium can differ depending on the purpose of use.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, the default condition includes a setting that defines the side on which an image is formed of a recording medium. Therefore, the side of a recording medium on which an image is to be formed can differ depending on the purpose of use.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, the default condition includes a setting that defines a printing condition for each of a plurality of pages. Therefore, the printing condition can differ for each page.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Although embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated in detail, the disclosed embodiments are made for purpose of illustration and example only and not limitation.
