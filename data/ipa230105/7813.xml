The computing rack approach is to store devices having their own functions, such as, for example, servers, in layers in a computing rack designed according to a specific standard. As the rack apparatus provides flexibility in terms of selection and arrangement of individual devices, the apparatus may have excellent flexibility and expandability in configuration and may occupy a small area. Regarding servers, 19-inch computing racks specified in standards such as International Electrical Commission (IEC) and Electrical Industries Association (EIA) are mainstream racks. For the 19-inch computing rack, the lateral width of a rack frame for mounting a server is defined in units of 451 mm, and the height in the mounted state is defined. in units of 1U (1 ETA)=44.45 mm.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A computing rack apparatus is required to have a cooling function to effectively remove heat generated from the server. Regarding the cooling technology of the computing rack apparatus, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-246649 discloses a cooling structure for cooling with a liquid, and Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-063755 discloses a method of using cold air blown by an air conditioning unit. Computing rack apparatuses having a conventional cooling structure as disclosed in the aforementioned patent documents increase manufacturing costs because the cooling structure is complicated, and an external device needs to be configured separately.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to address such issues a method of using a cooling unit for cooling the internal air has been proposed in Korean Patent No. 10-1718414. This patent document discloses a separation plate configured to separate a cooling zone and a cooling unit, and a structure of a suction container. In addition, although not explicitly disclosed in the aforementioned patent document, a controller to control a computing rack apparatus is usually disposed on an upper side, and is arranged in a separate case. Since the computing rack apparatus according to the aforementioned patent document requires a separator plate, a suction container, case for the controller, etc., the structure thereof is excessively complicated, which increases manufacturing costs. Further, the separation plate prevents the temperature of the internal air from being properly utilized in the cooling unit, resulting in heat loss.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, the present disclosure has been made in view of the above problems, and is one object of the present disclosure to provide a computing rack apparatus to simplify a structure to reduce manufacturing costs and enable the temperature of internal air to be utilized in a cooling unit.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, provided is a computing rack apparatus including a rack housing configured to store a server; a rack frame disposed in the rack housing, the server being fastened to and mounted on the rack frame; and a cooling unit disposed in the rack housing, the cooling unit including a discharge port configured to discharge cooling air and a suction port configured to suck internal air passing through a cooling zone. Herein, the discharge port is located in a first region with respect to a boundary defined as a front surface of the server, and the suction port is located in a second region with respect to the boundary, the first and second regions forming the cooling zone.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the apparatus of the present disclosure, a space between the server and the cooling unit may be opened to form an open structure. The cooling air discharged through the discharge port may flow along the discharge port, the cooling zone, and the suction port. The cooling air discharged from the discharge port may flow toward a server above the cooling unit or toward a server below the cooling unit. The cooling unit may be fixed to the rack frame. The cooling unit may include any one cooling means selected from an evaporator, an air-cooled total heat exchanger, a water-cooled heat exchanger, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the apparatus of the present disclosure, the cooling unit may include a third region containing a cooling means and a fourth region allowing external air to flow therethrough, the third region and the fourth region being divided by a partition. The fourth region may include at least one of a suction duct communicating with an air suction passage allowing the external air to be sucked therethrough and a discharge duct communicating with an air discharge passage allowing the external air to be discharged therethrough. The rack housing may include at least one of a plurality of suction vent holes formed in a front door and connected to the suction duct and a plurality of discharge vent holes formed in a rear door and connected to the discharge duct.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the apparatus of the present disclosure, the third region may contain a reservoir to store moisture. The reservoir may include a water level sensor and a heater.

In addition, the cooling unit may include an evaporator, and the space containing the compressor may be blocked from the space where the evaporator is located by using a means for suction and discharge of air.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view schematically illustrating a first computing rack apparatus using a cooling unit according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a first cooling unit according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a second cooling unit according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a third cooling unit according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a fourth cooling unit according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a fifth cooling unit according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view schematically illustrating a second computing rack apparatus using a cooling unit according to the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BEST MODE</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

In actual use, the spatial direction changes with the direction and rotation of the computing rack apparatus.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a computing rack apparatus simplifying the structure thereof by setting the position where cooling air cooled by the cooling unit is discharged to the space in front of the server to reduce manufacturing costs and utilize the temperature of internal air in the cooling unit. In this regard, the structure of a cooling unit in which the discharge position of the cooling air is adjusted, the structure of a computing rack apparatus using the same, and the operations of the computing rack apparatus will be described in detail. In addition, elements added to the computing rack apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure to more efficiently perform the operation of the computing rack apparatus will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view schematically illustrating a first computing rack apparatus <b>100</b> using a cooling unit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first device <b>100</b> of the present disclosure includes a rack housing <b>10</b>, in which a server S is accommodated. A rack frame <b>20</b>, which may be positioned perpendicular to the ground, is provided in the rack housing <b>10</b>. In the rack frame <b>20</b>, computer equipment such as the server S is installed by fastening bolts or the like, and constitutes a standard rack defined by international standards (IEC, EIA, and DIN) for 19 inches or 23 inches. The rack housing <b>10</b> provides a rectangular parallelepiped interior space and defines the exterior of the computing rack apparatus of the present disclosure. In the rack housing <b>10</b>, a cooling zone CZ in which cooling is caused by a first cooling unit <b>30</b> is formed. The rack housing <b>10</b> is provided with a front door <b>11</b> and a rear door <b>12</b>, which rotate around hinge axes. The doors <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> may be formed of a transparent material, such as, for example, glass, such that the interior may be visually checked.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although not shown in the figure, each of the doors <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and the rack housing <b>10</b> includes a locking device. Various kinds of locks may be employed as the locking device. An electromagnetic lock operated by electromagnetic force may be used. In addition, each of the doors <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> may be provided with a plunger. The doors <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> may be opened based on, for example, a password or a threshold temperature. Furthermore, a door sensor is mounted on the rack housing <b>10</b> to stop the operation of the first cooling unit <b>30</b> when the doors <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are opened. For the locking device, the plunger and the door sensor, well-known techniques may be used. In addition, components not disclosed herein may be mounted in order to operate the computing rack apparatus more efficiently within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first cooling unit <b>30</b>, which includes a discharge port <b>31</b> and a suction port <b>32</b>, is positioned in the lower and middle portions of the rack housing <b>10</b>. In the figure, the first cooling unit <b>30</b> is illustrated as being positioned in the lower portion. The first cooling unit <b>30</b> is fixed to the rack frame <b>20</b> by a fixing flange <b>33</b>. In other words, not only the server S but also the first cooling unit <b>30</b> is fixed to the rack frame <b>20</b>. The server includes a server front surface S<b>1</b>, a server top surface S<b>2</b>, a server rear surface S<b>3</b>, and a server bottom surface S<b>4</b>. The server S is fixed by a portion of the server front surface S<b>1</b>. The first cooling unit <b>30</b> generates cooled cooling air and sends the same to the cooling zone CZ through the discharge port <b>31</b>. For simplicity, the air discharged through the discharge port <b>31</b> is referred to as cooling air, the air flowing through the cooling zone CZ is referred to as internal air, and the air sucked into the suction port <b>32</b> is called suction air.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cooling zone CZ is divided into a first region b and a second region c by a boundary a, which is defined by the server front surface S<b>1</b>. Since the server front surface S<b>1</b> is substantially mounted on the rack frame <b>20</b>, the boundary a may be regarded as the rack frame <b>20</b>. Here, the boundary a is not clearly distinguished like a line, but is conceptually divided based on the discharge port <b>31</b> and the suction port <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the boundary a may be defined as either the front surface S<b>1</b> of the server or the rack frame <b>20</b> within the scope of the present disclosure. In this specification, the boundary a is set as the front surface S<b>1</b> of the server for convenience of description. That is, the space on the left side of the server front surface S<b>1</b> is the first area b and the space on the right side is the second area c.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The internal air passing through the discharge port <b>31</b> returns to the suction port <b>32</b> via a path {circle around (<b>1</b>)} above the server S, a path {circle around (<b>2</b>)} between the servers S, a path {circle around (<b>3</b>)} inside the server S, and a path {circle around (<b>4</b>)} below the server S. The server S is cooled by the internal air passing through the paths {circle around (<b>1</b>)}, {circle around (<b>2</b>)}, {circle around (<b>3</b>)} and {circle around (<b>4</b>)}. Substantially, in cooling the server S, cooling by the path {circle around (<b>3</b>)} inside the server is the main mechanism. Specifically, the server S sucks the cooling air present in the first region b through the front surface S<b>1</b>. The sucked air cools down components such as a CPU, a memory, and a power supply inside the server S, and then the internal air is discharged through the rear surface S<b>3</b>. The internal air is warmed by absorbing heat from the server S, the warmed internal air is sucked into the suction port <b>32</b>. The suction air introduced through the suction port <b>32</b> is cooled again in the first cooling unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first region b includes the discharge port <b>31</b> and the second region c includes the suction port <b>32</b>. In the second region c, the internal air that has been warmed by cooling the server S is sucked into the suction port <b>32</b>. In other words, the cooling air having passed through the first region b cools the cooling zone CZ including the server S in the second region c. When the server S is located above the discharge port <b>31</b> as in Korean Patent No. 10-1718414, it is difficult to smoothly form the paths {circle around (<b>1</b>)}, {circle around (<b>2</b>)}, {circle around (<b>3</b>)}, and {circle around (<b>4</b>)} described above. This is because the discharge port <b>31</b> faces the bottom surface S<b>4</b> of the server, and the cooling air collides with the bottom surface S<b>4</b> of the server. Accordingly, the discharge port <b>31</b> is formed to protrude into the space between the front surface S<b>1</b> and the front door <b>11</b> of the server fastened to the rack frame <b>20</b>. The shortest distance D between the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the server S is determined in consideration of the flow according to fluid mechanics, the amount of the internal air, the flow rate, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A cooling means is provided in the first cooling unit <b>30</b>. Any cooling means may be adopted as long as it is capable of cooling the suction air sucked from the cooling zone CZ. For example, the cooling means may be an evaporator, an air-cooled total heat exchanger, a water-cooled heat exchanger, or a combination thereof. The evaporator is a device configured to absorb heat by evaporation by introducing a low-temperature and low-pressure refrigerant obtained through an expansion valve. The air-cooled total heat exchanger is a device that causes heat exchange to occur between hot air and cold air. The water-cooled heat exchanger is a device that causes heat exchange to occur between suction air and a cold liquid.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The combination is a combination of different cooling means, such as a combination of the evaporator and the air-cooled heat exchanger, a combination of the evaporator and the water-cooled heat exchanger, or a combination of the air-cooled heat exchanger and the water-cooled heat exchanger. The cooling means may include a plurality of evaporators, air-cooled heat exchangers, or water-cooled heat exchangers. For example, several evaporators may be installed. Further, any one of the plurality of evaporators, the plurality of air-cooled heat exchangers, and the plurality of water-cooled heat exchangers may be combined with any one of one evaporator, one air-cooled total heat exchanger, and one water-cooled heat exchanger. For example, the plurality of air-cooled total heat exchangers may be combined with one evaporator.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Optionally, a suction duct <b>40</b> for sucking external air may be provided between the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the front door <b>11</b>, and a discharge duct <b>41</b> for discharging the external air to the outside may be provided between the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the rear door <b>12</b>. Here, the term &#x201c;between&#x201d; means that at least one of the suction duct <b>40</b> and the discharge duct <b>41</b> is attached to the front or rear door <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, or is attached to the first cooling unit <b>30</b>. To this end, a plurality of suction vent holes <b>13</b> and a plurality of discharge vent holes <b>14</b> are provided in the front door <b>11</b> and the rear door <b>12</b>. That is, external air sucked through the suction vent holes <b>13</b> and the suction duct <b>40</b> passes through the first cooling unit <b>30</b>, and is then discharged from the rack housing <b>10</b> through the discharge duct <b>41</b> and the discharge vent holes <b>14</b>. The external air, which will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, is distinguished from air cooled by the cooling means.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A suction packing <b>42</b> and a discharge packing <b>43</b> for sealing may be provided between the suction duct <b>40</b> and the front door <b>11</b> and between the discharge duct <b>41</b> and the rear door <b>12</b>, respectively. External air flowing through the suction duct <b>40</b> and the discharge duct <b>41</b> is prevented from leaking into the cooling zone CZ by the suction packing <b>42</b> and the discharge packing <b>43</b>. In the case where the external air flows into the cooling zone CZ, temperature control of the cooling zone CZ becomes difficult. The suction packing <b>42</b> and the discharge packing <b>43</b> may be placed between the suction duct <b>40</b> and the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and between the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the discharge duct <b>41</b>, respectively. That is, the suction packing <b>42</b> and the discharge packing <b>43</b> may be disposed on either or both sides of one or more of the suction duct <b>40</b> and the discharge duct <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the computing rack device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the space (see D) containing the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the server S is open without being separated. Accordingly, a separation structure for separating the space containing the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the server S is not necessary. Korean Patent No. 10-1718414 discloses a separation plate as the separation structure. In addition, since the first cooling unit <b>30</b> is exposed to the cooling zone CZ, the air of the cooling zone CZ is directly transferred to the first cooling unit <b>30</b> to additionally cool the first cooling unit <b>30</b>. That is, the temperature of the internal air in the cooling zone CZ is utilized in cooling the first cooling unit <b>30</b>. Accordingly, energy required to cool the suction air may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, an example of applying an evaporator as the cooling means will be described. The evaporator has a relatively large cooling effect and a relatively simple structure compared to other cooling means, and is suitable as a cooling means for the computing rack apparatus of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the first cooling unit <b>30</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The first cooling unit <b>30</b> is fixed to the rack frame <b>20</b> by the fixing hole <b>34</b> of the fixing flange <b>33</b>. Of course, the first cooling unit <b>30</b> may be fixed to the rack frame <b>20</b> at the bottom or the middle of the rack housing <b>10</b>. The discharge port <b>31</b> and the suction port <b>32</b> described above may be present in a surface <b>35</b><i>a </i>of the case <b>35</b> facing the server S. That is, the discharge port <b>31</b> and the suction port <b>32</b> are disposed on one of the surfaces forming the case <b>35</b>. In the figure, the top surface of the case <b>35</b> is the same as the surface <b>35</b><i>a </i>facing the server S.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Of course, the suction port <b>32</b> may be located on a side surface of the case <b>35</b> within the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the suction port <b>32</b> may be located at the corner of the case <b>35</b>. As such, the position of the suction port <b>32</b> is determined in consideration of the flow according to fluid dynamics, the amount of the internal air, the flow rate, and the like. However, the discharge port <b>31</b> is preferably located on the surface <b>35</b><i>a </i>facing the server S.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The interior of the first cooling unit <b>30</b> is divided into a third region d and a fourth region e by a first partition <b>36</b>. In the third region d, the evaporator <b>50</b> is located, and the fourth region e contains a compressor <b>60</b> and a condenser <b>61</b> configured to operate the evaporator <b>50</b>. In an extended concept of this configuration, the third region d is where the cooling means is placed, and the fourth region d is an area which is additionally provided to assist the cooling means in cooling. In some cases, when the space for assisting the cooling means in cooling is not necessary, only the third region d may be provided without the fourth region e. In this case, the first partition <b>36</b> may be thermally insulated.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the third region d, the evaporator <b>50</b> for cooling the suction air sucked from the suction port <b>32</b> is positioned. The evaporator <b>50</b> is placed on a support plate <b>52</b>. The support plate <b>52</b> has a plurality of through holes <b>53</b> to suck moisture formed in the third region d and send the sucked moisture to a reservoir <b>54</b>. The cooling air passing through the evaporator <b>50</b> is sent to the discharge port <b>31</b> by a discharge fan <b>51</b>. The discharge fan <b>51</b> may be a Sirocco fan or a crossing fan. The first partition <b>36</b> facing the discharge port <b>31</b> is inclined to direct the flow of the cooling air toward the first region b in an upward direction. In other words, the inclined portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the partition serves to direct the cooling air toward the cooling zone CZ.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The reservoir <b>54</b> is provided with a water level sensor <b>56</b> and a heater <b>55</b>. When it is checked by the water level sensor <b>56</b> that a certain amount of water is stored in the reservoir <b>54</b>, the heater <b>55</b> is turned on to heat the water. Here, the heater <b>55</b> serves as an electric heater to heat water above an evaporation temperature of the water. When the stored water is heated by the heater <b>55</b>, the water is evaporated and discharged into the cooling zone CZ through the third region d in the form of water vapor. The cooling zone (CZ) needs a certain degree of humidity in order to prevent static electricity from causing failure of the server S. Water vapor formed by evaporation caused by the heater <b>55</b> serves as a humidifier assisting in forming the humidity. When the water level sensor <b>56</b> determines that the stored water is insufficient, the heater <b>55</b> is turned off to stop heating the water.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A controller <b>70</b> is mounted in the third region d. The controller <b>70</b> may be a printed circuit board that is provided with necessary components and circuits and is not embedded in a separate case. Since the internal air of the cooling zone CZ maintains an appropriate humidity and temperature, the components and circuits mounted on the printed circuit board are not damaged. Thus, the controller <b>70</b> does not need to be mounted in a separate case unlike the related art. Of course, the controller <b>70</b> may be protected with a simple cover or the like. Since the cover only needs to be opened, there is no need to disassemble the case and check the controller <b>70</b> as in the related art. In addition, when the controller <b>70</b> is provided in the third region d, the distance thereof to the evaporator <b>50</b>, the compressor <b>60</b>, and the like is short, and therefore electrical connections such as power lines, communication lines, and various signal lines for the components are simplified.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The fourth region e is blocked from the third region d by the first partition <b>36</b>. A compressor <b>60</b>, a condenser <b>61</b>, and a discharge fan <b>62</b> are disposed therein. Here, the discharge fan <b>62</b> may be a Sirocco fan or a crossing fan, and may serve to cool the condenser. Due to the condenser <b>61</b> and the compressor <b>60</b>, the internal temperature of the fourth region e is higher than that of the third region d. Other devices not shown in the figure may be added to the fourth region e. For example, the other devices include an auxiliary reservoir, a liquid separator, and a receiver, which are configured in case of overflowing of the expansion valve, the compressor <b>60</b>, and the reservoir <b>54</b>, and an inflow path for introducing external cold air.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">External air flows along a path {circle around (<b>5</b>)} extending along the suction duct <b>40</b>, an air suction passage <b>63</b>, a discharge fan <b>62</b>, an air discharge passage <b>64</b>, and a discharge duct <b>41</b>. Here, the external air flows into the first cooling unit <b>30</b> through the air suction passage <b>63</b>. The external air flows out of the first cooling unit <b>30</b> through the air discharge passage <b>64</b>. The air suction passage <b>63</b> and the air discharge passage <b>64</b> may be implemented as one through hole or a plurality of through holes, for example, or may be implemented as a mesh.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the bottom surface S<b>4</b> of the server according to an embodiment of the present disclosure are spaced apart from each other by a distance D to form an empty space. In other words, unlike the related art (Korean Patent No. 10-1718414), the first device <b>100</b> of the present disclosure does not require a structure such as a separator plate and a suction container for separating the cooling zone and the cooling unit. Accordingly, the manufacturing cost of the first device <b>100</b> may be significantly reduced. A structure having an empty space between the first cooling unit <b>30</b> and the bottom surface S<b>4</b> of the server as described above is called an open structure. In contrast, the conventional structure of Korean Patent No. 10-1718414 is referred to as a closed structure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a second cooling unit <b>30</b><i>a </i>according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Here, the second cooling unit <b>30</b><i>a </i>is the same as the first cooling unit <b>30</b> except for the shape thereof near the discharge port <b>31</b>. In addition, although some of the components constituting the first cooling unit <b>30</b> are slightly changed in shape or mounting positions, the same reference numerals are assigned to the same functions and roles. Accordingly, redundant description of the same parts will be omitted.

Accordingly, the suction duct <b>40</b> is attached to the flat surface. Since the side surface of the case <b>35</b><i>b </i>to which the suction duct <b>40</b> is attached is flat, a second partition <b>36</b><i>b </i>to separate the third region d and the fourth regions e may be flat or slightly inclined. In addition, the support plate <b>52</b> supporting the evaporator <b>50</b> is supported by a first fixing part <b>37</b>. When the case <b>35</b><i>b </i>is made flat, the structure of the case <b>35</b><i>b </i>may be simplified, and thus manufacturing costs may be reduced. In the case <b>35</b><i>b, </i>the lower portion of the second partition <b>36</b><i>b </i>may be recessed to have a predetermined width.
