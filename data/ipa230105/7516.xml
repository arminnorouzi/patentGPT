generally to communication systems, and more particularly, to a configuration for signaling enabling a state transition of a transmission mode.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various telecommunication services such as telephony, video, data, messaging, and broadcasts. Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. 5G NR includes services associated with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. Some aspects of wireless communication may comprise direct communication between devices based on sidelink. There exists a need for further improvements in sidelink technology. These improvements may also  be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

A wireless PLC is desirable for flexible and simple deployment. A wireless PLC may be configured to control a plurality of S/As, and may have strict latency requirements (e.g., within 1 ms) and a  reliability requirement of 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>error rate. IIoT devices may experience challenges in RF environments due to blockage of communication signals from nearby machinery.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Multiple TRPs utilized together may for an mTRP system, which may be deployed in an effort to enhance data transfer. A single TRP may be used in instances where the link between the TRP and the IIoT device is consistently good, e.g., consistently meeting particular latency and/or quality levels. However, in instances where the link between the TRP and the IIoT device becomes degraded or unreliable, a switch may be made to provide a different link that is more reliable. In some instances, waiting for the IIoT device to transmit an indication of a degradation of link quality (e.g., NAK) may be inefficient due to latency requirements for IIoT.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A UE (e.g., PLC) may have one or more sidelinks to allow for multi-path diversity. If a sidelink is blocked or not reliable, another sidelink, or a Uu link, may be utilized to ensure added reliability. Similarly, if a Uu link is blocked, one or more sidelinks may be used to provide transmit diversity. Path switching between sidelink and Uu assists in improving reliability and latency of wireless communication. Multi-path diversity may allow for joint sidelink and Uu operation to provide a high reliability. However, such reliability may be at the expense of an increase in power consumption. switching between transmission modes may be based on the channel state information (CSI) of a link. Efficient and accurate switching may be referred to as seamless switching in some aspects. For example, a single TRP or sidelink may be sufficient (e.g., meet quality, reliability, etc. thresholds) in some instances. The base station may switch a transmission state to mTRP or joint sidelink and Uu operation in instances where the link has degraded or has fallen below a threshold. The change in the link quality may be indicated via a CSI measurement and feedback.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network <b>100</b>.

Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1  is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz).

The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) carries DCI within one or more  control channel elements (CCEs) (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 CCEs), each CCE including six RE groups (REGs), each REG including 12 consecutive REs in an OFDM symbol of an RB. A PDCCH within one BWP may be referred to as a control resource set (CORESET). A UE is configured to monitor PDCCH candidates in a PDCCH search space (e.g., common search space, UE-specific search space) during PDCCH monitoring occasions on the CORESET, where the PDCCH candidates have different DCI formats and different aggregation levels. Additional BWPs may be located at greater and/or lower frequencies across the channel bandwidth. A primary synchronization signal (PSS) may be within symbol 2 of particular subframes of a frame. The PSS is used by a UE <b>104</b> to determine subframe/symbol timing and a physical layer identity. A secondary synchronization signal (SSS) may be within symbol 4 of particular subframes of a frame. The SSS is used by a UE to determine a physical layer cell identity group number and radio frame timing. Based on the physical layer identity and the physical layer cell identity group number, the UE can determine a physical cell identifier (PCI). Based on the PCI, the UE can determine the locations of the DM-RS. The physical broadcast channel (PBCH), which carries a master information block (MIB), may be logically grouped with the PSS and SSS to form a synchronization signal (SS)/PBCH block (also referred to as SS block (SSB)).

The slot structure may be within a 5G/NR frame structure in some examples. In other examples, the slot structure may be within an LTE frame structure. Although the following description may be focused on 5G NR, the concepts described herein may be applicable to other similar areas, such as LTE, LTE-A, CDMA, GSM, and other wireless technologies. The example slot structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is merely one example, and other sidelink communication may have a different frame structure and/or different channels for sidelink communication. A frame (10 ms) may be divided into 10 equally sized subframes (1 ms). Each subframe may include one or more time slots. Subframes may also include mini-slots, which may include 7, 4, or 2 symbols. Each slot may include 7 or 14 symbols, depending on the slot configuration. For slot configuration 0, each slot may include 14 symbols, and for slot configuration 1, each slot may include 7 symbols. Diagram <b>400</b> illustrates a single resource block of a single slot transmission, e.g., which may correspond to a 0.5 ms transmission time interval (TTI). A physical sidelink control channel may be configured to occupy multiple physical resource blocks (PRBs), e.g., 10, 12, 15, 20, or 25 PRBs. The PSCCH may be limited to a single sub-channel. A PSCCH duration may be configured to be 2 symbols or 3 symbols, for example. A sub-channel may comprise 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, or 100 PRBs, for example. The resources for a sidelink transmission may be selected from a resource pool including one or more subchannels. As a non-limiting example, the resource pool may include between 1-27 subchannels. A PSCCH size may be established for a resource pool, e.g., as between 10-100% of one subchannel for a duration of 2 symbols or 3 symbols. The diagram <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example in which the PSCCH occupies about 50% of a subchannel, as one example to illustrate the concept of PSCCH occupying a portion of a subchannel. The physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) occupies at least one subchannel. The PSCCH may include a first portion of sidelink control  information (SCI), which may be referred to as SCI-1, and the PSSCH may include a second portion of SCI (which may be referred to as SCI-2) in some examples.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">SCI may comprise SCI 1-A in PSCCH. SCI 1-A may comprise a priority of 3 bits. For frequency resource assignment, the bits may depend on the number of slot reservation and the number of subchannels. The time resource assignment may comprise 5 or 9 bits for 2 or 3 reservations. The resource reservation period may comprise bits based on the number of allowed periods. The DMRS pattern may comprise bits based on the number of configured patterns. The format of SCI 2 may comprise 2 bits. A beta offset rate matching for SCI 2 may comprise 2 bits. A DMRS port may comprise 1 bit indicating one or two data layers. In some aspects, the MCS may comprise 5 bits, while additional MCS table may comprise 0-2 bits. The PSFCH overhead indicator may comprise 0 or 1 bit.

SCI 2 may comprise SCI 2-B only fields (e.g., NACK only groupcast) comprising a zone identifier comprised of 12 bits, or a communication range comprised of 4 bits. SCI 2 may be intended for receivers for decoding PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">A resource grid may be used to represent the frame structure. Each time slot may include a resource block (RB) (also referred to as physical RBs (PRBs)) that extends 12 consecutive subcarriers. The resource grid is divided into multiple resource elements (REs). The number of bits carried by each RE depends on the modulation scheme. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, some of the REs may include control information in PSCCH and some REs may include demodulation RS (DMRS). At least one symbol may be used for feedback. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates examples with two symbols for a physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH) with adjacent gap symbols.

The position of any of the data, DMRS, SCI, feedback, gap symbols, and/or LBT symbols may be different than the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Multiple slots may be aggregated together in some aspects.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">A UE (e.g., such as UE <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may transmit a sidelink transmission, e.g., comprising a control channel (e.g., PSCCH) and/or a corresponding data channel (e.g., PSSCH), that may be received by one or more other UEs (e.g., such as one or more UEs <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A control channel may include information (e.g., sidelink control information (SCI)) for decoding the data channel including reservation information, such as information about time and/or frequency resources that are reserved for the data channel transmission. For example, the SCI may indicate a number of TTIs, as well as the RBs that will be occupied by the data transmission. The SCI may also be used by receiving devices to avoid interference by refraining from transmitting on the reserved resources. The UEs may each be capable of sidelink transmission in addition to sidelink reception. The sidelink transmissions may be unicast, broadcast or multicast to nearby devices. For example, a UE may transmit sidelink communication intended for receipt by other UEs within a range of the transmitting UE. Additionally/alternatively, an RSU <b>107</b> may transmit or receive sidelink communication from with a UE.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Sidelink communication may be based on different types or modes of resource allocation mechanisms. In a first resource allocation mode (which may be referred to herein as &#x201c;Mode 1&#x201d;), centralized resource allocation may be provided by a network entity. For example, a base station <b>102</b> or <b>180</b> may determine resources for sidelink communication and may allocate resources to different UEs <b>104</b> to use for sidelink transmissions. In this first mode, a UE receives the allocation of sidelink resources from the base station <b>102</b> or <b>180</b>. In a second resource allocation mode (which may be referred to herein as &#x201c;Mode 2&#x201d;), distributed resource allocation may be provided. In Mode 2, each UE may autonomously determine resources to use for sidelink transmission. In order to coordinate the selection of sidelink resources by individual UEs, each UE may use a sensing technique to monitor for resource reservations by other sidelink UEs and may select resources for sidelink transmissions from unreserved resources. Devices communicating based on sidelink, may determine one or more radio resources in the time and frequency domain that are used by other  devices in order to select transmission resources that avoid collisions with other devices. The sidelink transmission and/or the resource reservation may be periodic or aperiodic, where a UE may reserve resources for transmission in a current slot and up to two future slots (discussed below).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Thus, in the second mode (e.g., Mode 2), individual UEs may autonomously select resources for sidelink transmission, e.g., without a central entity such as a base station indicating the resources for the device. A first UE may reserve the selected resources in order to inform other UEs about the resources that the first UE intends to use for sidelink transmission(s).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">In some examples, the resource selection for sidelink communication may be based on a sensing-based mechanism. For instance, before selecting a resource for a data transmission, a UE may first determine whether resources have been reserved by other UEs.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">For example, as part of a sensing mechanism for resource allocation mode 2, the UE may determine (e.g., sense) whether the selected sidelink resource has been reserved by other UE(s) before selecting a sidelink resource for a data transmission. If the UE determines that the sidelink resource has not been reserved by other UEs, the UE may use the selected sidelink resource for transmitting the data, e.g., in a PSSCH transmission. The UE may estimate or determine which radio resources (e.g., sidelink resources) may be in-use and/or reserved by others by detecting and decoding sidelink control information (SCI) transmitted by other UEs. The UE may use a sensing-based resource selection algorithm to estimate or determine which radio resources are in-use and/or reserved by others. The UE may receive SCI from another UE that includes reservation information based on a resource reservation field comprised in the SCI. The UE may continuously monitor for (e.g., sense) and decode SCI from peer UEs. The SCI may include reservation information, e.g., indicating slots and RBs that a particular UE has selected for a future transmission. The UE may exclude resources that are used and/or reserved by other UEs from a set of candidate resources for sidelink transmission by the UE, and the UE may select/reserve resources for a sidelink transmission from the resources that are unused and therefore form the set of candidate resources. The UE may continuously perform sensing for SCI with resource reservations in order to maintain a set of candidate resources from which the UE may select one or more resources for a sidelink transmission. Once the UE selects a candidate resource, the UE may transmit SCI indicating its own reservation of the  resource for a sidelink transmission. The number of resources (e.g., sub-channels per subframe) reserved by the UE may depend on the size of data to be transmitted by the UE. Although the example is described for a UE receiving reservations from another UE, the reservations may also be received from an RSU or other device communicating based on sidelink.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are examples <b>500</b>, <b>620</b> are examples of mTRP systems.

The plurality of TRPs <b>704</b> may be associated with the base station <b>706</b>. The base station <b>706</b> may comprise a centralized unit or server that may communicate with the IIoT device <b>702</b> via one or more of the plurality of TRPs <b>704</b>. For IIoT, ultra-reliability is required due in part to stringent latency requirements (e.g., within 1 ms). IIoT devices may utilize a reduced data rate, such as a few kbps to Mbps. IIoT devices may experience challenges in RF environments due to blockage of communication signals from nearby machinery. Multiple TRPs utilized together may for an mTRP system, which may be deployed in an effort to enhance data transfer. A single TRP may be used in instances where the link between the TRP and the IIoT device is consistently good, e.g., consistently meeting particular latency and/or quality levels. However, in instances where the link between the TRP and the IIoT device becomes degraded or unreliable, a switch may be made to provide a different link that is more reliable. In some instances, waiting for the IIoT device to transmit an indication of a degradation of link quality (e.g., NAK) may be inefficient due to latency requirements for IIoT. In IIoT, sidelink may enable direct programmable logical controller (PLC) and  sensors/actuators (S/As) communication. A wireless PLC may provide flexible and simple deployment. A PLC may be configured to control 20-50 S/As. Wireless PLCs may have a latency of 1-2 ms and reliability requirements on the order of a 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>error rate. Communication through a base station may require multiple over the air signals, which may affect latency and reliability. IIoT traffic may be deterministic and may have small packet sizes of approximately 32-256 Bytes. The bandwidth for such communication may be low, such as 2 RBs in some cases. S/As may exchange wireless communication as a UE and may have reduced UE capabilities that correspond to bandwidth and processing power.

The example <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> includes a UE <b>802</b> (e.g., PLC), a plurality of sensors <b>806</b> (e.g., sensor1, sensor 2), and a base station <b>804</b>. The sensors may each correspond to an S/A, in some aspects. The UE <b>802</b> may be configured to communicate with the base station <b>804</b> via a Uu link, while the UE <b>802</b> and may be configured to communicate with the sensors via sidelink. The sensors may communicate with the base station via a respective Uu link. The UE <b>802</b> having one or more sidelinks may allow for multi-path diversity. If a sidelink is blocked or not reliable, another sidelink, or a Uu link, may be utilized to ensure added reliability. Similarly, if a Uu link is blocked, one or more sidelinks may be used to provide transmit diversity. Path switching between sidelink and Uu assists in improving reliability and latency of wireless communication. Multi-path diversity may allow for joint sidelink and Uu operation to provide a high reliability. However, such reliability may be at the expense of an increase in power consumption. In some aspects, switching between transmission modes may be based on the channel state information (CSI) of a link. Efficient and accurate switching may be referred to as seamless switching in some aspects. For example, a single TRP or sidelink may be sufficient (e.g., meet quality, reliability, etc. thresholds) in some instances. The base station may switch a transmission state to mTRP or joint sidelink and Uu operation in instances where the link has degraded or has fallen below a threshold. The change in the link quality may be indicated via a CSI measurement and feedback. However, constant CSI feedback may introduce an increase in signaling overhead. </p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">Aspects presented herein provide a configuration for signaling that enables a state transition of transmission mode.

The UE may be configured to transmit a feedback signal comprising at least one bit that indicates a state transition based on the at least one bit. In some aspects, the feedback indicating the state transition may include a single bit. For example, the UE may operate in the single TRP state <b>1102</b> and may transmit a feedback signal comprising a first bit (e.g., Bit<b>1</b> <b>1114</b>) or a second bit (e.g., Bit<b>2</b> <b>1116</b>), where the bit  transmitted within the feedback signal indicates a request to switch to a particular state. In some aspects, the first bit (e.g., Bit<b>1</b> <b>1114</b>) may indicate a switch to a first mTRP mode (e.g., mTRP mode1 <b>1104</b>), while the second bit (e.g., Bit<b>2</b> <b>1116</b>) may indicate a switch to a second mTRP mode (e.g., mTRP mode2 <b>1106</b>). The UE, while in the first mTRP mode (e.g., mTRP model <b>1104</b>) may measure the at least one reference signal and may remain in the first mTRP mode if the measurements indicate that the link is good, such that the UE does not transmit a feedback signal (e.g., no feedback <b>1110</b>). The UE may switch from the first mTRP mode to the single TRP mode if the link quality is degraded or falls below a threshold, such that the UE transmits the feedback signal comprising the first bit (e.g., Bit<b>1</b> <b>1114</b>). The UE, while in the second mTRP mode (e.g., mTRP mode2 <b>1106</b>) may measure the at least one reference signal and may remain in the second mTRP mode if the measurements indicate that the link is good, such that the UE does not transmit a feedback signal (e.g., no feedback <b>1112</b>). The UE may switch from the second mTRP mode to the single TRP mode if the link quality is degraded or falls below a threshold, such that the UE transmits the feedback signal comprising the second bit (e.g., Bit<b>2</b> <b>1116</b>). In some aspects, if the UE sends a feedback signal comprising an invalid bit, then the base station may be configured to initiate a procedure to verify the transmission state of the UE. For example, if the UE is operating in mTRP model <b>1104</b> and the UE determines that the link is degraded or has fallen below the threshold, but sends a feedback signal comprising Bit<b>2</b> <b>1116</b>, the base station may initiate a procedure to verify the current transmission state of the UE based on receiving an invalid feedback bit.

As such, receipt of an invalid feedback bit, by the base station, may trigger the procedure to verify the current transmission state of the UE. For example, the base station may transmit a signal comprising a request for the current transmission state of the UE. The signal may be provided to a TRP for delivery to the UE. The UE, in response to receiving the request for the current transmission state of the UE, may transmit a report indicating the current transmission state of the UE.
