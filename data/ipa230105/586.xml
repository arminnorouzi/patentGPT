Biopsies can include surgical excisional biopsies and stereotactic and ultrasound guided needle breast biopsies. In the case of image directed biopsy, the radiologist or other physician may take a small sample of the irregular tissue for laboratory analysis. If the biopsy proves to be malignant, additional surgery (e.g., a lumpectomy or a mastectomy) may be required. In the case of needle biopsies, the patient may return to the radiologist a day or more later, and the biopsy site (the site of the lesion) may need to be relocated in preparation for the surgery. An imaging system, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MM) or x-ray may be used to locate the biopsy site. In order to assist the relocation of the biopsy site, a marker may be placed at the time of the biopsy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of markers used after breast biopsies to mark the location where the biopsied tissue was removed is described in the following U.S. Patents: U.S. Pat.

In some contexts, a placed marker may not completely correspond to the biopsy site when the marker is relocated. For instance, the marker may migrate to another nearby location during the intervening time between the biopsy procedure and subsequent follow up procedures. Migration of the biopsy site marker can cause difficulties when identifying the biopsy site during subsequent follow-up procedures.

The accompanying drawings incorporated in and forming a part of the specification illustrate several aspects of the present invention, and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention; it being understood, however, that this invention is not limited to the precise arrangements shown.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The following description of certain examples of the invention should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention. Other examples, features, aspects, embodiments, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description, which is by way of illustration, one of the best modes contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other different and obvious aspects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions should be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It may be beneficial to be able to mark the location or margins of a lesion, whether temporarily or permanently, prior to or immediately after removing or sampling it. Marking prior to removal may help to ensure that the entire lesion is excised, if desired. Alternatively, if the lesion were inadvertently removed in its entirety, marking the biopsy site immediately after the procedure would enable reestablishment of its location for future identification.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once a marker is positioned at a biopsy site, it may be desirable for the marker to remain visible under ultrasound. It may also be desirable to make the marker readily identifiable relative to other structural features of a patient. For instance, it may be desirable for the marker to be distinguishable under ultrasound visualization from microcalcifications to avoid inadvertently characterizing the marker as a microcalcification during subsequent ultrasonic examinations. Generally, microcalcifications are used in the field to identify suspicious lesions or masses. Thus, it is generally desirable for the ultrasound view to be distinguishable as a marker and not inadvertently identified as a new mass.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">I. EXEMPLARY MARKER</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Aspects presented herein relate to devices and procedures for manufacturing a marker for percutaneously marking a biopsy cavity (<b>10</b>) having surrounding tissue (<b>30</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>. For instance, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a marker (<b>100</b>) may be initially placed in the biopsy cavity (<b>10</b>) to facilitate relocation of the biopsy site. Marker (<b>100</b>) may comprise a carrier (<b>120</b>) and a marker element (<b>12</b>). Carrier (<b>120</b>) generally includes a bioabsorbable marker material (<b>122</b>). Thus, carrier (<b>120</b>) is generally configured for absorption into a patient after placement of marker (<b>100</b>) within the biopsy cavity (<b>10</b>). In some examples, carrier (<b>120</b>) can include a plurality of microbubbles to enhance visualization of carrier (<b>120</b>) under ultrasound. As will be described in greater detail below, marker material (<b>122</b>) is generally bioabsorbable such that marker material (<b>122</b>) may be generally absorbed into the patient's tissue over time. In the present example, marker material (<b>122</b>) comprises a hydrogel that is initially in a dehydrated state. Although a hydrogel is used in the present example, it should be understood that in other examples marker material (<b>122</b>) may comprise other known bioabsorbable materials</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present example, marker (<b>100</b>) further includes a marker element (<b>12</b>) that is generally not bioabsorbable. Marker element (<b>12</b>) may comprise a radiopaque or echogenic marker embedded within the bioabsorbable marker material (<b>122</b>) of carrier (<b>120</b>). For instance, marker element (<b>12</b>) may comprise metal, hard plastic, or other radiopaque or hyperechoic materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. In other examples, marker (<b>100</b>) may be formed without a marker element (<b>12</b>). In still other examples, marker (<b>100</b>) may be formed with only marker element (<b>12</b>) such that carrier (<b>120</b>) is omitted and marker element (<b>12</b>) is in a &#x201c;bare&#x201d; form. In other words, in some examples marker (<b>100</b>) is formed of only carrier (<b>120</b>) as a bare clip.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Marker material (<b>122</b>) is generally expandable once disposed within a patient at a biopsy site. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, the initially dehydrated marker material (<b>122</b>) may absorb fluid from the surrounding tissue (<b>30</b>) into which it is inserted. In response to this absorption of fluid, maker material (<b>122</b>) may swell, thereby permitting carrier (<b>120</b>) to fill a cavity formed at a biopsy site by removal of tissue samples during a biopsy procedure. Biodegradable materials may be particularly suitable in applications where it is desired that natural tissue growth be permitted to completely or partially replace the implanted material over time. Accordingly, biocompatibility is ensured and the natural mechanical parameters of the tissue are substantially restored to those of the pre-damaged condition.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Marker (<b>100</b>) may be inserted into the body either surgically via an opening in the body cavity (<b>30</b>), or through a minimally invasive procedure using such devices as a catheter, introducer or similar type insertion device. Marker (<b>100</b>) may be delivered immediately after removal of the tissue specimen using the same device used to remove the tissue specimen itself. Follow-up noninvasive detection techniques, such as x-ray mammography or ultrasound may then be used by the physician to identify, locate, and monitor the biopsy cavity site over a period of time via marker (<b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Marker (<b>100</b>) of the present example is large enough to be readily visible to a clinician under x-ray or ultrasonic viewing, for example; yet small enough to be able to be percutaneously deployed into the biopsy cavity and to not cause any difficulties with the patient.

Endpiece (<b>171</b>) comprises a tip (<b>172</b>), a ramp (<b>210</b>) having a ramp surface (<b>212</b>), and a marker engaging element (<b>240</b>). Ramp surface (<b>212</b>) aids in directing marker (<b>300</b>) from internal lumen (<b>165</b>) through side opening (<b>164</b>).

Such an arrangement is advantageous to reduce the possibility that marker (<b>300</b>), upon moving past marker engaging element (<b>240</b>), may become lodged between marker engagement element (<b>240</b>) and ramp (<b>212</b>). In some versions, marker engaging element (<b>240</b>), ramp (<b>210</b>), and/or tip (<b>172</b>) are formed of, or include, a material that is relatively more radiopaque than the wall of cannula (<b>162</b>).

EXEMPLARY BIOPSY SITE MARKERS FOR LIMITED MIGRATION</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some examples it may be desirable to include certain features within a marker similar to marker (<b>100</b>) to reduce a risk of the marker to migrate when placed within tissue. For instance, some markers may be prone to migration after placement of a biopsy site due to movement of tissue in the intervening time between marker placement and subsequent follow-up procedures. As a result, such markers may introduce challenges with identifying the biopsy site during subsequent follow-up procedures. Accordingly, it may be desirable to incorporate features into a marker similar to marker (<b>100</b>) to maintain the marker in a fixed position within tissue over time. Although several examples are described herein that incorporate the features outlined above, it should be understood that various alternative combinations can be used without departing from the basic principles described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A.

Unless otherwise explicitly noted herein, marker (<b>500</b>) is substantially similar to marker (<b>100</b>) described above. For instance, like with marker (<b>100</b>), marker (<b>500</b>) of the present example includes a marker element (<b>512</b>). In some examples, marker element (<b>512</b>) can be substantially similar to marker element (<b>12</b>) described above. Thus, marker element (<b>512</b>) can be generally configured as non-bioabsorbable and radiopaque and/or echogenic to enhance visualization over time. Unlike marker (<b>100</b>) described above, marker (<b>500</b>) of the present example is generally configured as a bare marker such that marker (<b>500</b>) does not include a structure similar to carrier (<b>120</b>) described above. However, in other examples, marker element (<b>512</b>) may be used with a carrier such as carrier (<b>120</b>) discussed above.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Marker element (<b>512</b>) of the present example is composed of nitinol. In certain embodiments, marker element (<b>512</b>) is composed of a nitinol mesh, wire, or stint like material. Additionally, in some examples marker element (<b>512</b>) can be configured to promote tissue ingrowth. For instance, in some examples, marker element (<b>512</b>) is composed of a nitinol mesh wherein the holes of the mesh are large enough so the tissue can grow through the holes, which fixes element marker (<b>512</b>) to the tissue. Similarly, marker element (<b>512</b>) can comprise a variety of materials such as metal, hard plastic, and/or etc.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Marker element (<b>512</b>) of the present example is configured to have a general &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape. In particular, marker element (<b>512</b>) of the present example comprises first arm (<b>530</b>) (also may be referred to as a &#x201c;first portion&#x201d;) and second arm (<b>540</b>) (also may be referred to as a &#x201c;second portion&#x201d;) joined along an edge and extending out, forming the &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape. Further, a first tine (<b>535</b>) is joined to first arm (<b>530</b>) to extend outwardly from first arm (<b>530</b>) and a second tine (<b>545</b>) is joined to second arm (<b>540</b>) to extend outwardly from second arm (<b>540</b>). In some examples, tines (<b>535</b>, <b>545</b>) may also be referred to as an anchor, a ground, and/or etc. Each of arms (<b>530</b>, <b>540</b>) and tines (<b>535</b>, <b>545</b>) may have a thickness and width as required to maintain the shape of marker element (<b>512</b>). In some examples, tines (<b>535</b>, <b>545</b>) are configured to have rough or sharp edges to enhance tines (<b>535</b>, <b>545</b>) ability to grip surfaces such as tissue.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Marker element (<b>512</b>) is configured to be compressible so that the acute angle between first arm (<b>530</b>) and second arm (<b>540</b>) will become smaller when a force is applied inwardly to first arm (<b>530</b>) and/or second arm (<b>540</b>). Additionally, marker element (<b>512</b>) is resiliently biased such that marker element (<b>512</b>) is configured to transition from a compressed state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) to an extended state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) when the force is reduced or removed from first arm (<b>530</b>) and/or second arm (<b>540</b>). In other words, first arm (<b>530</b>) and second arm (<b>540</b>) are generally configured to be displaced outwardly when deployed at a biopsy site. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, in some examples, marker (<b>500</b>) can be initially confined within an outer cannula (<b>550</b>) or other means of confinement such as a tube, a carrier similar to carrier (<b>120</b>), or other structure prior to deployment to the biopsy site. While located in outer cannula (<b>550</b>) marker element (<b>512</b>) is in a compressed state. Upon deployment from outer cannula (<b>550</b>) into the biopsy site, marker element (<b>512</b>) returns to an extended state, wherein first arm (<b>530</b>) and second arm (<b>540</b>) extend away from each other. When marker element (<b>512</b>) returns to an extended state, first tine (<b>535</b>) and second tine (<b>545</b>) press into biopsy site wall (<b>560</b>), securing the marker element (<b>512</b>) to biopsy site wall (<b>560</b>). As a consequence, the widened &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape of marker element (<b>512</b>) caused by the increased distance between first arm (<b>530</b>) and second arm (<b>540</b>) can act as an anchor to hold marker element (<b>512</b>) at a given position within tissue. Additionally, the movement of marker element (<b>512</b>) from the compressed state to the extended state can cause marker element (<b>512</b>) to anchor to tissue. The rough or sharp edges of tines (<b>535</b>, <b>545</b>) improves tines (<b>535</b>, <b>545</b>) ability to grip the biopsy site wall (<b>560</b>). Additionally, the edges of arms (<b>530</b>, <b>540</b>) may also include rough or sharp edges to improve the gripping ability of marker (<b>500</b>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although marker element (<b>512</b>) of the present example is configured with a &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape, it should be understood that various alternative shapes may be used. For instance, in one alternative configuration of marker element (<b>512</b>), the shape of marker element (<b>512</b>) may be of an irregular shape referred to as a &#x201c;target.&#x201d; In this configuration, marker element (<b>512</b>) may be formed of one or more wires defining two opposing tightly wound coils. The two tightly wound coils may be aligned along a common axis with a loose coil joining the two opposing tightly wound coils together. The tightly wound coils may be formed by the one or more wires being wound in circular or oval-shaped coils positioned closely together. The loose coil may be a section of wire joining the two coils. The loose coil itself may include one or more coils as it extends from one tightly wound coil to the other. In this configuration, when marker element (<b>512</b>) is viewed from the side (e.g., angle of view parallel to the common axis), the tightly wound coils may appear as a circular or oval-shaped outline of the &#x201c;target.&#x201d; Meanwhile, the loose coil may appear as an S-shaped pattern extending from one side of the circular or oval-shaped outline to the other. In some versions of the &#x201c;target,&#x201d; the loose coil may also include one or more thick or round portions to make the center of the &#x201c;target&#x201d; more readily identifiable.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another alternative configuration of marker element (<b>512</b>), the shape of marker element (<b>512</b>) may be of a &#x201c;3D M&#x201d; shape. In this configuration, marker element (<b>512</b>) may be formed of a flat sheet material similar to the &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape described above. However, unlike the &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape, the &#x201c;3D M&#x201d; shape may include two additional bends to form an M or W shape when viewed from one side. Thus, a total of three bends may be used. The three bends may together define a four discrete sections of material. In some examples, one or more sections may include one or more cut-outs, bores, or openings therein. Such a cut-out may be desirable to improve visualization from the top or bottom of the M-shaped pattern using an imaging medium such as x-ray where depth visualization may be difficult.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In yet another alternative configuration of marker element (<b>512</b>), the shape of marker element (<b>512</b>) may be of a &#x201c;double loop&#x201d; shape. In this configuration, marker element (<b>512</b>) may be formed of one or more wires. The one or more wires may define two circular or oval-shaped loops joined together. To improve visualization, the two loops may be oriented at different angles. For instance, a first loop may define a first plane and a second loop may define a second plane. In some examples, the first plane may be offset from the second plane by approximately 90 degrees. From above, this configuration may have the appearance of a cross. In other examples, the particular angle of offset may be varied such as the first plane and second plane being offset by approximately 45 degrees to have an X-shape when viewed from the top.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In still another alternative configuration of marker element (<b>512</b>), the shape of marker element (<b>512</b>) may be of a &#x201c;funnel.&#x201d; In this configuration, marker element (<b>512</b>) may be formed of one or more wires. The one or more wires may define a helical or spiral pattern, with the diameter of the helical or spiral pattern decreasing with each successive coil, thereby forming a frustoconical-shaped pattern.

However, unlike marker element (<b>12</b>), marker element (<b>612</b>) of the present example includes multiple a marker materials (<b>622</b>, <b>624</b>). Marker materials (<b>622</b>, <b>624</b>) of the present examples are generally configured to have varying material properties that effect the retraction and/or expansion thereof such that marker (<b>600</b>) can transition from a relatively large or extended volume to a relatively small volume. For instance, in the present example an outer marker material (<b>622</b>) is disposed around a structure of inner marker material (<b>624</b>). As will be described in greater detail below, outer marker material (<b>622</b>) is generally configured to dissolve over time within a patient to thereby providing a means for rapidly retracting the length of marker (<b>600</b>). In some examples, outer marker material (<b>622</b>) may also expand before dissolving, in such examples, this material property may be used to expand inner marker material (<b>624</b>) initially to lodge one or more anchor features of inner marker material (<b>624</b>) into tissue to initially anchor marker element (<b>612</b>) within tissue.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Marker materials (<b>622</b>, <b>624</b>) are generally positioned in filled or layered arrangement. For instance, in some examples both marker materials (<b>622</b>, <b>624</b>) form a prolate spheroid shape when in a dehydrated condition. In this configuration, inner marker material (<b>624</b>) forms a structural wound spring core that is wrapped by a filler marker material (<b>622</b>) also with a prolate spheroid form. Thus, marker (<b>600</b>) generally defines an elongate prolate spheroid configuration. In the present configuration, inner marker material (<b>624</b>) is shown as being centrally positioned within filler marker material (<b>622</b>). However, it should be understood that in other examples inner marker material (<b>624</b>) can have a variety of positions within filler marker material (<b>622</b>). Additionally, it should be understood that in other examples inner marker material (<b>624</b>) may be in the form of a rectangular spring, wherein both the marker material (<b>622</b>, <b>624</b>) form a mirrored wedge, with a profile as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, filler marker material (<b>622</b>) is generally absorbable such that filler marker material (<b>622</b>) is configured to degrade over time within a patient. Filler marker material (<b>622</b>) in the present example is formed of any suitable bioabsorbable material such as hydrogel, collagen, and/or etc. Additionally, such materials can be configured to have varying absorption properties. For instance, in some examples, filler marker material (<b>622</b>) can be configured to absorb relatively slowly over time leading to slow contraction of inner marker material (<b>624</b>). Yet in other examples, filler marker material (<b>622</b>) can be configured to absorb relatively quickly over time leading to rapid contraction of inner marker material (<b>624</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In use, marker (<b>600</b>) is initially placed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>.

As filler marker material (<b>622</b>) dissolves, inner marker material (<b>624</b>) remains and begins to expand or contract in response to movement of filler marker material (<b>622</b>). For instance, in some examples, filler marker material (<b>624</b>) may initially expand as moisture is absorbed by filler marker material (<b>624</b>). This expansion may initially cause an anchor portion, barb, or other structure of inner marker material (<b>624</b>) to be driven into tissue by filler marker material (<b>624</b>) expanding the structure of inner marker material (<b>624</b>). Upon absorption of filler marker material (<b>624</b>), inner marker material (<b>624</b>) may then retract into the space left by absorption of filler marker material (<b>622</b>).

For instance, in other examples the initial geometry of outer marker material (<b>622</b>) can be varied to influence the profile of marker (<b>600</b>) after at least some hydration. In addition, it should be understood that the particular shape and/or size of marker (<b>600</b>) can change throughout the course of hydration.

However, unlike carrier (<b>120</b>), carrier (<b>1420</b>) of the present example includes multiple marker materials (<b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>).

For instance, in the present example an outer marker material (<b>1422</b>) is disposed on outside edges of carrier (<b>1420</b>). A middle marker material (<b>1424</b>) lies inside of outer marker material (<b>1422</b>). Finally, an inner marker material (<b>1426</b>) lies along the center of carrier (<b>1420</b>). As will be described in greater detail below, marker materials (<b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>) are generally configured to be flexible enough to allow the carrier (<b>1420</b>) to be in a pad form to be rolled prior to deployment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, thereby providing a means for rapidly unrolling the length of marker (<b>1400</b>).

For instance, in some examples marker materials (<b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>) form a rolled pad when in a dehydrated condition before deployment. It should be understood that in other examples inner marker material (<b>1426</b>) can have a variety of positions within carrier (<b>1420</b>).

However, it should be understood that marker element (<b>1412</b>) can be placed in various alternative positions either within inner marker material (<b>1426</b>) or partially within inner marker material (<b>1426</b>) and partially within middle marker material (<b>1424</b>) or outer marker material (<b>1422</b>).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> shows marker (<b>1400</b>) in a deployed state after marker (<b>1400</b>) is positioned within tissue. To reach this state, marker (<b>1400</b>) can be rolled to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> from a natural state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>. In this state, carrier (<b>1420</b>) can unroll towards the natural state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> as marker materials (<b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>) hydrate. In some examples, marker materials (<b>1422</b>, <b>1424</b>, <b>1426</b>) can be configured to affect the rate of unrolling and/or the shape during unrolling. For instance, inner marker material (<b>1426</b>) can be configured to absorb moisture relatively quickly and thereby exhibit relatively high degradation or quick expansion. This property can be used to drive unrolling of marker (<b>1400</b>). Meanwhile, while middle marker material (<b>1424</b>) can be configured to expand relatively slowly to provide structural stability and/or durability. Finally, outer marker material (<b>1422</b>) exhibits can be configured to absorb fluid rapidly to also drive unrolling of marker (<b>1400</b>). These expansion properties, together with the geometry of carrier (<b>1420</b>) pad form, result in marker (<b>1400</b>) rapidly expanding in size. In some examples, the surface area of marker (<b>1400</b>) can expand to &#xbd; to &#x2154; size. As a consequence, the rapid expansion of marker (<b>1400</b>) can grip the biopsy cavity such that carrier (<b>1420</b>) can act as an anchor to hold marker (<b>1400</b>) at a given position within tissue.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the present example, the approximate profile of marker (<b>1400</b>) remains generally rectangular in shape upon deployment, but moves from the rolled to unrolled configuration. Of course, various other alternative profiles can be formed using the present configuration. For instance, in other examples the initial geometry of marker (<b>1400</b>) profile can be varied to influence the expansion of marker (<b>1400</b>) after unrolling and at least some hydration. In addition, it should be understood that the particular shape and/or size of marker (<b>1400</b>) can change throughout the course of hydration. For instance, marker (<b>1400</b>) can start in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> after initial deployment. As hydration completes, marker (<b>1400</b>) can form a shape approximately corresponding to the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> or another shape between the shapes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref>.
