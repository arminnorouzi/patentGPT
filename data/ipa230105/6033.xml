Information is stored by programing memory cells within a memory device to various states. For example, binary memory cells may be programmed to one of two supported states, often corresponding to a logic 1 or a logic 0. In some examples, a single memory cell may support more than two possible states, any one of which may be stored by the memory cell. To access information stored by a memory device, a component may read, or sense, the state of one or more memory cells within the memory device. To store information, a component may write, or program, one or more memory cells within the memory device to corresponding states.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types of memory devices exist, including magnetic hard disks, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM), static RAM (SRAM), ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), resistive RAM (RRAM), flash memory, phase change memory (PCM), 3 dimensional cross-point memory (3D Xpoint), not-or (NOR), and not-and (NAND) memory devices, and others. Memory devices may be volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memory cells (e.g., DRAM cells) may lose their programmed states over time unless they are periodically refreshed by an external power source. Non-volatile memory cells (e.g., NAND memory cells) may maintain their programmed states for extended periods of time even in the absence of an external power source.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a memory device that supports single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a transistor structure that supports single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a layout of a memory device that supports single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate examples of operations that support forming single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A through <b>5</b>F</figref> illustrate examples of operations that support forming single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A through <b>6</b>F</figref> illustrate examples of operations that support forming single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates example transistors that support single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> show flowcharts illustrating a method or methods that support single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Memory devices may include various arrangements of memory arrays and supporting circuitry formed with or over a substrate. For example, a memory device may include one or more decks of memory arrays over a substrate, where a deck may refer to a plane or level of memory cells (e.g., of one or more memory arrays) above the substrate and, in some examples, generally parallel to the substrate. In some examples, circuitry that supports accessing or operating the memory arrays may be located below the memory arrays, which may refer to a location that is at least in part between the memory arrays and the substrate (e.g., in a vertical direction). For example, sensing circuitry, decoding circuitry, periphery circuitry, or other logic and circuitry may be located below the memory arrays but at least in part above the substrate and, in some examples, may include transistors that are formed at least in part by doping portions of the substrate (e.g., substrate-based transistors, transistors having channels formed from doped crystalline silicon or another semiconductor substrate). But as memory devices scale with and have a greater quantity of layers or decks of memory arrays above a substrate, the area of a substrate used for such substrate-based circuitry may increase, which may lead to additional limitations (e.g., related to the limited area of a substrate to support a growing quantity of decks and, by extension, a growing quantity and area for such substrate-based circuitry, related to routing challenges associated with locating some circuitry below a stack of decks but not above the stack of decks).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with examples as disclosed herein, a memory device may include one or more decks of memory cells and circuitry for accessing or operating the memory cells (e.g., semiconductor circuitry, transistor circuitry, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry) with some of the circuitry being located above the one or more decks and some being located below the one or more decks. For example, the memory device may include lower substrate-based circuitry formed, in some examples, at least in part by doping portions of a lower semiconductor substrate (e.g., a base substrate, a silicon substrate, a crystalline semiconductor substrate, a chip or wafer) to form a first set of components, such as transistors. Above the lower substrate-based circuitry, the memory device may include one or more decks of memory cells and upper circuitry (e.g., transistors of the upper circuitry) formed, in some examples, at least in part by a semiconductor that is deposited over the one or more decks and formed in a crystalline arrangement based on a heating and a cooling of the deposited semiconductor. The semiconductor material may be deposited into tapered cavities that are etched into one or more dielectric or oxide materials, where the tapering may promote nucleation of the crystalline arrangement at a respective single location (e.g., at a bottom end of the cavity), rather than multiple nucleation locations that may result in a polycrystalline or multi-grain arrangement. In some examples, the described techniques may include depositing a seed material at the bottom of the cavities to further promote such cohesive single-grain nucleation. Channel portions of one or more transistors may be formed at least in part by doping regions of the single crystalline arrangement of the deposited semiconductor material. Accordingly, operation of the one or more decks of memory cells may be supported by lower circuitry, which may be formed at least in part by doped portions of a crystalline semiconductor substrate (e.g., a crystalline chip or wafer), and upper circuitry, which may be formed at least in part by doped portions of a semiconductor deposited over the one or more decks and formed with a crystalline arrangement in-situ.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Features of the disclosure are initially described in the context of a memory device and related circuitry as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. Features of the disclosure are described in the context of a memory device layout and illustrative fabrication techniques with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. These and other features of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to flowcharts that relate to single-crystal transistors for memory devices as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a memory device <b>100</b> that supports single-crystal transistors for memory devices in accordance with examples as disclosed herein. The memory device <b>100</b> may also be referred to as an electronic memory apparatus. The memory device <b>100</b> may include memory cells <b>105</b> that are programmable to store different logic states. In some cases, a memory cell <b>105</b> may be programmable to store two logic states, denoted a logic 0 and a logic 1. In some cases, a memory cell <b>105</b> may be programmable to store more than two logic states (e.g., as a multi-level cell). The set of memory cells <b>105</b> may be part of a memory array <b>110</b> of the memory device <b>100</b>, where, in some examples, a memory array <b>110</b> may refer to a contiguous tile of memory cells <b>105</b> (e.g., a contiguous set of elements of a semiconductor chip).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some examples, a memory cell <b>105</b> may store an electric charge representative of the programmable logic states (e.g., storing charge in a capacitor, capacitive memory element, capacitive storage element). In one example, a charged and uncharged capacitor may represent two logic states, respectively. In another example, a positively charged (e.g., a first polarity, a positive polarity) and negatively charged (e.g., a second polarity, a negative polarity) capacitor may represent two logic states, respectively. DRAM or FeRAM architectures may use such designs, and the capacitor employed may include a dielectric material with linear or para-electric polarization properties as an insulator. In some examples, different levels of charge of a capacitor may represent different logic states, which, in some examples, may support more than two logic states in a respective memory cell <b>105</b>. In some examples, such as FeRAM architectures, a memory cell <b>105</b> may include a ferroelectric capacitor having a ferroelectric material as an insulating (e.g., non-conductive) layer between terminals of the capacitor. Different levels or polarities of polarization of a ferroelectric capacitor may represent different logic states (e.g., supporting two or more logic states in a respective memory cell <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, a memory cell <b>105</b> may include or otherwise be associated with a configurable material, which may be referred to as a material memory element, a material storage element, a material portion, and others. The configurable material may have one or more variable and configurable characteristics or properties (e.g., material states) that may represent different logic states. For example, a configurable material may take different forms, different atomic configurations, different degrees of crystallinity, different atomic distributions, or otherwise maintain different characteristics that may be leveraged to represent one logic state or another. In some examples, such characteristics may be associated with different electrical resistances, different threshold characteristics, or other properties that are detectable or distinguishable during a read operation to identify a logic state written to or stored by the configurable material.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some cases, a configurable material of a memory cell <b>105</b> may be associated with a threshold voltage. For example, electrical current may flow through the configurable material when a voltage greater than the threshold voltage is applied across the memory cell <b>105</b>, and electrical current may not flow through the configurable material, or may flow through the configurable material at a rate below some level (e.g., according to a leakage rate), when a voltage less than the threshold voltage is applied across the memory cell <b>105</b>. Thus, a voltage applied to memory cells <b>105</b> may result in different current flow, or different perceived resistance, or a change in resistance (e.g., a thresholding or switching event) depending on whether a configurable material portion of the memory cell <b>105</b> was written with one logic state or another. Accordingly, the magnitude of current, or other characteristic (e.g., thresholding behavior, resistance breakdown behavior, snapback behavior) associated with the current that results from applying a read voltage to the memory cell <b>105</b>, may be used to determine a logic state written to or stored by memory cell <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the example of memory device <b>100</b>, each row of memory cells <b>105</b> may be coupled with one or more word lines <b>120</b> (e.g., WL<sub>1 </sub>through WL<sub>M</sub>), and each column of memory cells <b>105</b> may be coupled with one or more digit lines <b>130</b> (e.g., DL<sub>1 </sub>through DL<sub>N</sub>). Each of the word lines <b>120</b> and digit lines <b>130</b> may be an example of an access line of the memory device <b>100</b>. In general, one memory cell <b>105</b> may be located at the intersection of (e.g., coupled with, coupled between) a word line <b>120</b> and a digit line <b>130</b>. This intersection may be referred to as an address of a memory cell <b>105</b>. A target or selected memory cell <b>105</b> may be a memory cell <b>105</b> located at the intersection of an energized or otherwise selected word line <b>120</b> and an energized or otherwise selected digit line <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some architectures, a storage component of a memory cell <b>105</b> may be electrically isolated (e.g., selectively isolated) from a digit line <b>130</b> by a cell selection component, which, in some examples, may be referred to as a switching component or a selector device of or otherwise associated with the memory cell <b>105</b>. A word line <b>120</b> may be coupled with the cell selection component (e.g., via a control node or terminal of the cell selection component), and may control the cell selection component of the memory cell <b>105</b>. For example, the cell selection component may be a transistor and the word line <b>120</b> may be coupled with a gate of the transistor (e.g., where a gate node of the transistor may be a control node of the transistor). Activating a word line <b>120</b> may result in an electrical connection or closed circuit between a respective logic storing component of one or more memory cells <b>105</b> and one or more corresponding digit lines <b>130</b>. A digit line <b>130</b> may then be accessed to read from or write to the respective memory cell <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, memory cells <b>105</b> may also be coupled with one or more plate lines <b>140</b> (e.g., PL<sub>1 </sub>through PL<sub>N</sub>). In some examples, each of the plate lines <b>140</b> may be independently addressable (e.g., supporting individual selection or biasing). In some examples, the plurality of plate lines <b>140</b> may represent or be otherwise functionally equivalent with a common plate, or other common node (e.g., a plate node common to each of the memory cells <b>105</b> in the memory array <b>110</b>). When a memory cell <b>105</b> employs a capacitor for storing a logic state, a digit line <b>130</b> may provide access to a first terminal or a first plate of the capacitor, and a plate line <b>140</b> may provide access to a second terminal or a second plate of the capacitor. Although the plurality of plate lines <b>140</b> of the memory device <b>100</b> are shown as substantially parallel with the plurality of digit lines <b>130</b>, in other examples, a plurality of plate lines <b>140</b> may be substantially parallel with the plurality of word lines <b>120</b>, or in any other configuration (e.g., a common planar conductor, a common plate layer).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Access operations such as reading, writing, rewriting, and refreshing may be performed on a memory cell <b>105</b> by activating or selecting a word line <b>120</b>, a digit line <b>130</b>, or a plate line <b>140</b> coupled with the memory cell <b>105</b>, which may include applying a voltage, a charge, or a current to the respective access line. Upon selecting a memory cell <b>105</b> (e.g., in a read operation), a resulting signal may be used to determine the logic state stored by the memory cell <b>105</b>. For example, a memory cell <b>105</b> with a capacitive memory element storing a logic state may be selected, and the resulting flow of charge via an access line or resulting voltage of an access line may be detected to determine the programmed logic state stored by the memory cell <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Accessing memory cells <b>105</b> may be controlled using a row component <b>125</b> (e.g., a row decoder), a column component <b>135</b> (e.g., a column decoder), or a plate component <b>145</b> (e.g., a plate decoder), or a combination thereof. For example, a row component <b>125</b> may receive a row address from the memory controller <b>170</b> and activate the appropriate word line <b>120</b> based on the received row address. Similarly, a column component <b>135</b> may receive a column address from the memory controller <b>170</b> and activate the appropriate digit line <b>130</b>. In some examples, such access operations may be accompanied by a plate component <b>145</b> biasing one or more of the plate lines <b>140</b> (e.g., biasing one of the plate lines <b>140</b>, biasing some or all of the plate lines <b>140</b>, biasing a common plate).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some examples, the memory controller <b>170</b> may control operations (e.g., read operations, write operations, rewrite operations, refresh operations) of memory cells <b>105</b> using one or more components (e.g., row component <b>125</b>, column component <b>135</b>, plate component <b>145</b>, sense component <b>150</b>). In some cases, one or more of the row component <b>125</b>, the column component <b>135</b>, the plate component <b>145</b>, and the sense component <b>150</b> may be co-located or otherwise included with the memory controller <b>170</b>.

Components are considered in electronic communication with (or in conductive contact with or connected with or coupled with) one another if there is any conductive path between the components that can, at any time, support the flow of signals between the components. At any given time, the conductive path between components that are in electronic communication with each other (or in conductive contact with or connected with or coupled with) may be an open circuit or a closed circuit based on the operation of the device that includes the connected components. The conductive path between connected components may be a direct conductive path between the components or the conductive path between connected components may be an indirect conductive path that may include intermediate components, such as switches, transistors, or other components. In some examples, the flow of signals between the connected components may be interrupted for a time, for example, using one or more intermediate components such as switches or transistors.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The term &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; refers to condition of moving from an open-circuit relationship between components in which signals are not presently capable of being communicated between the components over a conductive path to a closed-circuit relationship between components in which signals are capable of being communicated between components over the conductive path. When a component, such as a controller, couples other components together, the component initiates a change that allows signals to flow between the other components over a conductive path that previously did not permit signals to flow.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; refers to a relationship between components in which signals are not presently capable of flowing between the components. Components are isolated from each other if there is an open circuit between them. For example, two components separated by a switch that is positioned between the components are isolated from each other when the switch is open. When a controller isolates two components, the controller affects a change that prevents signals from flowing between the components using a conductive path that previously permitted signals to flow.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;level&#x201d; used herein refers to a stratum or sheet of a geometrical structure (e.g., relative to a substrate). Each layer or level may have three dimensions (e.g., height, width, and depth) and may cover at least a portion of a surface. For example, a layer or level may be a three dimensional structure where two dimensions are greater than a third, e.g., a thin-film. Layers or levels may include different elements, components, and/or materials. In some examples, one layer or level may be composed of two or more sublayers or sublevels.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">As used herein, the term &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; may refer to an electrical conductor, and in some examples, may be employed as an electrical contact to a memory cell or other component of a memory array. An electrode may include a trace, wire, conductive line, conductive layer, or the like that provides a conductive path between elements or components of a memory array.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The devices discussed herein, including a memory array, may be formed on a semiconductor substrate, such as silicon, germanium, silicon-germanium alloy, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, etc. In some examples, the substrate is a semiconductor wafer. In other examples, the substrate may be a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, such as silicon-on-glass (SOG) or silicon-on-sapphire (SOP), or epitaxial layers of semiconductor materials on another substrate. The conductivity of the substrate, or sub-regions of the substrate, may be controlled through doping using various chemical species including, but not limited to, phosphorous, boron, or arsenic. Doping may be performed during the initial formation or growth of the substrate, by ion-implantation, or by any other doping means.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">A switching component or a transistor discussed herein may represent a field-effect transistor (FET) and comprise a three terminal device including a source, drain, and gate. The terminals may be connected to other electronic elements through conductive materials, e.g., metals. The source and drain may be conductive and may comprise a heavily-doped, e.g., degenerate, semiconductor region. The source and drain may be separated by a lightly-doped semiconductor region or channel. If the channel is n-type (i.e., majority carriers are electrons), then the FET may be referred to as a n-type FET. If the channel is p-type (i.e., majority carriers are holes), then the FET may be referred to as a p-type FET. The channel may be capped by an insulating gate oxide. The channel conductivity may be controlled by applying a voltage to the gate. For example, applying a positive voltage or negative voltage to an n-type FET or a p-type FET, respectively, may result in the channel becoming conductive. A transistor may be &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;activated&#x201d; when a voltage greater than or equal to the transistor's threshold voltage is applied to the transistor gate. The transistor may be &#x201c;off&#x201d; or &#x201c;deactivated&#x201d; when a voltage less than the transistor's threshold voltage is applied to the transistor gate.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The description set forth herein, in connection with the appended drawings, describes example configurations and does not represent all the examples that may be implemented or that are within the scope of the claims.
