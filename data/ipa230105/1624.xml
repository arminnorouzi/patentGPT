Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for sterilizing a blow molding machine that heats a sterilized preform to form the preform into a bottle, and a blow molding machine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, a sterilizing method has been proposed in which, while continuously conveying preforms, a sterilizer is applied to the preforms, the preforms are then introduced into a heating furnace and are heated in the heating furnace to a temperature suitable for molding each preform into a container, and the sterilizer that is applied to the preforms is simultaneously dried and activated by the heating (Patent Literature 1). A method has also been proposed in which after preforms are heated to a temperature for molding into a container, a sterilizer is caused to adhere to the preforms, and thereafter each preform is molded into a container (Patent Literature 2). These kinds of sterilizing method are utilized as methods for sterilizing preforms in an aseptic filling machine in which, after sterilizing preforms, the preforms are molded into bottles as containers, sterilized content is filled into the molded bottles in an aseptic atmosphere, and the bottles into which the content is filled are sealed by screwing a sterilized cap onto each bottle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this regard, according to the method disclosed in Patent Literature 1, there is a possibility that the sterilizer will diffuse inside the heating furnace. Further, according to the method disclosed in Patent Literature 2, although there is a possibility that the sterilizer will diffuse in a unit that blow-molds the preform, there is also a possibility that the sterilizer will not be completely diffused and some of the sterilizer will remain in the bottle. These are methods that are performed during operation of an aseptic filling machine, and although a part of the mold is sterilized as in the method of Patent Literature 2 by diffusion of the sterilizer, in a limited manner, the molded bottles are used as products.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During operation of a blow molding machine that includes a heating furnace, various failures may occur in the blow molding machine, and at such times it is necessary to stop the blow molding machine and open a cover of a chamber or the like surrounding the blow molding machine and inspect the interior of the blow molding machine. When the blow molding machine is opened and furthermore disassembled or subjected to maintenance in this way, there is a risk that bacteria or the like may enter the blow molding machine from a worker or the environment and adhere to a mold or an extension rod or the like, and the adhered bacteria or the like will move to preforms or bottles and it will no longer be possible to manufacture aseptic packages.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in the prior art an apparatus has been proposed in which a CIP (cleaning in place) system is installed as a device for sterilizing the inside of a blow molding machine after the blow molding machine is opened (Patent Literature 3). According to the CIP system, it is possible to clean a valve block for controlling blow air and the like, without disassembling the blow molding machine.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, technology has also been proposed in which a blow molding mold is opened, and the inside of the mold is cleaned by spraying a cleaning agent from a cleaning nozzle at the inner wall surface of the mold, or the inside of the mold is cleaned by spraying a cleaning agent into the mold from an extension rod (Patent Literatures 4 and 5).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In Patent Literatures 3, 4 and 5, equipment is required in order to clean the valve block or the mold or the like. Therefore, as disclosed in Patent Literature 6, a method for sterilizing a valve block or the like that does not require cleaning equipment has been proposed (Patent Literature 6).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-183899</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2012-500135</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0011">Patent Literature 3: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2010-274651</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0012">Patent Literature 4: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-42169</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0013">Patent Literature 5: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2011-51337</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0014">Patent Literature 6: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2015-171812</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0015">Conventionally, in an aseptic filling machine for bottles, a preform is molded into a bottle, and the bottle obtained after molding is sterilized, but because a large amount of sterilizer is required, and the apparatus also becomes excessively large, use of aseptic filling machines in which sterilization is carried out at the preform stage is spreading. However, after being sterilized at the preform stage, the aseptic condition of molded bottles must be maintained while the preforms are molded into bottles and the molded bottles are then conveyed to a filling unit which fills content into the molded bottles. In particular, the important point is to secure the aseptic condition during a process in which the sterilized preforms are heated and the heated preforms are blow molded into bottles, and this has been a problem.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">According to Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2, respectively, because a sterilizer that is caused to adhere to the surface of a preform to sterilize the preform is diffused in a heating unit or a molding unit, there is a possibility that the heating unit or molding unit can be sterilized during operation of the blow molding machine. However, there is a possibility of the inside of the blow molding machine being contaminated by bacteria or the like before operation, and these bacteria or the like cannot be immediately sterilized accompanying operation of blow molding machine.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">In order to secure an aseptic condition in a heating process that heats preforms and a blow molding process that molds preforms to thereby enable molding of sterilized preforms into bottles, it is necessary to sterilize the heating unit and the molding unit of the blow molding machine before operating the blow molding machine and, during operation, to maintain the aseptic state of the sterilized locations in the blow molding machine and to mold the sterilized preforms into aseptic bottles and also convey the molded bottles to a filling unit of an aseptic filling machine. To achieve this, sterilization of locations of the blow molding machine which are locations at which there is a possibility of direct or indirect contact with the inner surface of preforms before operation must be sufficiently performed. In the heating unit, spindles are the locations that directly contact the inner surface of preforms, and in the molding unit the blow nozzle and the extension rod are the locations that directly contact the inner surface of preforms. Further, a conduit for blow air is a location that indirectly contacts the inner surface of preforms.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">A CIP system as disclosed in Patent Literature 3, a method that sprays a cleaning agent at a mold as disclosed in Patent Literature 4, and a method that sprays a cleaning agent into a mold from an extension rod as disclosed in Patent Literature 5 are effective as methods for sterilizing a valve block, a mold and an extension rod, respectively, before operation of a blow molding machine. However, there is the problem that these methods require a large-scale apparatus to circulate the cleaning agent.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">Further, in the method in which a mold is opened and a cleaning agent is sprayed from a cleaning nozzle onto the inner wall surface of the mold (Patent Literature 4) and the method in which a cleaning agent is sprayed from an extension rod into a mold that is a molding die (Patent Literature 5), there is a problem that a holding member such as a mandrel or a spindle that holds the preforms during heating of preforms cannot be sterilized. Further, the inside of the blow molding machine must be dried after cleaning, and such drying requires a large amount of time and energy, and substantially reduces the rate of operation of the blow molding machine. In addition, there is a necessity to change conventional blow molding machines to a structure with high sanitary properties in order to secure cleaning properties, and there is also a necessity to add a seal structure so that cleaning fluid does not leak.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">Patent Literature 6 proposes a method that, without requiring a large-scale apparatus, can sterilize holding members for holding preforms inside a heating furnace, and furthermore, at a molding unit, can sterilize a conduit of a valve block and an extension rod as well as the inside of the molding unit. However, the sterilization of all holding members for holding preforms and the sterilization of a conduit for blow air is inadequate. Further, the treatment of preforms used for sterilization is unclear.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">Thus, with respect to aseptic filling machines for sterilizing preforms, there is a need for a method and an apparatus which, before operating a blow molding machine that is installed in the aseptic filling machine and constitutes one part of the aseptic filling machine, sterilizes locations in a heating unit and in a molding unit of the blow molding machine that are locations which directly or indirectly contact the inside of preforms, without requiring a large-scale apparatus.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">The present invention has been made to solve the problems described above, and an object of the present invention is to provide a method for sterilizing a blow molding machine and a blow molding machine which can mold preforms into aseptic bottles while maintaining the aseptic condition of sterilized preforms.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0023">A method for sterilizing a blow molding machine according to the present invention is a method that fills a liquid sterilizer into preforms, supplies to a heating unit of a blow molding machine the preforms into which the liquid sterilizer is filled that are of at least a same number as a number of spindles that hold the preforms that travel through the heating unit of the blow molding machine, activates and diffuses some of the liquid sterilizer in the heating unit, sterilizes places that the diffused liquid sterilizer contacts, blasts blow air into the heated preforms in a state in which the liquid sterilizer remains in the preforms, causes the liquid sterilizer to diffuse inside a molding unit of the blow molding machine, molds the preforms into bottles, and discharges the bottles that are molded.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">In addition, in the method for sterilizing a blow molding machine according to the present invention, it is favorable to inspect whether or not the preform in which the liquid sterilizer is filled is being held by the spindle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">Further, in the method for sterilizing a blow molding machine according to the present invention, it is favorable to supply the preform into which the liquid sterilizer is filled to the spindle that does not hold the preform into which the liquid sterilizer is filled identified by the inspection.

The positional information of the spindles <b>15</b> can be identified at all times with these sensors. Further, it is not necessary to limit the sensors to these sensors. The preforms <b>1</b> in which the liquid sterilizer S has been filled are heated to a molding temperature by the heating unit <b>16</b>. The liquid sterilizer S diffuses as a result of the heating, and locations facing the inner surface of the preform <b>1</b> of the spindle <b>15</b> are sterilized by the diffused liquid sterilizer S. The heated preform <b>1</b> in which the liquid sterilizer S remains is conveyed to the molding unit <b>23</b>, at which high-pressure blow air is blasted into the preform <b>1</b> in which the liquid sterilizer S remains, and the liquid sterilizer S diffuses into the blow air. The blow air in which the liquid sterilizer S has diffused spurts out into the molding unit <b>23</b>, and as a result the inside of the molding unit <b>23</b> is sterilized by the liquid sterilizer S diffused in the molding unit <b>23</b>.

The preform <b>1</b> is molded by injection molding, compression molding or the like. The material of the preform <b>1</b> is composed of a thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polypropylene or polyethylene, and may be a simple substance or a mixture of these thermoplastic resins, and may include recycled thermoplastic resin. Further, to impart a barrier property, a thermoplastic resin such as an ethylene-vinyl alcohol-copolymer or polyamide having an aromatic amine such as meta-xylene diamine as a monomer may be included as a layer or as a mixture.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">Further, with regard to the preform <b>1</b> that is used for sterilizing the blow molding machine, because it is not necessary to use a preform <b>1</b> that is to be used during operation of the aseptic filling machine, a preform <b>1</b> which is rejected because a defect is found during an inspection when manufacturing the preform <b>1</b>, or an inexpensive preform of a different shape to the preforms <b>1</b> that are used during operation of the aseptic filling machine may be used as the preform <b>1</b> for sterilizing the blow molding machine.

Therefore, after performing sterilization treatment of the blow molding machine, it is preferable to perform blow molding using preforms <b>1</b> in which the liquid sterilizer S has not been filled, to thereby remove any remaining liquid sterilizer S. Alternatively, it is good to confirm that the liquid sterilizer S has been removed and that blow molding is being performed as normal. Whether or not the liquid sterilizer S has been removed can be confirmed by filling water into a molded bottle, and measuring the amount of the liquid sterilizer S in the water, for example, in a case where the liquid sterilizer S contains hydrogen peroxide, measuring the amount of hydrogen peroxide, and it can be confirmed that the liquid sterilizer S has been removed if the measured value is equal to or less than a reference value. Further, whether or not blow molding is being performed as normal can be confirmed by measuring the overall height, capacity and wall thickness distribution and the like of the molded bottle <b>2</b>, and checking whether or not the measured values conform with reference values.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0083">To maintain the aseptic condition inside the sterilized molding unit chamber <b>25</b>, aseptic air is supplied into the molding unit chamber <b>25</b>.

In addition, if a large amount of the liquid flows into the liquid seal apparatus <b>57</b> and overflows from the liquid seal apparatus <b>57</b>, the liquid will flow out into the aseptic atmosphere. To prevent this, the height of the wall surface on the non-aseptic atmosphere side of the liquid seal apparatus <b>57</b> may be made lower than the height of the wall surface on the aseptic atmosphere side, so that liquid that overflows is stored in a liquid reservoir tank <b>58</b>, and is discharged from a bottom part of the liquid reservoir tank <b>58</b>.
