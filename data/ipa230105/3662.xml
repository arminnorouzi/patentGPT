Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an inspection support device, an inspection support method, and a non-transitory computer recording medium storing an inspection support program, and particularly relates to a technique of supporting an inspection of a structure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Social infrastructures such as bridges need to be inspected regularly for maintenance management and repair.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP2002-188998A discloses a cracking detection method of imaging an internal wall surface of a tunnel with a camera, performing image processing on the captured image to extract and quantify cracking for each subcategory in the internal wall surface, and displaying cracking information for each subcategory, and a display method thereof. For example, cracking is displayed in color which is different for each subcategory according to the degree of cracking for each subcategory, whereby the degree of cracking can be easily grasped.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, in damage to a structure, there are many types of damage other than cracking. For example, in the concrete part of the structure, there are multi-items of damage, such as water leakage, free lime, rust juice, peeling, and reinforcing bar exposure, in addition to cracking. Similarly, in the steel member of the structure, there are multi-items of damage, such as cracks, corrosion, and deterioration of anti-corrosion functions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In JP2002-188998A, there is a description that cracking is displayed in color which is different for each subcategory according to the degree of cracking for each subcategory, but there is no description that two or more types (multi-items) of damage are detected from the structure, and there is also no description on how to output the detection results of multi-items of damage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide an inspection support device, an inspection support method, and an inspection support program capable of satisfactorily outputting a damage detection result thereof, in a case where two or more types of damage are detected from a structure, and particularly, two or more types of damage are detected from the same or adjacent positions of the structure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the above object, an invention of a first aspect relates to an inspection support device comprising: a processor, in which the processor performs image acquisition processing of acquiring an image obtained by imaging a structure to be inspected, damage detection processing of detecting damage to the structure on the basis of the acquired image, determination processing of determining, in a case where two or more types of damage to the structure are detected by the damage detection processing, among the two or more types of damage, whether or not two or more types of damage are detected from the same or adjacent positions, and output processing of outputting a damage detection result detected by the damage detection processing, the output processing being processing of outputting the damage detection result in accordance with a priority of a damage type in a case where determination is made by the determination processing that two or more types of damage are detected from the same or adjacent positions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the first aspect of the present invention, in a case where two or more types of damage to the structure are detected on the basis of the image obtained by imaging the structure to be inspected, and particularly, two or more types of damage are detected from the same or adjacent positions of the structure, the damage detection result is output in accordance with the priority, as the damage detection result. With this, the damage detection result is output in accordance with the priority of the damage type in a case where two or more types of damage are detected from the same or adjacent positions of the structure, so that it is possible to respond to the case where two or more types of damage are detected from the same or adjacent positions of the structure. In a case where two or more types of damage are not located at the same or adjacent positions of the structure, two or more types of damage detection results can be output as they are.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the inspection support device according to a second aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that in the damage detection processing, a damage region and a damage type for each damage region are detected on the basis of the image, that in the determination processing, it is determined that whether or not two or more damage types are detected in the same or adjacent damage regions by the damage detection processing, and that in the output processing, in a case where determination is made by the determination processing that two or more damage types are detected in the same or adjacent damage regions, a damage detection result of a damage type with a highest priority is output as a damage detection result of the same or adjacent damage regions. This is because it is effective to output the damage detection result of the damage type with the highest priority and notify the user or the like, in a case where two or more types of damage are detected from the same or adjacent positions of the structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the inspection support device according to a third aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the adjacent positions are positions where a distance between the two or more types of damage is a threshold value or less.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the inspection support device according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the damage detection processing is executed by a trained model that outputs a damage region and a damage type for each damage region as a recognition result in response to an input of the image.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the inspection support device according to a fifth aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that in the output processing, different drawing patterns are output depending on whether the damage type is linear damage or the damage type is planar damage.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the inspection support device according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that in the output processing, in a case where the damage type is linear damage, a damage diagram showing a non-closed line of the linear damage is output, and in a case where the damage type is planar damage, a damage diagram showing a closed line surrounding the planar damage is output. In a case where the damage diagram is output with a drawing pattern of line drawing, a damage diagram showing a non-closed line of the linear damage is output in a case where the damage type is the linear damage, and a damage diagram showing a closed line surrounding the planar damage is output in a case where the damage type is the planar damage.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the inspection support device according to a seventh aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that in the output processing, in a case where the damage type is linear damage, a damage image in which at

<b>1</b>A</figref> shows water leakage A, which is one of the phenomena caused by damage to the concrete member. The water leakage A is caused by damage to the concrete member (cracking, joint cracking, defective joint material, and the like), and water leaks from the damaged portion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows cracking B, free lime C<sub>1</sub>, and rust juice D occurring in the concrete member. The free lime C<sub>1 </sub>refers to a phenomenon in which a lime component flows out from the inside of the concrete member due to water leakage or the like and the lime component appears on the surface when moisture evaporates. Further, the rust juice D refers to a liquid in which steel materials such as reinforcing bars provided inside the concrete member are corroded and brown corrosion products exude to the concrete surface.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows peeling E and reinforcing bar exposure F occurring in the concrete member. The peeling E refers to a state in which floating concrete pieces are peeled off, and the reinforcing bar exposure F refers to a state in which the reinforcing bar provided in the concrete is exposed as a result of the peeling E.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, although not shown, as damage to the steel member constituting the structure, there are types of damage, such as cracks, corrosion, fracture, and deterioration of anti-corrosion functions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are views showing an example of linear free lime, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref> are views showing an example of planar free lime.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Linear free lime C<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> is a state in which cracking occurring in the concrete member is clogged with the lime component.

Further, cracking and linear free lime are both linear damage, but it is preferable to represent the cracking and the linear free lime in an identifiable manner with polylines having different line types (for example, color) because the types of damage are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, in a case where peeling E and reinforcing bar exposure F are detected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>), a drawing pattern using a closed line (polygon) surrounding the region of planar damage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) is used as a method of representing peeling E and reinforcing bar exposure F.
