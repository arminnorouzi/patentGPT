ways. A trailer for an autonomous vehicle for hauling additional cargo and power supplies. A method for delivering and picking up goods using delivery trucks, autonomous vehicles, and trailers. The deployment mechanism can include a crane, a robot arm, a forklift, straps, and sails. The delivery container can include visible, partly visible, or hidden security features and grasping features, and can be foldable and stackable. The trailer can include a <b>4</b>-bar linkage, the <b>4</b>-bar linkage enabling consistent pitch between the trailer cargo and a cargo hold of the towing vehicle. The trailer wheels are decoupled from the <b>4</b>-bar linkage, connected by swing arms and possible shock absorbers. The trailer can buffer fore/aft movement of the trailer.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="132.00mm" wi="122.09mm"

APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 63/202,295, filed Jun. 30, 2021, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR UNATTENDED PACKAGE DELIVERY (Attorney Docket No. AA589), U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 63/203,180, filed Jul. 12, 2021, entitled TRAILER FOR AUTONOMOUS DELIVERY (Attorney Docket No. AA618), and which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present teachings relate generally to unattended package delivery using autonomous vehicles, trailers, and trucks. The package delivery industry has exploded in recent years, especially during the COVID pandemic. Alongside the increase in front door package delivery has grown up an industry of package theft. As people emerge from the pandemic and leave their homes once again for entry into commerce, the theft industry is expected to return to its post-pandemic loss percentages, which will result in a net increase in package theft over pre-pandemic levels because the ease of package delivery is expected to fuel its continued expansion.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In common use are autonomous delivery vehicles that travel on either public roads or sidewalks, but not both. Autonomous delivery vehicles either require attended delivery, or delivery to a secure location. In either case, the recipient provides a code or some other means to verify that the package is intended for the recipient. Unless the recipient invests in a secure delivery location such as a pod or box, current autonomous delivery devices cannot perform unattended delivery. Yet, unattended delivery is the primary mode of delivery today.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unattended autonomous delivery can require the same type of handling that would be accomplished by a delivery person, attended or unattended, for example, attending to the safety of the contents when depositing the cargo, attending to the security of the cargo until the recipient retrieves the cargo, and ensuring that the recipient and the cargo are paired correctly. An unattended delivery might require the package to be protected from the elements, whether rain, snow, heat, cold, or sunshine, among other conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an exemplary configuration, an autonomous vehicle picks up packages from package delivery vendor or a costumer of the package delivery vendor, and deliver the package to a desired destination autonomously with supervision. In an aspect, the autonomous vehicle is docked at a base station in which the autonomous vehicle is secured when not in use. At the docking station, power is recharged and/or swapped out. In an aspect, a remote operator or user or customer of the vendor enters a request to deliver a package to a desired location along a pre-mapped route. In an aspect, a fleet management system receives the request and allocates an autonomous vehicle, and possibly a delivery truck, to perform the delivery. In an aspect, the fleet management system calculates a route from the base station to the pickup point and then on to the drop off location. In an aspect, the route is reviewed and approved by an operator. In an aspect, the fleet management system generates a navigation package that contains the pickup and drop off locations for the package, a valid route containing the drivable surfaces, curbs, intersections and traffic signals, and identification information for the delivery that could be used to for the package to self-identify. In an aspect, the fleet management system supplies the navigation package to the autonomous vehicle while the autonomous vehicle is at a base station, possibly a docking station. If the same route is repeatedly run, the navigation package is pre-loaded on the autonomous vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect, a remote operator ensures that the remote control for the autonomous vehicle is active and working properly. The operator can enable autonomous driving on the autonomous vehicle. The autonomous vehicle leaves its base station and proceeds to the pickup point. This can include driving with the sidewalk traffic or with the road traffic. The autonomous vehicle stops at the pickup point, disables autonomous driving and requests the pickup on the screen from the package recipient. When the package recipient shows the correct identifying information to the autonomous vehicle or sends the appropriate command using handheld device/laptop/tablet/desktop computer, the cargo box door opens. The autonomous vehicle closes the cargo box door when the appropriate identifying information is provided to the autonomous vehicle or the autonomous vehicle receives the appropriate command from a computing device. The autonomous vehicle signals the remote control operator and waits for the operator to enable autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The autonomous vehicle can travel on the sidewalk and the road to the drop off location possibly autonomously or under supervision of the remote control operator. The autonomous vehicle continuously monitors the link to the remote control operator and can optionally bring the autonomous vehicle to a standstill if the link is dropped. While navigating with road traffic, the autonomous vehicle navigates around vehicles parked on the side of the road and avoids road obstacles like pedestrians and other vehicles. On the sidewalk the autonomous vehicle is expected to interact with pedestrians, animals and other sidewalk obstacles. Where the autonomous vehicle is expected to cross traffic intersections the autonomous vehicle can come to a complete stop and alert the remote control operator, or navigate autonomously through the intersection. If the intersection is to be navigated remotely, the remote control operator confirms that there is sufficient cellular signal that the remote operator does not expect the cellular signal to be dropped and at complex intersections can drive the autonomous vehicle across the intersection.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On arrival at the drop off location the autonomous vehicle stops and displays the appropriate screen waiting for the recipient to show the correct identifying information to the device or to send the appropriate command using computing device. When shown the correct identifying information, the autonomous vehicle opens the appropriate door and waits for the recipient to remove the package. When the recipient signals that the package has been removed by showing identifying information or by sending a command using computing device, the cargo box the door closes and the autonomous vehicle alerts the remote control operator. The remote control operator enables the return route on the autonomous vehicle and the autonomous vehicle returns to the base or docking station in a similar fashion as what was described above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The autonomous vehicle relies on redundant sensors that allow an expansive view of the environment across a range of lighting and weather conditions. The autonomous driving system uses complex software to detect and categorize other road users and static obstacles and relies on advanced control systems to safely and courteously plan a path through these to efficiently reach a desired destination.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The autonomous driving system for the autonomous vehicle relies on redundant processing of sensor information to ensure safe operation of the device. All the sensor information is processed in the perception system through both machine learning algorithms and traditional image and point cloud processing algorithms. This information is combined before being used by the path planning system. The path planning system for the trail includes a free space planner that does not produce a path that is in collision. A parallel emergency stop detection algorithm uses a close range sensor to detect possible collisions and bring the device to a stop.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The system of the present teachings for an autonomous delivery vehicle can include, but is not limited to including, a vehicle having a pre-selected length, width, and height, such as, for example, but not limited to, 40&#x2033;&#xd7;28&#x2033;&#xd7;62&#x2033;, having a pre-selected payload capacity, such as, for example, but not limited to, 100 pounds. The vehicle can travel without recharge of its battery for a pre-selected amount of time, for example, but not limited to, twelve hours, and its battery can recharge in a pre-selected amount of time, for example, but not limited to, 1.5 hours from empty. To enable delivery to destinations that require traveling over pedestrian and vehicular pathways, the vehicle can navigate discontinuous surfaces of a pre-selected height and inclines/declines of pre-selected angles, and can avoid obstacles and change directions based on obstacles in real-time. The pre-selected discontinuous surface height can include, but is not limited to including, six inches. The pre-selected angles can include, but are not limited to including, 20&#xb0; straight up and down, and 12&#xb0; turning. The vehicle can turn inside the vehicle's footprint, for example, but not limited to, a radius of 24 inches. The vehicle can include a variety of sensors, for example, but not limited to, radar, LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">What is needed are systems and methods that can provide unattended secure autonomous delivery, taking the foregoing situations into account. What is further needed is a way to add storage capacity to the autonomous vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.

id="p-0076" num="0075">The autonomous vehicle (AV), delivery container, and optional trailer of the present teachings can, separately or in combination, enable unattended delivery of packages. The AV can safely deploy its contents, and the contents can be housed in a reusable secure delivery container. In an aspect, the AV can include autonomous navigation features such as, for example, but not limited to, sensors, lights, day and night operation, requesting remote control monitoring in high risk areas, and autonomous navigation of discontinuous surface features. Other autonomous navigation features can include user-defined operating routes, manual operation, autonomous driving to a charging station, no chaperone required, and wireless connection between the AV and a central station. In an aspect, the AV can open its doors automatically, including doors with keycard access, require no full-time remote operator. In an aspect, the AV can navigate around objects and navigate on both pedestrian and vehicular roadways. In an aspect, the AV can include the ability to traverse rough terrain.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The delivery container can include, for example, but not limited to, environmental shielding and theft protection, for example. In an aspect, the bottom, sides, and top of the delivery container can include waterproof material, and the inside of the container can include insulation. The delivery container can include cameras, sensors, communications, audio and visual output, battery power, and security features. In an aspect, the cameras can show who is tampering with the container, and the sensors can detect the environment of the container. Communications means can be used to communicate with the owner of the box, and can include Bluetooth and wifi. If the container is tampered with by an unauthorized user, the container can automatically protect itself from being moved. Audio output, for example, and an accelerometer can be used to discourage would-be thieves from moving the container without permission. The container can include GPS that can be used to track the container. The container can be collapsible, and can be returned to the supplier for reuse.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The trailer can include additional storage to the autonomous vehicle, additional power supplies, and stabilization features that can enable increased speed of the autonomous vehicle. The trailer can include a means for connection to the autonomous vehicle that can coordinate the movement and orientation between the autonomous vehicle and the trailer. The trailer can be open or closed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, an apparatus of the present teachings for accomplishing unattended delivery and/or pickup of cargo can include, but is not limited to including, at least two major parts: an autonomous vehicle (AV) having a cargo area and, possibly optionally, secure cargo container <b>13</b> containing the cargo to be delivered or picked up. The AV can be outfitted in various ways to move the cargo from inside the AV cargo area to a delivery location without the assistance from the desired recipient or provider of the cargo. In an aspect, providing unattended delivery or pickup (also referred to herein as no-touch cargo manipulation) from/to an autonomous vehicle (AV) includes managing balance of the AV as the cargo is being lowered, managing space considerations in the cargo box, determining autonomously when to open and close door(s) <b>15</b>, and determining autonomously when the cargo has been successfully moved from the AV to its desired location or from the target location to the AV.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, with respect to managing weight and balance considerations, in some configurations, the AV automatically shifts its weight to balance the various positions that the cargo takes while it is being moved from the AV to the desired delivery location. In some configurations, on-board weights are automatically shifted within the cargo box to advantageously balance the cargo. In some configurations, the cargo weight is limited based at least on the weight of the AV itself, and the weight distribution of the AV. Other means of weight management are contemplated by the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, with respect to managing space considerations, in an aspect, the apparatus that achieves unattended delivery/pickup is positioned advantageously within the cargo area of the AV to maximize free space for one or more delivery containers positioned in the cargo area. In an aspect, the cargo area itself is shaped to accommodate the expected cargo load. For example, as described herein, the cargo area can be square, rectangular, open-topped, or many other geometric possibilities. Delivery containers <b>18</b> can be sized and shaped according to what they are to carry, can include delivery mechanisms <b>22</b>, and can be delivered from an appropriately-sized cargo area.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Continuing to still further refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, with respect to determining autonomously when to open and close the doors of the cargo area, or otherwise initiate delivery/pickup of the cargo, in an aspect, the AV is equipped with sensors, processors, controllers, and actuators that manage the AV's arrival at the desired location, the AV's manipulation of the cargo, and the AV's completing the process and moving to another location, possibly to make another delivery or pick up more cargo to deliver. In an aspect, when the AV arrives at a deployment location, the arrival triggers a cargo manipulation process. In one aspect, the cargo manipulation process includes the AV's controller commanding a door actuator(s) to open at least one door on the AV. Doors can be positioned on any part of the AV&#x2014;front, rear, sides, top, or bottom. The doors and the cargo manipulation mechanisms can be operably coupled so that the same actuator(s) can control both the status of the doors and the extension and retraction, or other movement, of the cargo manipulation mechanism. The doors and cargo manipulation mechanism can move simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a first exemplary configuration in which a no-touch, unattended cargo drop can be accomplished includes a crane-like apparatus attached to the interior of the cargo box. In an aspect, the apparatus includes package release mechanisms <b>153</b> that hold cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) while the crane lowers cargo <b>13</b> to the ground. At least one door of the cargo box can automatically open, package release mechanisms <b>153</b> can grab cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) and exit a cargo door with cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) in tow, and the crane can lower cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) to a surface. Package release mechanisms <b>153</b> can release their hold on cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), the crane can be raised to a storage level, and the crane and package release mechanisms <b>153</b> can be returned to the cargo box for storage. In an aspect, the crane can be attached to the outside of the AV, and can be deployed from there to retrieve cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) from inside the cargo box or the ground, for example. In some configurations, the externally-stored crane can enter the cargo box from a first door, and exit the cargo box with cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) in tow from another door. In some configurations, a door from which cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) exits can be determined when the AV arrives at the desired destination and can depend upon the current conditions as sensed by the sensors mounted upon the AV. Sensors inside the cargo box can determine the size of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). In an aspect, sensed and other data are used to direct the crane to be positioned so that package release mechanisms <b>153</b> can properly grab cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), whether vertically, horizontally, or both. In some configurations, the crane-to-cargo connection mechanism includes suction cups, magnets, or any releasable connector. In an aspect, telescoping arm <b>151</b> is stored in a retracted position as the AV transports cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) to a desired destination. In an aspect, telescoping arm <b>151</b> is moved by an actuator, possibly the actuator used to open and close the AV door from which cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) emerges. In an aspect, telescoping arm <b>151</b> extends, causing cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) to be moved outside the cargo box, to a pre-selected length of lowering device <b>152</b>, to a length determined by the position of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), or to a length supplied by a user remotely, for example. When cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) has been deployed, in an aspect, the actuator raises package release mechanisms <b>153</b>, retracts arm <b>151</b>, and closes the door(s). In an aspect, a controller operably coupled with sensors that detects the position of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) determines if manipulation of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) has completed by accessing default timing values, or by determining, based on sensor information, if cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) has reached a desired surface and the manipulation mechanism has disengaged with cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). In an aspect, a deployment location is requested by a user, and the vertical distance from the cargo area to the deposit surface is determined by sensors on the AV. For example, the crane can automatically discontinue its downward movement when some resistance is met equivalent to the resistance that would be encountered if cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) reached a surface. In another aspect, the crane is lowered a preselected distance. In another aspect, passive restraint is used to gently place cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) at the desired location. In another aspect, springs are used to cushion placement of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, when the AV reaches the desired destination, in an aspect, commands received from the AV processors instruct the controls within the cargo box to open the proper cargo box doors. In an aspect, when the AV reaches the desired destination, commands are received from a remote controller that opens/closes doors and ejects cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), for example, from the cargo box. In an aspect, the AV provides status information about the delivery/pickup on a status area located upon the AV, for example, for even when the intended recipient is not at the delivery location, others at the location might be interested in the status of the AV. In an aspect, the AV provides the status information to the receiver/provider of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) by a text, email, website posting, automated phone call, or any other electronic means. In an aspect, the AV provides status information to a remote controller, and possibly logs status information. Status information output can be controlled by user-managed settings, default settings, or dynamically-determined settings, possibly based on the availability of network access. In an aspect, the AV determines environmental conditions, for example, rain or snow, and automatically determines when a delivery/pickup is ill-advised at the time the AV arrives at the destination. In an aspect, the AV informs the user of the inclement conditions, and/or requests help from a remote controller, or other alternative actions. In some configurations, the AV deploys an environmental barrier to protect cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The barrier can include, for example, but not limited to, a waterproof cover, a UV protective barrier, and/or a thermal barrier. In some configurations, the environmental barrier is built into the cargo container, for example.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref>, a second exemplary configuration in which no-touch, unattended cargo manipulation is accomplished includes arms <b>33</b> riding upon telescoping lift having, for example, but not limited to, first part <b>39</b> slidably coupled with second part <b>35</b>, deployed from the cargo box within which cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) can rest during transport. In an aspect, arms <b>33</b> lower cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) onto a surface clear of the AV. Arms can be positioned to deploy cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) from the sides, front, or rear of the AV. Regardless of the operating location of arms <b>33</b>, an actuator propels the telescoping lift from the cargo box. For example, the telescoping lift is stored in retracted position as the AV transports cargo <b>13</b> to a desired destination. The telescoping lift is moved by an actuator, possibly the actuator used to open and close the AV door(s) from which cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) emerges. The telescoping lift can move outside of the cargo box, causing cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) to be moved outside the cargo box. In an aspect, arms <b>33</b> include a telescoping feature, and can deploy cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) to a pre-selected length, to a length determined by the position of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>), or to a length supplied by a user remotely, for example. The telescoping lift is directed to move towards the surface. When the surface is reached, arms <b>33</b> are directed to release cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>). When cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) has been deployed, the actuator causes the telescoping lift to raise arms <b>33</b>, and be retracted into the cargo box. The actuator can, optionally, close the door(s) while arms <b>33</b> are being retracted. In an aspect, a controller operably coupled with sensors that detect the position of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) determines if manipulation of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) has completed by accessing default timing values, or by determining, based on sensor information, if cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) has reached a desired surface and the manipulation mechanism has disengaged with cargo <b>13</b>. In an aspect, the deposit location is requested by a user, and the vertical distance from the cargo area to the deposit surface is determined by sensors on the AV. For example, arms <b>33</b> automatically discontinue their downward movement when some resistance is met equivalent to the resistance that would be encountered if cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) reached a surface. In an aspect, arms <b>33</b> are lowered a preselected amount. In an aspect, passive restraint is used to gently place cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) at the desired location. In an aspect, shock absorbers <b>1016</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>G</figref>) are used to cushion placement of cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, in a third exemplary configuration, an articulated arm reaches into the cargo box, or is deployed from the cargo box, grabs cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), and lowers cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) a desired amount. The articulated arm is automatically stored after depositing cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). The articulated arm includes a robotic arm, for example, with the number of degrees of freedom based at least upon the storage location of the arm. The number of degrees of freedom is based on the aspects of motion of the articulated arm. For example, at a joint, the arm may be able to move up/down and/or right/left. The more ways the arm can move, the higher the number of degrees of freedom. The articulated arm can be stored within the cargo box, or attached to the external features of the AV, for example. The articulated arm can include a plurality of joints, depending upon desired flexibility of the arm. In an aspect, the arm includes a shoulder joint located at the junction of the arm and the cargo box, elbow joint <b>163</b>A, wrist joint <b>165</b>, and hand <b>166</b>, which can grasp and hold package release mechanisms <b>153</b> holding cargo <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) until being commanded by a controller to release the hold as described herein.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in a fourth exemplary configuration, ramp <b>171</b> is extended from an opening in the cargo box. Ramp <b>171</b> can include features that can enable cargo <b>13</b> to slide on ramp <b>171</b> towards the surface. The features can include, but are not limited to including, ball bearings, rollers, and/or treads. The treads can include a &#x201c;moving sidewalk&#x201d; apparatus, for example. In an aspect, ramp <b>171</b> includes an apparatus that grabs cargo <b>13</b>. For example, ramp <b>171</b> includes a moveable hook, and cargo <b>13</b> includes a compatibly-positioned/sized coupling for the hook. Force can be provided to cargo <b>13</b> to propel cargo <b>13</b> towards ramp <b>171</b>. For example, a retractable arm as described herein can be used to push cargo <b>13</b> out of the cargo box to land upon any features that might be present, and travel down ramp <b>171</b> onto the surface.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring now to any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, other configurations are contemplated by the present teachings. For example, in an aspect, an arm can be connected, possibly removably, to a backstop, which itself can be connected to a platform or shelf. Alternatively, the backstop and platform or shelf can be a single article. Still further, the arm, backstop, and platform or shelf can be a single article. The arm, backstop, and platform or shelf can be retracted into the cargo box for storage after the cargo has been deployed. The backstop can engage with a lowering/raising means such as, for example, but not limited to, a linear actuator. In an aspect, forks can retract into the backstop, and can extend into a compatible pallet that can support the cargo. The pallet can be deployed with the cargo at a desired destination. In this configuration, the cargo can be placed atop the pallet, and the forks can extend into the pallet cavities to support the pallet and cargo. The entire structure can be pushed outside the cargo box and lowered to the surface. In an aspect, the forklift-like device can include a plurality of forks coupled with a carriage that can ride along at least one mast to move the cargo from the cargo box to a surface. The forks, carriage, and mast can be sized to fit into the cargo box. When the cargo is deployed, the forks, carriage, and mast, holding the cargo, can be moved outside the cargo box. A deployment post can include, for example, a telescoping feature, and can operably couple with the mast. The mast can also include a telescoping feature. The forks can operably couple with the mast interface. The mast interface can ride up and down the mast, regardless of the telescoping status of the mast. A controller can manage the deployment of the deployment post. When deploying cargo, sensors can inform the controller when the deployment post has reached a desired extension, and can then begin lowering the forks (and cargo) and telescoping the mast parts. Alternatively, the weight of the cargo can provide the force to lower the cargo. The drop of the cargo can be cushioned by a form of shock absorbers on the forks. In another aspect, the platform can engage with a track that can be built into the cargo box, for example, or can be coupled with the platform. The track can be activated to move the platform out of the cargo box. The track can include crawler treads that can be activated to move the platform to/from the cargo box. In some configurations, no backstop is required. In this case, the platform can engage with the deployment mechanism when it has sufficiently cleared the cargo box. Other methods of moving the platform horizontally and/or vertically are contemplated by the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>, exemplary configurations of an AV that can be used to implement the system of the present teachings are shown. The exemplary AV is described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/435,007, entitled System and Method for Distributed Utility Service Execution, filed Jun. 7, 2019 ('007), U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/926,522, entitled System and Method for Real Time Control of an Autonomous Device, filed Jul. 10, 2020 ('522), U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/035,205, entitled Mobility Device, filed on Jul. 13, 2018 ('205), U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/787,613, entitled Mobility Device, filed on Oct. 18, 2017 ('613), and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/600,703, entitled Mobility Device, filed on May 20, 2017 ('703), all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. While exemplary AV configurations are shown, other AV configurations are contemplated to implement the unattended cargo manipulation of the present teachings. AV <b>101</b> can include sensors <b>103</b> that, along with processors <b>117</b>, enable the AV to autonomously navigate. Wheels <b>113</b>A are controlled by powerbase <b>115</b> that interfaces with processors <b>117</b> with respect to direction and speed of wheels <b>113</b>A. Casters <b>111</b> enable AV <b>101</b> to travel over varying types of terrain.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref>, in a fifth exemplary configuration, AV <b>101</b> delivers cargo <b>109</b>, transported in cargo hold <b>21</b>A, through a side opening. In an aspect, AV <b>101</b> includes at least one door that opens to an area wide enough to permit cargo <b>109</b> to pass unobstructed through the opening in AV <b>101</b>. In an aspect, the door(s) can open side to side, up and down, and/or diagonally, for example. In an aspect, a single door is used. The single door can move to either side, away from the ground, or towards the ground. The single door can also move diagonally, or at any other angle with respect to the surface. In an aspect, as shown, two doors are used. In an aspect, AV <b>101</b> includes arm-like features <b>1121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) that grasp delivery container <b>109</b> and guide it through the door opening and clear of AV <b>101</b>. Arm-like features <b>1121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) can, for example, include robotic arms whose force against delivery container <b>109</b> can automatically be adjusted based at least on sensor input from the reaction of delivery container <b>109</b> to the pressure from arms <b>1121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). In an aspect, cables, straps, cords, bands, or belts, for example, can be cinched around a surface of delivery container <b>109</b>, and delivery container <b>109</b> can be moved outside the cargo box to clear AV <b>101</b>. Package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) can surround delivery container <b>109</b> partially or completely. Delivery container <b>109</b> can be released from package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) by, for example, but not limited to, decoupling package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) from delivery container <b>109</b>. For example, delivery package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) can terminate in temporary connectors such as, for example, but not limited to, hooks that engage with recesses <b>2022</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>J</figref>), VELCRO&#xae; strips, or magnets. In an aspect, the temporary connectors are disengaged when delivery package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>), for example, move away from delivery container <b>109</b>. Delivery package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) include, for example, spacers (not shown) that can be activated when delivery container <b>109</b> reaches a surface. In an aspect, the spacers force package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) to release delivery container <b>109</b>. If package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) surround delivery container <b>109</b>, spacers (not shown) cause delivery container <b>109</b> to tilt forward and slide from its engagement with package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) while package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) are retracted towards arms <b>1121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). After package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) are fully retracted into arms <b>1121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>), in an aspect, arms <b>1121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>) are drawn into the cargo area of AV <b>101</b>, leaving delivery container <b>109</b> available for pickup.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>E-<b>5</b>F</figref>, in a sixth exemplary configuration, AV <b>101</b> includes arms <b>23</b> and ropes <b>25</b>, similar to package release mechanisms <b>1123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). Arms <b>23</b> may extend from any location on cargo box <b>21</b>. For example, arms <b>23</b> can extend from the upper corners of cargo box <b>21</b> as shown. Arms <b>23</b> can extend from anywhere along the top, edges, or bottom of the cargo hold. Arms <b>23</b> can extend to their full length from the cargo hold, or any shorter length, depending upon, for example, the size and weight of delivery container <b>109</b>. Arms <b>23</b> can be constructed of flexible, semi-rigid, or rigid weight-bearing material, the material possibly being selected for holding up to a pre-selected maximum cargo weight. Ropes <b>25</b> can be flexible enough to retract and store compactly, but can retain a measure of rigidity, if needed. Ropes <b>25</b> can fully surround the ground-facing surface of delivery container <b>109</b>, or can terminate in connectors as discussed herein. Ropes <b>25</b> can include, but are not limited to including, cables, cords, lines, strands, chains, or strings. Arms <b>23</b> can include telescoping features made from fiberglass, aluminum, steel, or other suitable material. In an aspect, the extension of arms <b>23</b> is actuated by the same mechanism as actuates the opening of doors <b>105</b>/<b>107</b>. Ropes <b>25</b> are extended to enable delivery container <b>109</b> to reach a desired surface near AV <b>101</b>, if necessary. Other aspects are contemplated that hold delivery container <b>109</b> as it is moved out of the cargo hold. Ropes <b>25</b> extend from arms <b>23</b> to enable delivery container <b>109</b> to be deployed to a surface. When the surface is reached, ropes <b>25</b> are disengaged from delivery container <b>109</b>. Sensor data received from sensors <b>103</b> associated with delivery container <b>109</b>, ropes <b>25</b>, and arms <b>23</b>, for example, can trigger the disengagement of ropes <b>25</b> from delivery container <b>109</b>. Ropes <b>25</b> can be temporarily connected to delivery container <b>109</b>, and the connection can be automatically released when delivery container <b>109</b> has reached its desired position. Disconnected cables <b>25</b> are retracted, and arms <b>23</b> and cables <b>25</b> can be repositioned inside of the cargo hold, and doors <b>105</b>/<b>107</b> are closed. A sanitizing sequence can be optionally activated.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>, in an aspect, cargo box <b>102</b> includes rollers <b>211</b> that pinch delivery container <b>13</b> between them, and/or unwind sail <b>215</b> between them. Rollers <b>211</b> emerge from the cargo area when door(s) <b>105</b>/<b>107</b> open, and return to the cargo area as door(s) <b>105</b>/<b>107</b> are closed. Delivery container <b>13</b>/<b>213</b> travels upon sail <b>215</b> if sail <b>215</b> is deployed. Sail <b>215</b> is retracted into rollers <b>211</b> to leave delivery container <b>13</b>/<b>213</b> at its desired destination. The AV can accommodate non-uniformly-shaped delivery container <b>213</b> at least by positioning sensors within the cargo box <b>102</b> to determine enough dimensional data, including weight, to adjust the deployment apparatus properly.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, in a sixth configuration, the AV includes an open cargo area, or a cargo area that can be either open or closed, and can include support structure <b>185</b>. The AV can also include autonomy sensors <b>103</b> and processors <b>117</b>, and powerbase <b>115</b> to drive wheels <b>113</b>A. In an aspect, the cargo area includes a cap (not shown) that can be retracted and stored, for example, a canvas &#x201c;convertible&#x201d; top. The hardware to retract the top can be mounted to the top of the cargo area, in which case the retracted top can rest upon the top of the cargo area. The hardware to retract the top can be mounted to the bottom of the cargo area, in which case the top can be stored, after retraction, under the cargo area. The cargo area can include open area <b>187</b>, with no &#x201c;convertible&#x201d; aspect. Further, the AV can include a tilting capability in which the cargo area can accommodate tilt <b>193</b> with respect to wheels <b>111</b>/<b>113</b> and powerbase <b>115</b> of the AV. In the sixth configuration, the cargo area includes capture device <b>181</b> to secure delivery container <b>109</b>. Capture device <b>181</b> can include, but is not limited to including, hooks, suction cups, arms, or any other device <b>183</b> that can grab and retain cargo <b>109</b>. The AV includes ramp <b>189</b> or other similar means to automatically deploy delivery container <b>109</b>. If ramp <b>189</b> is used, ramp <b>189</b> is stored on the floor of the cargo area, either within the cargo area or outside of the cargo area. Ramp <b>189</b> can be extendable, and can include telescoping sections and rollers or tracks, for example. In an aspect, ramp <b>189</b> extends directly from the AV, and accomplishes tilt <b>193</b> along with the AV when the AV is tilted to encourage delivery container <b>109</b> to exit the cargo area. Rollers/tracks on the box-facing side of ramp <b>189</b> can also encourage delivery container <b>109</b> to exit. Further, the rollers/tracks can include breaking mechanisms that can be automatically controlled to push delivery container <b>109</b> away from the AV and stop or even reverse the movement of delivery container <b>109</b> of away from the AV. Other deployment means can include runners that can, when deployed, conform to the geometry of delivery container <b>109</b>. The runners can be deployed from either side of the cargo area, and can create, when deployed, a shell-like form around the side edges of delivery container <b>109</b>. When delivery container <b>109</b> leaves the runners, the runners are retracted and stored either within the cargo hold or outside of the cargo hold. In some configurations, delivery container <b>109</b> is placed in a wheeled container within the cargo hold. Wheeled delivery container <b>109</b> is configured to enable a temporary attachment to capture device <b>181</b>/<b>183</b>. When wheeled delivery container <b>109</b> is used, capture device <b>181</b>/<b>183</b> receives assistance from automatic breaking of the wheels <b>191</b>. In an aspect, the capture device <b>181</b>/<b>183</b> can consist solely of braking cables, for example, coupled with wheels <b>191</b> of wheeled delivery container <b>109</b>. The braking cables can be deployed and retracted from inside or outside the cargo area, either from the sides, top, or bottom of the cargo container. In some configurations, instead of tilting, the AV lowers itself to ground level to deploy delivery container <b>109</b>. In an aspect, the cargo hold area includes sensors (not shown) that detect, for example, but not limited to leaks, hazardous odors, and hazardous cargo. For non-hazardous spills and/or for protecting successive cargo shipments from possible contamination from previous shipments, the cargo hold can include automatic sanitation features (not shown) that can be deployed by the AV controller, after delivery container <b>109</b> has exited the cargo hold. When hazardous odors and/or hazardous cargo are detected, the AV can seal the cargo hold, not deploying delivery container <b>109</b>. The AV can trigger well-known hazmat protocols and provide data about delivery container <b>109</b> to officials, for example, through wireless communications available on the AV or associated with delivery container <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref> an autonomous cargo transport device, excluding wheels and powerbase, is illustrated. The wheels and powerbase can be provided in any conventional manner. The cargo transport device includes swing arms and a grab/release device on each arm. The grab/release device, upon contact, engages with a pins located on a cargo box. The engagement is stable until a trigger action that enables the grab/release device to disengage with the cargo box. A trigger action can include an instruction issued by a controller in the powerbase, in the cargo transport device, from a remote command center, from a user's cell phone, or from another source of commands that would control the grip/release device. The arms include at least one extension tube <b>1529</b> and base plate <b>1527</b>. Base plate <b>1527</b> hosts rotary latch <b>1531</b>, an exemplary grip/release device. Base plate <b>1527</b> is completely retracted into extension tube <b>1529</b> when stored within the cargo transport device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, various views of the autonomous device are shown, some relative to ground <b>1533</b>.

Cargo box <b>1535</b> is shown stored in the transport device alongside the arms. The exemplary autonomous device includes, for example, sensors that can be used to drive the autonomous device to a target delivery/pickup location. Further, the sensors can be used to detect identifying information associated with the cargo box. The base of extension tube <b>1529</b> rests in sector gear <b>1515</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref>, to deploy the arms, sector gear <b>1515</b> is rotated.

When the autonomous device determines that the cargo box has reached its target destination, rotary latch <b>1531</b> is released and the arms are retracted. The target destination can be determined by any of several methods including, but not limited to, sensors that detect the distance to the ground, sensors that detect when the cargo box exerts a back-pressure indicating that it has reached a surface, sensors that detect fiducials, or a remote indication by a user or remote operator that the cargo box has reached its target, among other ways.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>E-<b>7</b>N</figref>, schematic perspective diagrams provide details about a first configuration of a lift/lower mechanism of the transport device.

Gear mounting bracket <b>1507</b> and sector gear mounting brackets <b>1513</b>/<b>1514</b> are operably coupled with a chassis mounting components that are mounted to bottom panel <b>1539</b>. Between sector gear mounting brackets <b>1513</b>/<b>1514</b> is sector gear <b>1515</b> that is driven by motor <b>1501</b> (through a gear train described herein) to rotate the arms. The arm and arm brace <b>1541</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>) are operably coupled with and rotate with sector gear <b>1515</b> between standoffs that limit arm rotation. Motor <b>1501</b> rotates geared cross shaft <b>1511</b> at the same time as it rotates sector gear <b>1515</b>. Specifically, motor <b>1501</b> rotates gear <b>1505</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>H</figref>) that is operably coupled with and rotates cross shaft <b>1511</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>H</figref>).

Extension tubes <b>1561</b> are slidingly coupled with arms <b>1559</b> which rotate and extend to move the cargo box into or out of the autonomous vehicle. Arms <b>1559</b> include cam followers <b>1575</b>, and cam followers <b>1575</b> travel in channel <b>1557</b> to guide and limit arm <b>1559</b> and cargo box travel. In some configurations, channel bends <b>1564</b> provide a holding force on the cargo box. The shape of cam channel <b>1557</b> and the presence and location of channel bends <b>1564</b> can vary from configuration to configuration. In some configurations, the gears are sandwiched between roller guide plate <b>1555</b> and roller guide support plate <b>1567</b>. In some configurations, motor plate <b>1579</b> enables mounting of motor <b>1563</b> to the arm configuration through framing members <b>1565</b>. In some configurations, framing members <b>1565</b> include T-slotted framing, for example. Other configurations are contemplated by the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref>, in another configuration, an extension rotation linkage can be used to perform an unattended manipulation of cargo container <b>109</b> that has been transported in an AV to a desired location. Deployment begins by commanding door(s) <b>303</b> to unlatch and open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>), which, in an aspect, substantially simultaneously moves cargo container <b>109</b> onto linkage arms <b>301</b>. At a pre-selected point in the process, linkage arms <b>301</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>) rotate about pivot point <b>302</b>, extending and rotating at the same time due to second sliding linkage <b>313</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). As linkage arms <b>301</b> rotate, cargo container <b>109</b> is lifted out of the cargo hold. Second sliding linkage arm <b>311</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>) is operably coupled at pin recess <b>315</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>) with pin <b>317</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). As linkage arm <b>301</b> and second linkage arm <b>311</b> are rotated, cargo container <b>109</b> is moved away from the interior of the cargo hold and deployed. At this time, the motion of the linkage extends to move cargo container <b>109</b> outside of the AV's ground footprint while the arms are rotating. When linkage arms <b>301</b>/<b>311</b> reach their maximum rotation, or when sensor information directs a controller to cease rotation of linkage arms <b>301</b>/<b>11</b>, pins <b>317</b> are released by an electromechanical latch at the end of each second linkage arm <b>311</b>. In an aspect, cargo container <b>109</b> continues to descend to the surface after pins <b>317</b> are released and cargo container <b>109</b> is successfully deployed by the AV. Linkage arms <b>301</b>/<b>311</b> can reverse their movement and retract into the cargo hold as the door(s) close and latch shut.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, an exemplary method for unattended delivery and pickup relies on identifying features on the cargo box or package, for example, to indicate the target travel destination to the autonomous device. Method <b>9100</b> includes, but is not limited to including, the autonomous device's leaving <b>9101</b> the docking station either housing the cargo box or package or heading to pick up the cargo box or package. If <b>9105</b> the cargo box or package is being loaded directly into the cargo area of the autonomous device, as the package is moved into the cargo space, method <b>9100</b> includes scanning <b>9109</b>A the identifying feature. For example, the package can be manually positioned in the cargo area, or the package can be loaded automatically by a robot, for example. If <b>9103</b> the package has been placed in a pickup location, method <b>9100</b> includes moving <b>9107</b> the autonomous device to a target pickup location and scanning <b>9109</b>A the identifying feature. In some configurations, a user requesting the package pickup can send the request through a handheld/tablet/desktop device, for example, to the autonomous vehicle indicating the target location where the package will be located. The user can remain present at the target location and load the package, or the user can deposit the package at the target location, and in both cases the autonomous vehicle can scan the package for destination and other types of information, for example. Method <b>9100</b> can include using <b>9111</b> the package information to determine a target location. The target location can be determined by contacting a remote operator, by contacting the owner of the package, or by creating an initial route automatically, or possibly a combination of ways. Method <b>9100</b> can include autonomously navigating <b>9113</b>A to the target location according to the initial route and avoiding obstacles detected in real-time along the route. For attended delivery, method <b>9100</b> can include, when reaching the target location, enabling <b>9115</b>A user interaction with the autonomous vehicle. The user interaction can include entering a security code, for example, either directly into the autonomous device, or through an application interface residing on a handheld, tablet, laptop, or the like. The user entry can enable the doors of the autonomous vehicle to open, for example, and the cargo box and/or package to be provided to the user. If the delivery/pickup is unattended, method <b>9100</b> includes determining <b>9117</b>A by the autonomous device, where to deposit the cargo. For example, if the surface at the target location is determined by the autonomous device to have issues such as moisture or other challenging characteristics, the autonomous device searches for a better place to deploy the cargo during a delivery. In some configurations, the autonomous device includes environmental and image sensors that can provide surface and other information to the autonomous device. The autonomous device uses such data in its navigation, and can take the extra step of determining a delivery location based on the data. In either the attended or the unattended case, method <b>9100</b> includes scanning <b>9119</b> by the autonomous device identification associated with the package or cargo box. The autonomous device can use the data from the identification information to inform the recipient, for example, that the package has been delivered, the environmental conditions, the time of day, and any other information that might be useful to the recipient. The autonomous device in some configurations can inform a remote controller that it has completed a delivery or pickup, and can receive a next route, if any. In one scenario, method <b>9100</b> includes navigating <b>9121</b> of the autonomous device to a docking station. The autonomous device can route itself elsewhere, to further deliveries (if the autonomous device has multiple cargo bays) and/or pickups. The autonomous device can determine from a daily task list where to go next, or can receive commands from a remote operator (either a human or a computer) after each delivery/pickup.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>B and <b>10</b>C</figref>, in one aspect, method <b>9050</b> of the present teachings contemplates unattended delivery of cargo by an AV, and can include determining <b>9051</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) that a desired destination is reached and informing <b>9053</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) pre-selected recipients that the desired destination is reached. The desired destination can be selected by at least one of the recipients and transmitted to a deployment manager. In an aspect, a recipient can include the person who purchased the cargo that is destined for unattended delivery. In an aspect, a recipient can include a remote controller of the AV. In an aspect, through appropriate sensors and on-board processing, the AV can determine if it has reached the desired destination. In an aspect, a remote controller can either partially or completely navigate the AV to the desired destination. If <b>9055</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) instructions to deploy cargo are not received, method <b>9050</b> can include waiting <b>9073</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) for deployment instructions. If <b>9055</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) instructions to deploy cargo are received, method <b>9050</b> can include remotely receiving <b>9057</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) security information associated with the cargo from a recipient. If <b>9059</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) the security information is incorrect, method <b>9050</b> can include requesting <b>9075</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) new security information. If <b>9059</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) correct security information is received, method <b>9050</b> can include opening <b>9061</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>) the cargo hold associated with the cargo, the cargo being associated with the recipient and the provided security information, method <b>9050</b> including deploying the cargo. If <b>9063</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) the cargo is not deployed, method <b>9050</b> can include continuing <b>9077</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) to deploy the cargo. If <b>9063</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) the cargo has reached a deployment surface, method <b>9050</b> can include disengaging <b>9065</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) the cargo from the deployment device. If <b>9067</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) the cargo is not disengaged from the deployment device, method <b>9050</b> can include continuing <b>9079</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) to disengage the cargo from the deployment device. If <b>9067</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) the cargo is disengaged from the deployment device, method <b>9050</b> can include retracting <b>9069</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>) the deployment device into the cargo hold, and informing <b>9071</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>) the recipients.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>D and <b>10</b>E</figref>, when the package self-identifies, in an aspect, routing information is included on the package, or can be derived from information on the package. In an example, the identifying information on the package includes the address of the recipient. With the address, the autonomous vehicle determines a route in the way that has been described herein and elsewhere, for example, '007, '522, '205, '613, and '703. The identifying information on the package can include, for example, but not limited to, a bar code (UPC, EAN), a QR code, an RFID label, a pharmacode, or a shipping label. The autonomous vehicle of the present teachings can perform both deliveries and pickups at both vendor and customer locations. For example, the autonomous vehicle could be docked at a vendor location, and could pick up a package at the vendor that has been ordered by a customer. The autonomous vehicle could travel to the package's destination location, drop off the package (either autonomously, semi-autonomously, or recipient pickup), possibly pick up other package(s) at the same location, or travel to another location to pick up other package(s), deliver the package(s) that are being carried anywhere, to a desired customer location or to a desired vendor location, possibly ending up at a docking station to recharge and/or swap power supplies such as batteries. Method <b>9150</b> for autonomous pickup and delivery, executed from the point of view of the autonomous vehicle, includes receiving <b>9151</b> a desired destination. A remote operator, a user, a self-identified package, or a vendor can provide the desired destination, for example. The user can access an application on a handheld device, for example, and summon the autonomous vehicle to a location. The autonomous vehicle can locate the package associated with the summons, for example. A vendor such as a drug store can provide a package including a prescription and provide the desired destination. Alternatively, the prescription package can self-identify. The remote operator can manage a delivery schedule and provide that to the autonomous vehicle periodically or at check-in points or at check in times, for example. The autonomous vehicle can determine its route and desired destinations during its duty cycle by gathering directions from remote operators, users, vendors, and packages themselves. Method <b>9150</b> includes navigating <b>9153</b> to the desired destination. As described herein, the autonomous vehicle begins with a route and changes the route dynamically, depending upon sensor input and what obstacles are in the path of the autonomous vehicle. Method <b>9150</b> includes searching <b>9155</b> for the package. The autonomous vehicle includes sensors and machine learning models that enable locating the package. If <b>9157</b> the package is attended, method <b>9150</b> includes receiving <b>9159</b> the package into the cargo hold of the autonomous vehicle. The autonomous vehicle can receive communications from the package provider at the desired location that enables the autonomous vehicle to enact attended reception processes. Steps that lead up to receiving the package include receiving identifying information from the package provider, the identifying information causing the cargo hold to open for the package provider to deposit the package. If <b>9157</b> the package is unattended, method <b>9150</b> includes deploying <b>9161</b> a delivery/pickup mechanism from the autonomous vehicle and using the delivery/pickup mechanism to retrieve <b>9163</b> the package. The delivery-pickup mechanism can include such devices as are described herein. Method <b>9150</b> includes scanning <b>9165</b> identifying information from the package, if available. If available, the identifying information, possibly in the form of a code, is processed by the autonomous vehicle to parse out information that is included in the code. For example, the identifying information could include a destination address, a description of the contents of the package, security codes required before the package is released from the cargo hold, contact information for the intended recipient, or directions to contact a remote control operator. In an aspect, identifying information includes route information that the autonomous vehicle could use to optimize route creation, and/or seek help from a recipient and/or remote operator with navigation. Method <b>9150</b> includes accessing or creating <b>9167</b> a route based on the identifying information, present or not, for when the identifying information is not present, the autonomous vehicle seeks navigation help from a remote operator, for example. Method <b>9150</b> includes navigating <b>9169</b> to the desired destination determined based on the identifying information. If <b>9171</b> the desired destination is unattended, method <b>9150</b> includes accessing delivery information from identifying information. The delivery information, if available, can include whether to deliver the package to a specific location, such as a front porch, or to a secure area. The secure area could need a passcode, which could be part of the identifying information, enabling the autonomous vehicle to open the secure area using the passcode. The delivery information, if available, could include where to deliver the package if environmental conditions are a concern, such as rain or snow. The delivery tote itself could be weatherproof. If <b>9175</b> delivery information is available, method <b>9150</b> includes deploying <b>9177</b> the delivery/pickup mechanism having the package in the grasp of the mechanism (through means described herein), and moving <b>9179</b> the package from the cargo hold to the desired location. If <b>9175</b> there is no delivery information available, method <b>9150</b> includes contacting <b>9181</b> the recipient or a remote operator for instructions, navigating <b>9183</b> to the instructed location, deploying <b>9177</b> the delivery/pickup mechanism, and moving <b>9179</b> the package from the cargo hold to a desired location. If <b>9171</b> the desire destination is attended, method <b>9150</b> includes prompting <b>9185</b>, by the autonomous vehicle, the recipient who is attending the delivery for identifying information. The prompting can happen on a face of the autonomous vehicle, and information could be provided into a keypad or verbally, or through biometric means, for example, on the autonomous vehicle cargo box. In an aspect, the prompting can happen on a computer application, verbally, visually, or biometrically, for example. Method <b>9150</b> includes scanning <b>9187</b> the package for identifying information before the package is retrieved by the recipient. Such scanning enables the autonomous vehicle to track deliveries, inform the vendor and others who might be interested, and create/update a log file. Method <b>9150</b> includes opening <b>9189</b> the cargo hold so that the recipient can retrieve the package, and sense <b>9191</b> when the package is retrieved. Whether or not the delivery is attended, method <b>9150</b> includes closing <b>9193</b> the cargo hold (if there are no packages to be received and scanned at the location), and receiving <b>9195</b> further instructions from, for example, a remote control operator, a delivery truck, a vendor, or a summoning user. If <b>9197</b> there are further deliveries or other work to be performed by the autonomous vehicle, and if <b>9199</b> the autonomous device has enough power for another delivery, method <b>9150</b> includes returning to step <b>9155</b>. If <b>9197</b> there are no further deliveries, method <b>9150</b> includes navigating <b>9198</b> the autonomous vehicle to a docking area and returning to step <b>9151</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, in one aspect, system <b>9100</b>A of the present teachings for unattended manipulation of cargo by an AV can include destination processor <b>9101</b>A configured to determine that desired destination <b>9109</b> has been reached, and to inform, through communications processor <b>9103</b>, pre-selected recipients <b>9107</b>A/<b>9114</b> that desired destination <b>9109</b> has been reached. Desired destination <b>9109</b> can be selected by at least one of the recipients <b>9107</b>A/<b>9114</b> and transmitted to deployment manager <b>9105</b>. In an aspect, a recipient can include user <b>9107</b>A, who is expecting the cargo that is destined for unattended delivery/pickup. In an aspect, a recipient can include remote controller <b>9114</b> of the AV. In an aspect, remote controller <b>9114</b> can either partially or completely navigate the AV to desired destination <b>9109</b>. In an aspect, the AV can navigate itself to desired destination <b>9109</b>. Deployment processor <b>9113</b> can receive, from communications processor <b>9103</b>, instructions that user <b>9107</b>A/<b>9114</b> desires the cargo to be delivered to desired destination <b>9109</b>, and can trigger security processor <b>9115</b> to request and receive security information associated with the cargo from a recipient. Because there is no recipient present to enter security information, the request to receive security information can be transmitted, by communications processor <b>9103</b>, to one or more recipients. In an aspect, the recipient can, in advance of the delivery, provide alternative means for unattended delivery/pickup. Alternative means can include, but are not limited to including, providing, to the sender of the cargo, one or more designated ways that security processor <b>9115</b> can receive security information through, for example, communication processor <b>9103</b>. Security processor <b>9115</b> can receive security information from communications processor <b>9103</b>, and check that the security information is associated with the cargo in an expected way. In an aspect, security information is gathered by sensors <b>9108</b>. The security information can include a password, a cargo identification, a customer identification, or any combination of recipient-specific information. The security process can be as extensive as necessary to protect the cargo, for example, a two-factor authentication can be required. Security processor <b>9115</b> can notify the recipient or designate if the security information is incorrect, and can request further security information. When the security information has been verified, security processor <b>9115</b> can trigger deployment processor <b>9113</b> to open the cargo hold associated with the cargo associated with the recipient and the provided security information. Deployment processor <b>9113</b> can initiate deployment of the cargo. Various deployment methods have been contemplated by the present teachings and discussed herein. For example, deployment processor <b>9113</b> can direct AV controller <b>9117</b> to open the doors of the cargo hold and propel the delivery container, cradled by a deployment device, outside of the cargo hold. Deployment processor <b>9113</b> can direct AV controller <b>9117</b> to move the delivery container to a surface. Depending upon the delivery destination, the surface can be above or below the level of the cargo hold. When the surface is below the cargo hold, deployment processor <b>9113</b> can direct AV controller <b>9117</b> to lower the delivery container to the surface. When the delivery container has reached the surface, whether above or below the level of the cargo hold, deployment processor <b>9113</b> can direct AV controller <b>9117</b> to disengage the deployment device from the delivery container. Methods for disengagement have been discussed herein. Sensors can indicate when disengagement is complete. At this time, deployment processor <b>9113</b> can direct AV controller <b>9117</b> to retract the deployment device into the cargo hold and close the door(s) of the cargo hold. Retraction can take different forms, depending upon the nature of the deployment device. Various retraction techniques have been discussed herein. After retraction is complete, deployment processor <b>9113</b> can direct AV controller <b>9117</b> to inform the recipients of a completed unattended cargo deployment. In an aspect, alternative delivery destinations can be selected in case, for example, the AV is not able to navigate to the desired delivery destination, or an inclement environment exists at the desired delivery destination, among other reasons.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A trailer of the present teachings can enhance the utility of a delivery/pickup vehicle by (1) providing additional storage space, (2) providing additional energy storage or power supplies, (3) maintaining a consistent pitch between the cargo section of the delivery vehicle and the cargo section of the trailer, regardless of the underlying terrain or the delivery vehicle wheel configuration, and (4) buffering vertical and horizontal movement of the trailer. The trailer can be used to increase carrying capacity of the delivery/pickup vehicle which can include manually driven and autonomous vehicles. The trailer can be left behind with the delivery, for example, or can be used to deploy the cargo in, for example, but not limited to, a secure delivery container, or can be used for cargo pickup. The trailer can include suspension to provide a relatively smooth ride for the cargo, even over uneven terrain. For example, a mountain bike-type suspension can be used in conjunction with a sling arm connected to the wheels of the trailer. The trailer may include wheels that are relatively large when compared with a standard roadside curb, which may facilitate the trailer's climbing such a curb. The trailer can further include supplemental power supplies that are, in some configurations, wired to the towing vehicle, and can possibly extend the range of an autonomous vehicle. Storing the supplemental batteries underneath the trailer frame may provide a lower center of gravity for the trailer. A configuration of the trailer can include storage locations for supplemental power sources for the towing vehicle. For example, supplemental batteries can be stored underneath a trailer frame, for example. In an aspect, the supplemental power supplies can power such devices as sensors and lights on the trailer. In an aspect, the trailer includes at least one sensor that assists the autonomous vehicle in evaluating its environment. The at least one sensor can include, for example, but not limited to, ultrasonic, short range radar, and/or cameras. The sensor(s) can be located at the rear of the trailer, on the cargo box, and/or on the sides of the trailer and cargo box. In an aspect, the trailer includes a linkage that enables the payload of the trailer to pitch with the cargo box of the autonomous vehicle. The linkage can include a 4-bar linkage, for example. The trailer, in some configurations, stabilizes the autonomous vehicle at relatively higher speeds. In some configurations, the trailer includes at least one processor that performs, for example, sensor processing and power control, among other actions in support of either manual or autonomous navigation. The trailer can be connected to a towing vehicle such as, for example, but not limited to, an autonomous device. In an aspect, the hitch between the trailer and the towing vehicle includes, for example, but not limited to, a 4-bar cross hitch or a standard ball hitch. In an aspect, the tie rod is connected to the hitch by a spherical end. In an aspect, a steering damper provides a resistance to yaw motion between the trailer and the autonomous device. The steering damper can include, but is not limited to including, a hydraulic cylinder or an oil-filled cylinder, including a needle valve that can be used to adjust the resistance.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, a simplified version of a trailer of the present teachings including certain features is shown. For example, trailer <b>400</b> includes storage space <b>421</b> that can be used to carry cargo. The cargo can include, but is not limited to including, loose items, bagged items, boxed items, and/or a secured delivery container. Storage space <b>421</b> can be open, covered, partly covered, and/or convertibly covered. Storage space <b>421</b> can provide secure storage that can be locked and unlocked remotely or locally. Storage space <b>421</b> may have some or all of the feature of the cargo section of the delivery vehicle as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/926,522 entitled System and Method for Real time Control of an Autonomous Device, filed Jul. 10, 2020, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, trailer <b>400</b> can also provide storage or mounts, for example, outside of the cargo area, for power supplies <b>423</b>. In an aspect, power supplies <b>423</b> such as batteries or fuel cells can be used to power devices found on trailer <b>400</b> such as sensors and lights. In an aspect, power supplies <b>423</b> can provide supplemental power to the vehicle that is enabling the movement of trailer <b>400</b>. In an aspect, power supplies <b>423</b> can be wired to the towing vehicle, can be replacement batteries that can be swapped with the batteries on the towing vehicle, and/or can power devices on the trailer. In an aspect, power supplies <b>423</b> can include, but are not limited to including, batteries, fuel cells, solar collection devices, and wind collection devices. Power supplies <b>423</b> can be mounted under, above, within, or beside storage space <b>421</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, a feature of trailer <b>400</b> is that the cargo section carried by trailer <b>400</b> maintains the same pitch as the cargo section carried by the towing vehicle. To enable a linkage between trailer <b>400</b> and the towing vehicle that supports pitch consistency, trailer <b>400</b> is connected to the towing vehicle to form a 4-bar linkage that includes four rigid elements: tie rod <b>441</b>, trailer frame structure <b>443</b>, mast <b>431</b>, and hitch cross <b>437</b> hitching the trailer to the towing vehicle. The rigid elements are arranged in a vertical plane. Here, vertical plane means a plane that is perpendicular to a plane defined by the drive wheels of the towing vehicle or the base of the storage space <b>421</b>. The storage space, or cargo section, <b>421</b> is rigidly mounted to the mast <b>431</b> and thus maintains a fixed orientation with respect to the mast orientation.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Continuing to still further refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, the tie-rod and trailer base structure are each connected to mast <b>431</b> by pivots (<b>425</b>, <b>427</b>) that allow rotation in the vertical plane. In an aspect, the trailer-mast pivot <b>427</b> and the tie-rod-mast pivot <b>425</b> only allow motion in the vertical plane. The tie-rod and trailer base structure are connected to the cross-hitch on the tow vehicle with pivots <b>439</b>,<b>435</b> that allow rotation in both the vertical and horizontal planes. In an aspect, the tie-rod&#x2014;hitch-cross pivot <b>439</b> and/or the trailer plate&#x2014;hitch-cross pivot <b>435</b> are universal joints, pillow block bearings, elastic couplings, or other mechanical joints that allow rotation in two orthogonal planes. The four-bar linkage comprising the tie-rod <b>441</b>, mast <b>431</b>, trailer base structure <b>443</b>, and hitch-cross <b>437</b> form a parallelogram where the opposite pairs of bars are always parallel. In this case, hitch-cross <b>437</b> and mast <b>431</b> are always parallel, so that the pitches of hitch cross <b>437</b> and therefore cargo section <b>421</b> are always the same as cargo section <b>361</b>A in towing vehicle <b>402</b> which is rigidly connected to hitch-cross <b>437</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, when the terrain is challenging or variable such as, but not limited to, including steps, uneven ground or soft-ground, each tire <b>429</b> can independently adjust through swing arm <b>433</b>. The swing arms <b>433</b> may include a spring/damper or shock absorber to form the suspension of the trailer. The base of the cargo section <b>421</b> is decoupled from the vertical motion of the tire <b>429</b>, and decoupled from the 4-bar linkage. The pitch of the cargo section <b>421</b> is tied to the pitch of the cargo section of the towing vehicle through the 4-bar linkage.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, illustrations of a towing vehicle and trailer of the present teachings are shown. Towing vehicle <b>402</b> in the illustration is configured to adjust to the terrain by employing different numbers of drive wheels. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, towing vehicle <b>361</b>A is shown with four (two not shown) drive wheels <b>389</b>/<b>391</b> making ground contact for the purpose of navigating challenging terrain. The four-bar linkage that includes tie-rod <b>441</b>, trailer frame structure <b>443</b>, mast <b>431</b>, and hitch cross <b>437</b> can maintain consistent pitch <b>363</b> between the cargo in towing vehicle <b>402</b> and trailer <b>400</b>, while tire <b>429</b> maintains ground contact through swing arm <b>433</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, towing vehicle <b>402</b> is shown with four (two not shown) drive wheels <b>389</b>/<b>391</b>, only one (drive wheel <b>391</b>) of which is making ground contact. Caster <b>375</b> provides the required balance for standard driving on relatively smooth terrain where only two drive wheels are required. Tie rod <b>441</b> and trailer frame structure <b>443</b>, connected to mast <b>431</b>, can maintain consistent pitch <b>363</b> between the cargo in towing vehicle <b>402</b> and trailer <b>400</b>, while tire <b>429</b> maintains ground contact through swing arm <b>433</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref>, a configuration of the trailer of the present teachings embodying the features described herein is shown. The present teachings are not limited to the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref>. These configurations, and other drawings herein, are provided for illustrative purposes only. Towing vehicle <b>21001</b> includes a cargo area that rests on platform <b>21002</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, towing vehicle <b>21001</b> is configured for challenging terrain, deploying four (only two are shown) drive wheels <b>21011</b>, and retracting caster <b>21012</b> as it is not needed in this situation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, towing vehicle <b>21001</b> is configured for smooth terrain, deploying two (only one is shown) drive wheels <b>21011</b>, along with caster <b>21012</b> as it is needed in this situation. Tie rod <b>113</b> and spar (not shown), connected to mast <b>321</b>, are angled to maintain consistent pitch <b>325</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) and <b>301</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) between the cargo in towing vehicle <b>21001</b> and trailer <b>305</b>, while trailer tire <b>21011</b>A maintains ground contact through swing arm <b>311</b>. A distance between the cargo box of trailer <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) and a platform (not shown) above tie rod <b>113</b> can be seen to be lower than distance <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) between the cargo box of trailer <b>305</b> and a platform (not shown) above tie rod <b>113</b>. Other such comparisons include distance <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) compared to distance <b>203</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>), in the autonomous vehicles is in <b>4</b>-wheel mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) in which caster <b>21012</b> is lifted, versus standard mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) in which caster <b>21012</b> rests on the surface. In 4-wheel mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>), distance <b>207</b> is greater than distance <b>204</b>, i.e., the front wheel is on the surface in 4-wheel mode and lifted in standard mode. Although the distances vary in each case, the pitch of the cargo box remains the same in each case (and the same as the pitch of the trailer). Distance <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) versus distance <b>205</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) illustrates why the pitch does not change from one mode to another, specifically, because the distance between the cargo box and the rear wheel changes, depending upon the mode. Nevertheless, in both situations, the pitch <b>325</b>/<b>301</b> of the cargo in both towing vehicle <b>21001</b> and trailer <b>305</b> is consistent. In an aspect, trailer <b>305</b> can include conventional steering damper <b>1114</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B</figref>, the trailer of the present teachings can include wheels <b>21011</b>A coupled at their axles with swing arms <b>311</b>.
