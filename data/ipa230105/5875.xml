The devices for bonding may include through-silicon vias. In dielectric bonding, a dielectric surface is bonded with another dielectric surface. Hybrid bonding often includes bonding of a hybrid surface that includes a dielectric portion and a metal portion, between devices. For bonding metal surfaces, thermal compression is often used to form metal-metal bonding.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As two semiconductor structures are bonded together for 3-dimensional integration, more complications are introduced. Factors such as heat or an electromagnetic radiation generated by one semiconductor structure may affect operations of one or more semiconductor structures in the bonded structures. For example, heat generated by one semiconductor structure may not only affect its own operations, but also affect operations of the other semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosed methods and systems are directed to solve one or more problems set forth above and other problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure includes a metal-dielectric bonding method.
