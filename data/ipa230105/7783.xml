Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a method of manufacturing a conductive pattern, a touch sensor, an electromagnetic wave shield, an antenna, a wiring board, a conductive heating element, and a structure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conductive pattern such as a fine metal wire is used for various applications. Examples of the applications of the conductive pattern include a touch sensor of a touch panel, an antenna, a fingerprint recognition unit, a foldable device, and a transparent flexible printed circuit (FPC). For example, in the manufacturing of a semiconductor package, a printed wiring board, or a re-distribution layer of an interposer, a fine conductive pattern is formed on a substrate. As the substrate, for example, a film, a sheet, a metal substrate, a ceramic substrate, or glass is used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a general method of forming a conductive pattern, for example, a subtractive method or a semi-additive method is known (for example, JP2015-225650A and JP2015-065376A). In the subtractive method, a conductive pattern can be formed, for example, by protecting a conductive layer on a substrate with a resist pattern and subsequently removing the conductive layer that is not protected by the resist pattern by etching. On the other hand, in the semi-additive method, for example, after providing an electroless copper plating layer called a seed layer on a substrate, a resist pattern is further provided on the electroless copper plating layer. Next, after forming a conductive pattern by plating on the electroless copper plating layer where the resist pattern is not provided, the resist pattern and the electroless copper plating layer (seed layer) that are unnecessary are removed.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in order to reduce the electric resistance of a conductive pattern, a thick conductive pattern may be formed. However, in the subtractive method, the conductive layer protected by the resist pattern may also be corroded by a chemical liquid in a phenomenon (for example, called &#x201c;side etching&#x201d;) in which isotropic etching also progresses in an in-plane direction of the substrate on which the conductive layer is disposed. The occurrence of the side etching affects the form (for example, shape and dimension) of the conductive pattern formed through the etching. Therefore, for example, it is difficult to form a thick rectangular conductive pattern. In the semi-additive method, there is a problem in that the formation of the conductive pattern is unstabilized due to adhesiveness between the seed layer and the resist pattern. In addition, in a case where the unnecessary seed layer is removed, a part of the conductive pattern may be removed. Therefore, the semi-additive method has also the same problem as the subtractive method.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure has been made in consideration of the above-described circumstances.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of one aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a method of manufacturing a conductive pattern capable of forming a thick conductive pattern in which the occurrence of form abnormality (for example, breakage, peeling, chipping, the occurrence of a tapered shape caused by side etching, and instability in dimension caused by variation in etching;

Using the method of manufacturing a conductive pattern according to the present disclosure, a thick conductive pattern in which the occurrence of form abnormality is reduced is formed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0113">The reason why the method of manufacturing a conductive pattern according to the present disclosure exhibits the above-described effects is presumed to be as follows. As described above, in the method of manufacturing a conductive pattern in the related art (for example, the subtractive method and the semi-additive method), a step of processing a conductive layer prepared in advance in a patterned manner by etching or a step of removing a seed layer after forming a conductive pattern is adopted. Therefore, the controllability of the shape and dimension of the thick conductive pattern is a problem. On the other hand, in the method of manufacturing a conductive pattern according to the present disclosure, through the preparation step, the exposure step, the development step, and the conductive pattern forming step, for example, the occurrence of form abnormality of the conductive pattern caused by side etching or the removal of the seed layer can be reduced. Here, the method of manufacturing a conductive pattern according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing one example of the method of manufacturing a conductive pattern according to the present disclosure. (<i>a</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of the preparation step. (<i>b</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of the exposure step. (<i>c</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of the development step. (<i>d</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of the conductive pattern forming step. A laminate <b>100</b> shown in (<i>a</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a transparent substrate <b>10</b>, a light shielding pattern <b>20</b>, and a negative tone photosensitive resin layer <b>30</b>. As shown in (<i>b</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a surface (that is, an exposed surface <b>10</b><i>a</i>) of the transparent substrate <b>10</b> opposite to a surface facing the light shielding pattern <b>20</b> is irradiated with light. The proportion of light passing through the light shielding pattern <b>20</b> is small. Therefore, light incident into the exposed surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the transparent substrate <b>10</b> passes through an exposed portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the negative tone photosensitive resin layer <b>30</b> through the transparent substrate <b>10</b>. As a result, the exposed portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the negative tone photosensitive resin layer <b>30</b> is selectively exposed. As shown in (<i>c</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, by developing the negative tone photosensitive resin layer <b>30</b>, a portion of the negative tone photosensitive resin layer <b>30</b> other than the exposed portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>is removed, and a resin pattern <b>40</b> is formed in a region (that is, a groove) defined by the transparent substrate <b>10</b> and the light shielding pattern <b>20</b>. As shown in (<i>d</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a conductive pattern <b>50</b> is formed on the light shielding pattern <b>20</b>. As shown in (<i>d</i>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the conductive pattern <b>50</b> is formed in the region (that is, the groove) defined by the light shielding pattern <b>20</b> and the resin pattern <b>40</b> that function as a mold. Through the above-described steps, the thick conductive pattern <b>50</b> can be easily formed. Accordingly, using the method of manufacturing a conductive pattern according to the present disclosure, a thick conductive pattern in which the occurrence of form abnormality is reduced is formed.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0114">&#x3c;&#x3c;Preparation Step&#x3e;&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0077" num="0115">In the preparation step, a laminate including a transparent substrate, a light shielding pattern that is formed on the transparent substrate, and a negative tone photosensitive resin layer that is disposed on the transparent substrate and the light shielding pattern and is in contact with the transparent substrate is prepared.

That is, the preparation step may include a step of manufacturing the laminate.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0116">[Transparent Substrate]</p><p id="p-0079" num="0117">The laminate includes a transparent substrate. In the present disclosure, &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; represents that a transmittance at an exposure wavelength is 50% or more. The transmittance at the exposure wavelength defined by the term &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; is preferably 80% or more, more preferably 90%, and still more preferably 95%. In the present disclosure, &#x201c;the transmittance at the exposure wavelength&#x201d; refers to a transmittance at a wavelength of light that arrives at an object (for example, the transparent substrate) in the exposure step. For example, in a case where a light source having a wavelength of 365 nm is used in the exposure step, &#x201c;the transmittance at the exposure wavelength&#x201d; refers to a transmittance at a wavelength of 365 nm. In the present disclosure, &#x201c;transmittance&#x201d; refers to a ratio of an intensity of emitted light transmitted through and emitted from a measurement object to an intensity of incidence light in a case where light is incident in a direction (that is, a thickness direction) perpendicular to a main surface of the measurement object.

The average thickness of the transparent substrate is measured using the following method.

The thickness of the transparent substrate is measured at 10 points based on the obtained observation image. By averaging the measured values, the average thickness of the transparent substrate is obtained. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) may be used instead of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) depending on the thickness of the object.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0124">It is preferable that a total light transmittance of the transparent substrate is high.

The negative tone photosensitive resin composition was applied to a surface of the temporary support using a slit-shaped nozzle such that the application width was 1.0 m and the thickness after drying was a value shown in Table 2. The kind of the negative tone photosensitive resin composition was selected as shown in Table 2. By drying the formed coating film of the negative tone photosensitive resin composition at 90&#xb0; for 100 seconds, the negative tone photosensitive resin layer was formed. By pressure bonding a polyethylene film (GF-818, manufactured by Tamapoly Co., Ltd., thickness: 19 &#x3bc;m) as a cover film to the surface of the formed negative tone photosensitive resin layer, a photosensitive transfer material was prepared.

After peeling off the cover film from the photosensitive transfer material, the photosensitive transfer material was bonded to the PET film with the copper layer. The bonding step was performed under conditions of roll temperature: 100&#xb0; C., linear pressure: 1.0 MPa, and linear velocity: 1.0 m/min. Next, the negative tone photosensitive resin layer was exposed by being irradiated with light using a high-pressure mercury lamp exposure device (MAP-1200L, manufactured by Japan Science Engineering Co., Ltd., dominant wavelength: 365 nm) through a photomask. After peeling off the temporary support, the negative tone photosensitive resin layer was developed by showering using a sodium carbonate aqueous solution having a liquid temperature of 25&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds. As a result, a resin pattern (line/space=5.5 &#x3bc;m/4.5 &#x3bc;m) was formed. The copper layer that was not covered with the resin pattern was etched using an etchant (Cu-02, manufactured by Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.). The remaining resin pattern was removed using a stripper (10 mass % sodium hydroxide aqueous solution). Through the above-described procedure, the PET film with the copper pattern (line/space=5 &#x3bc;m/5 &#x3bc;m) was prepared. The copper pattern functions as the light shielding pattern.

A surface of the PET film opposite to a surface facing the copper pattern (light shielding pattern) was irradiated with light using a high-pressure mercury lamp exposure device (MAP-1200L, manufactured by Japan Science Engineering Co., Ltd., dominant wavelength: 365 nm). The exposure amount is shown in Table 2. After peeling off the temporary support, the photosensitive resin layer was developed by showering using a sodium carbonate aqueous solution having a liquid temperature of 25&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds. As a result, a resin pattern was formed. The space portion (that is, the groove) of the copper pattern (light shielding pattern) was filled with the resin pattern. The average thickness of the resin pattern is shown in Table 2. Copper was deposited on the copper pattern (light shielding pattern) that was not covered with the resin pattern by electrolytic copper plating. The current density in the electrolytic copper plating was 1.8 ASD. The treatment time in the electrolytic copper plating was 6 minutes. The PET film after the electrolytic copper plating was heated at 130&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. Through the above-described procedure, a structure including the copper pattern (line/space=5 &#x3bc;m/5 &#x3bc;m) was prepared.

However, in the step of irradiating light, misregistration of the copper pattern (light shielding pattern) that was presumed to occur by contraction of the PET film was observed. Therefore, it was difficult to perform registration between the position of an opening portion of the photomask and the space portion of the copper pattern (light shielding pattern). As a result, the resin pattern was not able to be formed on the space portion of the copper pattern (light shielding pattern).</p><p id="p-0472" num="0506">&#x3c;Evaluation&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0473" num="0507">[Formability of Conductive Pattern]</p><p id="p-0474" num="0508">Using an optical microscope, any 100 visual fields of the structure having the conductive pattern were observed.
