secondary batteries are widely used for electronic devices such as personal computers and communication terminals, motor vehicles, and the like since these secondary batteries have a high energy density. The energy storage device is generally provided with an electrode assembly, having a pair of electrodes electrically isolated by a separator, and a nonaqueous electrolyte solution interposed between the electrodes and is configured to perform charge-discharge by transferring ions between both the electrodes. Capacitors such as lithium ion capacitors and electric double-layer capacitors are also widely in use as energy storage devices except for the nonaqueous electrolyte solution secondary batteries.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a negative electrode material for such an energy storage device, the use of an aluminum foil that has a surface coated with carbon is proposed (see Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP-A-2012-174577</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an energy storage device with an aluminum foil used as a negative electrode material, even when an excessive amount of electric current flows through the negative electrode to such an extent that metal lithium is deposited, a lithium-aluminum alloying reaction is developed, thereby allowing the deposition of metal lithium dendrite to be inhibited. In an energy storage device in which an aluminum foil provided with a conductive layer such as carbon coat on the surface of the aluminum foil is used as a negative electrode material, a reaction of metal lithium dendrite deposition may be possibly generated preferentially rather than a lithium-aluminum alloying reaction in the case of charge (overcharge) beyond the charged state in normal use. This is because the presence or absence of the conductive layer affects the supply rate of lithium ions onto the negative substrate, but does not affect the supply rate of lithium ions to the negative active material. If any metal lithium dendrite is produced, the temperature of the energy storage device may be possibly increased rapidly. For this reason, the further improved safety of the energy storage device in the overcharged state is desired.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide an energy storage device capable of further improving safety at the time of overcharge.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of the present invention made for solving the problems mentioned above is an energy storage device including: a negative electrode including a negative substrate made of pure aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a conductive layer directly or indirectly layered on the negative substrate and containing a conductive agent, and a negative active material layer containing a negative active material capable of occluding lithium ions at a potential of 0.05 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup> or lower; and a positive electrode opposed to the negative electrode and including a positive substrate and a positive active material layer directly or indirectly layered on the positive substrate, where the negative active material layer is layered on the negative substrate and the conductive layer so as to include a region in contact with the negative substrate and a region in contact with the conductive layer.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantages of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide an energy storage device capable of further improving safety at the time of overcharge.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the appearance of an energy storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view schematically illustrating an electrode assembly of an energy storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a part of an electrode assembly of an energy storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a part of an electrode assembly of an energy storage device according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating an energy storage apparatus configured by aggregating a plurality of energy storage devices according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An energy storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: a negative electrode including a negative substrate made of pure aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a conductive layer directly or indirectly layered on the negative substrate and containing a conductive agent, and a negative active material layer containing a negative active material capable of occluding lithium ions at a potential of 0.05 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup> or lower; and a positive electrode opposed to the negative electrode and including a positive substrate and a positive active material layer directly or indirectly layered on the positive substrate, and the negative active material layer is layered on the negative substrate and the conductive layer so as to include a region in contact with the negative substrate and a region in contact with the conductive layer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The energy storage device is capable of further improving safety at the time of overcharge. Although the reason for this is not clear, the following reason is presumed. In the energy storage device, the negative active material layer is layered on the negative substrate and the conductive layer so as to include a region in contact with the negative substrate and a region in contact with the conductive layer. In addition, the energy storage device includes the negative substrate made of pure aluminum or an aluminum alloy, and the negative active material layer contains a negative active material that is capable of occluding lithium ions at a potential of 0.05 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup> or lower, that is, has a possibility of metal lithium deposition in the case of charge at a high current density. Thus, when the charged state of the energy storage device is increased, the negative potential is likely to be lower than the potential at which a lithium-aluminum alloying reaction is developed in the region with the negative active material layer in contact with the negative substrate. For this reason, when the energy storage device is overcharged, the above-mentioned lithium-aluminum alloying reaction is likely to proceed in the region with the negative active material layer in contact with the negative substrate, thereby inhibiting the deposition of metal lithium, and thus, the safety of the energy storage device at the time of overcharge can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As viewed in the direction in which the negative electrode and the positive electrode are opposed to each other, an end edge of the conductive layer is preferably protruded toward an outer edge side from an end edge of the positive active material layer. In a region of the negative active material layer formed on the conductive layer, the lithium-aluminum alloying reaction in the negative substrate is inhibited by the conductive layer interposed. In addition, in a normal use, lithium ions move in the region where the positive active material layer and the negative active material layer face are opposed to each other. The end edge of the conductive layer is protruded toward the outer edge side from the end edge of the positive active material layer as viewed in the direction in which the negative electrode and the positive electrode are opposed to each other, thereby leading to the conductive layer layered in the region of the negative active material layer opposed to the positive active material layer, and thus, in normal use, lithium ions are kept from reaching the negative substrate, and the lithium-aluminum alloying reaction in the negative substrate is inhibited. Because the lithium-aluminum alloying reaction is likely to be developed in the case of charge at a high current density, the energy storage device is particularly effective in the case of charge under conditions of, for example, 5 C or higher.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the device further includes a negative electrode external terminal and a positive electrode external terminal that each conduct electricity to an external, the negative substrate has a negative electrode connection connected to the negative electrode external terminal, and a region of the negative active material layer in contact with the negative substrate is located on the negative electrode connection side of the negative substrate. In the energy storage device, the lithium-aluminum alloying reaction of the negative substrate proceeds on the negative electrode connection side connected to the negative electrode external terminal, thereby significantly increasing the electrical resistance of the negative substrate. The electric resistance of the negative substrate is significantly increased on the negative electrode connection side connected to the negative electrode external terminal, thereby improving an inhibiting effect on the generation of a further charge current at the time of overcharge, and allowing safety at the time of overcharge to be further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The negative active material is preferably hardly graphitizable carbon or easily graphitizable carbon. The hardly graphitizable carbon or the easily graphitizable carbon has a higher discharge capacity at a potential that is higher than the potential at which the lithium-aluminum alloying reaction is developed, as compared with other carbon materials such as natural graphite or artificial graphite. The negative active material is hardly graphitizable carbon or easily graphitizable carbon, thereby allowing the capacity density of the energy storage device to be increased when pure aluminum or an aluminum alloy is used for the negative substrate.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, an energy storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">&#x3c;Energy Storage Device&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hereinafter, as an example of the energy storage device, an energy storage device which is a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery will be described. The energy storage device includes: an electrode assembly that has a negative electrode and a positive electrode stacked; a negative current collector joined to the negative substrate; a nonaqueous electrolyte solution containing lithium ions; and a case that houses the electrode assembly, the negative current collector, and the nonaqueous electrolyte solution.
