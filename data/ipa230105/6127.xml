Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since a piezoelectric polymer has a processing performance specific to a polymer material, the piezoelectric polymer is used in various forms. For example, a piezoelectric sheet made of polylactic acid generates an electrical output by a shear stress on the sheet. Therefore, such a piezoelectric sheet is considered to be applied as, for example, an input device that is provided on a screen of a smart phone and that accepts a touch input executed by a finger. However, even if the piezoelectric sheet is provided on the screen, there is not large room for the piezoelectric sheet to bend, and thus the shear stress is unlikely to be generated and a sufficient electrical output cannot be attained.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, WO2016/175321 discloses a braided piezoelectric element in which a piezoelectric fiber formed of a piezoelectric polymer is wound on a surface of a conductive fiber formed of a conductive material so that the surface is coated with the piezoelectric fiber. In such a braided piezoelectric element, the piezoelectric fiber including the piezoelectric polymer that is uniaxially oriented in a fiber axis direction is used. In addition, WO2016/175321 discloses that a winding angle of the piezoelectric fiber with respect to the conductive fiber is set to an oblique direction of 15&#xb0; or more and 75&#xb0; or less. By setting the winding angle to such a range, the shearing stress is likely to be generated in the piezoelectric fiber, and a large electric signal associated with a piezoelectric effect can be extracted through the conductive fiber.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the braided piezoelectric element has a complicated structure and is difficult to be manufactured. In addition, since the braided piezoelectric element has a special shape, it may be difficult to handle the braided piezoelectric element as a piezoelectric element.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A piezoelectric element according to an application example of the present disclosure includes: a piezoelectric body having a first surface and a second surface that are different from each other; a first electrode provided at the first surface; and a second electrode provided at the second surface.

Since the melt <b>919</b><i>a </i>is compressed by the flat screw <b>94</b>, the melt <b>919</b><i>a </i>is injected by a pressure. Accordingly, the melt <b>919</b><i>a </i>is injected at a high pressure, a force pressed in an injection direction D1 is applied to the deposits <b>919</b><i>b </i>formed by depositing the melt <b>919</b><i>a </i>at the upper surface <b>911</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, when the deposit <b>919</b><i>b </i>contains, for example, polylactic acid as the helical chiral polymer, an advance axis of the helical SP of a molecular structure of the polylactic acid, that is, the longest c axis in a unit cell of the polylactic acid is oriented along the upper surface <b>911</b><i>a</i>.

Therefore, it was found that the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to the example contains a crystal in which the b axis was uniaxially oriented.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">For the piezoelectric body test piece obtained in the example, a locking curve profile when a 2&#x3b8; position was fixed at 14.7&#xb0; was obtained, and the degree of orientation of the b axis was calculated according to the above-mentioned calculation method. As a result, the degree of orientation of the b axis was 0.83.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">6.3. Degree of Orientation of Piezoelectric Body Test Piece</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0138">Next, apart from the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to the example, a piezoelectric body test piece produced in a manner of reducing a degree of orientation was prepared as Comparative Example 4. In Comparative Example 4, the piezoelectric body test piece was obtained in the same manner as in the example except that a temperature of a plate was changed to 105&#xb0; C. The degree of orientation of the b axis in the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to Comparative Example 4 was 0.75.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0139">Next, the piezoelectric device having the unimorph structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> was produced by incorporating the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to the example and the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to Comparative Example 4. A displacement amount when the same voltage was applied was measured.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0140">As a result, in the piezoelectric body test piece obtained in the example, a displacement amount significantly larger than that in the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to Comparative Example 4 was obtained.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0141">The same test as described above was performed on the piezoelectric body test piece in which the degree of orientation of the b axis was set to 0.85 and 0.90 by increasing the temperature of the nozzle. However, the displacement amount significantly larger than that in the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to Comparative Example 4 was obtained in the same manner as that in the piezoelectric body test piece obtained according to the example.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0142">As described above, it was clear that the piezoelectric property of the piezoelectric body can be sufficiently improved and the piezoelectric effect and the inverse piezoelectric effect can be improved by setting the degree of orientation of the b axis to 0.80 or more.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230006128A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="9.48mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230006128A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
