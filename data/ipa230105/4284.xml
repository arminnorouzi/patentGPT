The touch panel display <b>132</b> is structured using, for example, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or organic Electro Luminescence (EL). A resistance film system, an electrostatic capacitance system, an ultrasonic surface elastic wave system, an infrared radiation optical imaging system, or an electromagnetic induction system is used in the touch panel display <b>132</b>. A pressure sensor <b>136</b>, for detecting the pressure of a touch on the screen (or, stated differently, a region whereon a touch operation is possible) is built into the touch panel display <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The audio outputting unit <b>140</b> has a speaker <b>142</b> and a speaker driver <b>144</b> for driving the speaker <b>142</b>.

The predetermined function may be, for example, a temperature adjusting function or air flow rate adjusting function for the passenger compartment, a volume adjusting function for the speaker <b>142</b>, a map thumbnail changing function for navigation, an air suspension vehicle height adjusting function, a seat massage intensity adjusting function, a seat heater temperature adjusting function, a drive mode switching function (switching to Snow Mode or Dirt Mode, switching between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive, etc.), or the like.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The user is able to designate, through an operation on the operating unit <b>120</b> or through a touch operation on the region <b>138</b>A, the function for which the control value is to be set. In the present embodiment, the explanation below will assume that the passenger compartment temperature adjusting function has been designated.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When operating a vehicle, for example, the user must concentrate on driving. Because of this, the user is unable to look at the screen <b>138</b> while driving. In this way, in a state wherein a touch operation is performed on the region <b>138</b>A of a screen <b>138</b> that the user is unable to view, it will be difficult for the user to set passenger compartment temperature to an intended temperature.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Given this, in the present embodiment the control value setting program <b>102</b> is executed by the CPU <b>100</b>A. Execution of the control value setting program <b>102</b> improves the ease of operations when setting control values for the various types of functions, including the temperature adjusting function described above. Because of this, even in a state wherein the user cannot look at the screen <b>138</b>, the user can still set the control value to the intended value (for example, the intended temperature for the passenger compartment) easily. The improved ease of operations enables the user to concentrate on driving while adjusting the temperature, for example, correctly.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart showing the control value setting program <b>102</b> that is executed by the CPU <b>100</b>A in one embodiment.

The four divided regions are displayed superimposed on the image that is displayed on the screen <b>138</b> (for example, the navigation image that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Note that the image for the four divided regions may be semitransparent. In this case, the image displayed on the screen <b>138</b> continues to be displayed, in the background of the image of the four divided regions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control value setting program <b>102</b> acquires, from the touch panel display <b>132</b>, the touch position (x1, y1) in the region <b>138</b>A wherein the pressing force of no less than the predetermined value is detected by the pressure sensor <b>136</b> (Step S<b>102</b>). Touch positions and detouch positions by the user on the region <b>138</b>A are acquired as two-dimensional coordinates data.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The control value setting program <b>102</b> assigns correspondence between the four divided regions and respectively different controlled objects. By way of illustration, the vehicle in which the control value setting device <b>1</b> is installed is provided with temperature adjusting devices for each of the seats (that is, for respectively different controlled objects) so as to enable the temperature to be adjusted independently for each seat (the driver seat, the passenger seat, the back seat on the driver side, and the back seat on the passenger side). The top left region <b>138</b><i>a </i>is associated with the temperature adjusting device for the passenger seat. The top right region <b>138</b><i>b </i>is associated with the temperature adjusting device for the driver seat. The bottom left region <b>138</b><i>c </i>is associated with the temperature adjusting device for the back seat on the passenger side. The bottom right region <b>138</b><i>d </i>is associated with the temperature adjusting device for the back seat on the driver side. Note that in this example the explanation is for a case envisioning the steering wheel as being on the right.

In the second modified example, the control value setting area CSA is partitioned into total of seven first areas: a circular first area at A<sub>0 </sub>and first areas A<sub>+3</sub>, A<sub>+2</sub>, A<sub>+1</sub>, A<sub>&#x2212;1</sub>, A<sub>&#x2212;2</sub>, and A<sub>&#x2212;3 </sub>that are semicircular band shapes arranged around the first area A<sub>0</sub>. The first areas A<sub>+1</sub>, A<sub>+2</sub>, and A<sub>+3 </sub>are arranged so as to surround 180&#xb0; around the top half of the first area A<sub>0</sub>. The first areas A<sub>&#x2212;1</sub>, A<sub>&#x2212;2</sub>, and A<sub>&#x2212;3 </sub>are arranged so as to surround 180&#xb0; around the bottom half of the first area A<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In Modified Example 2, the control value setting area CSA is displayed within the region <b>138</b>A so that the touch position (x3, y3) will be the position of the center of the first area A<sub>0</sub>. The first area A<sub>0 </sub>and the six circular band-shaped first areas are arranged concentrically. Moreover, the widths of the six circular band-shaped first areas are the width w. The circular first area A<sub>0 </sub>has a diameter that is equal to the width w. Because of this, in Modified Example 2, the seven first areas that partition the control value setting area CSA have equal sizes w in all directions that pass through the touch position (x3, y3). That is, in Modified Example 2, the seven first areas include parts with equal sizes w, lined up in a plurality of directions.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In Modified Example 2, the setting temperature will be increased or decreased by 0.5&#xb0; C. increments (that is, the amount of change in the setting temperature will be constant), when the user slides the finger by the amount w in any direction with the touch position (x3, y3) as the starting point, enabling the user to increase or decrease the setting temperature with the operation feeling the same every time.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In Modified Example 2, there is no constraint on the direction of sliding of the finger when the amount of change of the setting temperature is constant. Because of this, the user is able to set even more easily, to the intended temperature, the temperature of the seat that is the controlled object, even in a state wherein the screen <b>138</b> cannot be viewed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this way, cases wherein the plurality of first areas includes parts that are lined up with equal sizes in a plurality of directions are also included in the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXPLANATION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0088"><b>1</b>: Control Value Setting Device</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0089"><b>100</b>: Controlling Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0090"><b>100</b>A: CPU</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0091"><b>100</b>B: RAM</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0092"><b>100</b>C: ROM</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0093"><b>100</b>D: Input/Output Port</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0094"><b>100</b><i>a</i>: Position Acquiring Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0095"><b>100</b><i>b</i>: Area Displaying Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0096"><b>100</b><i>c</i>: Control Value Setting Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0097"><b>100</b><i>d</i>: Pre-detouch Position Acquiring Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0098"><b>100</b><i>e</i>: Controlled Object Selecting Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0099"><b>100</b><i>f</i>: Generating Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0013" num="0100"><b>102</b>: Control Value Setting Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0014" num="0101"><b>110</b>: Communication Interface Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0015" num="0102"><b>120</b>: Operating Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0016" num="0103"><b>130</b>: Displaying Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0017" num="0104"><b>132</b>: Touch Panel Display</li>    <li id="ul0001-0018" num="0105"><b>134</b>: Display Driver</li>    <li id="ul0001-0019" num="0106"><b>136</b>: Pressure Sensor</li>    <li id="ul0001-0020" num="0107"><b>140</b>: Audio Outputting Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0021" num="0108"><b>142</b>: Speaker</li>    <li id="ul0001-0022" num="0109"><b>144</b>: Speaker Driver</li>    <li id="ul0001-0023" num="0110"><b>150</b>: Vibrating Unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0024" num="0111"><b>152</b>: Vibrator</li>    <li id="ul0001-0025" num="0112"><b>154</b>: Vibrator Driver</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
