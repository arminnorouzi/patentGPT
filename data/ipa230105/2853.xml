Lithium extraction from salt lake brine will become the main direction of lithium salt production in the 21st century. Lithium resources in nature mainly occur in granite pegmatite-type deposits, salt lake brine, seawater and geothermal water. According to statistics, the reserves of lithium resources in salt lake brine account for about 70-80% of the total lithium resources. Therefore, lithium extraction from salt lake brine will become the main way of lithium salt production. The global lithium salt products produced from brine (calculated in terms of lithium carbonate) has accounted for more than 85% of the total lithium products.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lithium-containing salt lake brine generally contains magnesium ions, and the magnesium content directly affects the extraction of lithium. Generally, when a magnesium-to-lithium ratio (Mg/Li) is lower than 8-10, the natural evaporation concentration-precipitation method can be used; and if it is higher than 10, the magnesium and lithium are not easily separated. The technical methods of extracting lithium salt from salt lake brine at home and abroad mainly include precipitation method, extraction method, ion exchange adsorption method, carbonization method, calcination leaching method, Xu's method and electrodialysis method, etc. Among them, the precipitation method, the extraction method, the adsorption method and the carbonization method have been extensively studied and are the main methods for extracting lithium from salt lake brine. The extraction of lithium salts from brine generally adopts evaporation-crystallization-precipitation in industry, and all the final products are lithium carbonate. The precipitation method is feasible, but the process flow is long, the material turnover is large, multiple calcinations are required, the operation steps are complicated, the final lithium leaching solution has a low concentration of lithium and requires a large power cost to concentrate. The extraction method has a high recovery rate, but the process flow is long, the equipment corrosion is serious, and the production cost is high, making it difficult to achieve industrialization. The resin adsorption method is to use lithium ion exchange adsorbents such as titanium dioxide, metal phosphates, composite antimonates, aluminum salt type adsorbents and organic ion exchange resins to selectively treat salt lake brine with high magnesium-to-lithium ratio. The selective adsorbent is used to adsorb lithium ions, and then the lithium ions are eluted to achieve the purpose of separating lithium ions from other impurity ions. This method is simple in process, high in recovery rate and good in selectivity, and has great advantages compared with other methods. However, in the process of the precipitation method, extraction method and carbonization method, it is necessary to introduce a deep magnesium removal process, which increases the process steps and production cost and reduces the yield of lithium. Therefore, it is of great significance in economic value and environmental protection to promote the process of lithium carbonate in salt lakes with relatively high lithium content such as Taijnaier Lake and Yiliping in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province in China.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">CN1511964 discloses a method for extracting lithium from salt lake brine by adsorption method, which is suitable for lithium-containing salt lake brine in Qinghai and concentrated lithium-containing brine in salt fields, and suitable for the process of preparing lithium carbonate and lithium chloride from Qinghai salt lake brine; wherein aiming at the concentrated lithium-containing brine obtained by evaporating in the sun in the salt field, the Li+ is adsorbed with an aluminum salt type adsorbent, and the Li+ is eluted with water to obtain an effluent, and magnesium is removed from the effluent and then the effluent is concentrated to meet the qualified raw materials required for the preparation of lithium carbonate or lithium chloride. The lithium ion adsorption efficiency of this method is low, and a deep magnesium removal process is required, so the production cost is high.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">CN102031368 discloses a continuous ion exchange device and a method for extracting lithium from salt lake brine, and the method adopts a valve array to realize the whole process. In the device, since there are many valves used in the device, the valve program control is complicated, and the use and maintenance costs are high.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">CN1452513A discloses a fluid treating device, which comprises a distributing device with a revolving disc in a stationary housing, and a motor for rotating the revolving disc, through the feeding pipe and the discharging pipe contained on the distributing device to contact with the solid material inside the container, thereby realizing the fluid treatment process. The method mainly proposes a device structure and fluid distribution method, but does not involve a specific production process and method, and has no operability and production practice.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the problems of low adsorbent utilization rate and low utilization efficiency and high production and processing costs in the process of extracting lithium from salt lake brine in the prior art, the present invention provides a new method for extracting lithium from salt lake brine, in which a continuous adsorption system with a multi-way valve is combined with the lithium adsorbent.
