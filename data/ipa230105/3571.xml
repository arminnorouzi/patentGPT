For this purpose, these sensors are immersed in the liquid. These acoustic signals propagate in the liquid and are reflected back to the sensor upon impinging upon an interface in the liquid or in the container, for example, consisting of solid particles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The emission and detection of the acoustic signals normally takes place in the vertical direction relative to the container floor. Depending on requirements, the sensor should calculate the height of the interface above the container floor or the interface depth relative to a reference point, normally the water surface.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For this purpose, known sensors first determine the distance between sensor and interface on the basis of the parameters&#x2014;e.g., &#x201c;tank depth&#x201d; and &#x201c;immersion depth of the sensor in the liquid&#x201d;&#x2014;that are manually input by the user into the sensor. The parameters &#x201c;tank depth&#x201d; and &#x201c;immersion depth of the sensor&#x201d; must thus be determined on-site by the user for each sensor beforehand.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This manual parameter determination and parameter input by the user is linked with a great deal of work, in particular if a plurality of sensors are used. Likewise, it is not simple for the user to determine the &#x201c;immersion depth&#x201d; parameter exactly manually. In addition, such a sensor is suitable only for applications in which the fill level of the liquid in the container, i.e., the immersion depth, does not vary. A use of these sensors for applications, such as what are known as &#x201c;sequencing batch reactors,&#x201d; with varying fill level is thus not possible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to propose a method which enables a reliable, convenient, and versatile use of an interface sensor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is achieved by an operating method of an interface sensor according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An operating method according to the present disclosure comprises the following steps: arrangement of an interface sensor with a sound emitter, a sound detector and a control unit in a container, which is filled with a measurement medium such that the interface sensor is in contact with the measurement medium, wherein the interface sensor is aligned in the direction of a sediment layer in the container; emission of a first acoustic signal with a first frequency by the sound emitter; detection by the sound detector of a first signal response of the first acoustic signal; emission by the sound emitter of a second acoustic signal with a second frequency different from the first frequency; detection by the sound detector of a second signal response of the second acoustic signal; evaluation by the control unit of the first signal response and the second signal response; determination by the control unit of a floor distance and a sediment distance of the interface sensor, on the basis of the evaluation step; determination by the control unit of a sediment thickness on the basis of the floor distance and the sediment distance; and outputting of the sediment thickness by the control unit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Using the operating method according to the present disclosure, it is enabled that the &#x201c;tank depth&#x201d; and &#x201c;immersion depth&#x201d; parameters no longer need to be determined by the user. A fluctuating immersion depth is detected by the interface sensor and enables a highly accurate measurement value calculation. The interface sensor is capable of calculating the fill level in the container, e.g., the water level. By evaluating the change in fill level or the rate of change, the quantity flowing into the container and the quantity discharging from the container can be calculated. The interface sensor thus supplies a continuous fill level measurement value. The interface sensor can thus be used as a proportional element of automatic control engineering.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the operating method further comprises a step of determining a water level distance of the interface sensor by the control unit on the basis of the step of evaluating the first signal response and the second signal response, as well as a step of determination of a water level by the control unit on the basis of the floor distance and the water level distance, as well as a step of outputting the water level.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the step of evaluating the first signal response and the second signal response comprises a subtraction of the first signal response from the second signal response and/or a low-pass filtering and an addition of the first signal response and the second signal response.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the step of determining the sediment thickness comprises a subtraction of the determined sediment distance from the determined floor distance.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the step of determining the water level distance comprises a subtraction of the first signal response and the second signal response.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The aforementioned object is further achieved by an interface sensor for a sedimentation plant according to the present disclosure. An interface sensor according to the present disclosure comprises: a sound emitter that is configured for generating at least one first acoustic signal with a first frequency and for generating a second acoustic signal with a second frequency different from the first frequency; a sound detector that is configured for detecting at least one first signal response of the first acoustic signal and a second signal response of the second acoustic signal; and a control unit, wherein the control unit is connected to the sound emitter and to the sound detector and is configured for evaluating the first signal response and the second signal response.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The aforementioned object is further achieved by a sedimentation plant according to the present disclosure. A sedimentation plant according to the present disclosure comprises: an interface sensor according to the present disclosure; a container for receiving a measurement medium, wherein the interface sensor is arranged relative to the container such that the interface sensor is configured for being immersed in the measurement medium; a measurement medium inlet for filling the container with measurement medium; a measurement medium outlet for discharging measurement medium from the container.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the measurement medium inlet has an inlet valve, and the measurement medium outlet has a drain valve, wherein the sedimentation plant further has an automatic control unit, and the automatic control unit is connected to the inlet valve, the drain valve and the control unit of the interface sensor, and is configured for regulating the filling and emptying of the container with measurement medium.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the sedimentation plant further comprises a gas inlet with a gas inlet valve for treating the measurement medium with gas, wherein the automatic control unit is connected to the gas inlet valve and is configured for regulating the treatment of the measurement medium with gas.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The aforementioned object is also achieved by an automatic control method according to the present disclosure. An automatic control method according to the present disclosure comprises the following steps: providing a sedimentation plant according to the present disclosure; operating the interface sensor according to the present disclosure; regulating the inlet valve and the drain valve depending on the water level determined by the interface sensor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the sedimentation plant has a gas inlet with a gas inlet valve for treating the measurement medium with gas, wherein the automatic control unit is connected to the gas inlet valve and is configured for regulating the treatment of the measurement medium with gas, wherein the automatic control method further comprises a step of treating of the measurement medium with gas by means of the gas inlet valve, wherein the treatment with gas is performed depending on the sediment thickness and/or the water level.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the automatic control method further comprises a step of the determination of an operating state of the sedimentation plant by the control unit on the basis of the evaluation of the first signal response and/or the second signal response.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure is explained in more detail on the basis of the following description of figures.

The sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is used, for example, in a wastewater (e.g., sewage) treatment plant.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sedimentation plant <b>1</b> includes a container <b>20</b> for receiving a measurement medium <b>2</b>. The container <b>20</b> is, for example, a sewage sludge basin or what is known as a &#x201c;sequencing batch reactor&#x201d; or another vessel. The container <b>20</b> is open at the top, for example, so that sewage gases can escape. The container <b>20</b> is suitably configured such that a sediment layer <b>3</b> is deposited by the measurement medium <b>2</b> on its floor or base. The sediment layer <b>3</b> is part of the measurement medium <b>2</b> and is produced, for example, by the sinking of heavy particles in the measurement medium <b>2</b>, e.g., a decanting of the measurement medium <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sedimentation plant <b>1</b> includes a measurement medium inlet <b>21</b>. The measurement medium inlet <b>21</b> can be integrated into the container <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or, for example, can also be arranged above or in the container <b>20</b>, for example, by means of a hose or the like, without contact with respect to the container <b>20</b> to supply the measurement medium <b>2</b> to the container <b>20</b>. The measurement medium inlet <b>21</b> may include an inlet valve <b>22</b> for regulating the quantity of measurement medium <b>2</b> during the filling of the container <b>20</b> with measurement medium <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The sedimentation plant <b>1</b> further includes a measurement medium outlet <b>23</b>. The measurement medium outlet <b>23</b> may be integrated into the container <b>20</b>, for example, by means of a discharge pipe. However, the measurement medium outlet <b>23</b> can also be defined by the edge of the container <b>20</b>, such that an overflow of the container <b>20</b> enables a discharge of measurement medium <b>2</b> from the container <b>20</b>. A drain valve <b>24</b> may be arranged on the measurement medium outlet <b>23</b> to enable a regulation of the quantity of measurement medium <b>2</b> during the discharge of measurement medium <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> may further include a gas inlet <b>26</b>. The gas inlet <b>26</b> is, for example, integrated into the container <b>20</b>, for example, by means of a pipe. However, the gas inlet <b>26</b> can also be configured as a gas line independent of the container <b>20</b>, for example, by a hose or pipe inserted from above into the open-top container <b>20</b>. The gas inlet <b>26</b> may include a gas inlet valve <b>27</b> to effect a regulation of the gas quantity introduced into the measurement medium <b>2</b>. The gas inlet <b>26</b> is particularly advantageous if the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is what is known as a &#x201c;sequencing batch reactor.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to at least one embodiment, which is compatible with all described embodiments, the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> may include, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, an automatic control unit <b>25</b> that is connected to the inlet valve <b>22</b> and the drain valve <b>24</b> and is configured for regulating the filling and emptying of the container <b>20</b> with measurement medium <b>2</b>. The automatic control unit <b>25</b> is also connected to the gas inlet valve <b>27</b>, in embodiments including the gas inlet valve <b>27</b>, and is configured for regulating a gas flow at the gas inlet <b>26</b>. The automatic control unit <b>25</b> is connected via a wired or wireless communication channel to the inlet valve <b>22</b>, to the drain valve <b>24</b> and, if present, to the gas inlet valve <b>27</b>. The automatic control unit <b>25</b> is configured for operating the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> as what is known as a &#x201c;sequencing batch reactor,&#x201d; which will be discussed in detail further herein. The automatic control unit <b>25</b> may be also connected to the interface sensor <b>10</b> in order to control, for example, the inlet valve <b>22</b>, the drain valve <b>24</b> and the gas inlet valve <b>27</b> depending on the interface sensor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The terms water surface, water level and water level distance used in the following are to be understood to apply not only to water as the measurement medium but to all possible measurement media.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The interface sensor <b>10</b> includes a sound emitter <b>11</b>, a sound detector <b>12</b> and a control unit <b>13</b>. The sound emitter <b>11</b> and sound detector <b>12</b> can also be embodied in a common unit, e.g., as transceiver <b>11</b>,<b>12</b>. In such an embodiment, the transceiver <b>11</b>,<b>12</b> therefore functions on the one hand as a sound emitter and on the other hand as a sound detector. If the sound emitter <b>11</b> or the sound detector <b>12</b> is mentioned in the following, the transceiver <b>11</b>,<b>12</b> is also meant at the same time. Of course, all embodiments can also be realized with a transceiver.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sound emitter <b>11</b> and sound detector <b>12</b> are connected to the control unit <b>13</b>. The interface sensor <b>10</b> may be fastened to the container <b>20</b> by means of a holder <b>14</b> or by another device, for example, a bridge (not shown) arranged above the container <b>20</b>. The interface sensor <b>10</b> is thus fixedly arranged relative to the container floor. However, the interface sensor <b>10</b> can also be arranged to be moveable relative to the container <b>20</b> because the interface sensor <b>10</b> is configured for determining the floor distance BA and the water level distance WA itself.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to a further embodiment (not shown), the interface sensor <b>10</b> can also be arranged to be floating or freely immersed in the measurement medium <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sound emitter <b>11</b> is configured for generating at least one first acoustic signal Si with a first frequency and for generating a second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> with a second frequency different from the first frequency.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sound detector <b>12</b> is configured for detecting at least one first signal response A<b>1</b> which was initiated by the first acoustic signal S <b>1</b>, as well as a second signal response A<b>2</b>, which was initiated by the second acoustic signal S<b>2</b>. Of course, the sound detector <b>12</b> is also suitable for detecting signals with other frequencies. According to at least one embodiment, the sound detector <b>12</b> is structurally identical to the sound emitter <b>11</b>. In such an embodiment, the sound detector <b>12</b> can also be used as a sound emitter <b>11</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). According to such an embodiment, only one sound emitter <b>11</b> or sound detector <b>12</b> is thus necessary.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The control unit <b>13</b> is configured for controlling the sound emitter <b>11</b> such that the first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> and/or the second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> are generated. For example, the acoustic signals S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> are thus controlled by means of the control unit <b>13</b> with respect to their time intervals, with respect to their amplitudes and with respect to their duration.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is a low-frequency acoustic signal. The term &#x201c;low frequency&#x201d; is understood to mean a frequency lower than 300 kHz, for example, between 50 kHz and 200 kHz, particularly for example, between 80 kHz and 110 kHz. The first acoustic signal S<b>1</b>, due to its low frequency, can penetrate viscous fractions of the measurement medium <b>2</b> and/or deposits of the measurement medium <b>2</b>, e.g., flocculations, or deposits of particles on the floor of the container <b>20</b>. The first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is thus mainly reflected at the floor of the container <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> is a high-frequency acoustic signal. The term &#x201c;high frequency&#x201d; is understood to mean a frequency higher than 300 kHz, for example, between 500 kHz and 200 kHz, particularly for example, a frequency of 675 kHz. The second acoustic signal S<b>2</b>, due to its high frequency, is able to be reflected and absorbed at deposits, for example, a sediment layer <b>3</b>. The second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> is thus primarily reflected at the sediment layer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a first signal response A<b>1</b> detected by the sound detector <b>12</b>. The amplitude A can be read off on the abscissa, and the transit time of the signal response A<b>1</b> can be read off on the ordinate T. On the basis of the signal response A<b>1</b>, the control unit <b>13</b> determines the floor distance BA between the interface sensor <b>10</b> and the floor of the container <b>20</b>, as well as the water level distance WA between the interface sensor <b>10</b> and the water level W of the measurement medium <b>2</b>. The first signal response A<b>1</b> has a large amplitude A at the container floor, since the low-frequency first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is poorly absorbed and reflected by the sediment layer <b>3</b> in the measurement medium <b>2</b>. The component of the signal response A<b>1</b> which has the greatest amplitude is thus reflected at the container floor. The distance to the container floor, that is to say the floor distance BA, is thus determined using the transit time up to the greatest amplitude and the speed of sound. The container floor is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> by a horizontal dashed line. The beginning of the sediment layer <b>3</b> is represented by a horizontal dotted line. All signal components of the first signal response A<b>1</b>, which are measured chronologically after the point in time (dashed horizontal line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) which corresponds to the container floor, are further reflection and multiple-reflection signals. A detail of a multiple reflection MR is respectively shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> by a dashed-line frame. A repetition of the portion of the signal response, which represents the sediment layer beginning and the container floor, can be seen here. These further reflection signals occur, for example, at the water surface, at the sediment layer, or at the container floor.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The water level distance WA can be determined using the reflection signals. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a second floor reflection BR is schematically illustrated by the first acoustic signal Si reflected at the surface of the water and finally again at the floor of the container <b>20</b>. The framed detail of the multiple reflection MR unambiguously shows a correlation with the two signal peaks detected earlier in time, which represent the beginning of the sludge view (dotted line) and the floor of the container (dashed line). The offset in the transit time of the two correlated signal sections occurs due to the longer signal path (emitter to floor, floor to water surface, water surface to floor, floor to detector). The height of the water column above the sensor, i.e., the water level distance WA, can thus be determined from the difference in the transit time.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a second signal response A<b>2</b> detected by the sound detector <b>12</b>. The second signal response A<b>2</b> has a greater amplitude as compared to the first signal response A<b>1</b> at the interface between the low-viscosity measurement medium <b>2</b> and the high-viscosity measurement medium <b>2</b>, that is to say the sediment layer <b>3</b>, because the high-frequency second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> is reflected more strongly at the sediment layer <b>3</b> in the measurement medium <b>2</b>, and is absorbed more strongly by this, than the first acoustic signal S<b>1</b>. Here too, a repetition can be seen of the signal components which can be detected chronologically before the point in time which corresponds to the container floor (dashed-line frames with a detail of a multiple reflection MR). This repetition of the signal components of the first signal response A<b>1</b> is based on a reflection of the second acoustic signal at the water surface, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a third signal response A<b>3</b> detected by the sound detector <b>12</b>.

Reference signals, e.g., signal responses that are to be expected, may be stored in the memory <b>15</b>, with which reference signals the detected signal responses can be compared by the control unit <b>13</b>. Sound velocities for different measurement media are also stored in the memory <b>15</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The control unit <b>13</b> can also be equipped with a communication module <b>16</b>, for example, a wireless or wired communication module <b>16</b>, to assume the role of the automatic control unit <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In such embodiment, no automatic control unit <b>25</b> is necessary because the inlet valve <b>22</b>, the drain valve <b>24</b> and, if present, the gas inlet valve <b>27</b> are controlled by the control unit <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The control unit <b>13</b> and the automatic control unit <b>25</b> may be configured to perform certain operations comprising a control structure to provide the functions described herein. In certain embodiments, the control unit <b>13</b> and the automatic control unit <b>25</b> may form at least portions of a processing subsystem that includes one or more computing devices having memory, processing, and/or communication hardware. The control unit <b>13</b> may be a single device or a distributed device, and the functions of the control unit <b>13</b> may be performed by hardware and/or software, as may the automatic control unit <b>25</b>. The control unit <b>13</b> and the automatic control unit <b>25</b> can include one or more arithmetic logic units (ALUs), central processing units (CPUs), memories, limiters, conditioners, filters, format converters, or the like which are not shown to preserve clarity.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In at least one embodiment, the control unit <b>13</b> and the automatic control unit <b>25</b> are programmable to execute algorithms and process data in accordance with operating logic that is defined by programming instructions, such as software or firmware. Alternatively or additionally, operating logic for the control unit <b>13</b> and the automatic control unit <b>25</b> can be at least partially defined by hardwired logic or other hardware, for example, using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) of any suitable type.

In a first step, the interface sensor <b>10</b> is arranged in the container <b>20</b>. The arrangement comprises a fixed or moveable arrangement in the container <b>20</b>, in particular in the measurement medium <b>2</b>. The interface sensor <b>10</b> is, for example, fastened to the container <b>20</b>, in particular by means of the holder <b>14</b>, such that the interface sensor <b>10</b> is in contact with the measurement medium <b>2</b>. The interface sensor <b>10</b> is oriented in the direction of the floor of the container <b>20</b>, e.g., in the direction of a possible sediment layer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The container <b>20</b> is filled with the measurement medium <b>2</b> before, during or after the attachment of the interface sensor <b>10</b> to the container <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is then emitted by the sound emitter <b>11</b> at a first frequency. As stated above, the first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is a low-frequency signal. The first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is thus reflected or absorbed only slightly at the measurement medium <b>2</b> or at a sediment layer <b>3</b>. The first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is therefore primarily reflected at the floor of the container <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first signal response A<b>1</b> of the first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> is then detected by the sound detector <b>12</b>. The control unit <b>13</b> stores the first signal response A<b>1</b>, for example, in the memory <b>15</b>, to later perform an evaluation of the first signal response A<b>1</b>. Of course, the first signal response Al can also be evaluated immediately.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, an emission of the second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> by the sound emitter <b>11</b> occurs at a second frequency different from the first frequency of the first acoustic signal S<b>1</b>. As stated above, the second frequency is a high frequency. The second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> is thus reflected or absorbed at the sediment layer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The detection of the second signal response A<b>2</b> of the second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> by the sound detector <b>12</b> then occurs. The control unit <b>13</b> stores the second signal response A<b>2</b>, for example, in the memory <b>15</b>, to perform an evaluation later. Of course, the second signal response A<b>2</b> can also be evaluated immediately. Of course, the second acoustic signal S<b>2</b> can also be emitted and detected first, and then the first acoustic signal Si can be emitted and detected.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The aforementioned method steps can also occur in a different sequence or simultaneously, insofar as this is technically possible.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a further step, the first signal response A<b>1</b> and the second signal response A<b>2</b> are evaluated by the control unit <b>13</b>. The control unit <b>13</b> hereby performs, for example, a subtraction of the first signal response A<b>1</b> from the second signal response A<b>2</b>. In an alternative embodiment which is compatible with the one previously mentioned, the control unit <b>13</b> implements a frequency filtering, for example, high-pass filtering or low-pass filtering, with addition of the two signal responses. According to an alternative embodiment, the evaluation of the signal responses A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> occurs, for example, by means of a Fourier transform, e.g., by means of fast Fourier transform (FFT). The signal responses A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> are thereby respectively subdivided in the time domain, thus distributed over the tank depth, into numerous small segments which in turn are transformed into the frequency domain by means of FFT. In the frequency domain, the &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; of discrete frequencies is then investigated (e.g., 100 kHz and 675 kHz).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a subsequent step, the control unit <b>13</b> determines a floor distance BA between the interface sensor and the container floor of the container <b>20</b>. During this step or after this step, the control unit determines a sediment distance SA between the interface sensor <b>10</b> and the sediment layer <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The floor distance BA of the interface sensor <b>10</b> is the distance between the sound emitter <b>11</b> or sound detector <b>12</b> and the floor of the container <b>20</b>, e.g., where the sediment layer <b>3</b> deposits. In determining the floor distance BA, the transit time after which the first acoustic signal S<b>1</b> arrived at the container floor is determined. For this purpose, the signal amplitude of the first signal response A<b>1</b>, which thus was generated by the low-frequency first acoustic signal S<b>1</b>, is examined for a maximum. Based on this transit time up to the maximum and the known sound velocity in the measurement medium, the depth of the container floor is determined (represented by a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The sediment distance SA of the interface sensor <b>10</b> is the distance between the sound emitter <b>11</b> or sound detector <b>12</b> and the beginning of the sediment layer <b>3</b> of the measurement medium <b>2</b> (represented by a dotted horizontal line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). The beginning of the sediment layer <b>3</b> is potentially an interface between liquid measurement medium <b>2</b> and solid or viscous measurement medium <b>2</b>. To determine the sediment distance SA, the transit time is determined after which the signal amplitude of the second signal response A<b>2</b>, thus which was generated by the second acoustic signal S<b>2</b>, is greatest. For example, for this purpose a region of the second acoustic signal S<b>2</b>, e.g., the region in which the floor of the container <b>20</b> is located, is masked out.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a next step, the control unit <b>13</b> determines the sediment thickness D exhibited by the sediment layer <b>3</b> of the measurement medium <b>2</b>. For example, for this purpose the sediment distance SA is subtracted from the floor distance BA.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a further step, the sediment thickness D is output by the control unit <b>13</b>. This output can occur, for example, by means of communication of the sediment thickness D to a control center or to a field device. Furthermore, the control unit <b>13</b> is configured for forwarding all received and evaluated information to a control center, or to a field device, or to a mobile control device. All information can of course also be stored in the memory <b>15</b> of the control unit <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a further optional step, a water level distance WA of the interface sensor <b>10</b> is performed by the control unit <b>13</b> on the basis of the step of evaluating the first signal response A<b>1</b> and the second signal response A<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For this purpose, the evaluation range of the signal responses A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> is expanded, and simple reflections as well as multiple reflections between the interfaces are analyzed in terms of their intensity, their temporal sequence and their differences/deviations. Given the first signal response A<b>1</b>, a direct reflection of the previously recorded floor echo at the water surface can thereby be measured. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, this direct reflection, i.e., a second floor reflection of the first acoustic signal S<b>2</b>, is shown by the dashed-line frame (second signal maximum in the framed signal portion). Multiple reflections between the interface to be detected and the water surface can be measured with both the signal response A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. Since the main echo has a first transit time from the sensor to the interface, and the multiple reflection is extended by a second transit time due to the depth of immersion of the interface sensor <b>10</b> in the measurement medium <b>2</b>, the immersion depth can be determined by comparing the first and second transit times.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">This is preferably followed by a step of the determination of a water level W by the control unit <b>13</b> on the basis of the floor distance BA and the water level distance WA. For this purpose, for example, the floor distance BA and the water level distance WA are added. After the determination, the water level W may be output to a field device or other device. The water level W may also be stored in the memory <b>15</b> of the control unit <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">An automatic control method of the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is described below. In a first step, the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is provided. The sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is, for example, part of a sewage treatment plant with a plurality containers or basins that fulfill different functions. In this instance, further basins are arranged, for example, upstream and downstream of the container <b>20</b>, e.g., of the sedimentation plant <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In any event, the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> according to this automatic control method has at least the inlet valve <b>22</b> and drain valve <b>24</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">If the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is, for example, what is known as a &#x201c;sequencing batch reactor,&#x201d; there are generally no containers arranged upstream or downstream.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a further step, the interface sensor <b>10</b> is operated according to one of the embodiments described above, or according to a combination of the described embodiments according to one of the operating methods described above or a combination of the operating methods described above.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, the inlet valve <b>22</b> and the drain valve <b>24</b> are regulated depending on the water level WA and/or floor distance BA or water level W, determined by the interface sensor <b>10</b>. For example, the water level W is hereby determined by the interface sensor <b>10</b> at regular intervals and the drain valve <b>24</b> is opened as soon as the water level W has exceeded an upper limit value, and/or the inlet valve <b>22</b> is opened as soon as the water level W has fallen below a lower limit value. Of course, other types of regulation are also possible.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an optional step that is compatible with the aforementioned, in particular if the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is a &#x201c;sequencing batch reactor,&#x201d; the automatic control method includes a step of treating of the measurement medium with gas <b>2</b> by means of the gas inlet valve <b>27</b>. The gas inlet valve <b>27</b> is hereby opened, for example after a prespecified time period, or the gas inlet valve <b>27</b> is opened upon achieving a prespecified sediment thickness D and/or upon achieving a prespecified water level W. The gas treatment may also occur, for example, after or upon admitting measurement medium <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a further optional step that is compatible with the aforementioned steps, the current operating state of the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> is determined and output by the control unit <b>13</b>. The first signal response A<b>1</b> and/or the second signal response A<b>2</b>, or the third signal response A<b>3</b>, are thereby evaluated. For example, if a noise R is discovered in the signal response, the sedimentation plant <b>1</b> may currently be in a gas treatment phase. Depending on size, the gas bubbles ascending in the container <b>20</b> may exhibit a different, frequency-dependent reflection behavior, which can be recognized via the signal evaluation.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Due to the frequency-dependent reflection and transmission properties, the control unit <b>13</b> of the interface sensor <b>10</b> can recognize the gas bubbles and their size and adapt the frequency of the acoustic signals S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> such that an influencing of the measured values (e.g., interface, container floor, water surface) is prevented. If the gas quantity is so low or the gas bubbles are very small, such that acoustic signals in the measurement medium <b>2</b> still reach the floor of the container <b>20</b>, &#x201c;jumping&#x201d; interface measurement values may be measured (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) because the gas bubbles reflect the acoustic signal very strongly. Given a large amount of gas, or large gas bubbles, such that acoustic signals no longer reach the floor of the container <b>20</b> or deep regions of the container <b>20</b>, a sound echo may no longer be received by the sound detector <b>12</b>. This operating state evaluation thus contributes to a more robust measurement. The operating state in the container can be detected by the presence and characteristic of the air bubbles (e.g., aeration in the sequencing batch reactor). The automatic control method can react to these operating states.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>We claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
