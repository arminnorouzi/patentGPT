Therefore, many drug therapies may be altered by understanding the times of the day the drugs are most effective, an approach called chronotherapy. In chronotherapy, taking medications at a specific time of day may make the therapy more effective or reduces toxic side effects depending on the circadian clock, which drives a biological rhythm of behavior and physiology with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours. However, only about 50% of individuals with chronic diseases follow their treatment regimen, making efficacy of additional timing instructions dubious. In addition, conventional controlled-release delivery systems, such as nano-particles, micro-particles, hydrogels, and microneedle patch systems, cannot deliver drugs only at the desired time over a long period. Rather, such conventional systems employ diffusion-based continuous drug release that is inappropriate in chronotherapy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, an implantable pump of a therapeutic compound delivery system includes a housing, a reservoir, an actuatable portion of the implantable pump, and an actuating piston coupled to the actuatable portion of the implantable pump.

However, conventional devices are currently unable to reliably and consistently deliver a dose of a therapeutic drug at a predetermined time. Most conventional systems employ controlled-release, in which an entire dose of a drug is released over time continuously. Such conventional systems may be ineffective for providing chronotherapy for certain medical conditions, such as diabetes. Additionally, some conventional system for chronotherapy employ implanted batteries or controllers which may require frequent replacement and make the implantable device bulky and uncomfortable for a user. Some conventional systems are also not refillable, meaning that consistent delivery of the drug over long time periods is difficult and may require replacement of the delivery device. Finally, some conventional systems are magnetically or light activated, which may not be easily operable in all environmental conditions and may be interfered with by other medical equipment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In view of the above, the inventors have recognized the benefits of a therapeutic compound delivery system that is effective for chronotherapy and is user-friendly. In particular, the inventors have recognized the benefits associated with an implantable pump that does not include an internal energy source, and an external actuator configured to operate the implantable pump. The external actuator is configured to apply physical force through the intact skin of a user to apply an actuation force to a corresponding portion of the implanted pump to actuate the implantable pump and dispense a volume of fluid. In some embodiments, the portion of the implantable pump to which the actuation force is applied may be configured in a variety of ways to avoid inadvertent physical actuation of the system as detailed further below. Such a physical actuation mechanism may be well suited to a number of different environmental conditions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition to the physical actuation of an implanted pump, the inventors have also recognized the benefits associated with using magnetic materials associated with an implanted pump and associated external actuator for positioning the devices relative to one another for actuation. For example, in one embodiment, a first magnetic material such as a positioning magnet may be included in the external actuator. This first magnetic material may be magnetically attracted to a corresponding second magnetic material included in a portion of the implanted pump so that the external actuator may be aligned with an actuatable portion of the implanted pump when the first and second magnetic materials are located proximate to one another through an intervening layer of intact skin of the user. Such a therapeutic compound delivery system may be used to effectuate chronotherapy by delivering timed dosages of a drug while reducing the implanted size of the pump relative to conventional systems, though embodiments in which the disclosed systems and methods are not used for chronotherapy applications are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, an implantable pump of a therapeutic compound delivery system includes a housing, a reservoir, an actuatable portion, and an actuating piston. The housing may at least partially surround the reservoir, actuatable portion of the pump, and the actuating piston. The actuatable portion of the pump is fluidly connected to the reservoir, and is configured to dispense a predetermined volume of fluid when the actuatable portion of the pump is actuated. The actuating piston may be slidably disposed in the housing, and may be movable between a first unactuated position and a second actuated position. As the actuating piston moves from the first unactuated position to the second actuated position, the actuating piston actuates the actuatable portion of the pump to dispense the predetermined volume of fluid from the pump. The actuating piston may be physically accessible through a hole formed in the housing of the implantable pump. The pump may be implantable near the skin surface of a user, such that skin and any other intervening tissue may be deformed through the hole formed in the housing of the pump. Accordingly, the actuating piston may be movable in response to physical force applied to the skin, where the skin layer transmits the physical force to the actuating piston. As force is applied to the skin, the actuating piston may be moved linearly toward the actuatable portion of the pump and apply the physical force to the actuatable portion of the pump to dispense the predetermined volume of fluid.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to exemplary embodiments described herein, a housing of an implantable pump includes a hole through which skin and other intervening tissue may be deformed. This physical force and deformation applied to the skin may be transferred to an actuating piston, or other actuation mechanism, disposed in the housing of the implantable pump through the hole. In some embodiments, the hole may be sized and shaped such that skin and other intervening tissue may be deformed through the hole without accidental presses, normal human contact, or other incidental forces applied to the user's body actuating the implantable pump. Accordingly, in some embodiments the hole may have a diameter or other maximum transverse dimension that is greater than or equal to 0.1 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, 1 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm and/or any other appropriate diameter. Correspondingly, the hole may have a diameter or other maximum transverse dimension that is less than or equal to 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1.5 mm, 1 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.5 mm, and/or any other appropriate diameter. Combinations of the above ranges are contemplated, including, but not limited to, diameters or another maximum transverse dimension that is between or equal to 0.1 mm and 5 mm, 0.3 mm and 3 mm, 0.3 mm and 1.5 mm, 0.5 mm and 5 mm, 1 mm and 4 mm, and/or any other appropriate combination. Of course, a hole through which skin may be deformed may have any suitable maximum transverse dimension both greater and less than the ranges noted above and/or may have a non-circular shape, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, an actuatable portion of an implantable pump may include a flexible tube. The flexible tube may be fluidly connected to a reservoir by a first check valve (e.g., one way valve) configured to allow fluid to flow from the reservoir to the flexible tube, but not vice versa. The flexible tube may be coupled to a fluid outlet with a second check valve configured to allow fluid to flow from the flexible tube to the fluid outlet. The flexible tube may be configured to contain a predetermined volume of fluid to be dispensed into the body when the actuatable portion of the pump is actuated. An actuating piston disposed adjacent the flexible tube may move between a first unactuated position and a second actuated position. In the first unactuated position, the flexible tube may be in a resting position, where the flexible tube contains the predetermined volume of fluid to be dispensed. When the actuating piston is moved to the second actuated position (e.g., under application of physical force applied to skin to deform skin through a hole of an implantable pump housing) the actuating piston may apply force to deform and compress the flexible tube. As the flexible tube is compressed, the fluid may be forced out of the fluid outlet via the second check valve, as the fluid is unable to flow back into the reservoir. Accordingly, this actuation may dispense a predetermined volume of fluid into the body of a user. When the force is removed from the skin of a user and the actuating piston is free to return to the first unactuated position, the flexible tube may elastically return to the resting position where it may an initial unactuated configuration. The return of the flexible tube to the resting position draws in a second predetermined volume of fluid into the flexible tube from the reservoir. Additionally, the elasticity of the flexible tube may bias the actuating piston toward the first unactuated position. Of course, the actuating piston may be biased to the young actuated position using any appropriate method including, but not limited to, one or more separate springs, the noted elasticity of the flexible tube, and/or any other appropriate construction as the present disclosure is not limited in this regard.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to exemplary embodiments described herein, an actuating piston of an implantable pump may move between a first unactuated position and a second actuated position to operate an actuatable portion of a pump. For example, as discussed previously, the actuating piston may move linearly to apply force to a compressible, flexible tube to dispense a predetermined volume of fluid. The amount of movement of the piston may at least partially determine the amount of fluid dispensed from the actuatable portion of the pump, and may also help to avoid inadvertent actuation of the pump . In some embodiments, a linear distance between the first unactuated position and the second actuated position of the actuating piston may be greater than or equal to 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.8 mm, 1 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm, and/or any other suitable distance.

Accordingly, the actuating piston may be attracted to an appropriate corresponding magnetic materials. As will be discussed further below, the actuating piston may be used to align an external actuator with the implantable pump. For example, a magnet disposed in the external actuator may be attracted to the actuating piston. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the actuating piston may be a magnet. Accordingly, the actuating piston may be magnetically attracted to a corresponding magnet or magnetic material in the external actuator. In either case, a user may reliably align the external actuator with a corresponding portion of the implanted pump through the skin based on the magnetic attraction of the external actuator toward the actuating piston or other portion of the implanted pump arranged to appropriately position the external actuator with the implanted pump.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, an implantable pump includes a port configured to allow a reservoir of the pump to be refilled. The port may be formed as a septum configured to be positioned adjacent a user's skin. The septum may allow a syringe to fluidly couple to the reservoir through the skin such that a therapeutic compound may be injected into the reservoir through the skin to replenish a supply of the therapeutic compound in the reservoir. Of course, any suitable port for allowing an external volume of fluid to be inserted into a reservoir of the implantable pump may be employed, as the present disclosure is not so limited.

In part, the small size of the implantable portion of the therapeutic compound delivery system may be attributed in part to the lack of an integrated energy source in the implantable portion. That is, the implantable portion of the therapeutic compound delivery system may be unpowered and lack a battery, though embodiments in which the various implantable systems described herein include a power source are also contemplated. In some embodiments, an implantable portion of a therapeutic compound delivery system (e.g., an implantable pump) is formed as a cylinder having an outer diameter or other maximum transverse dimension perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the implanted device that is greater than or equal to 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, and/or any other appropriate diameter. Correspondingly, the implantable portion may have an outer diameter or other maximum transverse dimension that is less than or equal to 8 mm, 6 mm, 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, and/or any other appropriate diameter. Combinations of the above-noted ranges are contemplated, including an outer diameter or other maximum transverse dimension that is between or equal to 1 mm and 8 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm, 4 mm and 6 mm, as well as 1 mm and 5 mm. In some embodiments, the implantable portion has an overall length in a direction parallel to a longitudinal axis of the device that is greater than or equal to 25 mm, 30 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, and/or any other appropriate length.

The external actuator may be manually held on a skin surface, may be worn by a user, or may otherwise be positioned proximate to a desired portion of the user's skin such that the external actuator may apply physical force to the user's skin to operate an actuatable portion of the implantable pump of the therapeutic compound delivery system. The external actuator may include a driveshaft, a pusher, and a positioning magnet. The driveshaft and pusher may be configured to apply force to the skin of a user, with the driveshaft movable between a first unactuated position and a second actuated position. The pusher may be disposed on a distal end of the driveshaft, and the first unactuated position may be a proximal position while the second actuated position is a distal position. Accordingly, when the driveshaft is moved to the second actuated position, the pusher may apply a physical force to a user's skin when the external actuator is positioned adjacent the skin. Again, in some embodiments, a positioning magnetic material may be configured to magnetically attract the external actuator toward a portion of the implanted pump so that the external actuator is aligned with an actuatable portion of the implanted pump. In some embodiments, the positioning magnetic material may be coaxial with the driveshaft, and may be configured to magnetically attract the driveshaft toward axial alignment with an actuating piston associated with the implanted pump.

The processor may be electrically connected to the electromechanical actuator, so that the processor may control the operation of the actuator. The energy source may be a battery or another suitable electrical energy source. In some embodiments, the external actuator may be worn by a user. According to this embodiment, the processor may be configured to operate the electromechanical actuator at predetermined intervals. Accordingly, the external actuator may be employed to deliver a predetermined volume of medicinal fluid from an implanted pump at one or more predetermined intervals. In some embodiments, the timing and other characteristics (e.g., volume, flow rate, etc.) of the dispensing of the fluid may be altered. Accordingly, the external actuator may effectuate chronotherapy for a variety of therapeutic compounds.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">While an embodiment in which a delivery system is used for delivering a therapeutic compounds for use in chronotherapy as described above and in relation to other embodiments herein, the current disclosure is not limited in this fashion.

The Hall Effect sensor may be configured to detect and/or measure a combined magnetic field near the external actuator. As noted previously, the external actuator may include a positioning magnetic material configured to attract the external actuator toward alignment with an actuatable portion of an implantable pump. The Hall Effect sensor may determine when the external actuator is aligned with the actuatable portion of the implantable pump based on a change in the magnetic field.

In such an embodiment, an external actuator may include a force sensor configured to sense the force applied by a pusher of the external actuator to the skin of the user underlying the pusher. For example, a force sensor may be positioned between a pusher and a driveshaft electrically connected to a processor though other force sensing arrangements may also be used. The force sensor may be configured to measure a force applied by the driveshaft to an adjacent surface (e.g., skin). Accordingly, the force sensor may be employed to determine if a threshold force has been applied by the external actuator to the adjacent surface. In some cases, the threshold force may correspond to a volume of fluid dispensed from an implanted pump, a pusher not being aligned with an actuatable portion of an associated implanted pump, or other appropriate operating status. Accordingly, if the threshold force is not reached, the external actuator may be operated again to try and actuate the system with a force greater than or equal to the threshold force.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, an external actuator may include an accelerometer configured to measure acceleration of the external actuator, and the accelerometer may be electrically connected to a processor.

Of course, in other embodiments an external actuator may not be manually operable, as the present disclosure is not limited in this regard.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a therapeutic compound delivery system may include both an implantable pump having an actuatable portion, as well as an external actuator. The implantable pump may be implantable beneath a skin layer of a user, while the external actuator is placed against the outside of the skin.

Accordingly, the external actuator may include an elastic strap, hook and loop fastener strap, cinch strap, adhesive, be incorporated into a garment worn by the user, and/or may incorporate any other suitable arrangement for securing the external actuator to the body of a user.

Accordingly, the Hall Effect sensor information may be used to indicate to a user that the external actuator is appropriately aligned with an implantable pump, and/or may be employed to inhibit operation of the external actuator until the external actuator is appropriately aligned with an implantable pump. The force sensitive resistor <b>214</b> is configured to measure the force applied through the driveshaft to a skin surface, and correspondingly, to an actuatable portion of an implanted pump.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> by the dashed line, the pusher <b>230</b> and positioning magnet <b>228</b> may be axially aligned with the actuating piston <b>114</b> during actuation of the implanted pump. The actuating piston <b>114</b> may be formed at least partially from a magnetic material such that the positioning magnet, or other magnetic material of the external actuator, maybe attracted toward the actuating piston. That is, when the positioning magnet and actuating piston are not coaxially aligned, magnetic attraction between the actuating piston and positioning magnet draws the positioning magnet into axial alignment with the actuating piston. As the positioning magnet and pusher <b>230</b> are coaxial, the alignment of the positioning magnet <b>228</b> relative to the actuating piston also aligns the pusher <b>230</b> with the actuating piston. Of course, other embodiments in which the positioning magnet may not be coaxial with the pusher and may instead be attracted to another magnetic portion of the implantable pump with appropriate offsets so that the pusher <b>230</b> may still be aligned with the actuating piston <b>114</b> as a result of magnetic attraction are also contemplated.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the actuating piston <b>114</b> is in a second actuated position. The flexible tube <b>108</b> is correspondingly in a deformed position. That is, the actuating piston <b>114</b> has pressed against the flexible tube. As the flexible tube is depressed, a predetermined volume of fluid inside of the flexible tube is pressurized. As the first check valve <b>106</b> prevents flow in a direction of the reservoir, the predetermined volume of fluid is forced out of the fluid outlet <b>112</b> through the second check valve <b>110</b>, as shown by the arrow. To move the actuating piston to the second actuated position, the pusher <b>230</b> has been moved to a second actuated position. In the simplified schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>, skin is not shown between the external actuator and the implantable pump. Accordingly, the pusher abuts the actuating piston to apply physical force to the actuating piston <b>114</b> toward the flexible tube. However, when the implantable pump is implanted, a skin layer would be positioned between the pusher <b>230</b> and the actuating piston <b>114</b>, with the skin deformed through the hole <b>116</b>. Regardless, direct or indirect physical force transmission between the pusher <b>230</b> and actuating piston <b>114</b> moves the actuating piston to the second actuated position. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>, the elasticity of the flexible tube <b>108</b> may bias the actuating piston <b>114</b> toward the first unactuated position. In particular, the resiliency of the flexible tube may resist the movement of the actuating piston from the first unactuated position to the second actuated position. Of course, in other embodiments any suitable method for biasing the piston or other portion of an implantable pump to (e.g., a spring) toward the first unactuated position may be used as the present disclosure is not so limited. When the actuating piston is allowed to move back to the first unactuated position, the flexible tube may return to the undeformed and/or initial configuration. As the flexible tube returns to the initial configuration, a second predetermined volume of fluid may be drawn from the reservoir through the first check valve <b>106</b> into the flexible tube.

The processor <b>208</b> may wait to operate the solenoid <b>216</b> until the Hall Effect sensor detects that the positioning magnet <b>228</b> and the actuating piston <b>114</b> are aligned. Alternatively, rather than using the solenoid, a user may manually depress the handle <b>220</b> against the biasing force of the biasing spring <b>222</b> to move the driveshaft to the second actuated position. When the driveshaft is in the second actuated position, the pusher <b>230</b> projects out of the housing <b>202</b> and applies physical force to the skin layer <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the portion of the skin layer <b>300</b> disposed between the pusher and the hole <b>116</b> may be deformed such that a portion of the skin layer, and any other intervening tissue, extends into the hole <b>116</b> formed in the implantable pump housing <b>101</b>. Thus, force from the pusher <b>230</b> is transferred to the actuating piston <b>114</b> through the skin <b>300</b>.

The actuation process may be repeated as necessary to dispense a given volume of fluid over a desired time period. In some embodiments, the reservoir <b>104</b> may be refilled so that the therapeutic compound delivery system including the external actuator and the implantable pump may be used to deliver multiple doses of a therapeutic fluid over a long period of time on the order of weeks or months.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic of the external actuator <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in use with the implantable pump <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a human subject.

At step <b>400</b>, an external actuator is positioned over a portion of a user's skin under which a manually actuatable pump is disposed. At step <b>402</b>, an actuating piston disposed in the pump is axially aligned with a positioning magnet disposed in the actuator. At optional step <b>404</b>, the method includes indicating that the actuating piston and the positioning magnet are axially aligned. This indication may be tactile, as a user may feel when the positioning magnet is aligned based on changes in the magnetic field between the actuating piston and positioning magnet. In some embodiments, the external actuator may include a light or speaker to provide a visual or auditory indication as to the alignment state of the external actuator. In some embodiments, the indication may be relayed via a remote device (e.g., a mobile device) that communicates with the external actuator. At step <b>406</b>, the actuator is actuated to depress the skin surface and operate the manually actuated pump. As discussed previously, this actuation may include operation of an electromechanical actuator (e.g., solenoid), or the actuation may be manual. Operating the manually actuated pump may include moving the actuating piston from a first unactuated position to a second actuated position. At optional step <b>408</b>, a processor may receive one or more signals related to a force applied by a driveshaft of the external actuator to the underlying skin. The processor may compare the measured force to a predetermined threshold force to determine if the therapeutic compound delivery system was appropriately actuated. Based on this determination, an appropriate indication of the forced sense relative to the threshold may be output to a user using lights, sound, text, graphics, and/or any other appropriate indication. For example, if a sensed force is less than the predetermined force threshold, an indication of the sensed state may be output. This determination may inform a user whether a predetermined volume of fluid has been successfully dispensed from the implanted pump when the external actuator and implanted pump are appropriately aligned.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of another embodiment of an external actuator <b>200</b>, showing one embodiment of an electrical arrangement for an external actuator. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the external actuator includes an energy source <b>204</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the energy source includes a battery <b>250</b>, micro USB port <b>252</b>, and voltage regulator <b>254</b>. The battery may provide a portable source of power, and the micro USB port may allow the battery to be recharged, or alternatively provide a wired source of power to the external actuator. The voltage regulator may step down or step up the voltage from the battery and micro USB to a consistent voltage used for the rest of the components. For example, the voltage regulator may regulate the voltage to 12V, 5V, or another appropriate voltage. The energy source <b>204</b> is connected to a transistor <b>256</b> and a microcontroller unit <b>208</b> (e.g., a processor). The microcontroller unit (MCU) <b>208</b> controls the transistor and selectively allows power to flow to a solenoid <b>216</b>, such that the solenoid is selectively electrically connected to the energy source <b>204</b>. The MCU is also electrically connected to a magnetometer <b>212</b> (e.g., Hall Effect sensor), a force sensitive resistor <b>214</b>, and an accelerometer <b>210</b>, which each supply the above described sensed information to the MCU.

The BLE transceiver is configured to allow wireless communication with one or more remote devices, such as a mobile device <b>500</b>. The mobile device may include a graphical user interface which allows a user to control certain parameters or otherwise retrieve information about the external actuator.

At step <b>600</b>, a mobile device is wirelessly connected to an external actuator. At step <b>602</b>, user configuration input is received. The user configuration input may be input by a user on a graphical user interface on the mobile device, or may be transmitted from a remote server and controlled by a medical professional. The configuration input may include, but is not limited to, daily maximal dosage, delivery interval, single dosage mode, start time, combinations of the foregoing, and/or any other appropriate operating parameter. At step <b>604</b>, the configuration may be verified to make sure the input operating parameters meet one or more safety requirements including for example toxicity limits, maximum permissible dosages, maximum doses for a given time period, and/or other appropriate parameters. If the safety requirement is not met, a new configuration input may be required at step <b>602</b>. At step <b>606</b>, a configuration is adopted when the safety requirement is met and the configuration may be stored in memory for execution by the system processor.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in some embodiments, at step <b>608</b> a system may determine if it is a suitable time for delivery of a therapeutic compound. The external actuator may perform this determination based on information from clock, accelerometer, and/or any other appropriate information source. In some embodiments, a mobile device may perform step <b>608</b>. At step <b>610</b>, it is determined if a stop button is pressed. In some embodiments, the stop button may be disposed on the external actuator, and may prevent actuation of the external actuator. If the stop button is pressed, the method may immediately terminate at step <b>620</b>. If the stop button is not pressed, the method may proceed to step <b>612</b>, where an actuation command is sent to the external actuator. At step <b>614</b>, it is determined if the external actuator is aligned with an implanted pump. This determination may be based at least in part on information from a Hall Effect sensor which detected a combined magnetic field formed by the external actuator and the implanted pump. This determination may be done by comparing a sensed magnetic signal and a predetermined magnetic signal when the corresponding portions of the external actuator and implanted pump are aligned. If the external actuator is not aligned, the method may terminate at step <b>620</b>. However, if the external actuator is aligned, the method may proceed to step <b>616</b>, in which the external actuator is actuated. This actuation may operate the implanted pump to dispense a predetermined volume of fluid. At step <b>618</b>, it may be determined if a threshold force is reached by the external actuator, which may be indicative of a successfully dispensing of the predetermined volume of fluid. If a threshold force was not reached by the external actuator, in some embodiments, the processor of the external actuator may perform another actuation cycle either until a predetermined number of actuation cycles have been reached after which an error state may be output to the operator and/or until a successful actuation has been indicated by a force greater than the predetermined threshold force has been sensed. Once a sensed force greater than the predetermined threshold force has been sensed, the actuation cycle may end.

The compounds may be in liquid form, or may be otherwise suspended in a liquid solution. Examples of drug formulations that may be employed with delivery systems of exemplary embodiments described herein include bromocriptine, lisinopril, cortisol, cortisol derivatives, mineralocorticoids, growth hormone, and statin.

Firstly, the accuracy of the Hall Effect sensor was employed to determine whether the alignment may be accurately measured. In the test, the alignment was tested with a positioning magnet and an actuating piston having opposite magnetic polarities. The results of the test are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, which shows the Hall Effect sensor reliably reporting alignment with a change in sensed voltage corresponding to a predetermined voltage change and/or absolute voltage associated with the aligned position. Next, a force sensitive resistor was tested to determine whether a threshold force for dispensing a predetermined volume of fluid could be determined. The results of the tests are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, where the force applied to dispense a predetermined volume was reliably repeatable indicating a threshold value for determining appropriate actuation may be used.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Additional experiments were determined to test the repeatability of dispensing a predetermined volume of fluid. During these experiments, an implantable pump like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> was employed. The pumps filled with a bromocriptine solution (20 mg ml&#x2212;1) were fully immersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at 37&#xb0; C. and were actuated with the external actuator for ten consecutive times. That is, 20 mg of bromocriptine powder was dissolved in 0.5 ml EtOH (ethanol) and 0.5 ml Tween80. Of course, other formulations are contemplated and the amount of various drug components may be varied. In some embodiments, a ratio of the EtOH and the Tween80 need not be in a 1:1 ratio. For example, bromocriptine may be dissolved in solely EtOH up to approximately 7 mg/ml and solely Tween 80 up to approximately 5 mg/ml. In cases where EtOH and Tween 80 are used in combination, bromocriptine may be dissolved at concentrations between 0 and 23 mg/ml. The drug in the reservoir was infused like a water-jet and the infused fluid volume per actuation was 2.0&#xb1;0.12 &#x3bc;l, indicating high reproducibility even with ten consecutive actuations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Accordingly, therapeutic drug delivery systems according to exemplary embodiments described herein may generate a range of sequential doses that are within 10% of a target dosage. To evaluate long-term feasibility and to assess any possible leakage from the pump, the pump was immersed in PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline) for 28 days. The average infused fluid volume per actuation during immersion was 1.96&#xb1;0.14 &#x3bc;l, similar to that described above, again showing high reproducibility, and no drug was detected during non-actuation periods. Due to the flexible drug reservoir, the pump showed a reproducible infusion volume per actuation of 1.93&#xb1;0.12 &#x3bc;l with up to 60 consecutive actuations until approximately 89.1% of the total volume of the solution in the drug reservoir was consumed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The effect of refilling the reservoir was also tested, with the infusion profile per actuation not being affected by the refilling procedure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. During these experiments, it was also shown bromocriptine and lisinopril formulation in the pump were stable without apparent denaturation when stored in the pump at 37&#xb0; C. for 4 weeks.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">To demonstrate the effect of chronotherapy, the therapeutic compound delivery system was experimentally employed in two different applications; one was a type 2 diabetes application using a bromocriptine that is a sympatholytic dopamine D2 receptor agonist and exerts inhibitory effects on serotonin turnover in the central nervous system. The other application was a hypertension application using a lisinopril that is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">First, the in vivo pharmacodynamics of bromocriptine using Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats was investigated, as a model of type 2 diabetes. For five different animal groups, the same volume of bromocriptine or bromocriptine free solution was administered daily for 4 weeks. For the parameters of pharmacodynamics, the profiles of body weight and food intake were first measured. The body weight gain and the total food intakes in all bromocriptine groups were significantly lower than those of both control groups. More importantly, both Inj-Br-E and Pump-Br-E exhibited a significantly lower body weight gain and total food intake than those treated with Inj-Br-M (P&#x3c;0.05). During the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) performed after 4 weeks of treatment, all bromocriptine groups in pharmacodynamic parameters related to postprandial glucose metabolism showed better results than control groups. Significantly, the blood glucose levels after a glucose load and the area under the plasma glucose concentration-time curve (AUCglucose) of both Inj-Br-E and Pump-Br-E were lower than those of the Inj-Br-M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>). The plasma insulin levels during the IPGTT and AUCinsulin in both evening bromocriptine groups were comparably lower than those with the morning bromocriptine group. In addition, there was no significant difference in the above-mentioned pharmacodynamic parameters between the Inj-Br-E and Pump-Br-E groups, suggesting that the efficacy of the bromocriptine delivered with the pump was nearly identical to that administered via subcutaneous injections. The results were consistent with data obtained in many vertebrate species, including humans, which have shown that bromocriptine administration improves glucose tolerance.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">To demonstrate the feasibility of high blood pressure treatments, the in vivo pharmacokinetics profiles of lisinopril with the pump and subcutaneous injection groups was evaluated. The pharmacokinetic profiles from the Pump-lisinopril and Inj-lisinopril groups were superimposable with a similar maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 394.2&#xb1;83.2 ng ml&#x2212;1 and 322.7&#xb1;64.7 ng ml&#x2212;1, respectively. The time taken to reach the Cmax (Tmax) was 30 min in both groups. The areas under the curve of plasma lisinopril concentration versus time (AUC) in the pump and subcutaneous injection group were 25335.5&#xb1;7640.9 and 24484.5&#xb1;5643.8 ng ml&#x2212;1 min, respectively, which were not significantly different (p&#x3e;0.05). Drug leakage in the implanted pump was not detected during the non-actuation periods over a 28-day period. The maximum plasma concentration of drug did not vary significantly, showing that the refilling procedure still did not affect the in vivo performance of the pump .</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">To evaluate in vivo biocompatibility of the pump, biopsied tissues samples from three different locations around the pump were examined by both H&#x26;E and Masson's trichrome (MT) staining; 1) the outlet, 2) the area for actuation (i.e., the actuation), and 3) the wall. The overall inflammatory response was observed to be minor, irrespective of tissue location. Importantly, the tissue over the actuation area did not exhibit any adverse sign after repetitive actuations. The MT-stained tissues showed the formation of a fibrous capsule around the implanted pump, where the capsule thickness was measured as 140.7&#xb1;30.01 &#x3bc;m (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>). The outlet was not blocked when observed at the end point of the experiments (i.e., 30 days after implantation).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">While the present teachings have been described in conjunction with various embodiments and examples, it is not intended that the present teachings be limited to such embodiments or examples.
