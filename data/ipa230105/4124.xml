Watch faces capable of being displayed on smartwatches are known. Distributed ledgers are known techniques to produce a secure record or registry of ownership of assets, transactions, and other information. For example, a distributed blockchain is a distributed ledger. Different types of distributed ledgers are known.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One aspect of the present disclosure relates to a system configured to create a customized watch face that is capable of being displayed on a watch screen (e.g., of a smart watch). The user may select watch face features with varying styles, formats, colors, and/or other aspects through a selection interface. For example, the user may select a particular style of hour makers, hour hands, minute hands, and/or other features to be included in the customized watch face. The values of watch face features selected by the user may define a watch face design that is later used to generate the watch face. The user may purchase the customized watch face design by submitting a mint request and transferring the appropriate amount of consideration from a user wallet to an administrative wallet. The transfer of consideration from the user wallet to an administrative wallet may include the transfer of value from an address associated with the user wallet to an address associated with the administrative wallet on a decentralized ledger. Once consideration is received by the administrative wallet, the watch face capable of being displayed may be minted and the watch face may contain the values of watch face features defined by the watch face design purchased by the user. A watch face record may be generated for the minted watch face and a non-fungible token may be transferred to the address on the decentralized ledger that corresponds to the user wallet. The watch face record may include information pertaining to the watch face features and may include a watch face identifier that is unique to the watch face. The non-fungible token may indicate the watch face identifier, such that holding the non-fungible token indicates ownership of the watch face associated to the watch face identifier.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The system is further configured to retrieve the watch face to be displayed on a watch screen. The system may receive a display request from a user. The display request may indicate the watch face being requested (e.g., using the watch face identifier), the user associated with the watch screen, and/or other information. Responsive to receiving the display request, the system may determine whether the user wallet associated with the user holds a non-fungible token associated with the watch face being requested. Holding the non-fungible token may indicate the non-fungible token is recorded on the decentralized ledger at the address associated with the user wallet. Responsive to determining the user wallet holding the non-fungible token, the system may facilitate transmission of information to the watch screen that causes the watch screen to display the watch face. Responsive to determining the user wallet does not hold the non-fungible token, the system may take no further action to transmit information to the watch screen.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The system configured to create a watch face and retrieve the watch face to be displayed may include one or more of servers, decentralized ledger servers, client computing platforms, external resources, networks, users, user interfaces, and or other components. The one or more servers and/or decentralized ledger servers may include electronic storage, one or more hardware processors, one or more blockchains, and/or other components. The electronic storage may be configured to store information. The one or more hardware processors may be configured to execute one or more computer processing components.

In some implementations, decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> may be maintained by distributed computing platforms (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some implementations, a distributed computing platform may be implemented by a set of client computing platforms and/or servers (including, for example, one or more decentralized ledger server(s) <b>111</b>). The distributed computing platform may support a virtual machine (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The distributed computing platform and/or the virtual machine may form a runtime environment for smart contracts and/or other executable code. A distributed computing platform may include electronic storage configured to store part or all of decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b>. The smart contracts may be stored on decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> and/or another decentralized ledger. In some implementations, the distributed computing platform may be the EOSIO platform.

The private permissioned blockchain may be configured to record information. The recorded information may pertain to one or more watch faces recorded on decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b>. The recorded information may include ownership of the watch faces. User actions may effectuate modifications to the recorded information pertaining to the watch faces. For example, ownership rights and/or other rights may be modified. In some implementations, a watch face may be removed from one decentralized ledger and added or recorded on another decentralized ledger. In some implementations, at least one of the decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> implemented by decentralized ledger server(s) <b>111</b> is a public decentralized ledger. The public decentralized ledger may be configured to be part of either EOSIO mainnet, Ethereum mainnet, Ethereum 1.5, Ethereum 2.0, a derivative of Ethereum 2.0 that is configured to perform transactions of Ether (ETH) between accounts, or a derivative of EOSIO that is configured to perform transactions of EOS between different accounts.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Elements of decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> ledger may be grouped together in units that are referred to as blocks and/or nodes. For example, an individual block may include one or more assets (e.g., watch faces) and/or one or more transactions. For example, an individual block may be linked to one or more other individual blocks. Individual blocks may be linked or chained together to form a structure of blocks and/or a hierarchy of blocks, such as, e.g., a chain of blocks. An individual block may include one or more assets (e.g., watch faces), one or more transactions, and/or other information. As used herein, &#x201c;an individual block including a watch face&#x201d; may refer to the individual block including a watch face record and/or a watch face identifier associated with the watch face.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, decentralized ledger server(s) <b>111</b> may include one or more of electronic storage <b>128</b><i>b</i>, processor(s) <b>130</b><i>b</i>, machine-readable instructions <b>106</b><i>b</i>, (node of) decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b>, and/or other components.

In some implementations, an individual decentralized ledger server(s) <b>111</b> may be dedicated to a particular node of a decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b>. Typically, different nodes are included in (or implemented by, or hosted by) different servers or different computer systems to increase the safety and security of transactions on a decentralized ledger and/or blockchain. The consensus protocol used for a particular blockchain will be harder to falsify or circumvent when the different nodes are in different geographical locations, on different types of computing platforms, and/or otherwise distributed and diverse.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some implementations, one or more decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> implemented by decentralized ledger server(s) <b>111</b> may be publicly accessible.

In some implementations, one or more decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> implemented by decentralized ledger server(s) <b>111</b> may be append-only. In some implementations, existing blocks and/or nodes of one or more decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> implemented by decentralized ledger server(s) <b>111</b> can substantially not be altered or deleted, unless multiple copies are altered. This is unlikely to happen provided that the multiple copies stored on different computing platforms, e.g., in different geographical locations, in accordance with the relevant consensus protocol(s). Decentralized ledger(s) <b>117</b> may be replicated on multiple computing platforms, preferably in multiple different geographical locations. Additionally, individual blocks and/or nodes may be linked together in a manner that prevents tampering, such as, e.g., using a hash chain and/or digital signatures. In particular, hash values may be generated using fixed-output-length one-way hashing functions that take variable-length input, and may be effectively impossible (or, at least, computationally infeasible) to reverse. As such, a hashing function may provide one-way encryption. By way of non-limiting example, the hashing function may be SHA-256, BLAKE2, SHAKE256, and/or another hashing function. Contents of individual blocks, individual nodes, transactions, and/or assets may be digitally signed in a manner that proves integrity and/or prevents tampering, e.g., by providing authentication, as well as repudiation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Server(s) <b>102</b> may be configured to communicate with one or more client computing platforms <b>104</b> according to a client/server architecture and/or other architectures.
