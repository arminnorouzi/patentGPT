Those lithium batteries used in electric tools and electric vehicles are generally called power batteries. The top cover terminal structure has been widely used in the power batteries. Usually, the top cover plate is designed with a first terminal through hole and a second terminal through hole for the installation of terminals. The terminals and a sealing sleeve are fastened on the top cover plate with an injection molded part to realize electrical connection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, the above design generally struggles with complicated assembly operation, and secondary crystallization and stress will be generated, which result in deformation of the injection molded part, and cause the leakage, weakening the safety of the battery core and even causing the complete failure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the deficiencies in the prior art, this application provides a battery top cover structure, in which the injection molded part is absent, such that the material deformation is relieved, the sealing performance between the top cover and electrodes is enhanced, and the safety performance of the battery core is improved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Technical solutions of this application are described as follows.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect, this application provides a battery top cover structure, including:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a top cover sheet; and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a first electrode arranged on the top cover sheet;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein a sealing sleeve is sleevedly arranged between the first electrode and the top cover sheet; the first electrode includes a conductive part and a welding part; a top of the welding part passes through the top cover sheet and is fixed on the conductive part; and a bottom of the welding part is fixed on a bottom of the top cover sheet by means of a plastic part.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the conductive part includes a plate body and a protruding seat mounted on a bottom of the plate body; the welding part comprises a ring body and a post arranged on the ring body; and a top of the post is provided with a welding hole matched with the protruding seat.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the sealing sleeve includes a sleeve body and a first protrusion arranged at a bottom of the sleeve body; the first protrusion is provided with a through hole; a first recess is provided at a top of the through hole for accommodating the plate body; and the post passes through the through hole to be inserted into the first protrusion.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, an edge of the ring body extends upward to form a protruding edge; a bottom surface of the plastic part is provided with a groove matched with the protruding edge; an outer edge is formed on a side of the protruding seat corresponding to the plate body, and an outer diameter of the outer edge is equal to an outer diameter of the plate body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the sealing sleeve is prepared from fluoroplastic by injection molding or from fluororubber by die-cutting; the plate body and the protruding seat are independently made of copper, aluminum or a copper-aluminum composite material; and a material of the protruding seat is the same as a material of the welding part.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the top cover sheet is provided with a second electrode.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the top cover sheet is provided with a mounting hole; a second recess is provided on a top of the mounting hole to accommodate the sealing sleeve; a bottom surface of the second recess is in concavo-convex fit with the sealing sleeve; a third recess is provided on a bottom of the mounting hole for accommodating the plastic part; and a bottom surface of the third recess is in concavo-convex fit with the plastic part.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, a surface of the plastic part is provided with a second protrusion; and the top cover sheet is provided with a recess matched with the second protrusion.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the top cover sheet is further provided with at least one of an explosion-proof valve air hole and a liquid injection hole; an explosion-proof valve is provided between the top cover sheet and the plastic part; and a protective film is provided on a top of the explosion-proof valve air hole.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">This application further provides an assembly method for a battery top cover structure includes:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(a) fixing a plastic part on a bottom surface of a top cover sheet; and abutting a bottom of a welding part against a bottom surface of the plastic part;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(b) welding a top of the welding part to a conductive part sequentially through the plastic part, the top cover sheet and a sealing sleeve, so as to ensure that a first electrode is fastened to the top cover sheet; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">(c) welding a negative tab of a battery core to the first electrode; and then welding a positive tab of the battery core to a second electrode.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that, in the assembling method provided herein, the bottom of the welding part is fixed to the bottom surface of the top cover sheet through the plastic part. The plastic part plays an insulation role between the welding part and the bottom surface of the top cover sheet. The bottom of the welding part is fixed on the bottom surface of the top cover sheet, and the first electrode is fastened to the top cover sheet through the sealing sleeve, that is, the bottom of the first electrode is clamped on the bottom surface of the top cover sheet, which helps to improve the installation stability of the first electrode and the top cover sheet. The first electrode includes the conductive part and the welding part, so that the sealing sleeve can be easily sleeved on the first electrode, eliminating the need for an injection molded part for fastening the terminal and reducing the material deformation. The sealing sleeve is prepared from fluoroplastic by injection molding or from fluororubber by die-cutting, and has good electrical insulation performance, heat resistance, oil resistance, solvent resistance, abrasion resistance, moisture resistance and low-temperature resistance, facilitating prolonging the service life of the sealing sleeve.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Compared to the prior art, this application has the following beneficial effects.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The battery top cover structure provided herein includes a top cover sheet and a first electrode arranged thereon. A sealing sleeve is sleevedly provided between the first electrode and the top cover sheet. The first electrode includes a conductive part and a welding part, where a top of the welding part passes through a top cover sheet and is fixed on the conductive part, and a bottom of the welding part is fixed on a bottom of the top cover sheet by means of the plastic part. The existing top cover sheet is designed with a first terminal through hole and a second terminal through hole, and the terminals and the sealing sleeve are fastened to the top cover sheet by means of the injection molded part to realize the electrical connection, which results in complicated assembly operation. Moreover, the injection molded part is prone to deformation due to the generation of secondary crystallization and stress, which will result in air leakage, thereby reducing the safety performance of the battery core or causing the complete failure. Therefore, the first electrode is divided into the conductive part and the welding part, so that the sealing sleeve can be sleeved on the first electrode, and the first electrode can be fastened on the top cover sheet, which not only has an insulating effect between the top cover sheet and the first electrode, but also can ensure the sealing between the top cover sheet and the first electrode. At the same time, due to the absence of the injection molded part, the material deformation is reduced. The top of the welding part passes through the top cover sheet and then fixed to the conductive part, which can improve the assembly stability between the welding part and the conductive part and avoid the conductive part from falling off from the sealing sleeve, improving the safety of the battery. At the same time, the bottom of the welding part is fixed to the bottom surface of the top cover sheet through the plastic part, and the plastic part plays an insulation role between the welding part and the bottom surface of the top cover sheet. The first electrode is fastened to the top cover sheet through the sealing sleeve, that is, the bottom of the first electrode is clamped on the bottom surface of the top cover sheet, which helps to improve the stability of the first electrode and the top cover sheet. The structure is free of the injection molded part, reducing the material deformation, ensuring the sealing performance between the top cover sheet and the electrodes, and improving the safety performance of the battery core.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a structure of a battery top cover structure according to one embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of the battery top cover structure according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view showing the battery top cover structure after the first electrode is mounted;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded view showing the battery top cover structure after the first electrode is mounted;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sectional view showing the battery top cover structure after the second electrode is mounted;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a structural diagram of a sealing sleeve according to one embodiment of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a structural diagram of a welding part according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the figures: <b>1</b>&#x2014;top cover sheet; <b>2</b>&#x2014;first electrode; <b>3</b>&#x2014;second electrode; <b>4</b>&#x2014;sealing sleeve; <b>5</b>&#x2014;plastic part; <b>11</b>&#x2014;mounting hole; <b>13</b>&#x2014;explosion-proof valve air hole; <b>14</b>&#x2014;liquid injection hole; <b>111</b>&#x2014;second recess; <b>112</b>&#x2014;third recess; <b>21</b>&#x2014;conductive part; <b>22</b>&#x2014;welding part; <b>211</b>&#x2014;plate body; <b>212</b>&#x2014;protruding seat; <b>221</b>&#x2014;ring body; <b>222</b>&#x2014;post; <b>2121</b>&#x2014;outer edge; <b>2211</b>&#x2014;protruding edge; <b>2221</b>&#x2014;welding hole; <b>41</b>&#x2014;sleeve body; <b>42</b>&#x2014;first protrusion; <b>421</b>&#x2014;through hole; <b>4211</b>&#x2014;first recess; <b>51</b>&#x2014;groove; <b>52</b>&#x2014;second protrusion; <b>6</b>&#x2014;explosion-proof valve; and <b>7</b>&#x2014;protective film.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that hardware manufacturers may refer to the same component by different names.
