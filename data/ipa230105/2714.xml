All these processes are basic operations that are regularly employed in various overall processes. Processing systems that employ such overall processes require a comprehensive monitoring of the fluid flow or the fluid to ensure that the fluid has the required parameters in the overall process. However, this requires a plurality of measurement points in the processing system and elaborate management of the comprehensive monitoring data.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is then the task of the invention to provide a processing system for biopharmaceutical and/or chemical processes that simplifies monitoring the fluid in the processing system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This task is solved by a modular processing system for biopharmaceutical and/or chemical processes, comprising:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">at least one processing unit;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">at least one adapter plate that can be directly or indirectly fluidically connected to the processing unit, wherein the adapter plate has at least one adapter channel through which at least one fluid flow can flow, which flows to the processing unit, wherein the adapter plate additionally has at least one deflection element and/or a pump and/or at least one valve; and</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">an external control device;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">wherein the adapter plate is designed in such a way that the fluid flow to the processing unit can be at least partially deflected with the at least one deflection element in the adapter channel and/or the fluid flow, preferably its pressure, is controllable with the at least one valve and/or the pump in the adapter channel;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">wherein at least one sensor is embedded in the processing unit and/or in the adapter plate, in order to detect at least one property of the fluid flow in the processing unit or the adapter plate; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein the external control device can be coupled (directly or indirectly) to the at least one sensor in such a way that measurement data of at least one sensor can be read out, and the fluid flow in the processing unit and or the adapter plate can be centrally controlled based on the read-out measurement data.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A &#x201c;processing unit&#x201d; is in particular defined as a unit within which a special processing step for the desired method is performed. A processing unit in particular separates components of a fluid flow. A processing unit can for example be a unit for cell separation (for example by depth filtration), for sterile filtration, for a chromatography step, for virus inactivation, or for crossflow filtration.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In relation to the fluid flow, the adapter plate is arranged upstream of the processing unit such that the fluid flow flows from the adapter plate to the processing unit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The adapter plate, which can be arranged upstream of a processing unit in a modular processing system, permits making required adjustments concerning the fluid flow. This involves at least partially redirecting or deflecting the fluid flow, or changing the direction of flow of the fluid flow, and/or the fluid flow can be regulated or controlled with the adapter plate, preferably or in particular its pressure, with which the fluid reaches the processing unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, both adjustments can also be made simultaneously within one adapter plate. A deflection can preferably be achieved with at least one deflection element that is located in or on the adapter channel. Additionally or alternatively, a pump and/or at least one valve can be located in the adapter channel, by which the pressure of the fluid flow in the adapter channel can be regulated or controlled.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An adapter plate can then be arranged upstream of or on a processing unit in a processing system to make the required adjustments concerning the fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Arranging an adapter plate upstream of a processing unit in a modular processing system provides the ability to readily feed a fluid flow to the downstream processing unit in the manner required for the subsequent processing step in the processing system. Based on the construction, the adapter plate, in combination with a configuration of a processing unit, provides a compact construction such that the required footprint and system components can be reduced. The required investments are reduced accordingly.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, at least one sensor that can detect at least one property of the fluid flow is embedded in the processing system in the processing unit and/or in the adapter plate. As a result, measurements can be taken on the fluid flow at preferred positions, thus allowing the fluid flow to be permanently monitored. By embedding the at least one sensor in the processing unit and/or adapter plate, it is in particular not necessary to separately connect a sensor. The latter is already embedded or specified by the factory into the adapter plate or the processing unit, and can be advantageously preinstalled and/or sterilized. The user can as a result skip the work steps of calibrating or sterilizing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The measurement data of the at least one sensor in the processing unit and/or the adapter plate can be read by an external control device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the measurement data deviate from predefined optimum values, the external control device can centrally regulate the fluid flow in the adapter channel and/or the processing unit.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The modular processing system then only requires an external regulating or control device to obtain measurement data from the fluid flow and to regulate the fluid flow in the processing system.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The processing system preferably comprises at least a first and a second processing unit that can be fluidically connected to each other,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">wherein at least one fluid flow that flows from the first processing unit to the second processing unit can flow through the at least one adapter channel of the adapter plate; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">wherein the adapter plate is designed in such a way that the fluid flow between the first processing unit and the second the processing unit can be at least partially deflected with the at least one deflection element in the adapter channel and the fluid flow, preferably its pressure, is controllable with the at least one valve and/or the pump in the adapter channel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first and second processing unit can have an identical design or have at least partially different properties. The first and second processing unit can for example vary in their size, but can nevertheless be configured or combined with each other by the adapter plate. A processing system is preferably configured with various processing units that for example use various separation media or are responsible for various processing stages of a method. Equivalent processing units can be used when a capacity expansion is desired.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With respect to the fluid flow, the adapter plate is configured between the first processing unit and the second processing unit, and therefore fluidically connects the first processing unit and the second processing unit.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The adapter plate, which (at least partially) can be configured between two processing units in a modular processing system, permits making required adjustments regarding the fluid flow, which permit fluidically connecting processing units (in particular standard processing units) to connect to each other. This involves appropriately and at least partially rerouting or deflecting the fluid flow, or changing the direction of flow of the fluid flow, and/or the fluid flow can be regulated or controlled with the adapter plate, preferably or in particular its pressure, with which the fluid reaches the second processing unit. However, both adjustments can also be made simultaneously within one adapter plate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At least one adapter plate can then be arranged between two sequentially arranged processing units in a processing system to make the required adjustments concerning the fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Configuring process steps based on a modular processing system with at least one adapter plate between two processing units advantageously permits combining arbitrary process steps in a processing system such that the need for the footprint and system components can be reduced. The required investments are reduced accordingly. Additionally, in particular a compact and/or flexible configuration for the continuous operating mode in a processing system, including monitoring of several basic operations, is provided.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is further preferred that at least one sensor is embedded in the first and second processing unit and/or in the adapter plate, in order to detect at least one property of the fluid flow in the first and second processing unit and the adapter plate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">This ensures continuous monitoring of the fluid flow over the course of the processing system. Using the measurement data of the sensors, the regulating or control device can analyze at least one parameter of the fluid flow at the various locations in the processing system, and can immediately initiate actions to correct the corresponding parameters of the fluid flow if a deviation from the predetermined limit values is identified. As a result, the processing result can be advantageously influenced during the course of the processing system, and parameters of the fluid flow that would result in a negative process result can be influenced in the desired manner. As already described above, without limitation, the pump and/or the at least one valve and/or the at least one deflection element in the adapter plate can be controlled or regulated accordingly by the control device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The external control device is preferably coupled to the sensors in such a way that measurement data of the sensors can be read out, and the fluid flow in the processing units and or the adapter plate can be centrally controlled based on the read-out measurement data.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is preferred that the at least one processing unit and/or the adapter plate each have at least one transponder that is designed to transmit measurement data of a corresponding sensor to the external control device; or wherein the sensors of the processing units and or the adapter plate are coupled to the external control device over a bus system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A &#x201c;transponder&#x201d; is defined as a transmission unit that transmits the measurement data of the sensor wirelessly, optically, and/or by radio to the external control device. Alternatively, the processing system can comprise a bus system over which the at least one sensor can transmit measurement data to the external control device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the at least one deflection element and/or the pump and/or the at least one valve are controllable by an actuator.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An &#x201c;actuator&#x201d; is defined as a motion control unit that receives control commands from the external regulating or control device, and converts the commands into a mechanical motion. This can comprise actuating the at least one deflection element and/or the pump and/or the valve. The commands are output by the external control device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, not only are measurement data read out centrally, but the fluid flow can also be centrally controlled by automated means in the processing system.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sensor can be designed to measure a pressure, a volumetric flow, a UV value, a pH value, a turbidity, and/or a viscosity of the fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, depending on need, at least one parameter of the fluid flow can be monitored, and any required adjustments can be made on the fluid flow. These can be commanded by the external control device and/or the external control device generates an output (such as an alarm) for the user. The latter can then make any further adjustments as needed, should for example the pH value of the fluid be too high.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, the at least one sensor, the at least one deflection element, the pump, and/or the at least one valve, each have a rechargeable battery.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A rechargeable battery provides the sensor with the required power to make measurements; the deflection element or the valve can if needed be readjusted with the power, and the power from the rechargeable battery allows the pump to generate the required pump output if required.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The rechargeable battery in particular has the advantage that cables do not need to be routed to the outside and do not need to be connected by the user. A rechargeable battery already supplies the respective component with sufficient power. The rechargeable battery can in particular also be recharged inductively.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Alternatively or additionally, the at least one sensor, the at least one deflection element, the at least one valve, and/or pump can have an umbilical power supply.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In particular when the processing system is operated for an extended time, an umbilical power supply has the advantage of supplying the required power for the aforementioned components.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The processing system preferably has a central power supply for the at least one sensor, the at least one deflection element, the at least one valve and/or the pump,</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">wherein the at least [ . . . ] processing unit and the at least one adapter plate have partial sections of the power supply that form the central power supply when assembled.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other words, respectively one partial section of the umbilical power supply (cable) is integrated into the processing unit and in the adapter plate. When the processing system is assembled, the cable sections of the at least one processing unit and of the at least one adapter plate are connected to each other.

num="0090">Various processing units are used for biopharmaceutical and chemical processes, wherein said processing units can be used in the context of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) to <b>1</b><i>e</i>) show a basic construction of various processing units that can be used in the context of the present invention. These represent a selection and are not an exhaustive list.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) shows a processing unit <b>10</b> that can be used to perform a certain filtration step in a biopharmaceutical or chemical process. For this purpose, the processing unit <b>10</b> has a processing housing <b>12</b> through which a fluid flow <b>14</b> can flow. The fluid flow <b>14</b> comprises the medium to be filtered. At least one filter medium <b>16</b> is arranged in the processing housing <b>12</b>, the filter medium <b>16</b> comprising a porous material that is selected or used based on what particles or what substances are to be filtered out from the fluid flow <b>14</b> by the processing unit <b>10</b>. The filter medium <b>16</b> can for example be a virus filter, a sterile filter, a depth filter, or a membrane absorber. The filter medium <b>16</b> is preferably formed as a filter mat or filter membrane or filter membrane layer(s). In a preferred embodiment, the filter medium <b>16</b> can consist of several layers. Typically, the filter medium <b>16</b> is arranged substantially in vertical direction VR in the processing housing <b>12</b>. In the processing housing <b>12</b>, the filter medium <b>16</b> separates a filtrate side <b>18</b> from a retentate side <b>20</b>. The filter medium <b>16</b> is fluidically permeable, wherein filter medium-specific substances cannot pass through the filter medium <b>16</b>. Because the fluid flow <b>14</b> is as specified directed from the retentate side <b>20</b> to the filtrate side <b>18</b>, these filter medium-specific substances remain on the retentate side <b>20</b> and/or in the filter medium <b>16</b>, but substantially do not reach the filtrate side <b>18</b> of the processing unit <b>10</b>. A fluid pressure differential exists between the retentate side <b>20</b> and the filtrate side <b>18</b> as a function of the applied fluid pressure and/or the permeability of the filter medium <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">At least one inlet channel <b>24</b> is located at a preferably upper end <b>22</b> of the processing housing <b>12</b>. The inlet channel <b>24</b> preferably extends in substantially horizontal direction HR and feeds the processing unit <b>10</b> with the medium to be filtered. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by an arrow, the fluid flow <b>14</b> flows into the processing housing <b>12</b> over the inlet channel <b>24</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> this means that a fluid flow <b>14</b> flows from the left into the processing housing <b>12</b>. At least a part of the fluid flow <b>14</b> subsequently flows from the retentate side <b>20</b> through the filter medium <b>16</b> to the filtrate side <b>18</b>. If the processing unit <b>10</b> is configured in parallel with a further processing unit (not shown here), a further part of the fluid flow <b>14</b> flows directly to the further processing unit without permeating the filter medium <b>16</b>. This means, that this part of the fluid flow <b>14</b> flows into the inlet channel <b>24</b> of the further (not shown) processing unit. The fluid flow <b>14</b> that permeated the filter medium <b>16</b> (&#x201c;filtrate&#x201d;) subsequently flows into an outlet channel <b>26</b> at the preferably bottom end <b>28</b> of the processing housing <b>12</b>, and from there flows out of the processing housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The outlet channel <b>26</b> likewise preferably extends in substantially horizontal direction HR in the processing housing <b>12</b>. The filtrate that exits the processing housing <b>12</b> can subsequently flow into the outlet channel <b>26</b> of a further processing unit (not shown here) (parallel arrangement) and/or for further processing into the inlet channel <b>24</b> of the further processing unit (in-series arrangement).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>) shows the processing unit <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>), which merely differs from the latter in that the filter medium <b>16</b> has a multilayered design.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>) shows a processing unit <b>10</b> that is principally formed similar to the processing unit <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>), but differs in the type of filtration. The following therefore only describes the parts of the processing unit <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>) that differ from the processing unit <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Specifically, the processing unit from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>) for formed for precoat filtration. The filter medium <b>16</b> is for this purpose formed as a precoat filter. The filter medium <b>16</b> in this case comprises a filter carrier <b>17</b> that is preferably arranged in vertical direction VR in the processing housing <b>12</b>, and that has a relatively coarse design. Prior to permeating the filter, the pre-coat medium is typically mixed with the fluid. This enables the building up a filter cake (not shown here). The filter carrier <b>17</b> is selected such that at least one filter auxiliary agent is retained. A vacant space <b>19</b> is formed on the retentate side <b>20</b> to provide a corresponding space for the filter cake in the processing housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>) shows a further processing unit <b>10</b>. The latter has a design similar to the processing unit <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) but comprises a bulk medium <b>21</b> instead of a filter medium <b>16</b>. The bulk medium <b>21</b> can specifically be gels or activated carbon, such that the processing unit <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>) is suited for chromatography.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Substance mixtures can be separated in the context of chromatography.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The bulk medium <b>21</b> in this case acts as a stationary phase that is immovably arranged in the processing unit <b>10</b>. Using a mobile phase (such as water), a substance mixture is transported to the stationary phase. Due to an interaction of the stationary phase with the individual substances in the mobile phase, the flow-through time of the corresponding substance through the processing unit <b>10</b> can be delayed such that substances can be separated.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>e </i></figref>shows a further processing unit <b>10</b>. The latter likewise has a design similar to the processing unit <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>), but differs in that a second outlet channel <b>27</b> is provided. As a result, this processing unit <b>10</b> is suited for crossflow filtration. This involves pumping a suspension to be filtered at a high speed in parallel to the filter medium <b>16</b> and extracting the filtrate transverse to the direction of flow. The filtrate can then be extracted over one of the outlet channels <b>26</b>. The part of the fluid flow <b>14</b> that does not permeate the filter medium <b>16</b> (or the retentate), can be extracted from the processing unit <b>10</b> over the second outlet channel <b>27</b>. Depending on need, the filtrate or the retentate from the crossflow filtration can then be processed further in the context of processing systems described below.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Whereas the filter medium <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) to <b>1</b><i>e</i>) is formed as a flat filter, the filter medium <b>16</b> can alternatively be a filter cartridge or filter capsule <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Whereas flat filters have a flat design and form a plane, a filter cartridge <b>40</b> has a cylindrical shape. The filter medium <b>16</b> preferably comprises a pleated filter material arranged in multiple layers to form the cylindrical filter cartridge <b>40</b>. In order to ensure the required stability of the filter cartridge <b>40</b>, the filter cartridge <b>40</b> preferably comprises a cylindrical support core that braces the filter medium <b>16</b> from the inside, and a rigid outer cage that envelops the filter medium <b>16</b> from the outside and braces the latter from the outside. The support core and the outer cage are however both designed such that a fluid flow is permitted through these.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>) generally shows a schematic representation of a fluid flow <b>14</b> through the filter cartridge <b>40</b>. The fluid flow <b>14</b> can in this case be fed such that the fluid flow <b>14</b> flows from an inner side of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> to an outer side of the filter cartridge <b>40</b>, or from the outer side of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> to the inner side of the filter cartridge <b>40</b>. The feed direction is in this case influenced by an end cap that seals the cylindrical body of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> at an end side.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">If the flow is to be directed through the filter cartridge <b>40</b> from the interior to the exterior, the fluid flow <b>14</b> is fed from a first side <b>42</b> of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> to an interior of the filter cartridge <b>40</b>. But in this case, the second, opposing side <b>44</b> of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> is sealed by the end cap such that the fed fluid is forced to flow through the filter medium <b>16</b> of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> from the interior to the exterior.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">If the flow is alternatively to be directed through the filter cartridge <b>40</b> from the exterior to the interior, the filter cartridge <b>40</b> is sealed on the first end <b>42</b> by an end cap such that fluid flows from the exterior to the interior. By contrast, the second and <b>44</b> of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> is open this case.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The filter cartridge <b>40</b> itself is inserted or installed in a flat processing housing <b>12</b>. The processing housing <b>12</b> preferably has walls in its interior that appropriately route the fluid flow <b>14</b> such that the fluid flow <b>14</b> of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> is fed in the desired manner. If the fluid flow <b>14</b> for example is to be routed from the interior to the exterior on the filter cartridge <b>40</b>, walls can be arranged that route a fluid flow <b>14</b> to the interior of the filter cartridge <b>40</b>. As a result, any contact of the medium to be filtered with an exterior of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> can be avoided. This also avoids that the filtered medium comes into contact with the medium to be filtered.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">If the fluid flow <b>14</b> is to flow from the exterior to the interior on the filter cartridge <b>40</b>, a corresponding wall is preferably likewise arranged adjacent to the second side <b>44</b> of the filter cartridge <b>40</b>. The latter prevents that the filtered medium that exits on the second side <b>44</b> of the filter cartridge <b>40</b> comes into contact with the medium to be filtered on the exterior of the filter cartridge <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The filter cartridge <b>40</b> can be installed in the processing housing <b>12</b> in a vertical or horizontal orientation. The inlet channel <b>24</b> over which the medium to be filtered flows into the processing housing <b>12</b> is in this case appropriately formed such that a flow can appropriately flow through the filter cartridge in relation to its vertical or horizontal orientation. The same applies for the outlet channel <b>26</b> over which the filtered fluid can flow out of the processing housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>), several filter cartridges <b>40</b> can be arranged in parallel in a processing housing <b>12</b>. Feeding and extracting the fluid flow of <b>14</b> from and to the respective filter cartridge <b>40</b> is accomplished as was already described above in relation to a filter cartridge <b>40</b>. However, an additional partition wall can be arranged between the individual filter cartridges <b>40</b> such that the filter cartridges <b>40</b> are separated from each other.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">At least one filter cartridge valve <b>46</b> can be arranged in the inlet channel <b>24</b> and/or in the outlet channel <b>26</b>. In the inlet channel <b>24</b>, the filter cartridge valve <b>46</b> can be designed to facilitate or to prevent the flow to continue into the inlet channel <b>24</b>. A filter cartridge valve <b>46</b> can further be designed to facilitate or to block the fluid flow <b>14</b> from flowing toward or into a filter cartridge <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>), a filter cartridge valve <b>46</b> can also be designed to grant access from the exterior into the inlet channel <b>24</b> such that additives or a further fluid flow <b>14</b> can flow into the inlet channel <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the inlet channel <b>26</b>, the filter cartridge valve <b>46</b> can be designed to facilitate or to prevent the flow to continue into the outlet channel <b>26</b>.

The user can then in only a few steps supply the sensors <b>228</b>, <b>36</b> with power.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Alternatively, the at least one processing unit <b>10</b> and the at least one adapter plate <b>200</b> have an integrated power supply. For this purpose, the at least one processing unit <b>10</b> and the at least one adapter plate <b>200</b> are each integrated into at least a subsection of a power supply conductor. The subsections of the power supply conductor can be connected to each other as soon as the individual components (processing units, adapter plates) are joined. The power supply conductor is fed at a single point by an external power source. The individual sensors <b>228</b>, <b>38</b> are connected to the power supply conductor. One of the termination brackets <b>34</b> that hold the processing units <b>10</b> and the adapter plates <b>200</b> in the manner of a sandwich preferably also comprises a subsection of the power supply conductor, and the external power source is connected to the subsection of the power supply conductor in the termination bracket <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">The power supply was described above strictly on an exemplary basis for sensors <b>228</b>, <b>36</b> of the processing system <b>100</b>. However, we note that all other elements of the processing system <b>100</b> that require power also either have a rechargeable battery, or can be fed using any of the cable-based power supply options described above. For this purpose, reference is for example made to the actuators of the deflection elements, the pump <b>258</b>, or to the at least one valve for controlling pressure in the adapter plate <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">The bus system <b>300</b> can also be used for this purpose in order to transmit control commands from the external control device <b>400</b> to the individual components, such as the actuators or the deflection elements, the at least one valve for pressure control, or the pump <b>258</b> in the adapter plate <b>200</b>. For this purpose at least one control bus conductor is specified in the bus system <b>300</b> that permits transmitting data from the external control device <b>400</b> to the element to be controlled. Any of the elements to be controlled can for this purpose be directly linked to a separate or common control bus conductor. Alternatively, a primary data conductor can for example be routed from the corresponding control bus conductor into the adapter plate <b>200</b>, wherein the primary data conductor is split in the adapter plate <b>200</b> to connect the individual components to be controlled.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Alternatively to a cable-based data transmission, the control signals can also be transmitted wirelessly, as was already described regarding the data transmission between the sensors <b>228</b>, <b>36</b> and in the external control device <b>400</b>. The external control device <b>400</b> can for this purpose have its own transponder that transmits control commands to the corresponding components in the processing system <b>100</b>, which in turn facilitate regulating the fluid flow <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The processing system <b>100</b> according to the invention therefore provides a plurality of advantages. Firstly, at least one sensor <b>228</b>, <b>36</b> is embedded in the processing system <b>100</b> such that elaborate connecting, calibrating, and sterilizing of the sensor <b>228</b>, <b>36</b> is omitted. Moreover, the processing system <b>100</b> only comprises one external control device <b>400</b> by which the measurement data of the sensors <b>228</b>, <b>36</b> are collected and simultaneously used to regulate the fluid flow <b>14</b>. For the user, there is then only one point of contact by which he can monitor and at the same time regulate the processing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Moreover, the data transmission is provided to the user in a simple manner. Both, a wireless and also a cable-based data transmission between the external control device <b>400</b> and the individual components of the processing system <b>100</b> that communicate with the external control device <b>400</b> can be provided in a straightforward and fast manner. Elaborate cabling is avoided. A compact and user-friendly processing system <b>100</b> is provided as a result.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE SYMBOLS</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0203"><b>10</b> Processing unit</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204"><b>11</b> Processing unit group</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205"><b>12</b> Processing housing</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206"><b>13</b> First processing unit group</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207"><b>14</b> Fluid flow</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208"><b>15</b> Second processing unit group</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209"><b>16</b> Filter medium</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210"><b>17</b> Filter carrier</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211"><b>18</b> Filtrate side</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212"><b>19</b> Vacant space</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213"><b>20</b> Retentate side</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214"><b>21</b> Bulk medium</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215"><b>22</b> Upper end of the processing housing</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216"><b>24</b> Inlet channel</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217"><b>26</b> Outlet channel</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218"><b>27</b> Second outlet channel</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219"><b>30</b> First processing unit</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220"><b>32</b> Second processing unit</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221"><b>34</b> Termination bracket</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222"><b>35</b> Inlet pump</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223"><b>36</b> Processing unit sensor</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224"><b>38</b> Processing unit transponder</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225"><b>40</b> Filter cartridge</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226"><b>42</b> First side of the filter cartridge</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227"><b>44</b> Second side of the filter cartridge</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228"><b>46</b> Filter cartridge valve</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229"><b>100</b> Processing system</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230"><b>200</b> Adapter plate</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231"><b>202</b> First inlet opening</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232"><b>204</b> Bottom end of the adapter plate</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233"><b>206</b> Second inlet opening</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234"><b>208</b> Upper end of the adapter plate</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235"><b>210</b> First outlet opening</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236"><b>212</b> Second outlet opening</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237"><b>214</b> Adapter channel</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238"><b>216</b> First channel area</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239"><b>218</b> Second channel area</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240"><b>220</b> Connecting channel area</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241"><b>222</b> Deflection valve</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242"><b>224</b> First deflection valve</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243"><b>226</b> Second deflection valve</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244"><b>228</b> Adapter plate sensor</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245"><b>230</b> Inlet plate</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246"><b>234</b> Channel depression</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247"><b>236</b> Flow web</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248"><b>238</b> Connecting channel</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249"><b>240</b> Auxiliary branch</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250"><b>242</b> Channel element</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251"><b>244</b> Auxiliary inlet or outlet</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252"><b>246</b> Multiway valve</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253"><b>248</b> Valve tube</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254"><b>250</b> Jacket surface of the valve tube</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255"><b>252</b> Valve opening</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256"><b>254</b> Actuation arm</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257"><b>257</b> Deflection actuator</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258"><b>258</b> Pump</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259"><b>260</b> Piston</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260"><b>262</b> Cylinder</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261"><b>264</b> Inlet valve</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262"><b>266</b> Outlet valve</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263"><b>268</b> Hose</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264"><b>270</b> Rotor</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265"><b>272</b> Upper side of the rotor</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266"><b>274</b> Roller</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267"><b>276</b> Gear mechanism</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268"><b>278</b> Static mixer</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269"><b>300</b> Bus system</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270"><b>302</b> Cable</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271"><b>400</b> External control device</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">HR Horizontal direction</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">VR Vertical direction</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
