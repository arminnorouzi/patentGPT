The display device <b>100</b> may display an image based on input image data provided from an external component. The display device <b>100</b> may be, for example, an organic light emitting display device.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The display panel <b>110</b> may include gate lines S<b>1</b> through Sn, data lines D<b>1</b> through Dm, light emission control lines E<b>1</b> through En, and pixel <b>111</b>, where each of m and n is an integer that is greater than or equal to 2. The pixel(s) <b>111</b> may be at respective crossing regions of the gate lines S<b>1</b> through Sn, the data lines D<b>1</b> through Dm, and the light emission control lines E<b>1</b> through En.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The pixel <b>111</b> may store a data signal in response to a gate signal, and may emit light based on the stored data signal. A driving current flowing through the pixel <b>111</b> may be reduced according to a hysteresis characteristic of the pixel <b>111</b> (or, a hysteresis characteristic of a driving transistor included in the pixel <b>111</b>). In this case, luminance of the display panel <b>110</b> may be reduced as the driving current is reduced. A configuration of the pixel <b>111</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The gate driver <b>120</b> may generate the gate signal based on the gate driving control signal, and may provide the gate signal to the pixel <b>111</b> through a respective one of the gate lines S<b>1</b> through Sn (e.g., gate line Sj). Here, the gate driving control signal may be provided from the timing controller <b>150</b> to the gate driver <b>120</b>, and may be determined/set based on a display period, or based on a driving frequency of the display device <b>100</b>, where the display period may be a time interval between frames (e.g., an amount of time between two adjacent frame images) that are displayed through the display panel <b>110</b>. For example, the display period may be 1 second (sec), or may be 1/60 sec, etc. For reference, the driving frequency may correspond to a number of the frames displayed during a certain time interval, and may be an inverse of the display period.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The gate driving control signal may include a start pulse and clock signals, and the gate driver <b>120</b> may include a shift register for sequentially generating the gate signal corresponding to the start pulse and the clock signals.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some example embodiments, the gate driver <b>120</b> may operate in response to the driving frequency, which may be predetermined. However, the gate driver <b>120</b> may generate the gate signal with a certain period, which does not correspond to the driving frequency, based on a mask signal. For example, the gate driver <b>120</b> may operate in response to a driving frequency of 60 hertz (Hz), which corresponds to a display period of 1/60 sec. However, the gate driver <b>120</b> may generate and output a gate signal having a duration of only 1/60 sec for every second in response to the mask signal, where the mask signal has a logic low level for 1/60th of a second, and has a logic high level during 59/60 sec. In this case, the gate driver <b>120</b> may appear to operate with a driving frequency of 1 Hz (or, with a display period of 1 sec).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The data driver <b>130</b> may generate the data signal (or, a data voltage) based on data driving control signal and based on the input image data, and may provide the data signal to the pixel <b>111</b> through a corresponding one of the data lines D<b>1</b> through Dm (e.g., data line Di). Here, the data driving control signal may be provided from the timing controller <b>150</b> to the data driver <b>130</b>, and may be determined based on the display period, or the driving frequency, of the display device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some example embodiments, the data driver <b>130</b> may operate in response to the driving frequency, which may be predetermined, although the data driver <b>120</b> may generate the data signal with a certain period, which does not correspond to the driving frequency, based on the mask signal.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The light emission driver <b>140</b> (e.g., an emission driver, or an EM driver) may generate a light emission control signal based on the light emission driving control signal. Here, the light emission driving control signal may be provided from the timing controller <b>150</b> to the light emission driver <b>140</b>, and may be determined based on the display period/the driving frequency of the display device <b>100</b>. The light emission driver <b>140</b> may control an off-duty ratio (e.g., AOR, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>B</figref>) of the pixel <b>111</b> using the light emission control signal. Here, the off-duty ratio may be a ratio of light non-emission time of the pixel <b>111</b> to a light emission time of the pixel <b>111</b>. For example, when the light emission time of the pixel <b>111</b> (e.g., a maximum time in which the pixel <b>111</b> is capable of emitting a light) is 8 milliseconds (ms), and when the light non-emission time of the pixel <b>111</b> is 4 ms, the off-duty ratio may be 50% (e.g., 4 ms:8 ms).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some example embodiments, the light emission driver <b>140</b> may adjust/change/vary the off-duty ratio based on the light emission driving control signal, or based on the display period. The off-duty ratio may be determined according to an on-pixel ratio (OPR) of the input image data, grayscales, etc. Here, the on-pixel ratio may be a ratio of a number of pixels that are activated in an on-state, to a total number of all pixels. For example, the light emission driver <b>140</b> may gradually change the off-duty ratio during the display period. For example, when the off-duty ratio is 50% corresponding to a certain grayscale, the light emission driver <b>140</b> may gradually (or, step-by-step) change the off-duty ratio (e.g., from 50%, to sequentially be 40%, 30%, and 20% during the display period of 1 sec).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The timing controller <b>150</b> may control the gate driver <b>120</b>, the data driver <b>130</b>, the light emission driver <b>140</b>, and the power supply <b>160</b>. The timing controller <b>150</b> may generate the gate driving control signal, the data driving control signal, and a power control signal based on the display period.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some example embodiments, the timing controller <b>150</b> may determine the display period based on the input image data. For example, the timing controller <b>150</b> may select one display period among a plurality of display periods based on the input image data, and may determine the display period as one selected among the plurality of display periods. For example, the timing controller <b>150</b> may determine whether an input image (e.g., an input image corresponding to the input image data) is a video, a still image, or a special image (e.g., an image of a watch). That is, the timing controller <b>150</b> may determine a type of the input image. According to a result of determining the type of the input image, the timing controller <b>150</b> may select one among the plurality of display periods. For example, the timing controller <b>150</b> may select a first display period (e.g., 1/60 sec) among the plurality of display periods when the input image is video, may select a second display period (e.g., 3 sec) among the plurality of display periods when the input image is the still image, and/or may select a third display period (e.g., 1 sec) among the plurality of display periods, which have different lengths, when the input image is the special image.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">That is, the timing controller <b>150</b> may determine an operation mode of the display device <b>100</b> based on the input image data. Here, the operation mode may include a first operation mode having the first display period (e.g., 1/60 sec or 1/120 sec), and may include a second operation mode having the second display period (e.g., 1 sec or 0.5 sec) that is smaller than the first display period. The timing controller <b>150</b> may include a plurality of operation modes that respectively correspond to the plurality of display periods.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the timing controller <b>150</b> may analyze a grayscale change of frames included in the input image data, and may determine that an input image is a still image when the grayscale change of the frames is less than a reference setting value, and may, therefore, select the second mode/second display period. For example, the timing controller <b>150</b> may calculate an on-pixel ratio of the input image data, may determine that an input image is a still image (or, a special image) when the on-pixel ratio of the input image data is less than a certain value, or is within a certain reference range, and may select the second operation mode or the second display period.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some example embodiments, the display period may include a plurality of frame times, where a frame time is a unit time (or, a minimum time) to display one frame (or, a suitable time to display one frame). In this case, the timing controller <b>150</b> may generate a mask signal, which has a logic low level during a frame time among the plurality of frame times, and which has a logic high level during a remainder of frame time among the plurality of frame times. In addition, the timing controller <b>150</b> may generate the gate driving control signal and the data driving control signal based on the mask signal.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The power supply <b>160</b> may generate a power voltage, and may adjust/change/vary the power voltage during the display period based on the power control signal. Here, the power voltage may include a high power voltage ELVDD and a low power voltage ELVSS, and the high power voltage ELVDD may have a voltage level that is higher than a voltage level of the low power voltage ELVSS. For example, the power supply <b>160</b> may gradually reduce or lower the voltage level of the low power voltage ELVSS during the display period based on a first power control signal. Also, for example. The power supply <b>160</b> may gradually increase the voltage level of the high power voltage ELVDD during the display period based on a second power control signal.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some example embodiments, the display device <b>100</b> may further include a current sensor <b>170</b>. The current sensor <b>170</b> may measure a total current provided from the power supply <b>160</b> to the display panel <b>110</b>. Here, the timing controller <b>150</b> may generate at least one of the light emission control signal and the power control signal based on a change of, or a variation of, the total current. For example, the display device <b>100</b> may measure the total current during a certain time (e.g., during the display period), may calculate a reduced ratio (e.g., a reduction factor, or a reduced amount) of the total current with time during the certain time/display period, and may store the reduced ratio of the total current. Here, the timing controller <b>150</b> may generate the at least one of the light emission control signal and the power control signal based on the reduced ratio of the total current.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For reference, a driving current that flows through the pixel <b>111</b> may be reduced according to a hysteresis characteristic of the pixel <b>111</b>/of a driving transistor included in the pixel <b>111</b>, and a luminance of the display panel <b>110</b> may be reduced according to reduction of the driving current.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Therefore, the display device <b>100</b> according to example embodiments may compensate or reduce the driving current of the pixel <b>111</b> by changing/adjusting the power voltage, and may compensate a luminance that is reduced during the display period. In addition, the display device <b>100</b> may compensate the luminance, which is reduced during the display period, by changing/adjusting the off-duty ratio/the emission time of the pixel <b>111</b> during the display period. Furthermore, the display device <b>100</b> may reduce or eliminate flicker due to a luminance that is periodically dropped/reduced then and recovered/restored.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating an example of a pixel included in the display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the pixel <b>111</b> may include first through seventh transistors TR<b>1</b> through TR<b>7</b>, a first capacitor C<b>1</b>, and a light emission element EL.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The first transistor TR<b>1</b>, which may be referred to as a driving transistor, may be electrically connected between the high power voltage ELVDD and the light emission element EL, and may transfer a driving current Id to the light emission element EL based on a data signal DATA, or a data voltage, which is stored in the first capacitor C<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The second transistor TR<b>2</b> and the third transistor TR<b>3</b> may transfer the data signal DATA to the first capacitor C<b>1</b> based on a second gate signal GW.

Here, the second power control signal may be generated by the timing controller <b>850</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some example embodiments, the driving circuit <b>820</b> may include a power selection unit <b>826</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) that connects the charge pump <b>825</b> and a power line from the power supply <b>860</b> based on a switch control signal.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the driving circuit <b>820</b> may include a power selection unit <b>826</b>. The power selection unit <b>826</b> may include a first switch SW<b>1</b> to connect a first power line with the power supply <b>860</b>, and a second switch SW<b>2</b> to connect the first power line with the charge pump <b>825</b>. Here, the first power line may transfer the high power voltage ELVDD. The power selection unit <b>826</b> may include a third switch SW<b>3</b> to connect a second power line with the power supply <b>860</b>, and may include a fourth switch SW<b>4</b> to connect the second power line with the charge pump <b>825</b>. Here, the second power line may transfer the low power voltage ELVSS.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The first switch SW<b>1</b> may be turned off, and the second switch may be turned on, in response to a first switch control signal. Here, the first switch control signal may be generated by the timing controller <b>820</b>. For example, the timing controller <b>820</b> may generate the first switch control signal when the display device <b>800</b> determines that an input image is a still image.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">That is, the driving circuit <b>820</b> may select a power voltage generated by the power supply <b>860</b>, or may select a secondary power voltage generated by the driving circuit <b>820</b>, and may provide the display panel <b>810</b> with the selected power voltage or the selected secondary power voltage.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the first switch SW<b>1</b> and the second switch SW<b>2</b> are arranged independently to each other, and are included in the driving circuit <b>820</b>. However, the first switch SW<b>1</b> and the second switch SW<b>2</b> are not limited thereto. For example, the first switch SW<b>1</b> and the second switch SW<b>2</b> may be implemented as one switch that connects the first power line with the power supply <b>860</b>, or with the driving circuit <b>820</b>, in response to a switch control signal. For example, the first switch SW<b>1</b> and the second switch SW<b>2</b> may be included in the display panel <b>810</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">For reference, power consumption to output a data signal may account for most of the total power consumption of the driving circuit <b>820</b>. When the display device <b>800</b> is driven with a relatively large display period (or, driven with an ultra-low frequency, e.g., 1 Hz), an output frequency of the data signal may be reduced, and the total power consumption may be reduced. Therefore, the display device <b>800</b> may provide a power voltage (or, may provide a secondary power voltage) to the display panel <b>810</b> using the driving circuit <b>820</b>. In this case, the display device <b>800</b> may control a configuration of changing the power voltage by using the driving circuit <b>820</b>, which may be more easily performed than controlling a configuration of changing a power voltage of an externally located power supply <b>860</b>. In addition, the power consumption will be reduced because operation of the power supply <b>860</b> is reduced or minimized.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">As described above, the display device <b>800</b> according to example embodiments may generate a secondary power voltage, which is different from a power voltage generated by the power supply <b>860</b>, and may provide the display panel <b>810</b> with one selected among the power voltage and the secondary power voltage based on a selected/determined display period. The display device <b>800</b> may control the secondary power voltage more easily than the power voltage generated by the power supply <b>860</b>, and may reduce power consumption by generating the secondary power voltage using the driving circuit <b>820</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The present inventive concept may be applied to any display device (e.g., an organic light emitting display device, a liquid crystal display device, etc.).
