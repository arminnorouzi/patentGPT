The current invention more specifically relates to methods and compositions for reducing pollutants in ambient air, specifically ambient air that is in proximity with surfaces coated with the formulation disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Most of the developing countries are high pollution risk countries, including outdoor and indoor pollution. Combined with high population in small areas, this pollution takes a heavy toll on mental and physical well-being and also reduces the lifespan of people exposed to such heavy pollution loads.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polluted environment with poor air quality has a huge negative impact on both the physical and mental health. Indoor as well as outdoor pollution can adversely affect health, which in turn can affect mortality rate, quality of living, performance and learning. The most common symptoms of poor air quality are irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, coughing and fatigue, headache, sensory discomfort in the form of odor nuisances, light discomfort and temperature discomfort, exacerbated respiratory allergies, including hay fever symptoms, and increased frequency of respiratory tract infections, allergic bronchitis and reactions to pollution leading to various chronic illnesses and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Pollution continues to increase in most of the developing, and many developed countries.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, children may be affected in a different and to a greater extent than adults, because pollution may affect their development curve. Ensuring better air quality in schools can result in students and teachers being more proficient, more productive and having lesser sickness intervals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is great potential in ensuring a healthier and less polluted indoor environment in all enclosed as well as outdoor areas. Lesser pollution in indoor areas benefits not only people who are sensitive and have a low immunity, but in general increases the quality of life for everybody. The air quality in schools, and many places with heavy indoor activity, and human footfall, in most of the developing countries is not monitored, and in absence of any government recommendations, a decrease in pollution levels can have a great positive effect on the health, concentration and performance of people. The above problem applies to all indoor environments, that is, offices, restaurants, hotels, hospitals, all types of production units, that can have extremely poor air quality, depending on many factors such as the air filtration systems, footfall, number of people working in a specific area, geography of the region etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, house dust allergy is highly prevalent and can cause clogged, itchy or runny nose, besides respiratory distress. Moreover, house dust mite allergy is a year-round disease. People who suffer from house dust mite allergy often feel tired and sluggish. Also, it is difficult to sleep and you often wake up in the night due to difficulty breathing. Many people snore and become dry in the mouth and throat, or they wake up coughing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The current known and used methods for reducing indoor and outdoor pollution are usually expensive, and have limited area coverage, usually require heavy load of electricity, and replacement of filters frequently, which can turn out to be very expensive in the long run. Moreover, such measures are usually not available to low socio-economic populations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The current invention obviates the problems stated above and reduces indoor and outdoor pollution to a significant extent and thereby improves the quality of life. The invention provides a novel environment friendly, non-toxic, biodegradable particle binding composition for reducing indoor and outdoor pollution.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The current disclosure relates to a novel composition that can reduce indoor as well as outdoor pollution, is non-toxic and non-hazardous, inexpensive compared to other ways of reducing ambient air pollution and is easily applicable to even low-income, and low-socioeconomic regions. Thus, the composition disclosed herein can improve the quality of life for people being exposed to poor air quality in outdoor and/or indoor settings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The current invention discloses a novel water soluble, non-toxic, biodegradable, particle-binding composition.

The ambient air may be air in an indoor area, or an outdoor area. In an indoor area the ambient air may or may not be getting exchanged with outdoor air. The ambient indoor area air may or may not be getting filtered, or air conditioned by filtration units or air-conditioning units.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, the term &#x201c;particle&#x201d; refers to all particulate matter (PM) in the air or on surfaces in indoor or outdoor environment.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The particles can be of various sizes, ranging from 2.5 microns in diameter to 20 microns in diameter.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Particulate matter mostly comprises of a complex range of chemically and physically diverse substances that exist in the atmosphere as discrete suspended particles (liquid droplets or solids). PM is usually classified according to size, by its nominal median aerodynamic diameter (measured in micrometres or microns (&#x3bc;)).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Particles 2.5 microns or lesser diameter are called &#x201c;Fine particulate matter&#x201d; or &#x201c;soot&#x201d;) may consist as a tiny solid or liquid droplet containing a variety of compounds, that is emitted from road and nonroad vehicles like construction vehicles.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">PM with nominal diameters between 10 and 2.5 microns, designated as PM<sub>10-2.5</sub>and referred to as thoracic coarse particles; PM with nominal diameters less than 0.1 g and referred to as ultrafine particles (UFPs).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Particulate matter also includes PM with diameter of 4 microns, which is at many places referred to as &#x201c;RESP&#x201d; in the current disclosure. It may also be referred to as PM4.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">One main source of PM2.5 is diesel engines in trucks, buses, and nonroad vehicles (e.g., marine, construction, agricultural, and locomotive). Diesel engines emit large quantities of harmful pollutants annually.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Particulate matter is associated with a variety of serious health effects, including lung disease, asthma, and other respiratory problems. In general, children are especially sensitive to air pollution because they breathe 50 percent more air per pound of body weight than adults. Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, poses the greatest health risk, because it can pass through the nose and throat and become lodged in the lungs. These particles can aggravate existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma and bronchitis, and they have been directly associated with increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits for heart and lung disease, decreased lung function, and premature death. Short-term exposure may cause shortness of breath, eye and lung irritation, nausea, light-headedness, and possible allergy aggravations.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Dust is made up of particles in the air that settle on surfaces. Large particles settle quickly and can be eliminated or greatly reduced by the body's natural defence mechanisms. Small particles are more likely to be airborne and are capable of passing through the body's defences and entering the lungs. Many sources can produce dust including: soil, fleecy surfaces, pollen, lead-based paint, and burning of wood, oil, or coal.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Tobacco smoke consists of solid particles, liquid droplets, vapours, and gases resulting from tobacco combustion. Over 4,000 specific chemicals have been identified in the particulate and associated gases. The effects of tobacco smoke on smokers include rhinitis/pharyngitis, nasal congestion, persistent cough, conjunctival irritation, headache, wheezing, and exacerbation of chronic respiratory conditions. Second-hand smoke has been classified as a &#x201c;Group A&#x201d; carcinogen by EPA and has multiple health effects on children. It has also been associated with the onset of asthma, increased severity of or difficulty in controlling asthma, frequent upper respiratory infections, persistent middle-ear effusion, snoring, repeated pneumonia, and bronchitis.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Common biological contaminants include, but are not limited to, mould, dust mites, pet dander (skin flakes), droppings and body parts from cockroaches, rodents and other pests or insects, viruses, and bacteria. Many of these biological contaminants are small enough to be inhaled. Biological contaminants are, or are produced by, living things. Biological contaminants are often found in areas that provide food and moisture. Damp or wet areas such as cooling coils, humidifiers, condensate pans, or un vented bathrooms can be mouldy. Draperies, bedding, carpet, and other areas where dust collects may accumulate biological contaminants.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Mould, dust mites, pet dander, and pest droppings or body parts can trigger asthma. Biological contaminants, including moulds and pollens can cause allergic reactions for a significant portion of the population. Tuberculosis, measles, Staphylococcus infections, Legionella and influenza are known to be transmitted by air.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, the term di- and trivalent alcohols refers to compounds that are characterized by having 2 or 3 functional hydroxyl (&#x2014;OH) groups and being soluble in water.

We also noticed that after usage of our solution the floor got a shine as if it was new and was looking much better as we could eradicate the dust out of the floor.

The next step was to mop the floor each time it was normally mopped as part of the regular cleaning schedule with a certain percentage and concentrate of our dust binder solution (CMP). We mopped the floor with the industrial floor washing machines. This process continued for 7 days continuously and very good results were observed in dust and particle reduction in the air which is also tabulated below.
