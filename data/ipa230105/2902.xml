Concurrently, a third process gas G<b>3</b> may be injected from the third nozzle <b>55</b> and may then be introduced through the fourth slit <b>3</b><i>s</i><b>4</b> into the process space <b>3</b><i>h</i>. The third process gas G<b>3</b> may control distribution of the first process gas G<b>1</b>. Then, a second process gas G<b>2</b> may be injected from the second nozzle <b>53</b> and may then be introduced through the third slit <b>3</b><i>s</i><b>3</b> into the process space <b>3</b><i>h</i>. Concurrently, the third process gas G<b>3</b> may be injected from the third nozzle <b>55</b> and may then be introduced through the fourth slit <b>3</b><i>s</i><b>4</b> into the process space <b>3</b><i>h</i>. The third process gas G<b>3</b> may control distribution of the second process gas G<b>2</b>. The second process gas G<b>2</b> and the pre-introduced first process gas G<b>1</b> may react with each other to be deposited on the wafer WF. Some of the plurality of nozzles <b>5</b> may be positioned in different nozzle placement spaces <b>9</b><i>h</i>. Therefore, various process gases may be prevented from meeting each other in the nozzle placement space <b>9</b><i>h</i>. For example, because the first nozzle <b>51</b> is positioned in the first nozzle isolation member <b>91</b>, and because the second nozzle <b>53</b> is positioned in the second nozzle isolation member <b>93</b>, the first process gas G<b>1</b> injected from the first nozzle <b>51</b> may be prevented from moving to the vicinity of the second nozzle <b>53</b>. In addition, the second process gas G<b>2</b> injected from the second nozzle <b>53</b> may be prevented from moving to the vicinity of the first nozzle <b>51</b>. Therefore, the first process gas G<b>1</b> and the second process gas G<b>2</b> may be prevented from meeting each other in one or both of the first nozzle placement space <b>91</b><i>h </i>and the second nozzle placement space <b>93</b><i>h. </i></p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to semiconductor processing apparatuses and methods in accordance with some embodiments of the present inventive concepts, a nozzle may be outwardly spaced apart from an inner tube. For example, the nozzle may not be directly associated with an outer surface of the inner tube. Therefore, it may be possible to change a relative distance and/or angle between the nozzle and the inner tube. In this case, a position and/or angle of the nozzle may be changed to adjust a facing direction of a hole. Thus, it may be possible to control a moving direction of a process gas injected from the hole. For example, when adjustment of an injection direction of the process gas is needed to control a process variation at a wafer, an arrangement angle of the nozzle may be varied to adjust the injection direction of the process gas. Accordingly, injection of the process gas may be adjusted to control a process variation in each fabrication process.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to semiconductor processing apparatuses and methods in accordance with some embodiments of the present inventive concepts, the process gas injected from the nozzle may be introduced through a slit into a process space of the inner tube. In this case, the slit may vertically extend to horizontally overlap (i.e., to expose) a plurality of holes, and thus the process gas injected from the hole may be prevented from colliding with the outer surface of the inner tube. As discussed above, the nozzle may be outwardly spaced apart from the inner tube. Therefore, the process gas injected from the nozzle may diffuse vertically before being introduced into the process space. For example, until the process gas enters the slit after being discharged from the hole, the process gas may spread upwards and/or downwards without traveling straight only in a horizontal direction. As the slit of the inner tube according to the present inventive concepts vertically extends to horizontally overlap (i.e., to expose) a plurality of holes, even when the process gas is distributed vertically, the process gas may be prevented from colliding with the outer surface of the inner tube. Thus, the process gas escaped from the nozzle may be prevented from being introduced into an undesired region without being introduced into the inner tube. Therefore, a large amount of process gas may be distributed onto the wafer. For example, although a supply amount of process gas is maintained at a certain flow rate without increasing the gas supply amount, the wafer may receive an increasing amount of process gas that reaches a top surface of the wafer. Accordingly, an efficiency of deposition process on the wafer may increase and a process variation at the wafer may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view showing a semiconductor processing apparatus according to some embodiments of the present inventive concepts.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">For the convenience of description, descriptions of components substantially the same as or similar to that discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>13</b></figref> will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, an inner tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>may include a first slit <b>3</b><i>s</i><b>1</b> and a second slit <b>3</b><i>s</i><b>2</b> provided at a sidewall <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the inner tube <b>3</b>, and each of the first and second slits <b>3</b><i>s</i><b>1</b> and <b>3</b><i>s</i><b>2</b> may be substantially the same as or similar to that discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.
