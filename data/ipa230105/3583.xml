The quantum type infrared detecting device is a cooled type infrared detecting device requiring a cooling machine. On the other hand, the thermal type infrared detecting device is an uncooled type infrared detecting device not requiring a cooling machine and can be therefore miniaturized. The thermal type infrared detecting device is a detecting device that converts infrared rays absorbed by an infrared absorber into heat and converts a temperature change caused by the heat into an electric signal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, cost reduction aiming at consumer applications of the infrared detecting device has progressed and a sensing capability has been improved. If a diode is used as a temperature sensor in the infrared detecting device, the detection sensitivity of the infrared detecting device is enhanced by connecting a plurality of diodes in series because a temperature change rate of each of the diodes is small.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As many diodes as possible have been required to be connected in series and arranged in the limited area of a temperature sensing portion in an infrared detecting device. On the other hand, an infrared detecting device in which adjacent first and second diodes are connected to each other by a metal film provided on a surface of a recess formed to span a p-type layer of the first diode and an N-type layer of the second diode has been proposed (see, e.g., PTL 1). As a result, a spacing between the adjacent diodes is smaller than that when the diodes are separated from each other through an oxide film. Therefore, the plurality of diodes can be formed at a high density. Thus, the detection sensitivity of the infrared detecting device can be enhanced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">[PTL 1] JP 2009-265094 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the conventional infrared detecting device, the number of the plurality of diodes connected in series in the temperature sensing portion needs to be increased to enhance the detection sensitivity.
