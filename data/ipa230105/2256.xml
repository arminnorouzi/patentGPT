refers to a phenomenon in which an object becomes to have magnetism, but magnetized water does not mean that water itself has magnetism. In other words, magnetized water means that the arrangement of water molecules changed by a magnetic field, such that the magnetized water becomes to have a molecular structure different from that of normal water, and refers to water whose molecular structure is transformed into a specific structure by the magnetic field. However, these characteristics are not continuously maintained, but are maintained for a certain period of time and then returned to an original state thereof.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnetic field lines of the magnetic field come from an N pole and lead to an S pole, and when water passes through such a magnetic field at a right angle, an electromotive force is generated at a right angle with respect to the direction of the enormous magnetic field lines, thereby causing micro currents to flow. At this time, water molecules are usually attached to each other to form a cluster.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this state, if a strong magnetic field is formed therebetween, hydrogen ions with positive polarity and hydroxide ions with negative polarity adhere to each other, such that water molecules cause movements such as rotation and vibration, and thus, the water molecules are atomized and ions are activated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this regard, a magnetized water generator is configured to magnetize water by using the principle that water molecules become smaller as the hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions are subjected to the processes of separation and recombination when water passes through a magnetic field. Thereby, the magnetized water generator produces a sterilization effect by refinement of water molecules and provides an effect of removing scale or rust from water pipes, etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, when water passes through the magnetic field of a magnet, the molecular structure of water is ion-activated to change water into magnetized water having a hexagonal structure. The magnetized water generator using such a magnet is widely used in fields including domestic water, smart agriculture, firefighting and the like. However, since the conventional magnetized water</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generator is configured in such a way that water is simply magnetized by magnets provided in a housing of the generator during passing through the housing instantaneously, there is little opportunity for water to come into contact with the magnets and be exposed to a magnetized space. Consequently, there is a problem in that the magnetization efficiency is greatly reduced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-stage magnetized water generator which may be used by connecting to a water hydrant such as a water purifier or a shower, and a fire hydrant, etc., and in particular, may be used by connecting to various other systems for agricultural and smart farm, industrial, etc., thereby causing water to be magnetized while alternately rotating it in forward and reverse directions by rotors, thus to generate magnetized water.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-stage magnetized water generator in which rotors equipped with magnets are stacked in multiple stages to rotate water in directions opposite to each other, and the magnets facing each other generate complex magnetic force lines due to a repulsive force and an attractive force, thus to improve magnetization efficiency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Meanwhile, the objects of the present invention are not limited to those described above, and other objects not described in this disclosure will be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following description.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving Problems</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi-stage magnetized water generator including: a housing;
