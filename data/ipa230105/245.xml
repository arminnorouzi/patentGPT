The upper surface of these food trays is often segmented into a hot food products area on one side (right or left) and a cold food products area on the opposite side, and each food products area may include more than one individual compartment delimited by ridges or other features provided on the upper surface of the food trays. Hot and cold food products are put into corresponding compartments during the assembly of the food trays, for instance at a food tray assembly station in a commercial kitchen. Each food tray can then be loaded by an attendant into a wheeled cart or trolley so that they can be stored and eventually transported closer to the persons for which these meals were prepared, among other things. The food trays are generally given to these persons only at the beginning of the mealtime.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Food tray delivery carts can be designed to provide heat to the hot food products at the appropriate time without having to access the food trays, and many different systems have been suggested over the years to implement this approach. In these systems, the interior volume inside a food tray delivery cart is generally divided into two zones, namely a hot zone and a cold zone. The food trays are inserted into vertically stacked spaces when they are loaded into the housing from a lateral opening. Food trays generally have a substantially rectangular shape, and each food tray is usually loaded by first inserting one of their long sides into the space at a given loading level, and by sliding the food tray sideways until it is entirely inside the housing of the cart. Each food tray must be oriented so that their hot and cold food products areas are each placed into the correct zone.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some food tray delivery carts can be designed to hold only a single stack of food trays. Others can be designed to hold two adjacent stacks of food trays to increase the capacity, with the food trays in both stacks sharing the same hot and cold zones. In other words, the hot food products area on the food trays of both stacks will be located in the same hot zone, and the cold food products area on the food trays of both stacks will be located in the same cold zone. However, having two stacks of food trays but only a single lateral opening requires that two food trays must be inserted at least some of the loading levels. The second food tray inserted at a given level will push the first food tray deeper until it reaches the end position. However, when the meals are served, reaching the food tray at the deeper end will often be more difficult, and the risks of inadvertently touching food products or surfaces on other food trays are increased when an attendant must insert a hand well within the housing to reach a food tray. The design of such a system can also be challenging, particularly for the thermal barrier that creates the separation between the hot and cold zones within the internal space of the housing. Having lateral openings on opposite sides can alleviate these difficulties. It allows, among other things, the food trays of the first stack to be loaded and retrieved from one side and the food trays of the second stack to be loaded and retrieved from the opposite side.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The insertion of the food trays inside a cart at the end of a food tray assembly station being essentially a manual operation, it is generally desirable that the distance over which each food tray is hand-carried by an attendant during the loading process be minimized. This loading process, for instance, can involve picking up a food tray from a conveyor, with the food products already on it, and then inserting it inside the cart through one of the lateral openings. The lateral opening through which food trays are currently being loaded is positioned very close to where this attendant performs the loaded process. Hence, a food tray delivery cart having two opposite lateral openings is often repositioned at some point so as to bring the opposite lateral opening at the optimal position before food trays can be loaded in the second stack. For instance, the food tray delivery cart can be pivoted so as to bring the second lateral opening at the optimum position. This repositioning of the cart can even be done more than once until the loading process for this cart is complete and both lateral doors are closed. The cart can then be moved away to make room for a next cart.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Now, since the hot and cold zones inside a cart extend from one lateral side to the other, the orientation of the food trays to be loaded through a second lateral opening must be reversed, i.e., pivoted over 180 degrees around a vertical axis, compared to the orientation of the ones that were loaded through the first lateral opening. For instance, from the standpoint of the attendant at a loading workstation, if the hot food products area on the food trays loaded through the first lateral opening was on the left-hand side, the hot food products area on the food trays to be inserted through the second lateral opening must be on the right-hand side once the cart is repositioned. If not, the hot and cold food products areas on the second set of food trays will be misplaced. This rule is easy to forget, and it is inherently prone to errors. Unless such mistake is detected soon enough when it occurs, the cold food products on the misoriented food trays will be heated prior to serving while the hot food products will not. This will most likely result in food being wasted, additional work for the attendants and caretakers, and undesirable delays for the persons expecting the meals, among other things.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is worth mentioning that in general, there are also various other difficulties and challenges associated with systems and methods for storing and delivering food trays. Some of them can be complicated to solve or to mitigate without creating new issues or drawbacks. For instance, improvements made to increase the efficiency of some of the parts could increase the overall manufacturing costs far beyond what most buyers are ready to pay for the added benefits, or they may result in major inconveniences during cleaning operations because some of the newly designed parts are now more difficult to access compared to the previous ones. Many other situations exist.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is thus always room for further improvements to overcome or mitigate at least some of the difficulties and challenges in this area of technology.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The proposed concept involves a new approach in the design of systems for storing and delivering food trays. This new approach allows, among other things, the orientation of the food trays to remain the same regardless of the lateral opening through which they are loaded. It also suggests a number of other improvements, advancements and refinements on various components and aspects, for instance ones that are related to the manufacturing of the systems, or the cleaning and maintenance operations, to name just a few.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Among other things, there is provided a system for storing and delivering individual food trays, each food tray having separate hot and cold food products areas on opposite sides of a transversal demarcation line, the system including: a housing having two lateral doors to selectively open and close a respective one among two opposite lateral openings, the housing including separate first and second chambers, each chamber having an enclosed internal space accessed through a respective one of the lateral openings, each chamber including: a tray supporting arrangement having a plurality of vertically spaced stacking positions, each stacking position corresponding to a stowage space for receiving one of the food trays with the chamber through the respective lateral opening; and a vertically extending thermal barrier to divide the enclosed internal space within the chamber into separate vertically extending hot and cold food products sections along the demarcation line on the food trays; and when viewed from above, the hot food products section of the first chamber and the hot food products section of the second chamber are diametrically opposite to one another, and the cold food products section of the first chamber and the cold food products section of the second chamber are diametrically opposite to one another.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Details on the different aspects of the proposed concept and the various possible combinations of technical characteristics or features will

Other configurations and arrangements are possible.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The system <b>100</b> can include a carriage <b>102</b>, a housing <b>104</b> and an onboard heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> mounted onto the carriage <b>102</b>, as shown for instance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. It can also include other components. The illustrated system <b>100</b> is configured to create a self-contained food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> where the various devices are integrated or packaged into the same apparatus. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the housing <b>104</b> and the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can be provided separately, the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> being for instance located in or accessed through a docking station while the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> includes only the housing <b>104</b> and the carriage <b>102</b> on which it is mounted. The carriage <b>102</b> can be designed differently, and it can even be a device that does not include wheels and/or that is part of another machine, apparatus or vehicle. Accordingly, a carriage does not necessarily need to be present, n particular when a system <b>100</b> is manufactured and sold. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be noted that the term &#x201c;food tray delivery cart&#x201d; is used for the sake of brevity. The food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> is designed, among other things, to store food trays and to maintain the food products on the food trays at desired temperatures before the meals are served (i.e., delivered) to the persons for which these meals were prepared. It also allows the food trays to be transported to or at least closer to these persons. However, notwithstanding the presence of the word &#x201c;delivery&#x201d; in the term &#x201c;food tray delivery cart&#x201d;, the distance over which the food trays are transported after being loaded in a food tray delivery cart, for instance between a food tray assembly station in a commercial kitchen and the location where they will be retrieved to be given to the persons having these meals, is relatively unimportant. In some implementations, the food trays can even remain substantially at the same location between their loading and unloading. Hence, the term &#x201c;food tray delivery cart&#x201d; must be understood in this context.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The exterior of the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> has a generally boxlike aspect and a generally rectangular shape when viewed from above. The long axis is referred to hereafter as the longitudinal axis <b>107</b>, and the short axis is referred to hereafter as the transversal axis <b>109</b>. The longitudinal axis <b>107</b> can also be broadly defined as a line extending in the lengthwise direction, and the transversal axis <b>109</b> as a line extending in the widthwise direction. The illustrated food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> is designed so that its usual forward-rearward direction of travel is parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>107</b>. The food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> generally has opposite front and rear sides, and opposite left and right sides. It also has a top side and a bottom side. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, other shapes and designs are possible, and non-rectangular and/or irregular shapes are possible. The length does not always need to be a larger dimension compared to the width. The relative position, or layout, of the various components or parts can also be different. For instance, while the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> is said to be positioned at the front of the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, some implementations can be configured differently. The left, right, front and rear sides are all lateral sides. Hence, although the illustrated example shows the opposite lateral sides are the left and right sides of the implementation, they can also be the front and rear sides in others. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The carriage <b>102</b> of the illustrated example includes a bottom base panel <b>110</b> and a plurality of caster wheels <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> attached under it to engage the floor or ground that supports the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>. The wheels <b>112</b> at the corners can be directional wheels, i.e., that can also pivot about a vertical axis, while the wheels <b>114</b> at the center have a fixed orientation, as shown in this example. The bottom base panel <b>110</b> can be essentially a flat rectangular board that is slightly larger than the components mounted thereon, as shown. This bottom base panel <b>110</b> can be made of stainless steel or the like. Bumpers made of a resilient material can be provided around its periphery to absorb shocks if the carriage <b>102</b> runs into another object or a fixed structure. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the number, configuration, and type of wheels under the carriage <b>102</b> can be different in some implementations. Other materials are possible besides stainless steel or the like. The bottom base panel <b>110</b> can be designed differently and can even be omitted in some implementations, for instance by attaching wheels or the like directly under the housing <b>104</b>. As aforesaid, wheels can also be omitted in some implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> is a device capable of supplying thermally regulated air to be circulated into the housing <b>104</b>. In the illustrated example, the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can generate both hot and cold air flows. This heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can be constructed as a self-contained machine or cartridge that can be easily repaired or replaced when needed. The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can be plugged into an electrical power source when parked, for instance, using a power cord <b>116</b> as schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. It can also include or be otherwise connected to another energy source, such as one or more batteries (not shown) designed to keep at least some of the components running when the power cord <b>116</b> is unplugged, for instance when the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> is being repositioned or if no external power supply is otherwise available or used at a given location. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can be designed differently, for instance not as a self-contained machine or cartridge. A heating/cooling unit does not necessarily need to be present when a system <b>100</b> is manufactured and sold. The term &#x201c;heating/cooling&#x201d; also has a generic meaning and does not necessarily suggest that the same unit must do both. For instance, heat could be provided using by a plurality of heat-generating elements, such as electric heating coils, located at multiple locations within the housing <b>104</b> or even on the food trays <b>160</b> themselves, with only cooled air coming from the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b>. This, however, may significantly increase the complexity of the implementation and/or the manufacturing costs of the food trays. Some implementations could also include two separate machines mounted on the same food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>, one for heating and the other for cooling, and at least one of them could even be designed for doing both functions. Others can include one or more fluid circuits other than air to provide heat and/or to retrieve heat through heat exchangers positioned inside the housing <b>104</b> or elsewhere. Some implementations can use more than one method to provide and/or to retrieve heat for redundancy. One or more batteries with a sufficient capacity for sustaining autonomous operation of the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> over at least a complete cycle could be provided on the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>. Other sources of energy can be used. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The housing <b>104</b> of the illustrated example includes structural members to create a framework or the like in which are provided separate first and second chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). Each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> has an enclosed internal space accessed through a respective one among two opposite lateral openings <b>130</b> provided on the housing <b>104</b>. The housing <b>104</b> can also include an outer shell <b>118</b> surrounding at least a portion of its framework, as shown for instance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. This outer shell <b>118</b> includes, among other things, a top panel <b>120</b> located above the housing <b>104</b> and the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b>. This top panel <b>120</b> can be designed to provide a rectangular and horizontal flat upper surface to temporally store items or for other useful purposes. The outer shell <b>118</b> can also include a rear panel <b>122</b> having a flat vertical outer surface to which a driving bar or handle <b>124</b> can be attached. The handle <b>124</b> can be useful to facilitate manual handling of the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> by an attendant. The handle <b>124</b> can include a horizontal rod that is attached to the rear panel <b>122</b> through a pair of spaced-apart brackets maintaining the horizontal rod in a position where it extends parallel to and at a short distance from the rear panel <b>122</b>. The rear panel <b>122</b> can include a curved vertical edge on each side, as shown. The top panel <b>120</b>, the rear panel <b>122</b>, the handle <b>124</b> as well as other structural components or parts can be made of stainless steel or the like. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the handle <b>124</b> can be designed and/or attached differently, or even be omitted in some implementations. While the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> of the illustrated example is designed to be pushed or pulled by hand, some implementations can include a motorized arrangement to facilitate the handling. The handle <b>124</b> can be located at the front of a food tray delivery cart. The rear panel <b>122</b>, including its vertical edges, can be designed differently in other implementations. The outer shell <b>118</b> can be designed differently or even be omitted in some implementations. Other materials can be used besides stainless steel or the like. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The system <b>100</b> can also include a protective casing <b>136</b> to cover the front and lateral sides of the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b>, as shown. This protective casing <b>136</b> can include a door <b>138</b>, for instance a pivotable door, on at least one of the lateral sides. A door can also be provided on the opposite lateral side. The protective casing <b>136</b> can be made easily removable to facilitate the access to the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> for maintenance. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the protective casing <b>136</b> can be designed differently, for instance having a different kind of door or even without any door. It can also be entirely omitted in some implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The housing <b>104</b> of the illustrated example includes two lateral doors <b>132</b>, one for each one among the two opposite lateral openings <b>130</b>. Each lateral door <b>132</b> is provided to selectively open and close the corresponding lateral opening <b>130</b>. Both lateral doors <b>132</b> are in a closed position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, but where the lateral doors <b>132</b> are open. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a front isometric view of the system <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The internal space within each of the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> is said to be enclosed because it becomes a substantially confined space once its corresponding lateral door <b>132</b> is in a fully closed position.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each lateral door <b>132</b> can include structural members covered by flat panels on the exterior and interior faces. These flat panels and the main structural members can be made of stainless steel or the like. Each lateral door <b>132</b> can also include an internal thermal insulation layer to mitigate heat conduction and increase the overall energy efficiency. The thermal insulation layer can also be desirable to mitigate water condensation on the exterior surfaces under certain conditions. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the lateral doors <b>132</b> can be designed differently and/or be made of other materials or combination of materials. The two lateral doors <b>132</b> are substantially mirror symmetrical in the illustrated example. However, they do not necessarily need to be mirror symmetrical or otherwise similar in all implementations. At least one of the lateral doors <b>132</b> can be in the form of two or more independent or semi-independent subpanels or subsections instead of being constructed as a single unit or section. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The inner periphery of each lateral door <b>132</b> can include one or more gaskets or other features to seal the perimeter around each lateral opening <b>130</b>. They can also improve the thermal insulation. Gaskets or other features can also be provided or even only be provided on the periphery of each lateral opening <b>130</b> created by the housing <b>104</b>. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the periphery of the lateral openings <b>130</b> and/or of the lateral doors <b>132</b> does not necessarily need to include gaskets or other features, and these sealing arrangements can be omitted in some implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each of the lateral doors <b>132</b> can be pivotally attached to the framework of the housing <b>104</b>, as shown. In the illustrated example, each lateral door <b>132</b> is supported by a corresponding pair of spaced-apart double action hinges <b>134</b> attached directly to the rear panel <b>122</b>. Both of these lateral doors <b>132</b> open towards the rear, and they can be folded back against the rear panel <b>122</b>, even when both are fully open simultaneously, regardless of the order. The bottom base panel <b>110</b> can be configured to extend far enough towards the rear so that the lateral doors <b>132</b> remain within the outer periphery of the bottom base panel <b>110</b> when they are folded back against the rear panel <b>122</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. These lateral doors <b>132</b> are generally parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>107</b> when they are closed, and are generally parallel to the transversal axis <b>109</b> when they are fully open. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the lateral openings <b>130</b> and the corresponding lateral doors <b>132</b> can be designed and shaped differently compared to what is shown and/or described herein. The number, position, and kind of hinges <b>134</b> can also be different, and the hinges can be omitted in some implementations. For instance, one or both lateral doors <b>132</b> could be designed to slide horizontally or vertically, or be tambour doors or the like. Other kinds of doors are possible. While having the lateral doors <b>132</b> within the outer periphery of the bottom base panel <b>110</b> when folded back against the rear panel <b>122</b> can be desirable for a number of reasons, such as mitigating the risks of damaging the lateral doors <b>132</b> due to an impact with another object or structure, this feature can be omitted in some implementations. The lateral doors <b>132</b> can be mounted or otherwise attached to the bottom base panel <b>110</b> in some implementations.

This illustration is very simplified and is only for the sake of explanation. The food tray <b>160</b> includes a hot food products area <b>160</b>A and a cold food products area <b>160</b>B.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">This configuration is desirable to allow hot food products to be heated at the appropriate moment before the mealtime while keeping the cold food products at a lower temperature. The system <b>100</b> is designed to provide heat to the hot food products before serving the meals without having to access the food trays. Hot and cold food products are put into corresponding compartments during the assembly of the food trays <b>160</b>. This way, heat can be provided at the appropriate time to increase the temperature of the food products placed in the hot food products area <b>160</b>A on the food trays <b>160</b>. Food trays <b>160</b>, when viewed from above, often have a generally rectangular shape with rounded corners on their outer periphery, as shown. They are also often made of a monolithic piece of a heat-resistant material, for instance a plastic material. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the food trays can be designed differently and/or made using another kind of material or a combination of different materials in some implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted at this point that the terms &#x201c;hot&#x201d; and &#x201c;cold&#x201d; must be understood in the context in which they are presented. They are used primarily to distinguish between the food products that will eventually be heated on the food trays just before serving the meals from those that are not, among other things. These terms are not used, for instance, to suggest that the food products must remain constantly at different temperatures once the food trays are assembled. The term &#x201c;hot&#x201d; has a broad meaning and does not necessarily suggest a very high temperature or something more than warm. The hot food products, or at least some of them, may even be cold when the food trays are assembled. The term &#x201c;cold&#x201d; also has a broad meaning and does not necessarily suggest a very cold temperature or even a freezing temperature. The cold food products can sometimes be served at room temperature (for instance about 20&#xb0; C.), but it is also possible to have hot food products served at room temperature while the cold food products are at a cold temperature. The hot food products will generally be hotter than the cold food products when the meals are served, but not necessarily all the time. In particular, because the food trays can be assembled and placed into the housing of a food tray delivery cart many hours in advance, sometimes even days in advance, the entire content of the housing can be kept at a refrigerated storage temperature (for instance about 4&#xb0; C.) for a certain time and the hot food products will generally be heated only a short time before serving the meals. The hot and cold food products on the food trays can thus be at the same or substantially at the same temperature for a given period of time when stored inside a food tray delivery cart.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">These two areas <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B of the food trays <b>160</b> can have similar sizes, as shown, but can also have dissimilar sizes in some implementations. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the transversal demarcation line <b>160</b>C between the two food products areas <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B is at the geometric center, and this demarcation line <b>160</b>C is generally substantially parallel to the short axis of the food tray <b>160</b>. It can be located along the top of a continuous and substantially linear ridge <b>160</b>D extending from one edge to the other on the upper surface <b>160</b>E of the food tray <b>160</b>, as shown (see for instance <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). The demarcation line <b>160</b>C can also generally be parallel to a loading/unloading direction <b>160</b>F, as shown. This loading/unloading direction <b>160</b>F is substantially horizontal and corresponds to the movement of the food tray <b>160</b> when inserted or retrieved from the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the food trays <b>160</b> can be designed differently in some implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A food tray <b>160</b> can also hold dishes, such as plates, bowls, cups, glasses, etc., on which the food products are placed. However, in institutions where meals must be served to a multiple of persons, at least some of the food products can be put directly into corresponding individual compartments provided on the upper surface <b>160</b>E of each food tray <b>160</b>. These individual compartments can be delimited by ridges or other features provided in one or both food products areas <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B on the food trays <b>160</b>. Some tableware, for instance dishes, utensils, lids, or any other kind of kitchenware, can be placed onto the upper surface <b>160</b>E of the food trays <b>160</b> together with food products long before the meals are served. At least some can be already present when the food trays <b>160</b> are loaded at the food tray assembly station. Any tableware will thus be cooled and/or heated together with the other food products. Further, the food products on a food tray can include hot and/or cold beverages. For instance, a cup containing water can be placed on the hot food products area <b>160</b>A and this water will then be heated along with the other hot food products prior to serving the meal to a person.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The system <b>100</b> also includes a tray supporting arrangement inside each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> to allow a number of food trays to be stacked at multiple possible levels. Each food tray is removably inserted (i.e., loaded) into one of the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> through the corresponding lateral opening <b>130</b>, and each food tray will subsequently be retrieved (i.e., unloaded) through the same corresponding lateral opening <b>130</b>. The tray supporting arrangement inside each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> has a plurality of vertically spaced stacking positions. Each stacking position corresponding to a stowage space for receiving one food tray <b>160</b>. The food trays <b>160</b> are vertically spaced apart from one another and the vertical distance between two immediately adjacent stacking positions is selected so that the food products placed on the food trays <b>160</b>, including any tableware, will remain at least slightly below the underside of a food tray <b>160</b> to be positioned, or that is already present, within the stowage space immediately above. The food trays <b>160</b> will generally remain at the horizontal from the moment food products are placed thereon at a food tray assembly station until they are received at a cleaning station after the mealtime. The food trays <b>160</b> are horizontally slid into the stowage space at a corresponding one of the stacking positions. The stowage position at the top is closed by the ceiling panel inside the corresponding chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. The number of food trays that can be stacked will often depend on the minimum vertical spacing required between the food trays, and also the maximum height that can still be within the reach of most attendants when they stand on the floor next to a food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each tray supporting arrangement can include individual supports <b>162</b> or holders affixed on the corresponding inner surfaces inside the chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, as shown in the illustrated example. Each support <b>162</b> engages the bottom surface under the outer peripheral rim and a number of spaced-apart supports <b>162</b> are provided at each stacking position to create a rack, track or shelf on which the food tray <b>160</b> can be pushed or pulled while being guided and supported. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the supports can be replaced by other elements or features, and/or the tray supporting arrangements can be configured completely differently in some implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> of the illustrated system <b>100</b> includes a vertically extending thermal barrier <b>140</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> show the thermal barrier <b>140</b> that is provided within one of the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> in the illustrated example to create a partition wall separating the hot and cold food products areas <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B on the food trays <b>160</b>. An identical thermal barrier is also provided inside the opposite chamber. Each thermal barrier <b>140</b> divides the enclosed internal space within the corresponding chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> into separate vertically extending hot and cold food products sections <b>202</b>A, <b>202</b>B, <b>204</b>A, <b>204</b>B over substantially the entire height thereof. This division is made along the demarcation line <b>160</b>C on the food trays <b>160</b>. It creates a total of four vertical sections or columns within the housing <b>104</b>. The first chamber <b>202</b> includes a hot and cold food products section <b>202</b>A, and a cold food products section <b>202</b>B. The second chamber <b>204</b> includes a hot and cold food products section <b>204</b>A, and a cold food products section <b>204</b>B.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each thermal barrier <b>140</b> can include a plurality of vertically spaced-apart horizontal slots, and each slot corresponds to a stacking position where one of the food trays <b>160</b> can be inserted. The thermal barrier <b>140</b> can also provide additional support for the food trays <b>160</b>. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, although the illustrated thermal barrier <b>140</b> is shown as extending about the center of the food trays <b>160</b> in the illustrated example, the hot and cold food products areas <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B on the food trays <b>160</b> can have different sized and the thermal barrier <b>140</b> will then not be positioned at the geometric center. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each thermal barrier <b>140</b> in the example extends perpendicularly with reference to the lateral opening <b>130</b> across the entire width of the corresponding chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. The thermal barrier <b>140</b> substantially prevent air circulating in the airspace over the hot food products area <b>160</b>A to reach the airspace over the cold food products area <b>160</b>B of this food tray <b>160</b>, and vice versa. Each thermal barrier <b>140</b> includes seals or other features designed to close any one of the clearance spaces when no food tray is present at a given stacking position. In use, each food tray <b>160</b> will extend across the entire width and depth of the corresponding chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. The food trays <b>160</b> fit relatively tightly within the interior of each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and, once the lateral doors <b>132</b> are fully closed, the periphery of the food trays <b>160</b> closely engage the surrounding wall surfaces to minimize or even prevent air from reaching the spaces on the opposite side of the thermal barrier <b>140</b>. The food trays <b>160</b> themselves create subdivisions within each section. Other configurations and arrangements are possible.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The system <b>100</b> is designed, among other things, so that the same food tray orientation is used during the loading process through both opposite lateral openings. In other words, the orientation of the hot and cold food products areas <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B on the food trays <b>160</b> will remain constant for an attendant standing on the floor next to the system <b>100</b>, when the system <b>100</b> is repositioned the other way around. This standpoint on the floor is schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> at <b>161</b>. Thus, the food tray orientation will not have to be changed depending on which lateral opening <b>130</b> is being used. This can significantly mitigate the risks of having misoriented food trays and the consequences if such a mistake remains undetected until the misplaced food trays are retrieved from the housing to serve the meals, among other things.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the illustrated example, when viewed from above, the hot food products section <b>202</b>A of the first chamber <b>202</b> and the hot food products section <b>204</b>A of the second chamber <b>204</b> are diametrically opposite to one another, and the cold food products section <b>202</b>B of the first chamber <b>202</b> and the cold food products section <b>204</b>B of the second chamber <b>204</b> are diametrically opposite to one another.

The control module <b>400</b> can include, for instance, hardware and software components to control and monitor the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> and/or other features.

The control module <b>400</b> could also include switches (not shown) or the like.

The control module <b>400</b> in the illustrated example can be configured to constantly receive data from temperature and/or humidity sensors <b>180</b> located inside the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> or elsewhere. This can be useful to detect a potential or actual problem, and to notify an attendant or someone else if necessary.

The interior of the housing <b>104</b> must then generally be cleaned afterwards because some of the surfaces could have been in contact with some food products at some point. A cleaning operation with an increased degree or level of thoroughness and completeness can also be necessary from time to time, and the procedures may require for instance sanitizing surfaces inside air conduits or ducts, among other things. In general, a routine cleaning operation and the more extensive ones can involve using a high-pressure hot water spray or jet to remove any food residues and other possible contaminants from the surfaces. The temperature and/or humidity sensors <b>180</b> can be configured and disposed to detect the sudden and brief increase of the temperature and/or humidity level occurring when they are in contact with a hot water spray during cleaning. The control module <b>400</b> can then be programmed to monitor and relay data obtained from these signals or, if applicable, their absence. For instance, not receiving a signal from one or more of the sensors could indicate that at least some of the surfaces inside the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> were not cleaned for some reason, thus that the cleaning operation is incomplete.

These first and second air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> will pass through corresponding conduits provided around the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and through air spaces inside the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, where the air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are divided into a plurality of local arc-shaped subbranches.

Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the ports do not necessarily need to have a rectangular shape and/or to be something that is an opening made through a panel, a wall or another element. The term &#x201c;port&#x201d; and other related terms are, in general, simply referring to one end of an air circuit. They are the locations where air is supplied and returned after passing inside the housing <b>104</b>, for instance the junction between air conduits around the housing <b>104</b> and air conduits or other kinds of passageways inside the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b>.

This is only for the sake of simplicity. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, in other implementations, the first air circuit <b>206</b> can be the &#x201c;cold&#x201d; air circuit and the second air circuit <b>208</b> would then be the &#x201c;hot&#x201d; air circuit compared to what is shown in the figures.

In other words, once the lateral doors <b>132</b> are closed, the air content will remain the same until at least one of these lateral door <b>132</b> is open. This is often desirable to mitigate the release of food odors and/or to increase the energy efficiency. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the air inside the system <b>100</b> may not necessarily circulate or always circulate in a closed loop in all implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Air from the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> will circulate over the hot food products areas <b>160</b>A on the food trays <b>160</b> while air from the cold food products air circuit <b>208</b> circulates over their cold food products areas <b>160</b>B before the meals are served. This is what is referred to hereafter as the food heating mode. Before the food heating mode is taking place, however, it is often necessary to keep all food products, hot or cold, at a refrigerated temperature (for instance of about 4&#xb0; C.). This is referred to hereafter as the food storage mode. The temperature of the air circulating in the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> and the temperature of the air circulating in the cold food products air circuit <b>208</b> can thus be the same or substantially the same during the food storage mode. Hence, the term &#x201c;hot&#x201d; does not require the air be hot or hotter than the &#x201c;cold&#x201d; air at any given time. Air flowing along the two air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> can be mixed inside the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> during the food storage mode.

Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, air from the two air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> does not necessarily need to be mixed during the food storage mode in all implementations. Some implementations can be designed without a food storage mode, for instance when the meals are always served immediately once the food trays <b>160</b> are loaded inside the housing <b>104</b>, or for other reasons, such as when the whole system <b>100</b> can be stored inside a refrigerated space.

Each of these panels <b>164</b> include sets of air apertures <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> for circulating air in the spaces above and under the food trays <b>160</b>. In use, air enters the space between two food trays <b>160</b> through the incoming air apertures <b>166</b> and exits through the outgoing air apertures <b>168</b>. Air that follows the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> can only go over and under the hot food products area <b>160</b>A on the food trays <b>160</b>, and air that follows the cold food products air circuit <b>208</b> can only go over and under the cold food products area <b>160</b>B on the food trays <b>160</b>. There is at least one incoming air aperture <b>166</b> and at least one outgoing air aperture <b>168</b> for each intervening space between the corresponding food products areas of two superimposed food trays <b>160</b> in a given stack. There are also at least one incoming air aperture <b>166</b> and at least outgoing air aperture <b>168</b> for the airspace immediately above the corresponding food products area <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B on the food tray <b>160</b> located at the top, as well as at least one incoming air aperture <b>166</b> and at least one outgoing air aperture <b>168</b> for the space immediately under the corresponding food products area <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B on the food tray <b>160</b> located at the bottom of the stack. The number, size and/or shape of the various air apertures <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> can vary depending on where they are located along the corresponding air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. The dimensions of the air conduits leading to or away from the air apertures <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> can also vary. In general, the internal air supply network is designed so that in each air circuit <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, the flow rate of air passing through its subbranches will be approximately the same, taken into account the pressure drop along the way. For instance, the cross section of the air apertures <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> of a set located very close to the inlet and outlet ports will be smaller or collectively smaller than that of air apertures <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> of a set located at a far end on the opposite site of the housing <b>104</b>. These principles are well known to those skilled in the art and therefore, they do not need to be discussed further. Other configurations and arrangements are possible.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Air coming out of the incoming air apertures <b>166</b> will cool or heat the food products over which it flows, depending on the mode of operation and the corresponding food products area <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B. With the exception of the incoming air apertures <b>166</b> at the topmost location, air will also provide heat or cooling to the underside of every food tray <b>160</b>. These food trays <b>160</b> will conduct heat, either for heating or cooling, so heat transfers can occur on both top and bottom sides. In general, the incoming air apertures <b>166</b> are positioned to direct air towards the underside of each food tray <b>160</b> and not directly over the food products to prevent or mitigate dehydration, particularly the dehydration of the hot food products during the food heating mode. Providing most of the heat using heat conducted through the thickness of the material of the food trays <b>160</b> is generally desirable. Among other things, some food trays <b>160</b> may have lids placed over at least a portion of the hot food products and they can disrupt the heat transmission coming from air passing on the upper side.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Ideally, when the food trays <b>160</b> are assembled, the hot food products are positioned on the hot food products area <b>160</b>A so as to evenly distribute the thermal load as much as possible. For instance, a thin slice of meat loaf should not be placed directly on the surface of the food tray <b>160</b> next to a scoop of mashed potatoes. The thin slice of meat loaf may receive an excessive amount of heat during the food heating mode while the mashed potatoes are not receiving enough. In this case, during the food tray assembly, the scoop of mashed potatoes can be flattened, and the thin slice of meat loaf can be placed above this layer. In general, hot food products are simply heated or reheated, and are not cooked during the food heating mode.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Sets of incoming and outgoing air apertures <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> can be provided to send air into the spaces over the topmost food trays <b>160</b> of the stacks. Some implementations can be configured differently. However, during the food heating mode, having some of the air flowing along the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> going over the hot food products area <b>160</b>A of the topmost food tray <b>160</b> of each stack can be useful to prevent an excessive amount of condensation from building up inside a lid placed over the hot food products or some of the hot food products. Hot food products can receive heat coming from air passing or even impinging on the underside of the hot food products area <b>160</b>A on the food trays <b>160</b>. Providing heat in the air space immediately above the hot food products area <b>160</b>A of the topmost food tray <b>160</b> of each stack to bring its air temperature at the same or close to the same air temperature below can mitigate the condensation inside a lid.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">It should be noted that the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> and the cold air circuit <b>208</b> each include a multitude of subbranches of different lengths. For instance, some of the air passing through the inlet port <b>210</b> will go through the closest incoming air aperture or apertures <b>166</b> from the inlet port <b>210</b>, circulate into the corresponding space, and then exit through the outgoing air aperture or apertures <b>168</b> before passing through the outlet port <b>212</b> located very close. This subbranch is the shortest on this side. In contrast, the air coming from the inlet port <b>210</b> will reach the corresponding airspace located at the bottom of the diametrically opposite side only after passing through the corresponding air conduit inside the horizontal air duct <b>175</b> at the top and then all the way down before reaching the incoming air aperture or apertures <b>166</b> of that airspace. This air will exit the airspace through the corresponding outgoing air aperture or apertures <b>168</b>, then flow all the way in the opposite direction to reach the outlet port <b>212</b>. This subbranch is thus very long. There are a multitude of subbranches and a multitude of local air paths within each air circuit <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. Accordingly, each air circuit <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> does not follow a single path but multiple ones. Each air circuit <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> is thus formed by the combination of the multiple subbranches inside the housing <b>104</b> and other corresponding air passages within the system <b>100</b>. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the layout of the various ports <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> can be different in some implementations.

Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the air distribution doors <b>220</b> could be replaced by other kinds of panels or be designed completely differently, including panels that cannot be pivoted.

They are designed to be easily accessed, filled with water, and cleaned. They can be made a heat-resistant polymeric material, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or the like. Each of the humidifier trays <b>300</b> can hold a small quantity of water, for instance between 225 ml and 1,000 ml, and at least some of this water will evaporate during the food heating mode. Air coming from the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> below the bottommost food tray <b>160</b> of each stack will flow over the corresponding humidifier tray <b>300</b> and, since this airflow is hot during the food heating mode, it will capture some of the water released as it evaporates from the humidifier tray <b>300</b>. The humidifier trays <b>300</b> can be useful to increase or at least maintain the relative humidity level of the air in the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> during the food heating mode in a closed loop, for instance to maintain it above 50%. The hot air circulating over the hot food products during the food heating mode can often dehydrate some of these food products under certain conditions. Increasing the relative humidity level can help mitigate the dehydration. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the humidifier trays <b>300</b> not necessarily always increase the relative humidity level of the air, and they may instead only maintain the relative humidity level or even preventing it from decreasing too rapidly or from getting too low. The humidifier trays <b>300</b> can be made of a material other than PVC or the like. Other kinds of humidifier arrangements are possible.

The condenser <b>504</b> is a heat exchanger that can lower the temperature of the hot refrigerant coming out at the outlet of the compressor <b>502</b>, for instance using a blower forcing ambient air to go through the condenser <b>504</b> and retrieve heat from the refrigerant. The cooled refrigerant then goes through the expansion valve <b>506</b> where its pressure is significantly decreased, thereby causing its temperature to drop. The cold refrigerant flows thereafter inside the evaporator <b>508</b> and when air returning from inside the housing <b>104</b> passes through the evaporator <b>508</b>, heat is transferred from the air to the cold refrigerant, thereby causing the air temperature to decrease. The refrigerant then goes back to the compressor <b>502</b>, and the process is repeated. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the refrigeration device <b>500</b> can be designed differently. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can combine air returning from both air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> and send it through the evaporator <b>508</b> during the food storage mode, as shown. Two fans or blowers <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> are provided in this example to move air along the two air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. The first blower <b>510</b> is associated with the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b>, and the second blower <b>512</b> is associated with the cold air circuit <b>208</b>. Air coming out of the first blower <b>510</b> passes through an electric air heater <b>520</b> before being sent to the inlet port <b>210</b> using a corresponding air conduit. However, because the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> is currently set in the food storage mode, the air heater <b>520</b> is not generating any heat. A first air damper <b>530</b> and a second air damper <b>532</b> are provided in this example to channel air based on the selected mode.

The first air damper <b>530</b> and the second air damper <b>532</b> are now in a food heating configuration. The first air damper <b>530</b> now redirects air coming through from the outlet port <b>212</b> directly to the inlet of the first blower <b>510</b>, thereby preventing it from going through the evaporator <b>508</b>. The second air damper <b>532</b> is also positioned so as to prevent air passing through the evaporator <b>508</b> from going to the first blower <b>510</b>. Thus, only air coming from the outlet port <b>216</b> will go through the second blower <b>512</b> before passing through the inlet port <b>214</b>. Still, air from the first blower <b>510</b> can now be heated using the air heater <b>520</b> to increase its temperature. The air temperature of the hot food products air circuit <b>206</b> can be controlled, for instance, by adjusting the amount of electrical energy going through the heating coil inside the air heater <b>520</b>. One or more temperature and/or humidity sensors <b>180</b> can be provided at various locations to monitor the air temperatures and the relative humidity levels. The rotation speed of the first blower <b>510</b> can also be adjusted if needed.

The adjustments and the data monitoring can be done, for instance, through the control module <b>400</b>. Other configurations are arrangements are possible.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is worth mentioning that the illustrated refrigeration device <b>500</b> and its evaporator <b>508</b> are designed for cooling the entire content inside the two chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> during the food storage mode but during the food heating mode, the flow of air through the evaporator <b>508</b> will be smaller, for instance half the previous one, since only air from the cold food products air circuit <b>208</b> then goes through the evaporator <b>508</b>. This can be very helpful for keeping the cold air at a low temperature in spite of all the various nearby surfaces and air spaces within the housing <b>104</b> being at a significantly hotter temperature. For instance, some heat transfer will occur even if the thermal barrier <b>140</b> between the adjacent hot and cold food products sections within each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> is extremely airtight and its thermal insulation is optimal. Hence, having a smaller volume of air going through the evaporator <b>508</b> during the food heating mode can mitigate the internal heat transfers.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The food products on the hot food products area <b>160</b>A on the food trays <b>160</b> are often heated until their temperature reaches a target, for instance about 75&#xb0; C.

The heat is provided to warm the hot food products and in almost all implementations, no cooking process is carried out inside the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>.

Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, and as aforesaid, other methods can be used to increase the temperature of the hot food products during the food heating mode. The target temperature of the hot food products and/or the duration of the food heating mode can be different from one implementation to another.

These components may require a complete cleaning process after a given time in combination with a simpler cleaning procedure carried out from time to time between each complete cleaning. This simpler cleaning procedure can include a cleaning solution sprayed inside the housing <b>104</b> when it is empty so as to form a mist. The blowers <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> can then run at a low speed while the lateral doors <b>132</b> are closed until all internal surfaces have received a suitable quantity of droplets of the cleaning solution to be effective.

The position sensors <b>360</b>, <b>362</b> can cooperate with a locking arrangement provided to releasably secure the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> to the docking station <b>350</b> in the docked position, as also shown in the illustrated example. This locking arrangement can include, for instance, a set of electromagnets <b>370</b>. The system <b>100</b> can be designed to only activate the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> when the electromagnets <b>370</b> are in a fully locked position. Other configurations are arrangements are possible. Among other things, the position sensors <b>360</b>, <b>362</b> and/or the set of electromagnets <b>370</b> can be designed or positioned differently. One or even both of these features can be replaced by something else, or be omitted in some implementations. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a second longitudinal cross-sectional view of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, taken from the opposite side.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a cross-sectional plan view of the interior of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.

Some of the components are omitted, and others are semitransparent for the sake of illustration. As can be seen, the system <b>100</b> in the example includes both a housing <b>104</b> and a heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> located over a bottom base panel <b>110</b> of a wheeled carriage <b>102</b>. This system <b>100</b>, however, includes two lateral openings <b>130</b> that are juxtaposed on the same lateral side, the housing <b>104</b> extending longitudinally on the left side of the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>. The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> extends longitudinally on the right side thereof in this example. There are two separate chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> is divided into hot and cold food products sections by a corresponding thermal barrier <b>140</b>. The two chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, however, are juxtaposed side-by-side instead of being back-to-back, and the partition wall <b>200</b> extends in the transversal axis <b>109</b> in the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. The partition wall <b>200</b> is thus parallel to the thermal barriers <b>140</b> in this example. Each food products section of the chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> corresponds to a stack of food trays <b>160</b> and its lateral opening <b>130</b> can be closed by a lateral door <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). The food trays <b>160</b> can be loaded through both lateral openings <b>130</b> with the same orientation, for instance with the hot food products area <b>160</b>A of each food tray <b>160</b> to the left and the cold food products area <b>160</b>B to the right. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the housing <b>104</b> and its lateral openings <b>130</b> can be provided, for instance, on the right side of the system <b>100</b> in some implementations. Both lateral openings <b>130</b> can be closed using a single lateral door <b>132</b> instead of two. Some systems <b>100</b> can be designed to receive more than two stacks of food trays <b>160</b>, thus include more than two lateral openings side-by-side, particularly if the system <b>100</b> is designed for smaller food trays. Some implementations can be designed to receive food trays <b>160</b> of different sizes, one stack being configured for instance to receive a first set of food trays and another stack being configured to receive a second set of food trays having a different length and/or width than that of the food trays in the first set. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> can be somewhat similar to that of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for instance having ground-engaging wheels <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and a handle <b>124</b> provided at the back. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> in the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> can be modified or otherwise redesigned as previously presented in the text concerning the other examples. This includes having only the housing <b>104</b> on the carriage <b>102</b>, the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> being, for instance, provided in or being otherwise accessed through a docking station or another arrangement. Other variants are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> is provided along the right side of the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, thus along the back side of the housing <b>104</b> in this example. As aforesaid, the housing <b>104</b> and its lateral openings <b>130</b> could be on the right and the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> on the left. The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> provides the hot and cold food products air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> passing through the corresponding food products sections. Other configurations and arrangements are possible.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a cross-sectional plan view of the interior of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, with the system <b>100</b> being set in the food storage mode. The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> and the associated air passage arrangement are only semi-schematically depicted. The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can include components identical or similar to those presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The operation of the refrigeration device <b>500</b> and the associated components is essentially the same and need not to be repeated. Air is supplied and returns through corresponding ports provided at the back of one of the food products sections. Air flows independently along the air circuits <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the various components of the heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> and/or of the air passage arrangement, including the air ports, can be designed and/or be positioned differently in some implementations. The heating/cooling unit <b>106</b> can also be set in a food heating mode, thus operate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.

It shows semi-schematically an example of the fluid communication between the air conduits. Like the systems <b>100</b> of the other examples, this system <b>100</b> can include four vertical air ducts and each of them can include a longitudinally extending internal separator wall creating two separate air conduits in which air flows substantially in opposite directions. The air conduits located inside the vertical air ducts that are positioned in the food products section away from the air ports receive and return air through corresponding horizontal air conduits. These separate horizontal air conduits can be created inside horizontal air ducts divided in two using a longitudinally extending internal separator wall and/or through separate air ducts or air passages. The air passage arrangement is designed so that air from each air circuit <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> will enter the corresponding air spaces over and under the hot and cold food products areas <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B on the food trays <b>160</b> using air apertures <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> (shown in the other examples). As can be seen, the air passage arrangement in this example includes a combination of horizontal and vertical air ducts, like in the other examples.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The panels at the back of each housing section can also be designed to open so as to facilitate cleaning. Other configurations and arrangements are possible. Among other things, the design and the position of the air passage arrangement can be different in some implementations. Others may even include two heating/cooling units, one for each chamber <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, mounted over the food tray delivery cart <b>108</b>. Some implementations can be made without having horizontal and vertical air ducts. For instance, one or more can be obliquely oriented, or be designed completely differently.
