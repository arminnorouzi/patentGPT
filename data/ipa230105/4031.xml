In some embodiments, the first liquid crystal layer <b>110</b> further includes chiral molecules, so that the liquid crystal molecules <b>112</b> are aligned between the first substrate <b>140</b> and the second substrate <b>150</b> in a helical manner. In some embodiments, when the first liquid crystal layer <b>110</b> includes chiral molecules, the ratio of the thickness dLC to the chiral pitch of the first liquid crystal layer <b>110</b> may be less than 1. In some embodiments, the phase retardation of the first liquid crystal layer <b>110</b> is, for example, between 150 nanometers to 7500 nanometers, that is, 150 nanometers&#x3c;the phase retardation of the first liquid crystal layer <b>110</b>&#x3c;7500 nanometers, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, the first electrode <b>160</b> and the second electrode <b>170</b> may be full-surface electrodes, so a uniform electric field may be provided between the first substrate <b>140</b> and the second substrate <b>150</b> to control the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules <b>112</b>. However, in some embodiments, at least one of the first electrode <b>160</b> and the second electrode <b>170</b> may be patterned to provide a localized electric field distribution.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the dye molecules <b>114</b> are dichroic. The dye molecules <b>114</b> have long axes and absorb light whose polarization state is parallel to their long axes, thereby providing a light absorption effect. When the liquid crystal molecules <b>112</b> change their alignment, the dye molecules <b>114</b> may change their alignment state accordingly. For example, in the state A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the long axes of the dye molecules <b>114</b> are substantially parallel to the first substrate <b>140</b> or the second substrate <b>150</b> and intersect the incident direction of the light L, so the dye molecules <b>114</b> absorb the portion of the light L whose polarization state is parallel to the long axes of the dye molecules <b>114</b>. In contrast, in the state B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the long axes of the dye molecules <b>114</b> are substantially perpendicular to the first substrate <b>140</b> or the second substrate <b>150</b> and parallel to the incident direction of the light L, so the dye molecules <b>114</b> do not absorb the light L significantly. Therefore, in the state A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the transmittance of the light L is low, which may be understood as a dark state, and in the state B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the transmittance of the light L is high, which may be understood as a bright state. Therefore, the electronic device <b>100</b> may control the molecular alignment of the first liquid crystal layer <b>110</b> to adjust the transmittance of the light L. In some embodiments, the electronic device <b>100</b> may be applied to an optical switching device, such as a dimmable car window, a dimmable window and the like, but the disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first alignment layer <b>120</b> and the second alignment layer <b>130</b> may provide an alignment function to affect the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules <b>112</b>.
