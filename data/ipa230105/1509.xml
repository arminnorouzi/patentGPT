For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2019-51535 discloses a technique to radiate a laser beam with specific intensities to respective regions on a welding surface, namely a main region and an auxiliary region adjacent to the main region.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a manufacturing process of an automobile part (for example, an automobile body), metal forming such as press forming may be performed using a material called a tailored blank. A tailored blank is made of steel plates with different characteristics, for example, materials, and thicknesses joined by butt welding. Since one piece of tailored blank includes materials with different characteristics arranged in different portions thereof, use of a tailored blank enables improved productivity, weight reduction of a formed part, and so on.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an actual manufacturing process of a tailored blank, there may be a gap between steel plates arranged abutting each other, and/or a radiation position to which a laser beam is radiated may be deviated from a target position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If there is a gap between steel plates, part of a laser beam passes through the gap and causes a loss of an output power of the laser beam. This results in a shortage of molten metal that contributes joining of the steel plates and thus causes a possibility of insufficient joining of the steel plates.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">If a radiation position of a laser beam deviates from a target position, of the deviation also causes a possibility of insufficient joining of steel plates. For example, when steel plates of different thicknesses are joined in a manufacturing process, it is conceivable that the center of a laser beam is radiated on a thicker steel plate. In this case, a beam radiation condition including an output power and a beam radiation area (a beam radiation region) is expected to be set to sufficiently penetrate the thicker steel plate. However, if the radiation position deviates toward a thinner steel plate, there is an excess of energy radiated to the steel plate. This may cause a lack of molten metal and thus result in insufficient joining of the steel plates. In contrast, it is also conceivable that the center of laser beam is radiated on the thinner steel plate, and, for this purpose, a beam radiation condition is expected to be set to sufficiently penetrate the thinner steel plate. In this case, if the radiation position deviates toward the thicker steel plate, there is a short of energy radiated to the steel plate. This may produce an insufficient penetration depth in the thicker steel plate and thus result in insufficient joining of the steel plates.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is desirable that the present disclosure provides a manufacturing method of a tailored blank and a manufacturing method of an automobile part that enable sufficient joining of steel plates regardless of a gap between the steel plates and/or deviation of a radiation position.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the present disclosure provides a manufacturing method of a tailored blank including a first steel plate and a second steel plate to be joined by butt welding. In the manufacturing method, the first steel plate and the second steel plates are butt welded with a laser beam. The laser beam comprises, on a beam radiating surface, a first region located in a central portion, a second region surrounding the first region, a third region surrounding the second region, and a fourth region surrounding the third region. The laser beam has a power density q1 in the first region, a power density q2 in the second region, a power density q3 in the third region, and a power density q4 in the fourth region. The power density q1, the power density q2, the power density q3, and the power density q4 satisfy a relationship of q1&#x3e;q2&#x3e;q3&#x3e;q4.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such a method enables sufficient joining of steel plates regardless of a gap between the steel plates or deviation of a radiation position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first steel plate may have a thickness different from a thickness of the second steel plate. Such a method enables sufficient joining of steel plates regardless of deviation of a radiation position.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The laser beam may be radiated at an output power P1 in the first region, an output power P2 in the second region, an output power P3 in the third region, and an output power P4 in the fourth region. The output power P1, the output power P2, the output power P3, and the output power P4 may satisfy a relationship P1&#x3e;P2 and a relationship P1&#x3c;P3, P4.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The laser beam may be radiated at an output power P1 in the first region, an output power P2 in the second region, an output power P3 in the third region, and an output power P4 in the fourth region. The difference between a ratio of the output power P3 to the output power P1 (P3/P1) and a ratio of the output power P4 to the output power P1 (P4/P1) may be 2.6 or less. According to such a method, it is easy form a gradual power density distribution across a beam radiation area. Thus, steel plates can be sufficiently joined regardless of a gap between the steel plates or deviation of a radiation position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">One aspect of the present disclosure provides a manufacturing method of an automobile part to be produced by forming of a tailored blank. In the method, the tailored blank is produced by the aforementioned manufacturing method of a tailored blank. Such a method enables sufficient joining of steel plates regardless of a gap between the steel plates or deviation of a radiation position.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

Manufacturing Method of Tailored Blank</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in a manufacturing method of a tailored blank according to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a first steel plate <b>2</b><i>a </i>and a second steel plate <b>2</b><i>b </i>are joined by butt welding with a laser beam <b>1</b> of, for example, a fiber laser. In the present embodiment, each of the first steel plate <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the second steel plate <b>2</b><i>b </i>is a zinc plated steel plate, and has a thickness different from the other steel plate.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the laser beam <b>1</b> comprises, on a beam radiating surface, a first region <b>11</b> located in a central portion, a second region <b>12</b> surrounding the first region <b>11</b>, a third region <b>13</b> surrounding the second region <b>12</b>, and a fourth region <b>14</b> surrounding the third region <b>13</b>. The term &#x201c;beam radiating surface&#x201d; mentioned herein means the surfaces of steel plates irradiated with the laser beam <b>1</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, if the laser beam <b>1</b> is radiated perpendicular to the first steel plate <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the second steel plate <b>2</b><i>b</i>, the beam radiating surface is a cross section perpendicular to a radiation direction of the laser beam <b>1</b>, that is, a cross section perpendicular to a direction A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The laser beam <b>1</b> comprising such radiation regions can be formed by splitting a laser beam with a diffractive optical element.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first region <b>11</b> has a circular shape while each of the second region <b>12</b> to the fourth region <b>14</b> has an annular shape.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The laser beam <b>1</b> has a power density q1 in the first region <b>11</b>, a power density q2 in the second region <b>12</b>, a power density q3 in the third region <b>13</b>, and a power density q4 in the fourth region <b>14</b>. The power density q1, the power density q2, the power density q3, and the power density q4 satisfy a relationship of q1&#x3e;q2&#x3e;q3&#x3e;q4. The term &#x201c;power density&#x201d; means an output power of the laser beam <b>1</b> per area in one region.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described above, in actual manufacturing of tailored blanks, there may be a gap between steel plates arranged abutting each other, and/or a radiation position at which a laser beam is radiated may be deviated from a target position. In such cases, there is a possibility that steel plates cannot be sufficiently joined.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To enable stable welding of steel plates regardless of a gap between the steel plates, it is desirable to widen a beam radiation area to some extent and thereby increase the amount of molten metal so that the gap can be quickly filled with the molten metal. Moreover, to deal with deviation of a radiation position, it is desirable to achieve a relatively large molten width. As indicated by an arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the molten width refers to the width of a melt pool <b>4</b> formed around a keyhole <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, according to a study made by the inventors of the present disclosure, adjusting power density distribution of a laser beam is extremely difficult in a case where a laser beam has only two or three radiation regions as in the above-described Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2019-51535. The reason is that it is technically difficult to form a molten width of a desired size while such a large beam radiation area is provided. A power density refers to an output power of a laser beam per area.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in a case where a laser beam has, for example, only three radiation regions, a power density q1 in a first region located in a central portion, a power density q2 in a second region surrounding the first region, and a power density q3 in a third region surrounding the second region are adjusted to q1&#x3e;q2&#x3e;q3. During the adjustment, the power density q1 in the first region is adjusted so as to achieve a desired penetration depth. The power density q2 in the second region is adjusted so as to assist penetration in the central portion and to achieve a desired molten width. The power density q3 in the third region is adjusted so as to provide a sufficient amount of molten metal.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">However, in order to achieve a desired molten width by means only of the power density q2 in the second region, the power density q2 has to be increased to a considerable extent. There is usually a limit to the total output power of a laser beam due to the design of a laser. For a widened beam radiation area, a large output power is required to heat the entire beam radiation area. Accordingly, in order to increase the power density q2 in the second region, it is necessary to reduce the power density q3 in the third region. This makes the difference large between the power density q2 in the second region and the power density q3 in the third region. Such a large difference in the power densities renders a melt pool unstable, thereby causing a spatter, for example.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In contrast, in the manufacturing method according to one embodiment of the present disclosure, the radiation region of the laser beam <b>1</b> is divided into four regions having respective power densities.

In a case where the sum of the widths of the first region <b>11</b> to the fourth region <b>14</b> is greater than five times a gap between the first steel plate <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the second steel plate <b>2</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to form a wide molten width and thus to further broaden the permissible range of a gap and the permissible range of deviation of the radiation position.

Effects</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the above-described manufacturing method, formation of a gradual power density distribution is facilitated across the beam radiation area while a beam radiation area is increased. Thus, it is possible to sufficiently join steel plates regardless of a gap between the steel plates or deviation of the radiation position. This also improves the quality of welding.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Especially, in a case where the thickness of a first steel plate and the thickness of a second steel plate are different, deviation of a radiation position may prevent sufficient joining of the steel plates as described above. However, according to the above-described manufacturing method, formation of a gradual power density distribution is facilitated across the beam radiation area while a wide beam radiation area is provided. Thus, it is possible to achieve a relatively wide molten width. As a result, the steel plates can be sufficiently joined regardless of deviation of a radiation position.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, zinc plated steel plates, when melted, produce zinc vapor since the boiling point of zinc is lower than the melting point of steel plates. As a laser beam is scanned on steel plates, the steel plates are irradiated first with the outer radiation region of the laser beam and then with the inner radiation region, and thereby the temperature of the steel plates increases. In a case, for example, where there are only three radiation regions, the difference in the power densities of the second region and the third region increases as described above, thereby causing a rapid temperature change to the zinc plated steel plates. As a result, steam of zinc is suddenly produced, blowing molten metal, for example, and thereby making a hot liquid (specifically, a molten material) more likely to be unstable.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">However, the above-described manufacturing method enables a gradual power density distribution to be formed between radiation regions, thereby enabling a gradual increase in the temperature of zinc plated steel plates as scanning of a laser beam proceeds. Accordingly, zinc plating is first vaporized and removed before energy necessary to melt steel plates is introduced. Thus, the aforementioned manufacturing method can also inhibit the above-described destabilization of liquid which is specific to zinc plated steel plates.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">3.
