In particular, the present invention concerns the treatment of operable HER2-positive early breast cancer (eBC) by adjuvant administration of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It also concerns an article of manufacture comprising a vial with pertuzumab therein and a package insert providing instructions for adjuvant administration of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy to treat HER2-positive early breast cancer and compositions for use in the methods herein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Members of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important mediators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. The receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, or HER1), HER2 (ErbB2 or p185<sup>neu</sup>), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2). Members of the receptor family have been implicated in various types of human malignancy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A recombinant humanized version of the murine anti-HER2 antibody 4D5 (huMAb4D5-8, rhuMAb HER2, trastuzumab or HERCEPTN&#xae;; U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337) is clinically active in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti-cancer therapy (Baselga et al., <i>J. Clin. Oncol. </i>14:737-744 (1996)).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Trastuzumab received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration Sep. 25, 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. At present, trastuzumab is approved for use as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or hormone therapy in the metastatic setting, and as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab-based therapy is now the recommended treatment for patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer who do not have contraindications for its use (HERCEPTIN&#xae; prescribing information; NCCN Guidelines, version 2.2011). Trastuzumab plus docetaxel (or paclitaxel) is a registered standard of care in the first-line metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatment setting (Slamon et al. N Engl J Med. 2001; 344(11):783-792; Marty et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23(19):4265-4274).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patients treated with the HER2 antibody trastuzumab are selected for therapy based on HER2 expression. See, for example, WO99/31140 (Paton et al.), US2003/0170234A1 (Hellmann, S.), and US2003/0147884 (Paton et al.); as well as WO01/89566, US2002/0064785, and US2003/0134344 (Mass et al.). See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,573,043, 6,905,830, and US2003/0152987, Cohen et al., concerning immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for detecting HER2 overexpression and amplification. Thus, the optimal management of metastatic breast cancer now takes into account not only a patient's general condition, medical history, and receptor status, but also the HER2 status.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Pertuzumab (also known as recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody 2C4 (rhuMAb 2C4); Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco) represents the first in a new class of agents known as HER dimerization inhibitors (HDI) and functions to inhibit the ability of HER2 to form active heterodimers or homodimers with other HER receptors (such as EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4). See, for example, Harari and Yarden <i>Oncogene </i>19:6102-14 (2000); Yarden and Sliwkowski. <i>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol </i>2:127-37 (2001); Sliwkowski <i>Nat Struct Biol </i>10:158-9 (2003); Cho et al. <i>Nature </i>421:756-60 (2003); and Malik et al. <i>Pro Am Soc Cancer Res </i>44:176-7 (2003).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Pertuzumab blockade of the formation of HER2-HER3 heterodimers in tumor cells has been demonstrated to inhibit critical cell signaling, which results in reduced tumor proliferation and survival (Agus et al. <i>Cancer Cell </i>2:127-37 (2002)).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Pertuzumab has undergone testing as a single agent in the clinic with a phase Ia trial in patients with advanced cancers and phase II trials in patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer as well as lung and prostate cancer. In a Phase I study, patients with incurable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard therapy were treated with pertuzumab given intravenously every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab was generally well tolerated. Tumor regression was achieved in 3 of 20 patients evaluable for response. Two patients had confirmed partial responses. Stable disease lasting for more than 2.5 months was observed in 6 of 21 patients (Agus et al. <i>Pro Am Soc Clin Oncol </i>22:192 (2003)). At doses of 2.0-15 mg/kg, the pharmacokinetics of pertuzumab was linear, and mean clearance ranged from 2.69 to 3.74 mL/day/kg and the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 15.3 to 27.6 days. Antibodies to pertuzumab were not detected (Allison et al. <i>Pro Am Soc Clin Oncol </i>22:197 (2003)).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">US 2006/0034842 describes methods for treating ErbB-expressing cancer with anti-ErbB2 antibody combinations. US 2008/0102069 describes the use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic cancer, such as breast cancer. Baselga et al., <i>J Clin Oncol, </i>2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part I, Col. 25, No. 18S (June 20 Supplement), 2007:1004 report the treatment of patients with pre-treated HER2-positive breast cancer, which has progressed during treatment with trastuzumab, with a combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

Vol. 25, No. 18S (June 20 Supplement), 2007:1028 evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab+pertuzumab combination therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, who had progressive disease on trastuzumab-based therapy. The authors concluded that further evaluation of the efficacy of combination treatment was required to define the overall risk and benefit of this treatment regimen.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Pertuzumab has been evaluated in Phase II studies in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have previously received trastuzumab for metastatic disease. One study, conducted by the National cancer Institute (NCI), enrolled 11 patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Two out of the 11 patients exhibited a partial response (PR) (Baselga et al., <i>J Clin Oncol </i>2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings; 25:18S (June 20 Supplement): 1004).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The results of a Phase II neoadjuvant study evaluating the effect of a novel combination regimen of pertuzumab and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (docetaxel) in women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, presented at the CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), Dec. 8-12, 2010, showed that the two HER2 antibodies plus docetaxel given in the neoadjuvant setting prior to surgery significantly improved the rate of complete tumor disappearance (pathological complete response rate, pCR, of 45.8 percent) in the breast by more than half compared to trastuzumab plus docetaxel (pCR of 29. 0 percent), p=0.014.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Clinical Evaluation of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) Phase II clinical study assessed the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as first-line treatment for patients with locally recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, when used as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, significantly prolonged progression-free survival, with no increase in cardiac toxic effects.

For the purposes of the clinical trial described in the example, overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization of patient population to the date of death from any cause.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x201c;Progression free survival&#x201d; or &#x201c;PFS&#x201d; refers to the patient remaining alive, without the cancer progressing or getting worse. For the purpose of the clinical trial described in the example, progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization of study population to the first documented progressive disease, or unmanageable toxicity, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression can be documented by any clinically accepted methods, such as, for example, radiographical progressive disease, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Therasse et al., <i>J Natl Ca Inst </i>2000; 92(3):205-216), carcinomatous meningitis diagnosed by cytologic evaluation of cerebral spinal fluid, and/or medical photography to monitor chest wall recurrences of subcutaneous lesions.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">&#x201c;Disease free survival&#x201d; or &#x201c;DFS&#x201d; refers to the patient remaining alive, without return of the cancer, for a defined period of time such as about 1 year, about 2 years, about 3 years, about 4 years, about 5 years, about 10 years, etc., from initiation of treatment or from initial diagnosis. In the studies underlying the present invention, DFS was analyzed according to the intent-to-treat principle, ie, patients were evaluated on the basis of their assigned therapy. The events used in the analysis of DFS typically include local, regional and distant recurrence of cancer, occurrence of secondary cancer, death from any cause in patients without a prior event (breast cancer recurrence or second primary cancer).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">&#x201c;Invasive Disease-Free Survival&#x201d; of &#x201c;IDFS&#x201d;, as defined herein is the time a patient lives without return of invasive breast cancer at any site or death from any cause after adjuvant treatment. In other words, IDFS is defined as the patient remaining alive (surviving) without return of invasive disease after adjuvant treatment for a defined period of time, such as about 1 year, about 2 years, about 3 years, about 4 years, about 5 years, about 10 years, etc., from initiation of treatment or from initial diagnosis. In one embodiment, IDFS is at about 1 year, or about 3 years, from initiation of treatment.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">By &#x201c;extending survival&#x201d; is meant increasing overall or progression free survival in a patient treated in accordance with the present invention relative to an untreated patient and/or relative to a patient treated with one or more approved anti-tumor agents, but not receiving treatment in accordance with the present invention. In a particular example, &#x201c;extending survival&#x201d; means extending progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) of cancer patients receiving the combination therapy of the present invention (e.g. treatment with a combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and a chemotherapy) relative to patients treated with trastuzumab and the chemotherapy only. In another particular example, &#x201c;extending survival&#x201d; means extending progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) of cancer patients receiving the combination therapy of the present invention (e.g. treatment with a combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and a chemotherapy) relative to patients treated with pertuzumab and the chemotherapy only.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">An &#x201c;objective response&#x201d; refers to a measurable response, including complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">By &#x201c;complete response&#x201d; or &#x201c;CR&#x201d; is intended the disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment.

The HER receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an HER ligand and/or dimerize with another HER receptor molecule; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The HER receptor may be a &#x201c;native sequence&#x201d; HER receptor or an &#x201c;amino acid sequence variant&#x201d; thereof. Preferably the HER receptor is native sequence human HER receptor.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The expressions &#x201c;ErbB2&#x201d; and &#x201c;HER2&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and refer to human HER2 protein described, for example, in Semba et al., <i>PNAS </i>(USA) 82:6497-6501 (1985) and Yamamoto et al. <i>Nature </i>319:230-234 (1986) (Genebank accession number X03363). The term &#x201c;erbB2&#x201d; refers to the gene encoding human ErbB2 and &#x201c;neu&#x201d; refers to the gene encoding rat p185<sup>neu</sup>.

The amino acid sequence of HER2 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the extracellular domain of HER2 may comprise four domains: &#x201c;Domain I&#x201d; (amino acid residues from about 1-195; SEQ ID NO:1), &#x201c;Domain II&#x201d; (amino acid residues from about 196-319; SEQ ID NO:2), &#x201c;Domain III&#x201d; (amino acid residues from about 320-488: SEQ ID NO:3), and &#x201c;Domain IV&#x201d; (amino acid residues from about 489-630; SEQ ID NO:4) (residue numbering without signal peptide).

In one embodiment, the low HER3 cancer is epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. HER3 DNA, protein, and/or mRNA level in the cancer can be evaluated to determine whether the cancer is a low HER3 cancer. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,981,418 for additional information about low HER3 cancer. Optionally, a HER3 mRNA expression assay is performed in order to determine that the cancer is a low HER3 cancer. In one embodiment, HER3 mRNA level in the cancer is evaluated, e.g. using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), such as quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Optionally, the cancer expresses HER3 at a concentration ratio equal or lower than about 2.81 as assessed qRT-PCR, e.g. using a COBAS z480&#xae; instrument.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">A &#x201c;HER dimer&#x201d; herein is a noncovalently associated dimer comprising at least two HER receptors. Such complexes may form when a cell expressing two or more HER receptors is exposed to an HER ligand and can be isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described in Sliwkowski et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>269(20):14661-14665 (1994), for example. Other proteins, such as a cytokine receptor subunit (e.g. gp130) may be associated with the dimer.

HER2 antibodies of interest herein are pertuzumab and trastuzumab.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">&#x201c;HER activation&#x201d; refers to activation, or phosphorylation, of any one or more HER receptors. Generally, HER activation results in signal transduction (e.g. that caused by an intracellular kinase domain of a HER receptor phosphorylating tyrosine residues in the HER receptor or a substrate polypeptide). HER activation may be mediated by HER ligand binding to a HER dimer comprising the HER receptor of interest. HER ligand binding to a HER dimer may activate a kinase domain of one or more of the HER receptors in the dimer and thereby results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in one or more of the HER receptors and/or phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in additional substrate polypeptides(s), such as Akt or MAPK intracellular kinases.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">&#x201c;Phosphorylation&#x201d; refers to the addition of one or more phosphate group(s) to a protein, such as a HER receptor, or substrate thereof.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">An antibody which &#x201c;inhibits HER dimerization&#x201d; is an antibody which inhibits, or interferes with, formation of a HER dimer. Preferably, such an antibody binds to HER2 at the heterodimeric binding site thereof. The most preferred dimerization inhibiting antibody herein is pertuzumab or MAb 2C4. Other examples of antibodies which inhibit HER dimerization include antibodies which bind to EGFR and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors (for example EGFR monoclonal antibody 806, MAb 806, which binds to activated or &#x201c;untethered&#x201d; EGFR; see Johns et al., <i>J. Biol.

In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence.

Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Unless indicated otherwise, herein the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991), expressly incorporated herein by reference. The &#x201c;EU index as in Kabat&#x201d; refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A &#x201c;functional Fc region&#x201d; possesses an &#x201c;effector function&#x201d; of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary &#x201c;effector functions&#x201d; include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays as herein disclosed, for example.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A &#x201c;native sequence Fc region&#x201d; comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region (non-A and A allotypes); native sequence human IgG2 Fc region; native sequence human IgG3 Fc region; and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A &#x201c;variant Fc region&#x201d; comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, preferably one or more amino acid substitution(s). Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% homology therewith, more preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different &#x201c;classes&#x201d;. There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into Asubclasses@ (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;, &#x3b3;, and &#x3bc; respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A &#x201c;naked antibody&#x201d; is an antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous molecule, such as a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">An &#x201c;affinity matured&#x201d; antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art.

Adjuvant treatment may be given after definitive surgery, where no evidence of residual disease can be detected, so as to reduce the risk of disease recurrence. The goal of adjuvant therapy is to prevent recurrence of the cancer, and therefore to reduce the chance of cancer-related death.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">&#x201c;Definitive surgery&#x201d; refers to complete removal of tumor and surrounding tissue as well as any involved lymph nodes. Such surgery includes lumpectomy, mastectomy, such as total mastectomy plus axillary dissection, double mastectomy etc.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">&#x201c;Node-positive&#x201d; or &#x201c;lymph node positive&#x201d; breast cancer is breast cancer that has spread to the regional lymph nodes (usually those under the arm).

A subject's risk level can be determined by a skilled physician. Generally, such high risk subjects will have lymph node involvement (for example with 4 or more involved lymph nodes); however, subjects without lymph node involvement are also high risk, for example if their tumor is greater or equal to 2 cm.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">&#x201c;Progesterone receptor (PR) positive&#x201d; cancer is cancer which tests positive for expression of PR.

Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. HER receptor overexpression or amplification may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the HER protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC). Alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of HER-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g. via in situ hybridization (ISH), including fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see WO98/45479 published October, 1998) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH; see, e.g. Tanner et al., <i>Am. J. Pathol. </i>157(5): 1467-1472 (2000); Bella et al., <i>J. Clin. Oncol. </i>26: (May 20 suppl; abstr 22147) (2008)), southern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). One may also study HER receptor overexpression or amplification by measuring shed antigen (e.g., HER extracellular domain) in a biological fluid such as serum (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,294 issued Jun. 12, 1990; WO91/05264 published Apr. 18, 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,638 issued Mar. 28, 1995; and Sias et al. <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>132: 73-80 (1990)). Aside from the above assays, various in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g. a radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated, e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">A &#x201c;HER2-positive&#x201d; cancer comprises cancer cells which have higher than normal levels of HER2, such as HER2-positive breast cancer.

In order to screen for antibodies which bind essentially to the 2C4 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in <i>Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, </i>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Preferably the antibody blocks 2C4's binding to HER2 by about 50% or more. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds essentially to the 2C4 epitope of HER2. Epitope 2C4 comprises residues from Domain II (SEQ ID NO: 2) in the extracellular domain of HER2. 2C4 and pertuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 at the junction of domains I, II and III (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, and 3, respectively).

To screen for antibodies which bind essentially to the 4D5 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in <i>Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, </i>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds essentially to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 (e.g. any one or more residues in the region from about residue 529 to about residue 625, inclusive of the HER2 ECD, residue numbering including signal peptide).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">&#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures.

The effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. The effective amount may extend progression free survival (e.g. as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors, RECIST, or CA-125 changes), result in an objective response (including a partial response, PR, or complete response, CR), increase overall survival time, and/or improve one or more symptoms of cancer (e.g. as assessed by FOSI).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The term &#x201c;cytotoxic agent&#x201d; as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells.

Antibody and Chemotherapy Compositions</heading><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The HER2 antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be, e.g., a soluble form of the extracellular domain of a HER2 receptor or a portion thereof, containing the desired epitope. Alternatively, cells expressing HER2 at their cell surface (e.g. NIH-3T3 cells transformed to overexpress HER2; or a carcinoma cell line such as SK-BR-3 cells, see Stancovski et al. <i>PNAS </i>(USA) 88:8691-8695 (1991)) can be used to generate antibodies. Other forms of HER2 receptor useful for generating antibodies will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Various methods for making monoclonal antibodies herein are available in the art. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., <i>Nature, </i>256:495 (1975), by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The anti-HER2 antibodies used in accordance with the present invention, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, are commercially available.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">(i) Humanized Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as &#x201c;import&#x201d; residues, which are typically taken from an &#x201c;import&#x201d; variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., <i>Nature, </i>321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., <i>Nature, </i>332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., <i>Science, </i>239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called &#x201c;best-fit&#x201d; method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework region (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>151:2623 (1993)).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">U.S. Pat.

The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate 3-year IDFS percentages for each treatment group. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) between the two treatment groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 at a 5%, 2-sided significance level. A 3-year IDFS percentage of 89.2% was assumed for the placebo group on the basis of the findings of the BCIRG 006 study (NCT00021255). Under these assumptions approximately 379 IDFS events are required for the primary analysis of IDFS.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0284">Secondary efficacy endpoints include cardiac and overall safety, overall survival, disease free survival and health-related quality of life.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0285">Distant Recurrence-Free Interval (DRFI) is defined as the time between randomization and the date of distant breast cancer recurrence. Patients without distant disease recurrence at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of death or last known alive date. The definitive (final event-driven) OS analysis is planned when 640 deaths have occurred. The first interim analysis of OS is be made available at the time of the primary analysis of IDFS, with limited information compared to the definitive analysis. Two subsequent interim analysis will be performed. For regulatory purposes, the overall alpha-level will be controlled at 0.05 for the four OS analyses.

tumors, there were 71 (8.2%) IDFS events in the for pertuzumab arm 91 (10.6%) in the for placebo arm, leading to a hazard ratio of 0.76 (0.56-1.04; P=0.0847). The 3 year IDFS percentages were 92.8% in the pertuzumab arm and 91.2% in the placebo arm. The number of events was very low in patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumors (100 [6.5%] in the pertuzumab arm and 119 [7.7%] in the placebo arm), resulting in a hazard ratio of 0.86 (0.66-1.13) (P=0.2771). The 3 year IDFS percentages were 94.8% in the pertuzumab arm and 94.4% in the placebo arm.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0341">At the time of this primary endpoint analysis a first interim analysis for overall survival was performed, with 80 deaths in the pertuzumab arm and 89 deaths in the placebo arm. There was no significant treatment effect at this early point of time (hazard ratio 0.89; 95% CI 0.66-1.21; P=0.4673).</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">Cardiac Safety</heading><p id="p-0307" num="0342">Patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) were included in safety analyses by the treatment patients actually received. Patients who received pertuzumab for adjuvant treatment are in the pertuzumab safety analysis population group. Patients who received study medication but no pertuzumab are in the control safety analysis population group.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0343">Primary cardiac endpoint was severe congestive heart failure (CHF), defined as: heart failure NYHA Class III or IV and a drop in LVEF of at least 10 EF points from baseline and to below 50% or cardiac death. Cardiac death was prospectively defined by the APHINITY Cardiac Advisory Board (CAB).</p><p id="p-0309" num="0344">A secondary cardiac endpoint was defined as an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (NYHA Class II) significant drop in LVEF by MUGA scan or ECHO, confirmed by a second LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks showing also a significant drop OR as confirmed by the APHINITY CAB.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Discussion</heading><p id="p-0310" num="0345">The APHINITY study is a large, adequately powered, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical study. Treatment effect was homogenous throughout all subgroups; however, at this early time point of analysis it appeared best detectable in patient at higher risk of relapse due to lymph node involvement or negative hormone-receptor status. The safety profile of pertuzumab given for one year in this combination was favorable and no new safety signal was observed when compared to the safety reported in in the metastatic or neoadjuvant settings.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0346">Evaluation of patient benefit always has to relate the effect size with potential risks from side effects. A grade &#x2265;3 diarrhea occurred in an excess of 6.2% with the addition of pertuzumab and might be not sufficiently treatable with anti-diarrheic medication and lead therefore to treatment discontinuation. Nevertheless the overall treatment discontinuation rate was only 2.9% higher with pertuzumab compared to placebo. Most importantly no statistical difference could be detected with regard to cardiac toxicity despite the large number of patients. Assuming that type of cardiac toxicity of pertuzumab is comparable to the type induced by trastuzumab, most cardiac events will be observed already at the current time of analysis and late cardiac events will be infrequent. The cardiac safety of pertuzumab was already demonstrated in previous trials in the metastatic setting (Swain et al., Oncologist. 2013; 18(3):257-64) and even for simultaneous application with trastuzumab and epirubicin in the neoadjuvant setting (Schneeweiss et al., Ann. Oncol. 2013 24(9); 278-84).</p><p id="p-0312" num="0347">The importance of the finding of the APHINITY study goes beyond the application of pertuzumab as adjuvant treatment. This adjuvant study was also considered as a proof-of-concept for the surrogacy of pathological complete response (pCR) observed in neoadjuvant studies for long-term outcome. The NeoSphere study reported an increase of pCR rate from 29.0% after a 12 weeks treatment of docetaxel and trastuzumab to 45.8% after the same treatment but with the addition of pertuzumab (Gianni et al., Lancet Oncol. 2012 13(1):25-32). Corresponding 5-year progression-free survival rates were 81% (95% CI 71%-87%) without and 86% (95% CI 77%-91%) with pertuzumab; but the trial was not sufficiently powered to show statistical significant differences. Taking into account the stronger chemotherapy including a taxane and an anthracycline (or carboplatin), the effect size observed in the APHINITY study corresponds well to the reported neoadjuvant effect on reaching a pCR.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0348">In conclusion, the APHINITY trial demonstrates that pertuzumab significantly improves IDFS in patients with operable HER2-positive breast cancer when added to chemotherapy and trastuzumab and no new safety signals were identified. Although further aspects, such as the efficacy or longer or shorter durations of treatment, will need to be further explored, this trial represents a landmark for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive EBC.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0349">While certain embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only.
