They consist of a series of side-by-side floor slats that are all moved in one direction at the same time. This moves or conveys a load that rests on the floor slats. Then, a lesser number of floor slats is moved in the opposite direction, sliding underneath the load. This is commonly done in sets of three, or in other words, one third of the slats are moved in the opposite direction, in sequence, until all are returned to their initial position. Moving a lesser number of slats during the return sufficiently reduces friction between the slats and the load above, such that the load holds its position during the return. Then, the slats are moved again, all at the same time, to further carry the load, and so forth, with the sequence just described being repeated until the load is moved off the reciprocating floor slat conveyor. Systems of this kind are often installed in trailers for hauling and unloading bulk materials, although there are also many other kinds of applications, including stationary applications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The reciprocating floor slats are commonly made from extruded aluminum. However, there is a need and market for steel floor slats. Steel is a better material for floor slats compared to aluminum and would be better for use in the solid waste industry. Regardless of the material that is used to manufacture the slats (i.e., aluminum vs. steel), the space between individual slats (that are side-by-side each other in the installed conveyor) needs to be sealed. In the solid waste industry, for example, where aluminum slats have been used, the seals between slats can be the first thing to fail. The type of seal used for an aluminum slat does not translate for use in a steel slat for reasons relating to differences between aluminum and steel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The design disclosed here was created to fill the elongated space or &#x201c;gap&#x201d; between steel floor slats. The design solves a problem in that it enables the sealing of the elongated gap that is created between individual, roll-formed steel slats. Roll-forming is a different process relative to making extrusions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Floor slats that are extruded from aluminum can be made with nonuniform wall thicknesses that include elongated seal-holding grooves or recesses. These grooves or recesses can hold a gap-filling seal in place between aluminum slats that are arranged side-by-side across the width of the reciprocating floor conveyor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, as an example, which is labeled and acknowledged to be &#x201c;prior art,&#x201d; a conventional aluminum slat (shown in cross-sectional profile) is indicated at <b>1</b>. The slat <b>1</b> rests upon a bearing member <b>2</b>. The bearing member <b>2</b> is supported by a square subdeck member <b>3</b>. The gap-filling seal is indicated at <b>4</b>. As can be seen in this Figure, the seal <b>4</b> has an enlarged portion <b>5</b> that is captured by a recess <b>6</b> in the aluminum slat <b>1</b>. A split portion <b>7</b> of the seal fills the gap (indicated generally by arrow <b>8</b>), which prevents material from working through the gaps between individual slats as they move back-and-forth during operation of the conveyor (bear in mind that all of these components are elongated and extend lengthwise into the page).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aluminum can be extruded to the slat form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> with the seal-capturing recess <b>6</b>. This is not workable for steel floor stats that are roll-formed from harder and thicker steel alloys, because roll-forming has practical limitations that make it difficult to mimic what can be done (in terms of cross-sectional profile) in comparison to extruding aluminum.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A steel floor slat (that is roll-formed) is therefore likely to have a less complicated cross-sectional profile, relative to an extruded aluminum floor slat, with the steel slat's top and side surfaces having the same thickness throughout, resulting from a single steel strip being put through a roll-forming process that bends the steel into top and side sections. This creates a design problem for sealing the gaps between steel slats because, as indicated above, unlike extruded aluminum, it is not workable to roll-form steel with the kind of seal-holding pockets or recesses (i.e., reference number <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>) that have been used in the past to seal gaps between aluminum floor slats in reciprocating conveyors.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The design disclosed here makes roll-formed steel slats practical in typical markets where reciprocating floor slat conveyors are used and offers the advantage of using more-durable steel instead of aluminum, particularly when reciprocating floor slat conveyors are built into trailers (or the like) that are used to haul and unload abrasive materials. The design enables a simple steel slat profile to work in reciprocating floor slat conveyors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For use with a reciprocating floor slat conveyor that has reciprocating floor slats that are formed from steel, a gap filler that fills the space between side-by-side slats.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The slats in the conveyor will have a lengthwise gap between adjacent side-by-side steel slats that enables the slats to move together, or in reciprocating fashion, according to conventional operation of the conveyor. The gap filler includes an upper portion that extends upwardly into the lengthwise gap. A lower portion of the gap filler, connected to the upper portion as a single integrated piece, is wrapped around a lower side edge of one of the side-by-side steel slats.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lower portion of the gap filler is made to pinch the lower side edge or sidewall of the steel slat, in the manner described below. This enables the gap filler to be pre-installed on the roll-formed steel slat. During the assembly sequence that involves installing roll-formed steel slats side-by-side across a conveyor, the gap-filler's upper portion is initially elevated vertically relative to its final installation position, which enables the combination of steel slat and gap filler seal to be installed during the assembly of the reciprocating floor conveyor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Final installation involves pushing down the gap-filler's upper portion (or, in other words, pushing the gap-filler further downward into the gap between side-by-side floor slats). When this happens, the upper portion of the gap filler (in the gap between slats) shifts to close and seal the gap. At the same time, the lower portion of the gap filler is shaped to shift into place around the lower side edge or sidewall of the steel slat, thereby holding the gap filler in position between the floor slats as they subsequently move together, or move relative to each other, according to the operation of the reciprocating floor conveyor. As is described further below, this shifting movement (caused by pushing the gap filler downward) involves the lower portion of the gap filler having an angled surface that rotates to match a surface on the inside of the sidewall of the slat when the gap filler is pushed down. This serves to hold the gap filler in position so that it seals the floor slats properly during conveyor operation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The gap filler/slat configuration summarized above may ride on a slat bearing structure, with the slat bearing structure further supported by an elongated subdeck component or subdeck member. The subdeck member provides a vertical wall surface, in combination with underlying cross-member structures, that also helps to maintain the gap filler in position following the above-described gap filler installation. Because the gap filler design disclosed here may be used in connection with well-known reciprocating floor drive units, it is also known that locating the drive unit in the reciprocating floor slat conveyor system requires creating a length-wise gap along the length of the plurality of subdeck members that are commonly used in the floor slat conveyor system. In other words, the drive unit is installed in a &#x201c;window&#x201d; space that is not spanned by subdeck members that otherwise provide length-wise support for the reciprocating floor slats. In this window space, the drive connections between the drive unit and floor slats provide underlying support for the floor slats. However, because the subdeck members are missing in the window space, the just-described vertical wall surface of the subdeck member is also missing in the window space. To compensate in this specific region of the conveyor system, gap filler supports may be welded to certain parts of the drive unit, in the manner described later.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, it is possible to manufacture steel, roll-formed subdeck members in a manner so that steel subdeck members can be used to replace aluminum subdeck members. Aluminum subdecks are common in the industry, but in some situations, it might be desirable to replace them with steel. In such case, a steel subdeck member can be roll-formed into a shape that provides the same subdeck/vertical wall surface described above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Like the floor slats, the gap filler is likely to be elongated, although length of the gap filler is a variable. Near the end of the floor slat, however, the lower portion of the gap filler will be independently fastened to the floor slat, where hauled material drops off the conveyor system during the unloading process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The gap filler design disclosed here makes reciprocating steel floor slats viable for other hauling markets. For example, the combination of steel slat, gap filler, and steel subdeck may enable the hauling of heavier, high-impact materials. Supporting bearings, i.e., the components that rest on the subdeck and provide a sliding surface for the steel slats above, can be extruded as single-piece bearings (in lieu of two separate bearings) that are possibly installed on the subdeck at the same time as individual steel floor slats. This may provide certain advantages for the installer.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above summary will be better understood upon review of the following description which is to be read in conjunction with the illustrated details of the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The accompanying drawings are described as follows, wherein like parts indicate like parts throughout, except where the text indicates otherwise:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a series of side-by-side reciprocating floor slats;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged view of one floor slat of the overall floor slat configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a subdeck component of the floor slat configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of floor bearing components of the floor slat configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a &#x201c;gap filler&#x201d;

It is envisioned that the floor slat <b>10</b> will be made of formed steel having the shape illustrated in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each floor slat rests upon a pair of bearings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, which further rest upon a subdeck component, indicated generally at <b>16</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the floor slats are installed so that a small or narrow gap (at the position indicated by reference numeral <b>18</b>) will exist lengthwise between the sides <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of the slats. This gap is filled by the component (&#x201c;the gap filler&#x201d;) indicated generally at <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The narrow gap <b>18</b> between the floor slats is filled by an upper portion <b>26</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b>. The lower portion of the gap filler <b>24</b>, indicated generally by reference numeral <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, is wrapped around a lower side edge <b>30</b> of the steel floor slat (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Exemplary dimensions of the gap filler <b>24</b> are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. While these dimensions may vary, it is envisioned that they will be sized so that the lower portion <b>28</b> of the gap filler can snap-fit onto the lower side edge <b>30</b> of the steel floor slat. This would allow the gap filler to be preinstalled at the place of floor slat manufacture and then shipped, installed, to the end user.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the floor slats <b>10</b> are installed in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the upper portion <b>26</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b> vertically fills gap <b>18</b> and is captured in place. It is envisioned that the gap filler <b>24</b> can be made from different materials ranging from metal (aluminum, for example) or high-density plastic. This is an ongoing matter of development and test. High temperature UHMW plastic may be used for some hauling applications like asphalt, for example.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the subdeck component <b>16</b> previously described is illustrated as an aluminum extrusion. As an alternative, the subdeck component <b>16</b> could be made from rolled steel, which is illustrated at <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In all the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the pair of bearings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> (previously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is replaced by a single bearing illustrated at <b>34</b>. The single bearing <b>34</b> is shown as having two versions <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B. According to the embodiments illustrated here, one version (<b>34</b>A) is designed to have longitudinal grooves <b>36</b>, while the other (<b>34</b>B) lacks these specific grooves. Both versions (<b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B) of the single bearing <b>34</b> have a central channel <b>38</b>. In the embodiment that illustrates the roll formed steel subdeck <b>32</b>, the central channel <b>38</b> of the bearing <b>34</b> rests on top of an upwardly projecting portion <b>40</b> of the subdeck (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>). The bearing <b>34</b> is made of high density plastic or similar materials already known to be used in connection with making reciprocating floor conveyors.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The dimensions of the gap filler <b>24</b> provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are applicable to the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>19</b></figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, installation of the gap filler <b>24</b> will be described in greater detail.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the roll-formed steel floor slat <b>10</b> is shown according to the configuration it would take following the roll-forming process, which would be known in the art. While the steel thickness might vary, a steel thickness of 3 millimeters may be typical. The steel slat has a top portion <b>42</b>, opposite downwardly depending, vertical side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and inwardly bending lower side portions <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The inwardly bending lower side portions <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> define slants toward the center line of the slat <b>10</b>. The opposite edges <b>49</b>, <b>51</b> of these side portions are spaced a certain distance apart and create an open width on the bottom of the slat <b>10</b>. This width opens into the hollow space created by the slat's various walls <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, just described.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The vertical side portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the steel floor slat <b>10</b> define the &#x201c;gap&#x201d; between the various steel slats <b>10</b> when installed as part of the reciprocating floor conveyor system. As is further described below, the inwardly bending side portions <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> provide surfaces for connecting the lower portion <b>28</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b> to the steel slat <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The left-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the gap filler <b>24</b> about to be connected to the slat <b>10</b>. The right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the gap filler <b>24</b> attached to the slat <b>10</b>. There, the lower portion <b>28</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b> is wrapped around the slat's inwardly bending portion <b>50</b>, with the slat's vertical side portion <b>46</b> being captured by the flex in the gap filler <b>24</b>, which pinches slat side portion <b>46</b> generally at the points indicated by arrows <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, respectively. The gap filler dimensions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are sized to pinch a 3 millimeter steel slat, although these dimensions could be changed for different installation configurations.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the right-hand side of the Figure shows how the slat/gap filler combination might be provided to an installer prior to installation of the slat/gap filler in a reciprocating floor conveyor system. It should be noted from the Figure that the vertical elevation of the gap filler's upper portion <b>26</b> at the top point (see reference numeral <b>56</b>) is close to the plane of the slat's load-bearing surface (reference numeral <b>58</b>). There is also a space, indicated generally by arrow <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, that is present between steel slat edge surface <b>62</b> and gap filler surface <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates the same gap filler configuration described above, but with the steel slat <b>10</b> resting on the bearing <b>34</b> and steel subdeck <b>32</b>, side-by-side with the same slat/bearing/subdeck combination to the immediate right. This is illustrative of the position of the gap filler <b>24</b> during floor slat installation. It should be noted that, at this point, a narrow gap (indicated by arrow <b>61</b>) still exists between the outside surface <b>63</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b> and the outside surface <b>65</b> of the slat's sidewall <b>44</b>. Then, the installer pushes down (see arrow <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) on the top <b>56</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b> to shift (some could call it a type of snap fit) the gap filler to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. There, the vertical elevation of the gap filler's upper portion <b>26</b> at the top point <b>56</b> is pushed down below the plane of the slat's load-bearing surface <b>58</b> and shifts slightly laterally to contact the side of the adjacent slat (see reference numeral <b>67</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>), thereby closing the narrow gap <b>61</b> described above; the previously described &#x201c;pinch&#x201d; between points <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> on the slat's side <b>46</b> moves down to the approximate location of the bend between the slat's side <b>46</b> and inwardly bending portion <b>50</b>; and gap filler surface <b>64</b> rotates and shifts slightly so that surface <b>64</b> rests directly against slat surface <b>62</b> in lieu of the previously described space <b>60</b>. This also creates a new space at the location indicated by arrow <b>68</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The angle of gap filler surface <b>64</b> (which could be called a positioning angle) and other gap filler dimensions are selected so that surface <b>64</b> matches the angle of slat edge surface <b>62</b> after the shift (caused by the installer pushing the gap filler's upper portion <b>26</b> downwardly). Matching the angles of these surfaces keeps the upper portion <b>26</b> of the gap filler sealing the gap properly (between adjacent slats). As indicated above, gap filler specifications are described in detail directly on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As indicated in the Figure, the positioning angle on the gap filler <b>24</b> illustrated there is 37 degrees on a non-attached gap filler. These dimensions could vary if other variations are made to other components.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> illustrate the above gap filler installation for the aluminum subdeck configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a counterpart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a counterpart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>), while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref> illustrate the same installation but with fixed side slats <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> that would be (typically) next to the bottom wall of a trailer, one on each side. The trailer is not illustrated, but a person skilled in the art would recognize that these Figures are representative of a larger number of slats that span the distance, from side-to-side, within the trailer's walls, which is typical for reciprocating floor slat systems. The number of slats is usually defined by installation application.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates an end cap installation for steel slat <b>10</b>. It is well understood how bulk materials exit a reciprocating floor slat conveyor. In the present configuration, an end cap <b>74</b> has a portion <b>76</b> that is inserted into the end <b>78</b> of the slat <b>10</b> (there would be no bearing structure at that location). The end cap <b>74</b> is held in place by fasteners <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. A series of over-sized openings (indicated generally at <b>84</b>) in the lower portion <b>28</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b> at this end location enables rivet fasteners <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> to secure the gap filler <b>24</b> to the slat <b>10</b> at the end location only. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows the final end cap installation in cross-section.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Finally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the single-piece bearing <b>34</b> described above is made to snap fit around subdeck lateral edges <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>. The bearing <b>34</b> can flex at locations <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> so that bearing portions <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> are captured in place by subdeck lateral edges <b>90</b>,<b>92</b>. This is the same for the steel subdeck configuration <b>32</b> previously described (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>). The single-piece bearing <b>34</b> is otherwise captured within the perimeter or envelope defined by the top and side walls <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> of the steel slat <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The side-to-side width of the bearing <b>34</b> is less than the width between the opposite edges <b>49</b>, <b>51</b> of the slat lower side portions <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> that were previously described above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, for example). Generally speaking, the side-to-side width of the bearing <b>34</b> is the distance between arrows <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. The idea is to create a bearing width within the envelope of the hollow slat <b>10</b> that is too wide for the bearing to be easily removed through the lower side of the slat. What this means is that the plurality of bearings <b>34</b> that will be used for a typical conveyor installation may be inserted end-wise into the hollow slat <b>10</b>. In such case, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the combination of slat <b>10</b> and bearing <b>34</b> may then be installed onto the underlying subdeck structure (whether it be aluminum or steel) at the same time by snap-fitting the bearing onto the subdeck (while it is inside the slat <b>10</b>) and then later securing individual slats <b>10</b> to conveyor drive structure (not shown in the drawings). The conveyor drive structure for reciprocating floor slat conveyors is well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the subdeck component or subdeck member <b>16</b> has a vertical sidewall <b>110</b>. After the gap filler <b>24</b> is installed, this vertical sidewall <b>110</b> may serve as a &#x201c;stop&#x201d; to lateral movement of the gap filler <b>24</b>, while the upper surface <b>112</b> (of the underlying cross-member <b>114</b>) stops downward movement (of the gap filler <b>24</b>). By way of additional explanation, forces that continually act on the gap filler <b>24</b> caused by the load on the reciprocating floor slats <b>10</b> may tend to push the upper part or portion <b>26</b> of the gap filler <b>24</b> downward between adjacent floor slats <b>10</b>. This, in turn, may tend to push the lower portion <b>28</b> of the gap filler laterally and/or downwardly. This potential lateral/downward movement is constrained or stopped by vertical sidewall <b>110</b> and upper surface <b>112</b> (on the subdeck member <b>16</b> and cross-member <b>114</b>, respectively).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As a person familiar with reciprocating floor systems would know, these systems are typically driven by three-cylinder hydraulic drive units. The top side of an exemplary drive unit is illustrated generally at <b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. The drive unit <b>116</b> typically has three cross-drives (illustrated at <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>), with each one carrying its own set of drive shoes. The drive shoes connect the hydraulic cylinders to the reciprocating floor slats. For example, reference <b>124</b> illustrates one set of drive shoes that would correspond to one of the cross-drives just described, with that particular set driving one-third of the floor slats in the conveyor system. Reference <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> generally indicates the location of the hydraulic drive cylinders.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">These details would be familiar to the person having knowledge of reciprocating floor systems. That person would also know that the drive unit requires a &#x201c;window&#x201d; in the subdeck components or members <b>16</b> previously described (and in underlying subdeck support structure) in order to provide a space in the reciprocating floor system to connect drive unit shoes <b>124</b> to the plurality of floor slats in the system. In this window space or region, there is no underlying subdeck <b>16</b> or cross-member or cross-support <b>114</b> structures like those illustrated and described relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In order to provide the same kind of gap filler physical constraints (as surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>) within the drive unit's operating area, gap filler supports <b>128</b> are welded or otherwise connected to the sides <b>130</b> of each drive shoe <b>124</b>. This is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. Directing attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, the gap filler support <b>128</b> has surfaces <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> that provide the same constraining function as surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, but in the drive unit region.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Generally indicated at <b>136</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>29</b></figref> is another embodiment of a roll-formed steel subdeck. In this embodiment, the subdeck has an outer surface <b>138</b> that provides the same constraining function as surface <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. The roll-formed embodiment <b>136</b> otherwise has two leg portions <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> that rest upon a cross-support surface <b>144</b>. Each roll-formed leg <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> is hollow in that the legs are defined by vertical inner sidewalls <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and bent outer sidewalls <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>. The legs <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> further have outer bent portions <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> that capture the single slat bearing structure <b>34</b> previously described.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is to be understood that the design is under development and test and may change as the design is further developed. As an example, while the gap filler seal described above is intended to make steel slats a commercially viable design in the marketplace, it may later prove to work for aluminum slat configurations.
