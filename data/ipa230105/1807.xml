European Patent Application No. 21183673.9, filed on Jul. 5, 2021, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure invention relates to an electric vehicle charging plug and a charger comprising such charging plug.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the most common failures of an electric vehicle charging plug is cracking of its housing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It usually happens due to mechanical shock, for example due to dropping a plug by a user or running</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">a wheel of a car over a plug lying on the ground. A mechanical damage of a plug might have different degrees starting from microcracks and ending on a substantial destruction of the plug housing. In all cases, the destruction of the integrity of the plug entails the appearance of a security risk to the user. In particular, small cracks that can cause loss of electrical insulation of the device, which are so small that they may go unnoticed by the user, can be very dangerous. Such a defect may cause a significant risk of electric shock to the user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">From Korean patent application KR20170093269 there is known a power plug for charging an electric vehicle comprising a plug portion including a plurality of circular plug pins configured to be inserted into a power outlet and a sensor disposed adjacent to the plug portion arranged to sense heat of the plug portion. Furthermore, the power plug comprises a housing for gripping the plug portion and supporting the sensor therein and a cable having one end thereof inserted into the housing and having a wire inside connected to the plug portion and a portion of the outer circumferential surface thereof fixed to the housing. The Korean application raises the problem of preventing electric shock and fire by using the temperature sensor arranged to detect threshold values associated with currents causing possible damage of the plug. KR20170093269 is silent about detecting cracks in the housing of the plug.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">From PCT patent application WO2018192805 there is known a charging connector for a motor vehicle comprising a connection module and a load contact module. The connection module is arranged to be connected to supply lines for supplying power. The load contact module includes a load contact for transmitting a charging power. The load contact module is arranged to be removably and replaceably secured to the connection module. Further the load contact module includes a temperature sensor. Likewise the above-mentioned Korean application WO2018192805 focuses on the overheating problem occurring in EV charging plugs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO2018105809A1 discloses a portable charger for an electric car comprising a plug arranged to be connected to a power source and a control box connected to the plug. Further the plug comprises a bipolar plug pin, a neutral pole plug pin, a first temperature sensor installed adjacent to the positive electrode plug pin and a second temperature sensor disposed adjacent to the neutral pole plug pin. The control box is configured to receive signals from the first temperature sensor and the second temperature sensor and based on a calculated difference in those signal values decrease or stop transmission of current from the power source to the electric car. The PCT disclosure aims in improving continuity of charging by eliminating a problem of false signals deriving from using only one temperature sensor. It also solves a possible plug overheating problem and controlling current values transmitted to the car.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">DE102018120057 discloses a temperature measuring instrument having a panel-shaped cover element made of a ceramic material i.e. alumina-ceramic substrate, or plastic, a carrier element and a temperature measuring unit comprising conductive strips. The carrier element is a glass-fiber reinforced printed circuit board. Further, the conductive strips may be arranged on the carrier element or between the carrier element and the cover element. The carrier and cover elements are operatively connected with each other such that a connection of the carrier and cover elements is carried out through a glass solder. The carrier element is provided with recesses that are formed for retaining plug-in units within a region of a plug connector, wherein a material thickness of the carrier element amounts to 0.15-5 mm. Copper spring-loaded contacts are positioned within a region of the recesses. The German application aims at providing a temperature measuring instrument for plug connectors which is simple in construction and enables temperature measurement on site, i.e. in the area of the plug connector/mating connector parts connected to one another, precisely. As a result it solves the problem of overheating of a charger during a charging process.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">US2019126764A1 discloses an electric vehicle charging plug comprising a housing for accommodating power contacts, power contacts for power transmission, a cooling system and an apparatus for detecting liquid leaking from the cooling system and collecting inside the housing. The apparatus for detecting a liquid has at least one detector element having a conductor track structure. The detector element is arranged in an interior of the housing and the conductor track structure forms a detection face for detecting the liquid. The US application raises the problem of a charging plug damage caused by leaks from the cooling system resulting in possible injury of a charger operator. For this reason it proposes the apparatus for detecting a liquid leaking but it is silent about detecting cracks in the housing of the plug.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The solutions known in the prior art mainly focus on the problem of preventing the plug damage due to overheating of the plug. Neither of the aforementioned documents addresses the issue of lack of continuous monitoring of mechanical integrity status of a plug's housing, and a resulting increased risk of user electric shock and subsequent fire of the plug as well as reduction of its usage efficiency. Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a charging plug solving these problems and having additional advantages disclosed in this application.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The object of the invention is an electric vehicle charging plug comprising a housing for connecting to an electric vehicle, a main housing, a sensor comprising at least one conductive path embedded in a wall or arranged on the surface of the housing for connecting to an electric vehicle or the main housing, and a control unit, wherein the sensor is configured to detect the crack of the housing for connecting to an electric vehicle and/or the main housing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The electric vehicle charging plug according to the invention ensures possibility of continuously monitoring of a mechanical integrity status of the plug's housing (herein understood as a housing connecting to an electric vehicle and/or a main housing) and thereby preventing its users from electric shock.

The foil with the electric conductive paths <b>5</b> is placed in a molding tool in a way in which the electric conductive paths <b>5</b> are exposed directly to melted plastic injected in an injection molding process.
