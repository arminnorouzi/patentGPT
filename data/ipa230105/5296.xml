Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">JP2006-315305A discloses a management system that manages entering and exiting of an event venue by a visitor and entering and exiting of a booth provided in the venue. The management system receives an input of personal information from the visitor, images a face of the visitor by a camera, and prints a visitor card used as an ID card of the visitor by a printer. The personal information input by the visitor is a name, a department, and the like. For example, the department is a name of an organization such as a company in which the visitor works. The name, the department, and a face photo of the visitor and a two-dimensional code are printed on the visitor card. The two-dimensional code is information in which the input name and department of the visitor are coded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A scanner is installed near each booth in the event venue and near an exit. The number of users of each booth and the number of exiting persons are counted by causing the visitor to read the two-dimensional code of the visitor card by the scanner before using the booth and before exiting.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the management system in JP2006-315305A, the number of entering and exiting persons of the event venue and the number of users of each booth are counted in real time. In a case where the management system in JP2006-315305A is used, an event organizer can collect behavior information of the visitor indicating which booth the visitor stops by. In addition, since the name, the department, and the like of the visitor are also collected, an approximate attribute of the visitor such as a sex and the department of the visitor can be perceived based on such information. Thus, for example, what kind of attribute and preference a person has can be perceived based on the collected behavior information.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As illustrated by the visitor to the event venue, perceiving a behavior of a participant in accordance with an approximate attribute of the participant participating in an event is more useful for an organizer of the event, compared to a case of simply perceiving the behavior of the participant from the number of persons. For example, in a case of using the collected behavior information of the participant for marketing or the like, the collected behavior information is considered to be more useful in a case where an approximate attribute of the participant can be perceived.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, in the management system in JP2006-315305A, in a procedure of issuing the visitor card, the visitor that is an example of the participant needs to input the personal information including the name and the department at the time of entering. An input procedure of the personal information such as the name is a cause of extending a time for reception processing at the time of entering. Thus, the organizer of the event desires the input procedure to be as simple as possible. In addition, from a standpoint of a participant side, there is also a person who feels that the input procedure of the personal information such as the name is cumbersome, or feels reluctant to submit the personal information such as the name. An increase in the number of persons who hesitate about participating in the event or avoid the event for such a reason is not preferable for an organizer side of the event.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are various types of events. While there is an event that needs strict participant management such that personal information has to be collected to an extent in which an individual participant can be specified, there is also an event that does not need strict participant management. For example, the event that does not need strict participant management is an event that requires the minimum participant management required for crime prevention such as a measure for a suspicious person, but does not need collection of the name and the like with which an individual person can be specified.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, even in a case where the event does not need strict participant management, information representing an approximate attribute of the visitor such as a sex and an age is useful for marketing or the like and thus, is useful information for the organizer of the event. Thus, the organizer side of the event has a strong desire to collect information representing an approximate attribute of the participant even in a case where the name and the department are not known.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment according to the disclosed technology provides an information management system, an information management method, and a program that can collect behavior information of a participant while reducing an input procedure of personal information by the participant participating in an event compared to the related art.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect according to the disclosed technology, an information management system is an information management system comprising a reception device including a camera that images a face of a participant participating in an event, and an information management apparatus that is communicably connected to the reception device and manages information about the participant, in which the information management apparatus includes at least one first processor, and the first processor is configured to receive an issuing request transmitted from the reception device for a digital key assigned to each participant, issue the digital key independently of personal information of the participant, transmit the issued digital key to the reception device, in a case where the reception device outputs an ID image of the participant that includes a face image representing the face of the participant imaged by the reception device and the digital key received by the reception device and is issued for each participant, acquire the face image from the reception device, store the face image and the digital key in a storage portion in association with each other, and in a case where information including the digital key is received from a plurality of reading devices that are installed in an event venue and read the digital key included in the ID image, store the received information in the storage portion in association with the digital key as behavior information representing a behavior of the participant in the event venue.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A second aspect according to the disclosed technology is the information management system according to the first aspect, in which the reception device includes at least one second processor, and the second processor is configured to create the ID image by combining the face image of the participant with a template image, and output the ID image.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A third aspect according to the disclosed technology is the information management system according to the second aspect, in which the second processor is configured to output the ID image to a printer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A fourth aspect according to the disclosed technology is the information management system according to the third aspect, in which the reception device includes a digital camera including a

aspect according to the disclosed technology is the information management system according to any one of the first to sixth aspects, in which the first processor is configured to count behavior information of a plurality of participants and output a counted counting result.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An eighth aspect according to the disclosed technology is the information management system according to the seventh aspect, in which the first processor is configured to output a counting result including the face image as the counting result.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A ninth aspect according to the disclosed technology is the information management system according to any one of the first to seventh aspects, in which the first processor is configured to receive a distribution request including the digital key from the participant and distribute the behavior information of the participant corresponding to the digital key.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A tenth aspect according to the disclosed technology is the information management system according to any one of the first to ninth aspects, in which the first processor is configured to, in a case where the information including the digital key is received from the reading device, request a surveillance camera arranged near the reading device to transmit surveillance data, receive the surveillance data from the surveillance camera, detect a face image from the surveillance data, determine whether or not a person who has operated the reading device and the participant associated with the digital key

id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as an example, an information management system <b>2</b> comprises a reception device <b>10</b> and an information management apparatus <b>11</b>. For example, the reception device <b>10</b> is installed on a reception counter of an event venue. For example, the reception device <b>10</b> includes a digital camera <b>30</b> including a printer, a touch panel display <b>19</b>, and a speaker <b>12</b> incorporated in the touch panel display <b>19</b>. The touch panel display <b>19</b> and the speaker <b>12</b> provides a guide for a method of creating an identification data (ID) card <b>15</b> to a participant <b>13</b> of an event who has visited the reception counter, through a video and voice. Here, the participant <b>13</b> includes a visitor to the event venue.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The ID card <b>15</b> is a participant identification for identifying the participant <b>13</b> participating in the event and is a card to be carried by the participant <b>13</b> during at least participation in the event. The ID card <b>15</b> is created for each participant <b>13</b> in entering the event venue. A face image <b>14</b> of the participant <b>13</b> is printed on the ID card <b>15</b>. The ID card <b>15</b> is not only used as the participant identification but also used for collecting behavior information of the participant <b>13</b> as will be described later.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer has a camera function of imaging a face of the participant <b>13</b> and a printing function of printing the face image <b>14</b> including the imaged face. For example, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer is an instant camera that has a printing function enabling instant printing of an image (captured image) acquired by performing imaging. By the printing function, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer instantaneously issues the ID card <b>15</b> on which the face image <b>14</b> of the participant <b>13</b> is printed, at the time of reception in entering the event venue by the participant <b>13</b>. In addition, in the present example, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer comprises a control function of controlling the touch panel display <b>19</b> and the speaker <b>12</b> and a communication function with the information management apparatus <b>11</b> and functions as a main portion of the reception device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">After the face image <b>14</b> of the participant <b>13</b> is acquired, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer included in the reception device <b>10</b> requests the information management apparatus <b>11</b> to issue a digital key. The digital key is identification information of the participant <b>13</b> that is issued independently of personal information of the participant <b>13</b> and is assigned for each participant <b>13</b>. The digital key is management information, described later, for perceiving the behavior information of each participant <b>13</b>. In the present example, the digital key is a reference number assigned to each participant <b>13</b> in order of visitors of the participants <b>13</b>. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a four-digit number such as a digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d; is the digital key assigned to one participant <b>13</b>. Such a digital key is assigned for each participant <b>13</b>. The information management apparatus <b>11</b> transmits the issued digital key to the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer prints an ID image of the participant <b>13</b> on an instant film <b>16</b> and outputs the instant film <b>16</b> on which the ID image is printed as the ID card <b>15</b>. The ID image is an image including the face image <b>14</b> and the digital key issued from the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. In the present example, the digital key is coded and included in the ID image in the form of a two-dimensional code <b>18</b>. The image including the face image <b>14</b> and the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> is printed on the instant film <b>16</b> as the ID image. For example, a QR code (registered trademark) is employed as the two-dimensional code <b>18</b>. In addition, the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> includes not only the digital key but also a form in which a uniform resource locator (URL) or the like for referring to a my page screen <b>96</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) described later is coded.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer transmits the acquired (captured) face image <b>14</b> and the digital key corresponding to the face image <b>14</b> to the information management apparatus <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The information management apparatus <b>11</b> is communicably connected to the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer of the reception device <b>10</b>. For example, the information management apparatus <b>11</b> is a desktop personal computer, and the personal computer is comprised in a management booth of the event venue. The information management apparatus <b>11</b> receives a request to issue the digital key from the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer and issues the digital key. In addition, the information management apparatus <b>11</b> receives the face image <b>14</b> and the digital key corresponding to the face image <b>14</b> transmitted from the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer. The information management apparatus <b>11</b> stores the received face image <b>14</b> and the digital key in a database <b>20</b> in association with each other.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the participant <b>13</b> attaches the ID card <b>15</b> to a neck strap <b>17</b> and moves in the event venue in a state where the ID card <b>15</b> is hung from a neck. A plurality of scanners <b>24</b> are installed in main locations in the event venue. The scanner <b>24</b> is a device for collecting the behavior information representing a behavior of the participant <b>13</b> in the event venue. The information management apparatus <b>11</b> is communicably connected to each scanner <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a case where the participant <b>13</b> holds the ID card <b>15</b> on the scanner <b>24</b>, the scanner <b>24</b> reads the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> of the ID card <b>15</b> and transmits information including the digital key indicated by the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> and a scanner ID to the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. The scanner <b>24</b> is an example of a &#x201c;reading device&#x201d; according to the embodiment of the disclosed technology. The information management apparatus <b>11</b> stores the information received from the scanner <b>24</b> in the database <b>20</b> in association with the digital key as the behavior information of the participant <b>13</b> in the event venue.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as an example, a plurality of exhibition booths including exhibition booths <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B are provided in the event venue. In the following description, the plurality of exhibition booths will be referred to as an &#x201c;exhibition booth <b>22</b>&#x201d; unless otherwise necessary to distinguish. The scanner <b>24</b> is comprised at an entrance of each exhibition booth <b>22</b>. A unique scanner ID is assigned to each scanner <b>24</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a scanner <b>24</b>A comprised in the exhibition booth <b>22</b>A has a scanner ID &#x201c;A&#x201d;, and a scanner <b>24</b>B comprised in the exhibition booth <b>22</b>B has a scanner ID &#x201c;B&#x201d;. In the following description, the scanners <b>24</b> will be referred to as the scanners, <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B, and the like in a case where distinction is necessary for each ID.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, in entering the exhibition booth <b>22</b>, the participant <b>13</b> causes the scanner <b>24</b> to read the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> by holding the ID card <b>15</b> on the scanner <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in a case where the participant <b>13</b> reads the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> by the scanner <b>24</b>A arranged in the exhibition booth <b>22</b>A, &#x201c;0001-A&#x201d; including the digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d; and the scanner ID &#x201c;A&#x201d; is transmitted to the information management apparatus <b>11</b> as the behavior information. In the same manner, in a case where the participant <b>13</b> to which the same digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d; is assigned reads the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> by the scanner <b>24</b>B arranged in the exhibition booth <b>22</b>B, &#x201c;0001-B&#x201d; including the digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d; and the scanner ID &#x201c;B&#x201d; is transmitted to the information management apparatus <b>11</b> as the behavior information. In the present example, the behavior information &#x201c;0001-A&#x201d; transmitted by the scanner <b>24</b>A is the behavior information representing the behavior of the participant <b>13</b> such that the participant <b>13</b> to which the digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d; is assigned has entered the exhibition booth <b>22</b>A. In the same manner, the behavior information &#x201c;0001-B&#x201d; transmitted by the scanner <b>24</b>B is the behavior information representing the behavior of the participant <b>13</b> such that the participant <b>13</b> to which the digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d; is assigned has entered the exhibition booth <b>22</b>B.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The database <b>20</b> stores the digital key, the face image <b>14</b>, and the behavior information in association with each other. First, in the reception at the time of entering, the information management apparatus <b>11</b> stores the issued digital key and the face image <b>14</b> in the database <b>20</b> in association with each other. Then, in a case where the information management apparatus <b>11</b> receives the behavior information from the scanner <b>24</b>, the received behavior information is stored in association with the digital key in the database <b>20</b>. In a case where the participant <b>13</b> performs a plurality of behaviors, a plurality of pieces of behavior information are accumulated in the database <b>20</b> for each participant <b>13</b>. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the database <b>20</b> stores the behavior information &#x201c;0001-A&#x201d; and &#x201c;0001-B&#x201d; of the above example as the behavior information of the participant <b>13</b> having the digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, the database <b>20</b> is a storage device including a data storage device such as a hard disk drive (HDD) and a solid state drive (SSD) and a control circuit, and is an example of a &#x201c;database (storage portion)&#x201d; according to the embodiment of the disclosed technology. The database <b>20</b> stores data in accordance with a storage request from the information management apparatus <b>11</b>, searches for data in accordance with a search request from the information management apparatus <b>11</b>, and returns a search result to the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. The database <b>20</b> may be provided inside the information management apparatus <b>11</b> or may be provided outside the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. In a case where the database <b>20</b> is provided outside the information management apparatus <b>11</b>, the database <b>20</b> and the information management apparatus <b>11</b> are communicably connected through a network such as a local area network (LAN).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as an example, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer has a rounded box shape as a whole. As described above, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer of the present example is an instant camera, and a film pack <b>32</b> of the instant film <b>16</b> is interchangeably loaded into the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer. The film pack <b>32</b> accommodates a plurality of, for example, 10, unused instant films <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A printer <b>35</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) is comprised inside the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer. The printer <b>35</b> prints the ID image on the instant film <b>16</b>. The printed instant film <b>16</b> is discharged from a discharge port <b>34</b> formed in an upper portion of a camera body.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as an example, the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer comprises a control circuit <b>40</b>, a camera <b>42</b>, a storage <b>46</b>, the printer <b>35</b>, and a communication portion <b>43</b>. The camera <b>42</b> images a subject (including the participant <b>13</b> and a wall or the like in a background of the participant <b>13</b>) captured within an imaging range and outputs the face image <b>14</b> including a face of the subject as an image representing the subject. For example, the camera <b>42</b> includes an imaging element such as a charge coupled device (CCD) image sensor and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor, and an imaging optical system that forms a subject image on an imaging surface of the imaging element. The camera <b>42</b> outputs the face image <b>14</b> that includes the face of the subject and is formed on the imaging surface of the imaging element, as digital data. Here, the camera <b>42</b> is an example of a &#x201c;camera&#x201d; according to the embodiment of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The printer <b>35</b> comprises an exposure unit as an example of a printing portion that prints an image on the instant film <b>16</b>. The exposure unit includes a liquid crystal display portion that displays an image (captured image) acquired by performing imaging, and a light source for exposure. The exposure unit exposes the instant film <b>16</b> to image light corresponding to the image displayed on the liquid crystal display portion by irradiating the instant film <b>16</b> with light from the light source through the liquid crystal display portion. The instant film <b>16</b> comprises a photosensitive layer, and the exposed image is developed by applying a developer that is sealed in after the exposure onto the photosensitive layer.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, the control circuit <b>40</b> is a micro-processing unit (MPU) and generally controls an operation of the reception device <b>10</b> in addition to the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer that includes the camera <b>42</b> and the printer <b>35</b>. The control circuit <b>40</b> stores the face image <b>14</b> output from the camera <b>42</b> in the storage <b>46</b>. The control circuit <b>40</b> is an example of a &#x201c;second processor&#x201d; according to the embodiment of the disclosed technology. The communication portion <b>43</b> is a communication interface for communicating with the information management apparatus <b>11</b> through a local area network (LAN) or a communication cable. The control circuit <b>40</b> communicates with the information management apparatus <b>11</b> through the communication portion <b>43</b>. The communication portion <b>43</b> may be a wired interface or a wireless interface. In an environment such as the event venue in which the number of electronic apparatuses that emit radio waves, such as a smartphone carried by the participant <b>13</b>, is large, it is preferable that the communication portion <b>43</b> is a wired interface in order to prevent a communication delay caused by interference between the radio waves.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, each time the face image <b>14</b> is acquired by the camera <b>42</b>, the control circuit <b>40</b> transmits a digital key issuing request to the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. The control circuit <b>40</b> receives the digital key issued from the information management apparatus <b>11</b> in accordance with the digital key issuing request. The control circuit <b>40</b> stores the digital key in the storage <b>46</b> in association with the face image <b>14</b>. For example, the storage <b>46</b> is a data storage device such as a flash memory and primarily stores data such as the face image <b>14</b> (face image <b>14</b> captured by the camera <b>42</b>) acquired by imaging performed by the camera <b>42</b>, that is, data acquired in the reception at the time of entering.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The control circuit <b>40</b> requests a template image <b>23</b> from the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. As will be described in detail later, the template image <b>23</b> is data as a template of the ID image and is data to be combined with the face image <b>14</b>. In addition, the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> obtained by coding the digital key is attached to the template image <b>23</b> by the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. The control circuit <b>40</b> acquires the template image <b>23</b> to which the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> is attached from the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. The control circuit <b>40</b> temporarily stores the template image <b>23</b> in the storage <b>46</b> in association with the digital key indicated by the two-dimensional code <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The control circuit <b>40</b> reads out the template image <b>23</b> and the face image <b>14</b> from the storage <b>46</b>. The control circuit <b>40</b> generates an ID image <b>25</b> by combining the template image <b>23</b> with the face image <b>14</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and outputs the ID image <b>25</b> to the printer <b>35</b>. The printer <b>35</b> prints the ID image <b>25</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) input from the control circuit <b>40</b> on the instant film <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> as an example, a frame <b>21</b> for fitting the face image <b>14</b> is provided at almost a center of the template image <b>23</b>, and the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> is arranged on a lower right side of the frame <b>21</b>. The ID image <b>25</b> is generated by combining the face image <b>14</b> at a position of the frame <b>21</b> of the template image <b>23</b>.

The camera <b>42</b> of the reception device <b>10</b> images the face of the participant <b>13</b> participating in the event. The information management apparatus <b>11</b> comprises at least one CPU <b>60</b>. The CPU <b>60</b> receives the issuing request that is the issuing request transmitted from the reception device <b>10</b> for the digital key assigned for each participant <b>13</b>, that is, for each face image <b>14</b> (face image <b>14</b> captured by the camera <b>42</b>) acquired by the camera <b>42</b>, issues the digital key independently of the personal information of the participant <b>13</b>, and transmits the issued digital key to the reception device <b>10</b>. The reception device <b>10</b> outputs the ID image <b>25</b> that includes the face image <b>14</b> and the digital key and is the ID image <b>25</b> of the participant <b>13</b> issued for each participant <b>13</b> to the printer <b>35</b>. The printer <b>35</b> creates the ID card <b>15</b> by printing the ID image <b>25</b> on the instant film <b>16</b>. In the output (printing) of the ID image <b>25</b> by the reception device <b>10</b>, the CPU <b>60</b> of the information management apparatus <b>11</b> acquires the face image <b>14</b> from the reception device <b>10</b>. The CPU <b>60</b> of the information management apparatus <b>11</b> stores the face image <b>14</b> and the digital key in the database <b>20</b> in association with each other. In the event venue, the plurality of scanners <b>24</b> for reading the digital key included in the ID card <b>15</b> are arranged. The scanner <b>24</b> transmits information including the digital key and the scanner ID to the information management apparatus <b>11</b>. The CPU <b>60</b> of the information management apparatus <b>11</b> stores the information from the scanner <b>24</b> in the database <b>20</b> in association with the digital key as the behavior information representing the behavior of the participant <b>13</b>. Thus, according to the present configuration, it is possible to collect the behavior information of the participant <b>13</b> while reducing an input procedure of the personal information by the participant <b>13</b> participating in the event compared to the related art.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The information management apparatus <b>11</b> issues the digital key independently of the personal information of the participant <b>13</b>. Thus, in the reception device <b>10</b>, the personal information such as a name does not need to be acquired from the participant <b>13</b> for creating the ID image <b>25</b> usable as a participation identification for the event. Thus, the input procedure of the personal information by the participant can be reduced compared to the related art. A person who feels reluctant to inputting the name or the like easily participates in the event, compared to a case where the input procedure of the personal information is necessary. Thus, it is easy to increase the number of participants of the event. In addition, a reception procedure can be quickly performed, compared to a case where the input procedure of the personal information such as the name by the participant <b>13</b> is necessary.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, the CPU <b>60</b> of the information management apparatus <b>11</b> acquires the face image <b>14</b> representing the face of the participant <b>13</b> imaged by the camera <b>42</b> of the reception device <b>10</b> from the reception device <b>10</b> and stores the face image <b>14</b> and the digital key in the database <b>20</b> in association with each other for each participant <b>13</b>. Acquiring the face image <b>14</b> of the participant <b>13</b> participating in the event enables visitor management in terms of crime prevention. In addition, since the face image <b>14</b> is included in the ID image <b>25</b>, a face of an owner of the ID image <b>25</b> can be visually compared with the face image <b>14</b> of the ID image <b>25</b>. This is also effective as the visitor management in terms of crime prevention.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, since the behavior information of the participant <b>13</b> is stored in association with the digital key, the information management apparatus <b>11</b> can acquire the behavior information of each participant <b>13</b>. In addition, in the information management apparatus <b>11</b>, the behavior information is stored in association with the face image <b>14</b> through the digital key. As described above, an approximate attribute of the participant <b>13</b> such as the sex and the age can be perceived from the face image <b>14</b>. The behavior information of the participant <b>13</b> corresponding to the sex and the age is information useful for marketing or the like and is, for example, information useful for the organizer of the event and/or an exhibitor or the like of the exhibition booth <b>22</b>. Accordingly, in a case where the face image <b>14</b> can be acquired, for example, information useful for the organizer of the event and/or the exhibitor or the like of the exhibition booth <b>22</b> can be obtained without acquiring the personal information such as the name and a department.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In addition, according to the first embodiment, the reception device <b>10</b> comprises at least one control circuit <b>40</b>, and the control circuit <b>40</b> creates the ID image <b>25</b> by combining the face image <b>14</b> of the participant <b>13</b> with the template image <b>23</b>. Thus, according to the present configuration, for example, the reception device <b>10</b> can simply create the ID image <b>25</b> including the digital key and the face image <b>14</b>, compared to a case of performing processing using only the face image <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition, the control circuit <b>40</b> of the reception device <b>10</b> outputs the ID image <b>25</b> to the printer <b>35</b>.

Thus, according to the present configuration, the reception device <b>10</b> can create the ID card <b>15</b> that can be carried by the participant <b>13</b> of the event.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition, the reception device <b>10</b> comprises the digital camera <b>30</b> including the printer that includes the camera <b>42</b> and the printer <b>35</b> which prints the face image <b>14</b> acquired (captured) by the camera <b>42</b> on the instant film <b>16</b>. Thus, according to the present configuration, for example, the reception device <b>10</b> can instantaneously issue the ID card <b>15</b> and quickly perform the reception procedure of the event, compared to a case where a printer is installed in a location separated from the camera <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In addition, the ID image <b>25</b> may be output to the smart device <b>94</b> of the participant <b>13</b> instead of being printed on the instant film <b>16</b>. However, the ID image <b>25</b> usable as the participant identification can also be issued to the participant <b>13</b> not having the smart device <b>94</b> by creating the ID card <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition, in the information management apparatus <b>11</b>, the digital key is included in the ID image <b>25</b> in the form of the two-dimensional code <b>18</b>.

For example, viewing the behavior history is convenient in a case where the participant <b>13</b> has to summarize a report for reporting participation in the event.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the above example, while an example in which the digital key is included in the ID image <b>25</b> as the two-dimensional code <b>18</b> is described, the digital key may be included in the ID image <b>25</b> not in the form of the two-dimensional code <b>18</b>. For example, the reference number of the digital key &#x201c;0001&#x201d; in the above example may be directly included in the ID image <b>25</b>. Since the digital key is not information obtained by coding the personal information such as the name and is issued independently of the personal information, there is little concern about leakage of the personal information even in a case where the digital key is not coded.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In a second embodiment, the information management apparatus <b>11</b> acquires and counts selection information representing a selection of each participant <b>13</b> as the behavior information of each participant <b>13</b>.
