Teaching aids for storytelling to enhance language comprehension, as well as alphabet teaching, are also used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, these teaching aids do not arouse vigorous curiosity and interest of infants and children and cause them to easily get bored and distracted, failing to present efficient teaching effects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, learning methods using teaching tools that do not give fun, interest, curiosity, and novelty, force infants and children to participate in learning passively and by rote, rather than actively and voluntarily, thus failing to meet their unlimited desire for learning.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the most important thing when teaching infants and children is to let them more actively attend learning and maximize the ability to understand and learn the content being learned by using exciting and fun play aids that are able to stimulate the curiosity and interest of infants and children and let their imagination run wild.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To that end, Korean Patent Application Publication No. 10-2020-0065242 discloses a 3D fairy tale play teaching tool configured so that in the background of a children's book, character dolls on a stage are moved by an operation mechanism disposed under the stage. The character doll has a metal material attached thereon, and the operation mechanism has a magnet. The character doll is moved in the direction in which the magnet is moved by the operation mechanism. However, since the character doll cannot be rotated, the teaching effect using the character doll is limited. In other words, since it is necessary to teach by associating the alphabet letters with the related designs (or images, photos, characters, models, etc.), it is preferable to move the character dolls and expose the characters and designs alternately. To do that, the character dolls must be rotated while moving. However, the conventional teaching tool can't do so.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Korean Patent Application Publication. No. 10-2004-0019808 discloses an educational material in which a disc capable of attaching a charged body printed with, e.g., letters, numbers, fractions, polygons, circles, lines, or dotted lines, is formed to have, in a lower portion, a magnet built-in hemisphere and is placed on a non-magnetic plate, and is moved to rotate the disc, under the non-magnetic plate using a writing instrument <b>1</b> having a magnet embedded not to be parallel with the non-magnetic plate. Here, a point deviating from the center point of the hemisphere forms a contact point, and a frictional force acts upon movement, and the direction of rotation is determined according to the direction of movement. Accordingly, since the disk rotates when moving, various types of learning is possible by changing the print content of the charged body attached to the disc. However, the rotation speed is changed by the magnetic force or contact resistance of the magnet, and it rotates randomly, so it is difficult to control the rotation speed and the rotation angle. Thus, its use is limited to learning for the purpose of showing different printed designs by rotation. In other words, the instructor cannot teach by illustrating letters and related designs alternately.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As another type of rotatable teaching tool, the play tool disclosed in Korean Patent Application Publication No. 10-2003-0062804 has a magnet at the bottom of the operation unit placed on the play board. The magnet placed under the play board is rotated to rotate the operation unit, while adjusting the rotation angle or in place. Further, the magnet under the play board and the magnet of the operation unit have different poles face each other, so that the rotation angle may be adjusted more precisely. However, the structure for rotating the magnet is complicated and bulky, and it is impossible for the instructor alone to simultaneously operate the plurality of operation units, and additional manipulation for rotation is needed, and use is inconvenient. Thus, it is appropriate as a play tool, rather than for teaching, and is limited in use for alphabet teaching.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the present invention aims to provide a dynamic three-dimensional teaching aid with a simplified structure, which may represent teaching content in diversified manners by changing the position of a dynamic teaching tool or continuously express teaching contents related to each other using 3D dynamic teaching tools by rotating the dynamic teaching tool by a predetermined angle while moving and may thus enable storytelling play using dynamic movements or teaching of associating alphabet letters with related images, thereby stimulating indefinite curiosity and imagination of infants and children, meeting their learning ability, arousing interest not to be bored and to appear novel despite use many times, and letting them actively participate in and focus on learning.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the foregoing objectives, according to the present invention, a dynamic three-dimensional teaching aid comprises a teaching board <b>1</b>; a control rod <b>2</b> for moving at least one first magnet <b>23</b> along a lower surface of the teaching board <b>1</b>, the at least one first magnet <b>23</b> including an upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> and a downward magnetic pole surface having different polarities; a moving block <b>3</b> placed on the teaching board <b>1</b> and including an attractive force element to apply an attractive force to the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b> and a second magnet <b>32</b> to apply a repulsive force to the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> to be able to rotate so that a repulsive force acts in a direction opposite to the moving direction of the first magnet <b>23</b>; and a teaching member <b>4</b> coupled to the moving block <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the attractive force element may be implemented as a metal piece <b>33</b> attached to a magnet.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the metal piece <b>33</b> may be attached to a heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b>, which has a different polarity from the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the attractive force element may be implemented by a heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b>, which has a different polarity from the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the attractive force element may be implemented as a third magnet <b>34</b> that has a magnetic pole surface having a different polarity from the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b> and facing the teaching board <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the second magnet <b>32</b> has a homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> having the same polarity as the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b> and facing in a direction opposite to the attractive force element.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the second magnet <b>32</b> is installed so that the homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> faces upward in an inclined direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the second magnet <b>32</b> is configured as a plate-shaped magnet installed on the moving block <b>3</b> to form an angle with the upper surface of the teaching board <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the dynamic three-dimensional teaching aid includes an attaching/detaching means <b>31</b> for attaching/detaching the teaching member <b>4</b> to/from the moving block <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the attaching/detaching means <b>31</b> is provided on a side surface, in a direction in which a repulsive force acts by the second magnet <b>32</b>, and a side surface, in a direction opposite to the direction in which the repulsive force acts by the second magnet <b>32</b>, among side surfaces of the moving block <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the control rod <b>2</b> is configured to have a plate shape with a handle <b>21</b> exposed to an outside of the teaching board <b>1</b> and a hole <b>221</b> formed by cutting out an inside of an edge to which the first magnet <b>23</b> is fixed. The control rod <b>2</b> is disposed between the teaching board <b>1</b> and an auxiliary board <b>11</b> connected to a point on the lower surface of the teaching board <b>1</b> via a connecting member <b>12</b>, so that a moving range of the control rod <b>2</b> is limited by the connecting member <b>12</b> passing through the hole <b>221</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the present invention, at least one sheet <b>13</b>, where teaching content is printed or the teaching member <b>4</b> is attached/detached, is provided on one side of the teaching board <b>1</b>, and wherein the moving block <b>3</b> is placed on the sheet <b>13</b> covering the teaching board <b>1</b> and is moved by the control rod <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the dynamic three-dimensional teaching aid further comprises a storage cabinet <b>14</b> provided under the teaching board <b>1</b> to store the moving block <b>3</b> and the teaching board <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an embodiment of the present invention, at least two of the teaching plate <b>1</b> having the control rod <b>2</b> disposed on the lower surface thereof are connected to each other side-by-side so that in an unfolded state, the moving block <b>3</b> is placed on each teaching board <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a side of at least one sheet <b>13</b>, where teaching content is printed or the teaching member <b>4</b> is attached/detached, is fixed to where the teaching boards <b>1</b> are connected to each other.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention configured as described above allows for action of both attractive force and repulsive action by using a simplified method, which varies the installation form of magnets, unlike the conventional art that uses only either attractive force or repulsive force, in using magnets like in the conventional art.

The moving block <b>3</b> has an attaching/detaching means <b>31</b> on an outer surface thereof to attach or detach the teaching member <b>4</b>. The moving block <b>3</b> includes an attractive force element to exert an attractive force to be attracted to the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b> and a second magnet <b>32</b> to exert a repulsive force to be moved away from the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The attractive force element allows an attractive force to act to the bottom surface in surface contact with the teaching board <b>1</b> in the moving block <b>3</b>, allowing the moving block <b>3</b> to stabilize the upright position of the moving block <b>3</b>. The second magnet <b>32</b> is disposed on a side of the attractive force element and applies a repulsive force in any one direction with respect to the attractive force element.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the specific embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the moving block <b>3</b> has an isosceles triangular shape in vertical cross-section and has portions inclined at the same angle so that, as described below, a doll-shape teaching member <b>4</b> may easily be fitted and fixed in the moving block <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The attaching/detaching means <b>31</b> is attached to the outer surfaces of both the inclined portions of the moving block <b>3</b>. The second magnet <b>32</b> is attached to the inner surface of one of both the inclined portions, so that the magnetic pole surfaces <b>321</b> and <b>322</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b> form an acute angle with the bottom portion in surface contact with the upper surface of the teaching board <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Here, the second magnet <b>32</b> is configured as a plate-shape magnet so that a surface of the second magnet <b>32</b>, facing the bottom portion downwardly in an inclined direction, is formed as a heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> having the same polarity as the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>, and a surface opposite to the heteropolar magnetic pole surface is formed as a homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> having the same polarity as the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>. The homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> is attached to the inner surface of one inclined side portion of the moving block <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, the attractive force element may be configured as a metal piece <b>33</b> that is attached to a magnet. The attractive force element is attached to the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b> to be adjacent to the bottom surface of the moving block <b>3</b>. Thus, the attractive force element is subjected to strong attractive force to allow it to stick to the first magnet <b>23</b>, so that the moving block <b>3</b> is attracted by the first magnet <b>23</b> moved by the control rod <b>2</b> and is moved on the upper surface of the teaching board <b>1</b>. In this case, since the metal piece <b>33</b> is attached by the magnetic force of the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b>, the metal piece <b>33</b> may have any material or shape, e.g., a bolt or short metal pipe exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which may be stuck to a magnet and may have any size in which the metal piece <b>33</b> may be received inside the moving block <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Since the homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b> faces in the direction opposite to the metal piece <b>33</b> and upwardly in an inclined direction, a relatively weak repulsive force, rather that the attractive force by the metal piece <b>33</b>, acts to the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>. Accordingly, when attracted and moved by the first magnet <b>23</b> which is moved by the control rod <b>2</b>, the moving block <b>3</b> takes a position in which the portion where the second magnet <b>32</b> is installed faces rearward.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Resultantly, since the moving block <b>3</b> is moved with the surface, in the opposite direction to the second magnet <b>32</b>-installed portion, being the front surface, the moving block <b>3</b> is rotated in a different rotation angle depending on the moving direction and, although the moving direction is changed, the moving block <b>3</b> maintains the position in which the front surface faces in the moving direction.

An example is described with clockwise angles. The moving block <b>3</b> may be rotated by 90 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, by 180 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, by 270 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref>. Such rotational angles vary depending on the moving direction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The reason why the moving block <b>3</b> is rotated as such is that at the time when starting to be attracted and moved by the first magnet <b>23</b>, the moving block <b>3</b> slightly lags behind due to friction between the moving block <b>3</b> and the teaching board <b>1</b>, and the repulsive force applied to the first magnet <b>23</b> by the second magnet <b>32</b> increases, and thus, the second magnet <b>32</b> is forced to be pushed in the direction opposite to the moving direction while the moving block <b>3</b> is attracted by the attractive force by the metal piece <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Meanwhile, as a modification to the moving block <b>3</b>, although the metal piece <b>33</b> is not installed in the moving block <b>3</b>, the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b> may function as the attractive force element that exerts attractive force to the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>. Since the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> faces obliquely downward the bottom surface of the moving block <b>3</b> abutting the teaching board <b>1</b>, the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> exerts a relatively large attractive force than the repulsive force by the homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b> so that, although a repulsive force acts in one direction, the moving block <b>3</b> may be attracted to the first magnet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">However, since attractive force is relatively weakened if the metal piece <b>33</b> is not installed, a second magnet <b>32</b> with strong magnetic force needs to be used. If the angle between the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> and the bottom surface of the moving block <b>3</b> is rendered to reduce to increase attractive force, the repulsive force by the homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> is weakened. Thus, it is preferable to install the metal piece <b>33</b> to exert sufficient attractive force and repulsive force while using the second magnet <b>32</b> that has a weak magnetic force.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As another modification example, although the metal piece <b>33</b> may be fixed and installed on the internal bottom surface of the moving block <b>3</b>, it may be difficult to securely fix the metal piece <b>33</b> due to attractive force by the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b>. Thus, it is preferable to leave the metal piece <b>33</b> magnetically attached to the heteropolar magnetic pole surface <b>321</b> of the second magnet <b>32</b> rather than fixing the metal piece <b>33</b> to the internal bottom surface.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, if the metal piece <b>33</b> is installed, sufficient attractive force acts although the second magnet <b>32</b> is erected vertically or is installed so that an acute angle is formed between the homopolar magnetic pole surface <b>322</b> and the teaching board <b>1</b>. Thus, the form of the moving block <b>3</b> may advantageously be configured to differ from examples shown in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view illustrating another modified embodiment of the moving block <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, instead of installing a metal piece <b>33</b> in the moving block <b>3</b>, a third magnet <b>34</b> is installed on the internal bottom surface of the moving block <b>3</b>. In this case, the third magnet <b>34</b> is installed so that a magnetic pole surface of the third magnet <b>34</b>, having a different polarity from the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>, faces the internal bottom surface. In other words, the attractive force element may be configured as the third magnet <b>34</b>. In this case, strong attractive force acts to the upward magnetic pole surface <b>231</b> of the first magnet <b>23</b>, but since attractive force is generated between the second magnet <b>32</b> and the third magnet <b>34</b>, the third magnet <b>34</b> needs to be securely fixed and installed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the attaching/detaching means <b>31</b>, installed on the outer surface of the moving block <b>3</b>, is configured to allow the teaching member <b>4</b> to be attached and detached in a press-fitting manner, not a sticking manner.
