Therefore, such modifications are intended to be within the meaning and plurality of equivalents of the exemplary embodiments based upon the teaching and guidance presented herein. It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation, such that the terminology or phraseology of the present specification is to be interpreted by those skilled in relevant art(s) in light of the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As discussed above, typical authentication for communications involving a participant who currently resides or is incarcerated within a controlled environment (e.g., an inmate) involve a single authentication step such as providing a password, passing a biometric check. Moreover, whatever authentication step is performed for a call involving certain participants, the same authentication step is likely to be performed for another call involving different participants, even if one participant (or the behavior of the one participant) is more trustworthy than another participant. That is, the authentication step is static and does not change regardless of the participants involved in the call.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Relying only a single step for authenticating communications is problematic because such a security process can be easily circumvented. This becomes especially true when the single step remains unchanged for all calls and no matter the participant. For example, a controlled environment could employ the same authentication step, such as a username/password challenge. Because this step does not change, participants can easily anticipate the security step and undertake means to overcome it, such as by providing their username/password (or any other authentication credentials) to another unauthorized party.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, there is a need for a dynamic authentication system that is capable of varying the number of authentication steps and changing the types of authentication that is performed in each step from call to call and for different participants.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Exemplary Variable-Step Authentication System</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. variable-step authentication system <b>100</b> can be implemented in a controlled environment, such as a prison. In some embodiments, variable-step authentication system <b>100</b> includes communication devices <b>110</b>, authentication server <b>120</b>, and outside communication devices <b>130</b>. Communication devices <b>110</b> are connected to authentication server <b>120</b> through network <b>101</b>. Outside communication devices <b>130</b> are connected to authentication server <b>120</b> through network <b>102</b>. Authentication server <b>120</b> acts as an intermediary through network <b>101</b> and network <b>102</b> between communication devices <b>110</b> and outside communication devices <b>130</b>. Communication sessions between communication devices <b>110</b> and outside communication devices <b>130</b> include telephone calls and video conference calls.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Networks <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, may include any or all of a Local-Area Network (LAN), a Wide-Area Network (WAN), or the Internet, depending on the location of authentication server <b>120</b> in relation to communication devices <b>110</b>. For example, network <b>101</b> is implemented as a LAN when authentication server <b>120</b> is co-located with communication devices <b>110</b> within the controlled environment. In another example, network <b>101</b> is implemented as a WAN or the Internet when authentication server <b>120</b> is located remotely from communication devices <b>110</b> (e.g., outside of the controlled environment). In some embodiments, authentication server <b>120</b> is cloud-based and includes one or more cloud-based servers. In some embodiments, authentication server <b>120</b> is a server within a data center that supports the wireless devices within the controlled environment. Because outside communication devices <b>130</b> are typically outside of the controlled environment, network <b>102</b> can be implemented as a WAN or the Internet because authentication server <b>120</b> will be located remotely from outside communication devices <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Variable-step authentication system <b>100</b> provides management of communication devices <b>110</b>, such as a smartphone <b>112</b>, a tablet <b>114</b>, a wearable device <b>116</b>, and a conference kiosk <b>118</b>. A controlled environment can distribute and/or provide communication devices <b>110</b> to its inmates. Communication devices <b>110</b> are devices operated by inmates within a controlled environment and communicate directly with authentication server <b>120</b> in order to participate in communications such as with parties operating outside communication devices <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, communication devices <b>110</b> can connect to network <b>101</b> through wireless connections, such as Bluetooth&#x2122; or IEEE 802.11 (commonly known as Wi-Fi). Communication devices <b>110</b> can connect to network <b>101</b> through one or more access points (not shown) that are installed in controlled environment which provide network access between communication devices <b>110</b> and authentication server <b>120</b>. The access point can be implemented as any device that provides network access such as, but not limited to, a router, a modem, smartphone, a tablet, or a laptop device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, authentication server <b>120</b> acts as an intermediary in communications between communication devices <b>110</b> and outside communication devices <b>130</b>. Authentication server <b>120</b> performs authentication functions including implementing the variable-step authentication method described herein. For example, authentication server <b>120</b> generates participant-specific authentication procedures based on a trust level associated with each participant. In some embodiments, the trust level of a participant is stored as information in the participant's profile and, in some embodiment, is defined by a value or ranking assigned to the participants by the controlled environment. In some embodiments, the trust level of a participant, such as an inmate or an outside participant, indicates the amount of authentication steps that a participant is required to engaged with in order to join or initiate communications within variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. For example, an inmate with a higher trust level than a second inmate could be required to provide responses to more authentication steps than the second inmate. That is, based on their respective trust levels, the inmate would be required to pass a three-step authentication procedure while the second inmate would be required to pass a one or two-step authentication procedure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Authentication server <b>120</b> also selects the types of authentication challenges to be included as the authentication step. Examples of authentication challenges include a biometric challenge, username/password challenge, and a confirmation challenge. In some embodiments, a biometric challenge would require the participant of the call to provide requested biometric information associated with the participant. Biometric information includes, for example, one or more of a finger print, a hand print, a voice sample, an iris or retinal sample, a facial image of the user (2D or 3D), a hand geometry, a signature identification, an infrared facial identification, or any other biometric as deemed appropriate. The biometric information is stored at authentication server <b>120</b> and is used to verify responses to the biometric challenge that is received from communication devices.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, a username/password challenge would require the participant of the call to provide a username and password that is associated with the participant. In some embodiments, a confirmation challenge would require the participant to provide a response to, for example, a challenge question or a request for a desired action. A desired action includes, but is not limited to, responding to messages, such as short message service (SMS) or emails, transmitted by authentication server <b>120</b> or providing an alphanumeric value through SMS message, email, or by voice to authentication server <b>120</b>. A challenge question includes, but is not limited to, personnel questions associated with the participant.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, outside communication devices <b>130</b> are devices that are operated by participants that are outside of the controlled environment and include at least one of outside conference phone <b>132</b>, outside conference tablet <b>134</b>, and outside conference kiosk <b>136</b>. In an embodiment, outside communication devices <b>130</b> may be located within the controlled environment, such as in a designated area or room of the controlled environment. Accordingly, devices can be considered outside of the controlled environment when they are operated by participants who are not incarcerated or otherwise detained within the controlled environment and/or not directly managed or controlled by the controlled environment.

Communications subsystem <b>202</b> performs signal switching required to electrically connect communication devices <b>110</b> within the controlled environment to outside communication devices <b>130</b> that allow users operating such devices to communicate. Communications subsystem <b>202</b> can further record conference sessions including metadata associated with the conference sessions such as time of sessions and participants involved in the conference sessions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, communications subsystem <b>202</b> also controls the establishment of communications within variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. Communications subsystem <b>202</b> performs functions related to managing communication requests from communication devices <b>110</b> and outside communication devices <b>130</b> and managing requests from communication devices <b>110</b> and communication devices <b>130</b> to manage profiles associated with participants operating these devices. Managing communications requests includes, but is not limited to, receiving requests from communication devices <b>110</b>, receiving requests from outside communication devices <b>130</b>, and performing the appropriate processing of such requests to determine whether to establish the requested communications including determining whether participants are authorized to participate in any communications and participate in any communications involving other specific participants. Processing the requests can further include routing the request to authentication subsystem <b>203</b> to determine whether the inmate involved in the request is authorized to initiate or otherwise participate in the communications and to generate the appropriate participant-specific authorization procedures to be transmitted to the requested communication device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, communications subsystem <b>202</b> also monitors ongoing conference calls to determine whether to initiate further authentication procedures. Communications subsystem <b>202</b> monitors participants during the communication (e.g., emails, SMS texts, video call, telephonic call) and determines the appropriate action if a an unauthorized participant is detected. For example, if, during a telephone call, communications subsystem <b>202</b> detects a change in the voice of one of the participants, communications subsystem <b>202</b> performs an identity check of the new voice to insure that it belongs to a participant who was authorized when the call was first initiated. A confidence value is assigned to the identity check based on the certainty of the new voice and the identified participant. If the confidence measure is below a certain threshold, communications subsystem <b>202</b> will cause authentication subsystem <b>203</b> to initiate additional authentications procedures to confirm the identity of the participants.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, communications subsystem <b>202</b> also tracks communication devices within the controlled environment. In some embodiments, communications subsystem <b>202</b> tracks all communication devices currently active in a network of controlled environment as well as the inmates that have signed into each communication device. For example, communications subsystem <b>202</b> can associate the network information (e.g., IP address, MAC address, device identifier) of the communication device with inmate information (e.g., inmate identifier, inmate user name).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, authentication subsystem <b>203</b> performs authentication functions for establishing communications within variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. Authentication subsystem <b>203</b> is responsible for generating participant-specific authentication procedures based on a trust level associated with each participant who wishes to establish the communication. Trust levels are associated with each participant and are generated by authentication server <b>200</b> or another device associated with the controlled environment. Trust levels are based on, for example, the type of criminal offense (if the participant is an inmate), previous actions of the participant with regard to past authentication procedures, another participant who is involved in the communication, any other information that the controlled environment has stored with regard to the participant's history in previous communications, and a value assigned by the controlled environment. Examples of previous actions of the participant include but are not limited to whether the participant has successfully passed previous authentication procedures, whether the participant has failed any previous authentication procedures, and whether participant has been involved in any suspicious activity in previous communications.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Trust levels represent the level of trust that the controlled environment places on the particular participant and can be expressed as a value or metric that is compared to threshold values for determining a number of authentication steps to be included in a participant-specific authentication procedure. In some embodiments, the trust level also indicates the type of authentication steps to be issued to the participant. For example, a participant with a high level of trust will receive certain types and a certain number of authentication steps compared to a participant with a lower level of trust that Table 1.1 below illustrates an exemplary relationship between the trust levels and the number of authentication steps.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1.1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Number of</entry><entry>Type of </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Authentication </entry><entry>Authentication Steps</entry></row><row><entry>Trust Level</entry><entry>Steps</entry><entry>(Challenges)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>76%-100%</entry><entry>Two</entry><entry>Username/password, SMS</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>response</entry></row><row><entry>51%-75%</entry><entry>Three</entry><entry>Username/password, SMS</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>response, challenge question(s)</entry></row><row><entry>26%-50%</entry><entry>Four</entry><entry>Username/password, SMS</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>response, challenge question(s),</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>email response</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;&#x2009;11-25%</entry><entry>Five</entry><entry>Username/password, SMS</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>response, challenge question(s),</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>email response, biometric voice</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2002;&#x2009;&#x2009;&#x2009;0-10%</entry><entry>Six</entry><entry>Username/password, challenge</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>question(s), SMS response,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>email response, biometric voice,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>biometric facial</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>The metrics above for the trust level, the assigned numbers to each trust level, and the assigned types of authentication steps are merely exemplary. It is understood that the trust level can be represented using any type of value or metric that indicates varying degrees of trust to the controlled environment. In some embodiments, trust levels are determined exclusively based on information&#x2014;such as a participant's name, participant's calling history, personal allowed number (PAN) list, blacklist&#x2014;provided in a profile associated with the participant.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In some embodiments, a response to an authentication step is deemed to be successful based on the type of authentication step, are typically associated with information stored in profiles associated with the participant, and also are identified as appropriate by administrators of the controlled environment and/or authentication server <b>200</b>. For example, a successful response to a username/password step is the username/password associated with the participant (and identified in the profile). A successful response to an SMS challenge includes one of several expected responses identified by controlled environment such as an SMS response that includes billing or identification information to authorize payment for the communication, an SMS response that includes an alphanumeric value (provided in an SMS message from authentication server <b>200</b>), or an email message from an email address approved by the controlled environment that includes an alphanumeric value (provided in an SMS message).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">In some embodiments, an SMS response authorization step includes messages sent to the participant that include but are not limited to an alphanumeric code or a request for authorization to pay for the communication. A successful response to the SMS response authorization step may be to provide the alphanumeric code back to authentication server <b>200</b> in the form of an SMS message, an email message sent from an email address associated with the participant that has been approved for use by authentication server <b>200</b>, or spoken back verbally over a communication that is being monitored by communications subsystem <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">In some embodiments, trust levels are dynamically updated based on real-time actions performed by the participant. For example, trust levels are updated based upon a successful or unsuccessful attempt to respond to a challenge. In some embodiments, trust levels are manually updated by administrators of the controlled environment. For example, in response to a participant's behavior or actions within the controlled environment that can be input by the administrators to affect the trust level. In this manner, the administrators would update a profile associated with the participant (e.g., by entering in the actions such as a fight) and profile subsystem <b>205</b> (discussed below) would update the trust level based on the information in the participant's profile.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">Because each participant involved in a communication could have different trust levels, the authentication procedures for each participant could also be different. One participant may be required to successfully respond to three authentication steps and another participant may be required to successfully respond to two authentication steps. Moreover, authentication procedures may vary between each participant because the types of authentication steps that each participant must respond to also can be different based on, for example, the trust levels of each participant and a random selection of the type of authentication steps that each participant is to perform. For example, if a participant has a trust level between 26%-50% as indicated in Table 1.1 above, the participant will face four authentication steps and these steps can be selected from a group of challenges including any combination of username/password, an SMS response, challenge question(s), and an email response. For example, authentication subsystem <b>203</b> may select username/password, two challenge questions, and an SMS response as the authentication procedure for the participant.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">In some embodiments, authentication (based on trust level) can be performed on one participant and conventional authentication (not based on trust level) can be performed on another participant. For example, one participant may only be required to enter in a username/password but another participant to the communication may be authenticated based on trust level according to the description above. This one-sided trust-level authentication may be based on, for example, whether a communication device is capable of performing any of the authentication steps, the identity of the participant, or a specific option selected by authentication server <b>200</b> and/or the controlled environment.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In some embodiments, responses provided by participants during an authentication procedure may include a response that represents and authorization from the participant to pay for the communication. One example of such a response includes premium SMS messages. Billing subsystem <b>204</b> determines the cost of a requested communication, manages billing accounts of participants, and, upon receiving a response authorizing payment, organizes the payment of a requested communication from the appropriate billing account associated with the participant that sent the authorization. As one example, one embodiment of an authentication step is an SMS message that is sent to the communication device of the participant. In some embodiments, the SMS message requests the participant to reply to the SMS with an authorization to pay for the communication using a billing account associated with the participant. One example of an authorization to pay includes but is not limited to the user responding with a message, such as an SMS response or an email message, that includes the user's permission (such as a password associated with the billing account or any identifier associated with the billing account that links the participant to the billing account).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In some embodiments, profile subsystem <b>205</b> manages profiles of participants that can be involved with communications within variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. As noted above, profile subsystem <b>205</b> updates trust levels associated with participant and stores the trust levels in the associated profiles. In some embodiments, profile subsystem <b>205</b> generates and updates trust levels based on information stored in the profiles and/or based on direct input from administrators associated with the controlled environment. For example, administrators can directly override a dynamically generated trust level when appropriate. Information stored in the profiles that are relevant to trust levels include but are not limited to the participant's name (to allow for identification), participant's calling history, participant's authentication history, and any flags set by the controlled environment or by authentication subsystem where flags indicate any potentially suspicious behavior or actions taken by the participant.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Profile subsystem <b>205</b> also receives and implements preferences from inmates regarding communications including but not limited to managing outside contacts on a PAN list. In some embodiments, trust levels of can also be based on the outside contacts in the PAN list, such as if any of the outside contacts are known to variable-step authentication system <b>100</b> and have low trust levels. There are profiles for outside contacts who are registered with variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, outside contacts are only permitted to be involved with communications if they are registered. Registering includes establishing a billing account that allows for the participant (either residing in the controlled environment or outside of it) to pay for requested communications. Profiles also include options established by participants as to whether payment for communications can be included as party of authentication procedures such as through a premium SMS that is sent by the participant in response to an SMS response authorization step. Accordingly, profile subsystem <b>205</b> also manages requests from participants to manage their associated profiles. As previously mentioned, the profile includes preferences associated with communications that are established involving the participant associated with the profile, trust levels, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">In some embodiments, profiles of participants also include email addresses and telephone numbers that are approved for use by the controlled environment within variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. For example, as part of the registering process, a participants may be required to provide a list of email addresses and telephone numbers that the participant may use in communications. The controlled environment and/or authentication server <b>200</b> approves or denies their use based on verifying that the provided email addresses and telephone numbers are associated with the participant. Profiles may also include device identifiers such as media-access control (MAC) addresses or IP addresses associated with devices that have been approved for use within variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. For example, as part of the registration step, authentication server <b>200</b> requires participant to transmit a message that includes the device identification information. Authentication server extracts the device identification information from the message, verifies that the device identification information is associated with the participant, and stores it as part of the participant's profile. In some embodiments, association of device identification information with the participant is done passively such as through analyzing previous emails or messages transmitted by the participant and extracting the device identification information from these emails.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Database <b>206</b> includes any number of databases and/or servers, and stores and organizes data in a relational database. Database <b>206</b> runs a database management system, such as MYSQL&#x2122;, to provide an example. Database <b>206</b> stores inmate-specific information regarding the content associated with each inmate and subject to administrative rules associated with the inmate, the communication device to which the inmate has signed in, and/or the specific content. Database <b>206</b> further stores administrative rules that are utilized by authentication server <b>200</b> and monitoring system <b>104</b> to monitor and manage conference calls within the controlled environment. As previously discussed, administrative rules can be apply to inmates as an inmate specific rule or a global rule, to devices as a device specific rule, a device type rule, or a global rule, and to content as a content specific rule, a content type rule, and a global rule. Administrative inmate rules can be associated with an inmate (or inmates) and either allow or restrict access to a conference call function based on the identity of the inmate. Examples of administrative inmate rules include but are not limited to restricting or limiting the inmate's access to the conference call function, restricting or limiting contacts that can be added to the inmate' conference PAN list, and restricting or limiting a conference call (e.g., time restriction).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Database <b>206</b> further stores all conference calls that occur within variable-step authentication system <b>100</b>. The stored conference calls may be later analyzed or provided to a monitoring system, such as monitoring system <b>140</b>, for later analysis. Database <b>206</b> also includes biometric and authentication information of all inmates within the controlled environment. Moreover, database <b>206</b> can also include biometric information of any outside party approved to participate in the conference call function within the controlled environment.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Exemplary Variable-Step Authentication System Operation</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0044">Exemplary usage of variable-step authentication system <b>100</b> in a controlled environment will be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>.

The request may be received from any or each communication device that are to be involved in the communication. In some embodiments, the request includes identification of the participants to be involved in the communication. Examples of identification include but are not limited telephone numbers of the communication device, approved email addresses associated with the participants, and device identification information of the communication device(s) to be involved in the call.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In some embodiments involving real-time communications such as a telephone call, authentication server <b>200</b> will initiate the communication between the participants solely to allow authentication server <b>200</b> to communicate with all participants to perform the variable-step authentication method described herein. However, authentication server <b>200</b> would prevent any communication (e.g., muting the call) from taking place until after participants have been authenticated as described further below. In some embodiments involving non-real-time communications such as an email message, authentication server <b>200</b> will perform the variable-step authentication method described herein prior to delivering the non-real-time communication.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In <b>302</b>, authentication server <b>200</b> determines trust levels of participants that are to be involved in the requested communication. In some embodiments, this determination is performed based on the identification received as part of the request by retrieving profiles associated with the participants. In some embodiments, the trust levels are stored as metrics in the profiles. In other embodiments, the trust levels are dynamically generated for each request based on information in the profile and any other parameters specified by the controlled environment. In some embodiments, not every participant will have a trust level or will be required to be authenticated based on their trust level. This determination may be based on any number of factors including a specific option selected by authentication server <b>200</b>, an identity of the participant, and/or the type of communication device used by the participant.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In <b>303</b>, for each participant identified in the request or alternatively for each participant who is to receive authentication based on trust-level, authentication server <b>200</b> generates authentication procedures based on the determined trust levels. As noted above, authentication procedures includes a number of authentication steps that is based on the determined trust levels. Moreover, the types of authentication steps can be selected randomly from a group of authentication steps that is based on the determined trust levels. In some embodiments, the minimum number of authentication is steps is two. For each generated authentication procedure associated with a particular participant and for each participant who is to undergo authentication based on the trust level, authentication server <b>200</b> transmits the first authentication step from the authentication procedure generated for the particular participant to the respective communication device (associated with the participant).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In <b>304</b>, authentication server <b>200</b> receives an authentication response from each respective communication device in response to transmitting the first authentication step. In <b>305</b>, authentication server <b>200</b> verifies each authentication response by determining whether they are appropriate or correct responses to the respectively transmitted first authentication step. Whether each response is appropriate or correct is based on the associated authentication step (i.e., whether it is a username/password, SMS response, or biometric challenge), as discussed above. In some embodiments, if at least response is not verified, then the request for communication is rejected because one participant in the communication was not authenticated. In other embodiments, the communication may be still allowed between other participants who have been authenticated but without the participant who provided the improper response.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">If the request is verified, then in <b>306</b>, authentication server <b>200</b> determines whether there are any additional authentication steps to be performed as part of the authentication procedure for each participant. In <b>307</b>, in response to determining that there are additional authentication steps to be performed as part of the authentication procedure, authentication server <b>200</b> transmits the next authentication step identified in the authentication procedure to the respective participant. For example, if the authentication procedure includes two steps, then authentication server <b>200</b> sends the second authentication step identified in the authentication procedure. In <b>311</b>, if there are no additional authentication steps for a particular participant, that participant waits until all other participants have been authenticated.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In <b>308</b>, authentication server <b>200</b> receives another authentication response from each participant in response to the transmission of the next authentication step from <b>307</b>.
