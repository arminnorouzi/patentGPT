personal vapor inhaling unit is disclosed. An electronic flameless vapor inhaler unit that may simulate a cigarette has a cavity that receives a cartridge in the distal end of the inhaler unit. The cartridge brings a substance to be vaporized in contact with a wick. When the unit is activated, and the user provides suction, the substance to be vaporized is drawn out of the cartridge, through the wick, and is atomized by the wick into a cavity containing a heating element. The heating element vaporizes the atomized substance. The vapors then continue to be pulled by the user through a mouthpiece and mouthpiece cover where they may be inhaled.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

However, because a personal vaporizer is typically electrically powered, no tobacco, smoke, or combustion is usually involved in its operation. For portability, and to simulate the physical characteristics of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe, a personal vaporizer may be battery powered. In addition, a personal vaporizer may be loaded with a nicotine bearing substance and/or a medication bearing substance. The personal vaporizer may provide an inhaled dose of nicotine and/or medication by way of the heated and atomized substance. Thus, personal vaporizers may also be known as electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes. Personal vaporizers may be used to administer flavors, medicines, drugs, or substances that are vaporized and then inhaled.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0232" num="0231">In an embodiment, a personal vaporizer unit comprises a mouthpiece configured for contact with the mouth of a person. At least part of this mouthpiece has an antimicrobial surface. This mouthpiece may also comprise silicone rubber, thermoplastic elastomer, organosilane, silver impregnated polymer, silver impregnated thermoplastic elastomer, and/or polymer. The mouthpiece may be removed from the personal vaporizer for washing or replacement, without using a tool. The mouthpiece may be provided in different colors. Designs or other patterns may be visible on the outside of the mouthpiece.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">In an embodiment, a personal vaporizer unit comprises a first conductive surface configured to contact a first body part of a person holding the personal vaporizer unit, and a second conductive surface, conductively isolated from the first conductive surface, configured to contact a second body part of the person. When the personal vaporizer unit detects a change in conductivity between the first conductive surface and the second conductive surface, the vaporizer is activated to vaporize a substance so that the vapors may be inhaled by the person holding the vaporizer unit. The first body part and the second body part may be a lip or parts of a hand(s). The two conductive surfaces may also be used to charge a battery contained in the personal vaporizer unit. The two conductive surfaces may also form, or be part of, a connector that may be used to output data stored in a memory.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">In an embodiment, a personal vaporizer unit comprises a chamber configured to receive a cartridge. The cartridge may hold a substance to be vaporized. The chamber may be configured at the distal end of the personal vaporizer unit. A user may inhale the vaporized substance at the proximal end of the personal vaporizer unit. At least one space between the exterior surface of the cartridge and an interior surface of the chamber may define a passage for air to be drawn from outside the personal vaporizer unit, near the distal end, through the personal vaporizer unit to be inhaled by the user along with the vaporized substance. The personal vaporizer unit may also include a puncturing element that breaks a seal on the cartridge to allow a substance in the cartridge to be vaporized. An end surface of the cartridge may be translucent to diffuse light produced internally to the personal vaporizer unit. The translucent end may be etched or embossed with letters, symbols, or other indicia that are illuminated by the light produced internally to the personal vaporizer unit.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">In an embodiment, a personal vaporizer unit comprises a first wick element and a second wick element having a porous ceramic. The first wick element is adapted to directly contact a liquid held in a reservoir. The reservoir may be contained by a cartridge that is removable from the personal vaporizer unit. A heating element is disposed through the second wick element. An air gap is defined between the first wick element and the second wick element with the heating element exposed to the air gap. Air enters the first wick element through a hole in a housing holding the first wick element.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">In an embodiment, a personal vaporizer unit comprises a light source internal to an opaque cylindrical housing that approximates the appearance of a smoking article. A cylindrical light tube is disposed inside the opaque cylindrical housing to conduct light emitted by the light source to an end of the opaque cylindrical housing. This allows the light to be visible outside of the opaque cylindrical housing of the vaporizer.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">In an embodiment, a personal vaporizer unit comprises a microprocessor, a memory, and a connector. The connector outputs data stored in the memory. The microprocessor may gather, and store in the memory, information including, but not limited to, the number of cycles the device has been triggered, the duration of the cycles, the number of cartridges of fluid that are delivered. The microprocessor may also gather and store times and dates associated with other information gathered and stored. The microprocessor may detect an empty cartridge by detecting a specific change in resistance between a wick and a housing that is equivalent to a &#x201c;dry wick,&#x201d; and thus signifies an empty cartridge.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">In an embodiment, a case comprises a cradle adapted to hold a personal vaporizer unit. The personal vaporizer unit has dimensions approximating a smoking article. The case includes a battery and at least two contacts. The two contacts may form an electrical contact with the personal vaporizer unit when the personal vaporizer unit is in the cradle. The two contacts may conduct charge from the battery to the personal vaporizer unit to charge the personal vaporizer unit. The case may also download and store data retrieved from the personal vaporizer unit. The case may download and store this data via the at least two contacts.

The power settings could modulate or configure the activation energy delivered to the heating element(s) as well as modulating or configuring the parameters of the heating element(s) being energized in relation to the time to peak activation or &#x201c;warm up&#x201d; or &#x201c;ramp&#x201d; and or the time of maximum or peak activation, and or the time of the heating element being deactivated or the &#x201c;cool down&#x201d; to effect and modulate the vapor or aerosol strength, vapor or aerosol density, vapor or aerosol volume, vapor or aerosol flavor, vapor or aerosol temperature or similar characteristics of the vapor or aerosol generated by the device.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0400">f) The device and associated application having the capability for power settings of the device to modulate, adjust, configure or similar the settings of the device as they relate to battery life and performance such that the user can make setting adjustment to the device to maximize battery life and the device will resultantly operate at lower energy output to preserve the maximum number of cycles that be sustained per battery charge cycle. Conversely the user could modulate, adjust, configure or similar the settings of the device to maximize performance in relation to the energy output of the device per cycle.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0401">g) The device and associated application having the capability related to the liquid components and formulation or similar such that the information relating to the liquid to be vaporized or aerosolized can have predetermined as well as user configurable settings to modulate, configure, adjust or similar the device activation parameters.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0402">h) The device and associated application having the capability related to user specific environmental configurations such as cold weather or warm weather settings such that the device optimizes heating element activation and activation parameters to optimize performance based on ambient temperature.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0403">i) The device and associated application having the capability related to user specific environmental configurations such as high or low humidity settings such that the device optimizes heating element activation and activation parameters to optimize performance based on user locale humidity values or ranges.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0404">j) The device and associated application having the capability related to user specific environmental configurations such as user locale altitude settings such that the device optimizes heating element activation and activation parameters to optimize performance based on end user altitude.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0405">k) The device and associated application having the capability related to user specific temporal configurations such as the user preferring higher active component delivery per inhalation at specific times of the day. For example the device configure such that it delivers higher dosage of active component related to a time of day such that the dosage delivered to the user is highest, or at maximum value or similar in the morning and tapers down to a lower delivered dose per inhalation, or minimum value, or similar at the end of the evening. This is an example of the configurability of the device and the user could program the settings based on personal preference.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0406">l) The device and associated application having the capability related to modulating the device performance and activation parameters to minimize or maximize the functional effects of the taste or flavor component of the vapor product such that the device can be configured to activate in such a way that the flavor delivered from the vapor or aerosol is minimized or maximized. For example components of the liquid being vaporized that may contribute to the flavor characteristics of the vapor or aerosol may be more profound, or more prevalent, or more substantial when the device is activated with higher temperature ranges being generated by the heating element then when lower temperature ranges are being generated by the heating element within the range of temperatures that the heating element may operate within in order to generate a vapor or aerosol for inhalation by the user. For example the user may set the device to perform for maximal, minimal, moderate, or another interim value of flavor for the vapor or aerosol product and the heating element activation cycle will be modulated accordingly.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0013" num="0407">m) The device and associated application having the capability related to modulating the device performance and activation parameters to minimize or maximize the functional effects related to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the active or drug component of the vapor or aerosol product such that the device can be configured to activate in such a way that the active component or drug delivered from the vapor or aerosol is minimized or maximized in terms of target tissue or organ delivery. For example active components or drug(s) in the liquid formulation being vaporized will be absorbed into the blood stream at different rates depending on the target tissue or organ. For example active component(s) or drug(s) in the vapor having small particle size of less than 10 microns may be readily absorbed into systemic circulation through the pulmonary vasculature, as is well documented in the literature. However active component(s) or drug(s) in the vapor having small particle size of greater than 10 microns may be absorbed more preferentially through the mucosal surface of the oral and pharyngeal cavities and mucosal absorption is slower to reach the systemic circulation then is the delivery of a drug or similar to the systemic circulation through the pulmonary vasculature. To continue the example, a user may be using the device for the delivery of nicotine as the active or drug component in the vapor or aerosol and it may be desirable for the user to have the option to have more rapid delivery of the nicotine to the bloodstream, such as after a period of time of not having nicotine such that the user's urge or craving is elevated. Alternatively, at times it may be desirable for the user to have a slower absorption of nicotine into the blood stream such as at times when the users craving or urge is low, or at times when the user wants to have a more prolonged period of time before they have the urge or craving for nicotine such as prior to going to sleep, or an event where they will be unable to use the device for dosing or administration of the nicotine. The device settings relating to the activation of the device and the temperature of the heating element and heating element activation characteristics may be modulated such that for example at lower temperature activation the particle size of the drug component is larger than when at higher temperature activation of the heating element. Thus by modulating the input of thermal or heat energy inputted into the vaporization chamber by the heating element to volatize or vaporize the liquid containing the active component(s) or drug(s) the characteristics of the vapor or aerosol in relation to the particle size of the active component(s) or drug(s) can be wholly or partially modulated by the user. These settings could also be used by the end user or healthcare provider or similar to reduce dependence on the active component(s) or drug(s) such as nicotine, for example, by initially using the device configured to maximize pulmonary deliver of the nicotine and then transition to device settings that maximize mucosal delivery of the nicotine as a means to facilitate reducing nicotine dependence and could be used in conjunction with nicotine dosage reduction as a means of reducing or mitigating the users nicotine dependence or addiction.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0014" num="0408">n) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as battery life status and battery condition(s) data such as number of battery cycles and battery &#x201c;health&#x201d; such that the user can be notified as desired to the current meaning &#x201c;real time&#x201d; and overall condition of the devices internal battery, and the devices charging case internal battery.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0015" num="0409">o) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as the device battery requiring recharging.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0016" num="0410">p) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as the device active case battery requiring recharging.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0017" num="0411">q) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as the device battery being fully charged.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0018" num="0412">r) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as the device active case battery being fully charged.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0019" num="0413">s) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as liquid cartridge status, such as number of usages or inhalations taken.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0020" num="0414">t) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as liquid cartridge status, such as number of usages or inhalations remaining.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0021" num="0415">u) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as liquid cartridge status, such as number of usages or inhalations taken over a preset or predetermined period of time, for example number of usages or inhalations taken per day.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0022" num="0416">v) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as liquid cartridge contents, such as active component(s) and strength or dosage or similar, and flavor profile or similar, and general formulation or similar.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0023" num="0417">w) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as liquid cartridge or the liquid cartridge assembly, or similar requiring replacement.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0024" num="0418">x) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as predetermined or preset times for usage of the device.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0025" num="0419">y) The device and associated application having the capability for device alerts and notifications such as device heating element status or &#x201c;health&#x201d; such as number of cycles performed and number of cycles remaining before suggested or required replacement of heating element or heating element assembly.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0396" num="0420">2.

For example, PVU <b>100</b> can be configured to activate in such a way that the flavor delivered from the vapor or aerosol is minimized, maximized, or modulated over the period of an inhalation. Some components of the liquid being vaporized that may contribute to the flavor characteristics of the vapor or aerosol may be more profound, more prevalent, or more substantial when PVU <b>100</b> is activated with higher temperature ranges being generated by the heating element than when lower temperature ranges are being generated by the heating element (within the range of temperatures that the heating element may operate in order to generate a vapor or aerosol for inhalation by the user.) For example the user may set PVU <b>100</b> to perform for maximal, minimal, moderate, or another interim value of flavor for the vapor or aerosol product. PVU <b>100</b> can modulate the heating element activation cycle accordingly.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0556">In an embodiment, functional effect related setting of PVU <b>100</b> can minimize, maximize, or modulate the functional effects related to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an active ingredient or drug component of the vapor or aerosol product. For example, PVU <b>100</b> can be configured to activate in such a way that the active component or drug delivered from the vapor or aerosol is minimized or maximized in terms of target tissue or organ delivery. Active components or drug(s) in a liquid formulation being vaporized can be absorbed into the blood stream at different rates depending on the target tissue or organ.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0557">Active component(s) or drug(s) in a vapor having a small particle size of less than 10 microns may be readily absorbed into systemic circulation through the pulmonary vasculature. However active component(s) or drug(s) in a vapor having a small particle size of greater than 10 microns may be absorbed more preferentially through the mucosal surface of the oral and pharyngeal cavities. Mucosal absorption is slower to reach the systemic circulation than delivery of a drug (or similar) to the systemic circulation through the pulmonary vasculature.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0558">A user may be using PVU <b>100</b> for the delivery of nicotine as the active or drug component in the vapor or aerosol. It may be desirable for (or by) the user to have an option for more rapid delivery of the nicotine to the bloodstream&#x2014;such as after a period of time of not having nicotine (when that the user's urge or craving is likely to be elevated.) Alternatively, at times it may be desirable for (or by) the user to have a slower absorption of nicotine into the blood stream such as at times when: (i) the users craving or urge is low, (ii) when the user wants to have a more prolonged period of time before they have the urge or craving for nicotine&#x2014;such as prior to going to sleep, or an event where they will be unable to use the device for dosing or administration of the nicotine. PVU settings relating to the activation of the device and the temperature of the heating element and heating element activation characteristics may be modulated such that, for example, at lower temperature activation the particle size of the drug component is larger than at times of a higher temperature activation of the heating element. Thus, by modulating the input of thermal or heat energy inputted into the vaporization chamber by the heating element to volatize or vaporize the liquid containing the active component(s) or drug(s) the characteristics of the vapor or aerosol in relation to the particle size of the active component(s) or drug(s) can be wholly or partially modulated by the user. These settings can also be used by the end user or healthcare provider (or similar) to reduce dependence on the active component(s) or drug(s)&#x2014;such as nicotine. These settings can also be used, for example, by initially using the device configured to maximize pulmonary deliver of the nicotine and then transition to device settings that maximize mucosal delivery of the nicotine as a means to facilitate a reduction in nicotine dependence. This transition can also be used in conjunction with nicotine dosage reduction as a means of reducing or mitigating the users nicotine dependence or addiction.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0559">In an embodiment, an app may receive alerts and notifications associated with PVU <b>100</b> and/or case <b>500</b>.

For example components of the liquid being vaporized</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>that may contribute to the flavor characteristics of the vapor or</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>aerosol may be more profound, or more prevalent, or more</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>substantial when PVU 100 is activated with higher temperature</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ranges being generated by the heating element than when lower</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>temperature ranges are being generated by the heating element</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>within the range of temperatures that the heating element may</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>operate within in order to generate a vapor or aerosol for inhalation</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>by the user.

However active component(s) or</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>drug(s) in the vapor having small particle size of greater than 10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>microns may be absorbed more preferentially through the mucosal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>surface of the oral and pharyngeal cavities and mucosal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>absorption is slower to reach the systemic circulation then is the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>delivery of a drug or similar to the systemic circulation through</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>the pulmonary vasculature. To continue the example, a user may</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>be using PVU 100 for the delivery of nicotine as the active or</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>drug component in the vapor or aerosol and it may be desirable</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>for the user to have the option to have more rapid delivery of the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>nicotine to the bloodstream, such as after a period of time of not</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>having nicotine such that the user's urge or craving is elevated.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Alternatively, at times it may be desirable for the user to have a</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>slower absorption of nicotine into the blood stream such as at</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>times when the users craving or urge is low, or at times when the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>user wants to have a more prolonged period of time before they</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>have the urge or craving for nicotine such as prior to going to</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>sleep, or an event where they will be unable to use PVU 100 for</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>dosing or administration of the nicotine. PVU 100 settings</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>relating to the activation of the device and the temperature of the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>heating element and heating element activation characteristics</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>may be modulated such that for example at lower temperature</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>activation the particle size of the drug component is larger than</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>when at higher temperature activation of the heating element.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Thus by modulating the input of thermal or heat energy inputted</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>into the vaporization chamber by the heating element to volatize</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>or vaporize the liquid containing the active component(s) or</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>drug(s) the characteristics of the vapor or aerosol in relation to the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>particle size of the active component(s) or drug(s) can be wholly</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>or partially modulated by the user.

writing (DW). The use of direct writing of a conductive metal or conductive material directly to the heating element support member or wire guide(s), or other component performs the function of the heating element(s) that is currently embodied by a metal wire or metal ribbon. This concept expands the material(s) potentially used for the heating element beyond the scope of using a metal wire or metal ribbon. The use of metal deposition methods such as plating, electroplating, or sputtering to effect the same heating element functionality as described throughout the section may be performed through the implementation of direct writing methods. The use of embedded metal into formed ceramic, or similar, components to effect the same function may be used for directly written heating element(s). Likewise, embedded metals may be used to facilitate electrical connection to directly written elements.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0594">In an embodiment, direct writing of a conductive metal or conductive material to a heating element support member or wire guide, or other component which performs the function of a heating element can be used to construct a heating element or wire guide. Direct writing of these conductive materials or metals can be done instead of the metal wire and/or metal ribbon described previously herein. Direct writing expands the materials that can be used for the heating element beyond a metal wire or metal ribbon. In addition, metal deposition methods such as plating, electroplating, or sputtering can be used to make the same heating element and/or contact functionality as described hereinafter as performed through the implementation of direct writing methods. Likewise, the use of embedded metal into formed ceramic, or similar, components can be used to make the heating element and/or contact functionality as described hereinafter as performed through the implementation of direct writing methods. Embedded metals can be used to facilitate electrical connections to directly written elements.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0595">Direct Writing (DW) typically refers to a printing or patterning method that employs a computerized, motion-controlled stage with a motionless pattern generating device to dispense flowable materials in a designed pattern onto a surface. Conductive flowable materials (a.k.a., &#x201c;inks&#x201d;) that can be used in direct write applications include, but are not limited to: (i) polymeric&#x2014;metallic particles in a polymeric matrix, primarily for polymeric substrates Silver, graphite, tungsten, copper; (ii) cermet&#x2014;metallic particles in a glass matrix, primarily for ceramic substrates, gold, platinum, silver; (iii) nanoparticulate silver; and (iv) specialty electrode materials such as titanium, stainless steel, niobium, and/or titanium nitride.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0596">Substrates (i.e., surfaces) that can be used in DW applications include, but are not limited to ceramics and metal. Examples of suitable ceramics include, but are not limited to: alumina, aluminum nitride, yttria-stabilized zirconia, and pyrex. Examples of suitable metals include, but are not limited to: stainless steels (e.g., <b>316</b>L, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and <b>430</b>), nitinol, and titanium alloys.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0597">In an embodiment, a heating element is comprised of a conductive (flowable) material deposited on a substrate (support member). By depositing the heating element material on a support member, the heating element is now thermally coupled to the support member through the process of direct writing the heating element directly to the support member. The heating element is created using the process of direct writing can be substantially L-shaped etc., as described herein.

In this embodiment the distal wick has been reduced in height to accommodate for the sensor assembly which is positioned in the atomizer housing and is occupying the distal volume of the atomizer housing and performing the function of the distal portion of the distal wick of being in direct contact with the fluid volume contained in the cartridge (not shown). Fluid should pass through the sensor assembly and liquid temperature and viscosity measurements should be made and transmitted to the device PCB/CPU. The fluid should then be in contact with the distal wick for displacement into the vaporization chamber, undergo vaporization/volatilization/aerosolization and then to the flow channel of the device for inhalation by the user. Vacuum pressure from the user when inhaling drives the fluid from the cartridge through the sensor assembly such that the only flow path for the liquid in the cartridge to travel from the cartridge to the distal wick is through the sensor assembly.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0644">There may be a velocity or flow sensor that is also used. For example, an RTD based flow or velocity sensor may include a constant temperature anemometer or thermal anemometer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>156</b></figref> illustrates a constant temperature anemometer wiring configuration. The thermal anemometer may be comprised of two sensors: an air velocity sensor and a temperature compensation sensor. The velocity sensor is heated to an elevated temperature (relative to the surrounding air) by means of control electronics. The temperature compensation sensor senses the ambient, or surrounding, air temperature and forces the velocity sensor to stay at a constant overheat above the ambient. The sensors form two opposite legs of a Wheatstone bridge (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>156</b></figref>). The circuit forces the voltage at points A and B to be equal by means of an operational amplifier. Air flowing past the velocity sensor tends to cool the sensor, thus driving down its resistance. The operational amplifier responds by immediately delivering more power to the top of the bridge to maintain voltage equilibrium at points A and B. As more air flows past the sensor, more power is required to maintain a balanced bridge. Thus, the power going into the top of the bridge is related to the velocity of the air flowing past the sensor. This is a principle of operation for constant temperature thermal anemometers. There may be an RTD based hot wire anemometer, RTD based hot film anemometer, or RTD based calorimeter flow sensors sometimes referred to as flow modules. Air velocity or flow is measured using the temperature distribution over four heating/sensor elements with serial down/up-stream arrangement. For accurate measuring a laminar flow is required to keep up the temperature distribution gradient.</p><p id="p-0535" num="0645"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>157</b></figref> is a cross section showing a proximal section of a device illustrating flow channels, a path of airflow, and positioning of a calorimeter flow sensor.

For calorimetric measurement the sensors should be placed in the region of the device with laminar flow as illustrated.</p><p id="p-0536" num="0646">In alternative embodiments, there may be thermal mass flow sensors that are similar to RTD based sensors utilizing heat transfer principles to determine the flow velocity of a fluid. As fluid passes across the sensor, heat is carried from the sensor to the medium. This relationship is dependent upon the flow rate. As flow increases, so does the amount of heat that is transferred. By knowing the temperature of the medium, the flow rate can be determined from the amount of voltage compensation needed to maintain a constant temperature differential.</p><p id="p-0537" num="0647">In alternative embodiments, there may be Mass airflow sensor (MAF). The MAF may include a micro-bridge mass airflow sensor, a MEMS thermal flow sensor, or a hot wire mass airflow sensor similar to a hot wire anemometer. Alternatively, a vane meter sensor also referred to as a VAF (volume air flow) sensor may be used. A membrane MAF is a technology that utilizes a very thin electronic membrane placed in the air stream. The membrane has a thin film temperature sensor printed on the upstream side, and one on the downstream side. A heater is integrated in the center of the membrane which maintains a constant temperature similar to the hot-wire approach. Without any airflow, the temperature profile across the membrane is uniform. When air flows across the membrane, the upstream side cools differently from the downstream side. The difference between the upstream and downstream temperature indicates the mass airflow.</p><p id="p-0538" num="0648"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>158</b></figref> illustrates viscosities of aqueous glycerol (Glycerin) solutions in centipoises/mPa. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>159</b></figref> illustrates temperature viscosity of anhydrous glycols.

The present is also directed to a system, software, and method for obtaining, storing, and displaying the results of spirometry tests. In general, a spirometry test measures the air entering and leaving the lungs and airways and is often used as a preliminary test for assessing the health condition of a patient's lungs and airways as well as a means for periodically tracking the progress of disease treatment and effect of medication. The spirometry test typically is performed using a device known as a spirometer, and the data provided by the test often is provided graphically in the form of a &#x201c;volume-time curve&#x201d; in which volume in liters is shown along the Y-axis and time in seconds is shown along the X-axis and/or in the form of a &#x201c;flow-volume loop&#x201d; in which the rate of airflow is shown on the Y-axis and the total volume inspired or expired is shown on the X-axis.</p><p id="p-0544" num="0654">By way of example, a few common parameters that may be measured during respiratory testing include: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) which is the total volume of air that can be forcibly blown out after full inspiration; Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) at timed intervals (for instance, at 1.0 second (FEV1)); Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) which is the average flow (speed) of air coming out of the lungs and airways during a specified period of the expiration; and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) which is the maximum flow (speed) of air during maximum expiration initiated after full inspiration. These parameters often are provided in raw data form (i.e., in liters, liters/second, liters/minute, etc.) and as a percentage of a predicted value (i.e., a percent of a predicted value for a patient of similar age, height, weight, gender and ethnicity).</p><p id="p-0545" num="0655">Each test typically is repeated three times to ensure reproducibility. The obtained results of the tests are highly dependent on patient cooperation and effort. For meaningful and valid test results to be obtained, the patient should provide vigorous and maximum respiratory effort for full expiration and/or inhalation. Typically, if the test is given during an office visit or at a hospital or the like, the patient should be coached and motivated by the attending nurse, physician, or technician to keep exhaling as hard as possible for a predetermined period of time (i.e. &#x201c;keep going, don't stop&#x201d;). However, no such assistance is typically provided during home use of a spirometer.

Illustrated is the stepwise process of cartridge insertion and corresponding cartridge contact interfaces. Interface #<b>1</b> represents the initial engagement of the atomizer housing and the cartridge where the contacts on the most distal aspect of the atomizer housing come into contact with the seal on the liquid cartridge. The contact area on the cartridge seal has a specific resistance value that corresponds to the contents of that cartridge such that several points of data are conveyed through this initial interface: a) that the cartridge seal is intact; b) and that an intact cartridge seal conveys that the cartridge has not been tampered with; c) the cartridge contents in terms of formulation and active component such that the activation characteristic of the device can be appropriately modulated to optimize the vaporization process; d) active component/formulation data can be used to extrapolate dose delivery; e) that he active component/formulation is the correct active component/dosage for the user. Interface #<b>1</b> is transient and is terminated with the cartridge is further inserted and the puncturing element of the atomizer housing breaks the cartridge seal. Interface #<b>2</b> is also transient and occurs when the proximal internal cartridge contact passes the distal lateral atomizer housing contact. The lateral contact of the atomizer represents an open circuit and the internal cartridge closes that circuit, the closing of the circuit represents the signal from the interface. In the illustrated embodiment the proximal internal cartridge contact is shown as being fused, or comprised or partially comprised of a fuse wire or element. Upon removal of the cartridge the circuit is energized and the fused proximal internal contact is melted such that it can no longer serve to complete the circuit. Completion of the circuit on insertion conveys to the device that the cartridge is new and has not been previously used. By melting the fused contact upon removal of the cartridge it prevents reuse or tampering with the cartridge or cartridge contents. Interface #<b>3</b> occurs when the cartridge is in the fully seated or inserted position. This contact is maintained for the &#x201c;life span&#x201d; of the cartridge, that is, until all liquid has been delivered to the wick element of the device and a &#x201c;dry wick&#x201d; signal is received from the device when all the liquid from the cartridge has been delivered to the wick elements. Interface #<b>3</b>, similar to interface #<b>2</b>, is the simple completion of an open circuit and the circuit being complete conveys a signal to the device that the cartridge is fully inserted and the device is ready to be activated by the user. Removal of the cartridge initiates a process in the device where the first signal is the breaking of the circuit made by the #<b>3</b> interface. This signal energizes the distal lateral atomizer contacts such that when the proximal internal cartridge contact comes into contact the fused contact is melted and the cartridge is rendered inactive and cannot be reused.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0721"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>171</b></figref> illustrates an atomizer housing contacts, light pipe sleeve contacts, cartridge seal and external cartridge contact arrangement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>171</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of the cartridge/device sensor assembly where the cartridge contacts are on the external aspect of the cartridge (<b>150</b>). The cartridge seal contact and resistive aspects of the seal interface with distal contacts on the puncturing element of the atomizer housing (<b>132</b>) in the same manner as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>170</b></figref>. The external cartridge contacts engage with contacts on the internal surface of the light pipe sleeve (<b>140</b>). Collectively the cartridge (<b>150</b>), atomizer housing (<b>132</b>), and light pipe sleeve (<b>140</b>) are referred to in the figure as the &#x201c;Complete Assembly.&#x201d; The proximal external cartridge contact is a fused wire or element similar to the internal cartridge contact illustrated and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>170</b></figref>. The functionality of the assembly for the cartridge insertion process begins with the initial contact made between the resistive surface of the cartridge seal coming into contact with the distal contacts on the puncturing element of the atomizer housing. This contact occurs during the insertion and ends when the cartridge seal is punctured. The &#x201c;signal&#x201d; from this contact interface is a resistance value interpreted by the PCB/CPU and conveys at a minimum two pieces of data: 1) the cartridge has an intact seal and is new and unused; 2) the resistance value corresponds to the cartridge formulation and active component (drug compound) such that the dosage delivery per inhalation, and per cartridge can be extrapolated. The second contact interface can occur in conjunction with the initial contact to effect a sequential control process such that if the second contact made by the proximal external cartridge contact and the distal internal light pipe sleeve contact completes a circuit that is the &#x201c;signal&#x201d; and if that signal is not followed by the third and final contact interface signal the device is rendered inactive. This prevents the initial contact being completed and a different cartridge being subsequently inserted, as this would activate the second interface twice which would result in device deactivation secondary to the improper cartridge insertion sequence. Both the first and second interfaces are transient as they are occurring during the process of active cartridge insertion. The third and final contact interface is a stable interface and the cartridge is in the fully inserted position where the proximal external cartridge contact comes into direct contact with the proximal internal light pipe sleeve contact and the distal external cartridge contact is in direct contact with the distal internal light pipe sleeve contact. The contact engagement completes a circuit, which is the &#x201c;signal&#x201d; sent to the PCB/CPU to convey the completed cartridge insertion process. The process is such that once the cartridge insertion process is initiated it should be completed with that specific cartridge or the failure of the sequential contact interface engagement registers an error code and the device is deactivated until a full and correct cartridge insertion process is completed. The external cartridge contacts are fully circumferential around the external surface of the cartridge. The internal light pipe sleeve contacts are not fully circumferential around the internal surface of the light pipe sleeve such that when the external cartridge contact interfaces with the corresponding light pipe sleeve contact the electrical coupling completes a circuit. The removal process is also sequential, when the cartridge is removed the stable/static interface is disrupted and the distal internal light pipe sleeve is energized such that when the proximal external cartridge contact (the fuse contact) passes the energized light pipe sleeve contact and the circuit is completed the fused cartridge contact is energized sufficiently to melt the contact. This process renders the cartridge &#x201c;inactive&#x201d; and prevents further use of the cartridge as the melted fused contact is no longer able to properly interface with the light pipe sleeve contact and effect the completion of the circuit required to signal the PCB/CPU. The used cartridge in effect has two intrinsic elements that prevent reuse, misuse, or abuse; 1) the broken seal which cannot effectively interface with the distal atomizer housing contact and 2) the melted fuse contact that cannot effect the completion of the circuit when engaging with the light pipe sleeve contact.</p><p id="p-0573" num="0722"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>172</b></figref> illustrates a contact mediated sequential cartridge insertion process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>172</b></figref> provides a detailed overview of the cartridge insertion process. The process is initiated by the user when the device does not have a cartridge inserted. A new, unused cartridge (<b>150</b>) is inserted into the device and slides freely through the light pipe sleeve (<b>140</b>) until the cartridge seal comes into contact with the distal aspect of the atomizer housing (<b>132</b>). Pressure should be applied to rupture the seal and this also represents Interface #<b>1</b> where the distal atomizer housing contacts engage the resistive section of the atomizer seal to effect a &#x201c;signal&#x201d; to the PCB/CPU as previously described. Additionally, as this resistive value correlates to a cartridge contents value by the onboard PCB/CPU and software this represents a safety feature the &#x201c;cartridge validation&#x201d; in that if the device does not recognize the cartridge having the proper contents (wrong dose, wrong formulation, wrong active component/drug) the device can send a visual and/or auditory signal to the user indicating that cartridge is or is not the correct cartridge (e.g. green light from LED and pleasant auditory cue for &#x201c;correct cartridge&#x201d; red light from LED and unpleasant beep or buzz cue for &#x201c;incorrect cartridge.&#x201d; This serves to prevent usage and dosage errors and can be achieved prior to cartridge rupture such that an incorrect cartridge could be removed and replaced with the correct cartridge. Once the initial interface is completed, including the described cartridge validation step and the seal is punctured Interface #<b>2</b> occurs. Interface #<b>1</b> and #<b>2</b> can be set to occur in a time dependent manner such that only a predetermined period of time may laps once a &#x201c;correct cartridge&#x201d; cue is sent from the user. This time period would be brief to insure that the same cartridge is being utilized to complete the insertion cycle. This is relevant in the embodiment where the cartridge contacts are internal as Interface #<b>1</b> and #<b>2</b> occur sequentially and not concomitantly as occurs in the embodiment where the cartridge contacts are external. Interface #<b>2</b> is transient as described previously and occurs when the cartridge contacts serve to close the open circuit of either the distal lateral atomizer housing contacts or the distal internal light pipe sleeve contacts depending on the embodiment. As described previously Interface #<b>3</b> should occur sequential to Interface #<b>2</b>. The stable or static Interface #<b>3</b> activates the device so the user can activate it as needed throughout the cartridge life span.</p><p id="p-0574" num="0723"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>173</b></figref> illustrates contact mediated sequential cartridge removal process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>173</b></figref> provides a detailed overview of the cartridge removal process.

The new component is positioned in the internal space of the atomizer housing and lateral fitment is such that the passage of fluid between the outer lateral surface of the new component and the inner lateral surface of the atomizer housing is mitigated. The distal portion of the new component extends beyond the distal portion of the atomizer housing such that the new component distal element functions as a puncturing element to pierce/puncture the seal on the liquid cartridge. The distal end of the component is in direct contact with the liquid contained in the cartridge, replacing the position previously occupied by the distal wick. Liquid flow from the cartridge (not shown) passes through the flow channel over the pH sensor assembly which is shown positioned in the flow channel. Flow port(s) on the distal aspect of the pH sensor housing serve as the liquid intake for liquid to exit the cartridge. The liquid flows through a center channel in the pH sensor housing that contains the pH sensor such that the pH of the liquid can be measured immediately upon exiting the cartridge.

The blade may be designed such that there are ridges, teeth, grooves, or similar designed to facilitate the rotation of the blade into the cutting position when the cartridge is being removed from the device.</p><p id="p-0600" num="0749">The rotation blade may have multiple positions: a) fully depressed during the cartridge insertion and while the cartridge remains fully inserted; b) the fully extended cutting position where the blade is substantially orthogonal to the long axis of the cartridge such that the blade is extended and able to transect, cut, slice or similar the wall(s) of the cartridge; c) a transient position which is the range of rotation about the axis between the fully depressed and the fully extended position. The cartridge may be sliced, or cut, in such a fashion that there is a cut or cuts that fully divide the wall(s) of the cartridge for the majority of the length of the cartridge (distal to proximal) preventing the cartridge from serving as a reservoir or container for liquid.</p><p id="p-0601" num="0750">Directional blade(s) may be used such that the distal aspect of the blade is non-cutting such that the cartridge can be inserted into the device without being cut. The cartridge may be wholly or partially comprised of a plastic, polymer, or similar that is readily dividable, or easily cut or sliced, or similar to facilitate the use of the cutting blades. The cartridge may be wholly or partially comprised of a plastic, polymer, or similar that is readily able to be punctured, pierced or similar by a sharp object such as a sharp point, blade edge or similar. The cartridge may be wholly or partially comprised of a plastic, polymer, or similar that when cut, sliced, or similar does not maintain the shape or geometry of the cartridge prior to being cut. For example the proximal aspect of the cartridge would flare outward thus increasing the outer diameter of the cartridge such to prevent reinsertion of the cartridge into the light pipe sleeve.</p><p id="p-0602" num="0751">The cartridge once removed may be rendered unusable, as the cartridge should no longer be capable of containing fluid such that the cut(s) or slice(s) provide a means for fluid to escape the cartridge if the cartridge was refilled. The rotational blade(s) and cartridge may be used to effect a &#x201c;one time use&#x201d; cartridge configuration. The prevention of reuse, misuse, or abuse of the device where the one time use cartridge should not be able to be refilled or reinserted into the device. Rotational blades may be used in conjunction with cartridge recognition methods described above. The rotation blades may serve as a means to prevent cartridge reuse, misuse, or abuse by rendering cartridge recognition methods, described in detail above, unusable upon removal of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0752">The use of the described directional features on the distal aspect of the rotational blades may prevent unwanted, unintended, or accidental displacement or removal of the cartridge from the device once inserted. The cartridge in the device may be engaged securely through the use of directional features on the rotational blade(s) or similar component that allow for the cartridge to be inserted into the device using less force than required to remove the cartridge as the removal of the cartridge involves the interfacing of the outer wall of the cartridge lateral surface being in contact with the directional features of the rotation blade(s) or similar component.</p><p id="p-0604" num="0753"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>191</b></figref> illustrates the positioning and rotational dynamics of the rotating blade(s). The blade(s) are positioned in this embodiment at the distal aspect of the light pipe sleeve such that when the cartridge is removed the blade(s) should engage the cartridge at the distal portion of the cartridge to effect a transection, cut, slice or similar down the majority of the length of the cartridge. The blade(s) rotation is shown such that three positions of rotation about the axis are seen; 1) the fully depressed position where the non-cutting distal aspect of the blade(s) is in contact with the cartridge during insertion and use; 2) the transient range of rotation that represents the entire range of rotation between the fully depressed and fully extended positions; 3) the fully extended position. The blade in this embodiment is illustrated as being held in position through the use of a rod, pin, or similar serving to both position the blade(s) in the light pipe sleeve and to serve as the axis of rotation for the blade(s). The distal aspect of the blade is non-cutting and is designed such that the cartridge can be inserted in the light pipe sleeve and not be damaged, sliced, or cut. The distal aspect of the blade(s) has grooves, ridges, teeth, or similar designed such that they do not grab, engage, or substantially engage with the cartridge outer surface through friction or other mechanical means when the cartridge is inserted. When the cartridge is removed the grooves, ridges, teeth, or similar are deigned to grab, engage, interface or similar with the outer surface of the cartridge such that the removal of the cartridge rotates the blade(s) into the cutting position through the interface with these features on the distal aspect of the blade(s). The rotation of the blade(s) results in the blade(s) puncturing, piercing, cutting into, or similar the cartridge wall(s). The proximal aspect of the blade is sharpened and engages with the entirety of the wall thickness of the cartridge such that the cartridge is cut, sliced, transected or similar down the length of the cartridge from the point of the blade(s) initial engagement through the most proximal aspect of the cartridge. The user supplies the force required to effect the cutting of the cartridge by the blade(s) during the cartridge removal process.</p><p id="p-0605" num="0754"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>192</b></figref> illustrates the positioning of the liquid cartridge (<b>150</b>) in the light pipe sleeve (<b>140</b>) and the corresponding positioning of the rotational blade(s). During cartridge insertion the blade(s) are positioned by the interface with the outer surface of the lateral aspect of the cartridge to the or their fully depressed position. The blade(s) are designed such that they do not provide substantial resistance or friction when the user is inserting the cartridge into the light pipe sleeve. The geometry of the light pipe sleeve may be modified from a cylinder to a modified cylinder or similar to provide a more robust support for the positioning of the blades and rod, pin, or similar used as the axis of rotation for the blade(s). In such an embodiment the geometry of the cartridge would be also modified as to be shaped such that it is readily inserted into the light pipe sleeve such that the outer diameter and geometry of the cartridge is shaped and sized as to match for fitment the internal diameter and geometry of the light pipe sleeve. The cartridge insertion process requires less applied force from the user than the cartridge removal process as the distal features of the rotational blade(s) are designed such that frictional resistance is minimal during the insertion of the cartridge by the user and that frictional resistance is substantial enough to effect the rotation of the blade(s) into the extended position during removal by the user. The increased resistance required to remove the cartridge from the device also serves to prevent the cartridge of unwanted, unintentional, or accidental removal during normal use.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0755"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>193</b></figref> illustrates the cartridge removal process from the light pipe sleeve and the interfacing of the rotational blade(s) during the cartridge removal process.

In another embodiment the cuts would also serve to alter the geometry of the cartridge such that the proximal aspect of the cartridge was no longer capable of achieving insertion into the light pipe sleeve as the cut(s) serve to cause the proximal aspect of the cartridge to flare outwards altering the effective outer diameter of the proximal aspect of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0757">Methods for Reducing or Mitigating the Risk of Choking on Vaporizer Components, Choking Risk Reduction Packaging of Vaporizer Cartridge and Vaporizer Cartridge Assemblies</p><p id="p-0609" num="0758">The Consumer Product Safety Commission states any toy that is small enough to fit through a circle an inch and a half in diameter (the size of a toilet paper tube) or is less than two and a quarter inches long is unsafe for small children.

The cartridge or cartridge assembly in a generally cylindrical embodiment (shown) is inserted into the distal end of the main PVU where the light transmitting sleeve is comprised such that the inner diameter of the light transmitting sleeve is in close tolerance to the outer diameter of the cartridge such as to effect a wholly, or partially airtight interface.</p><p id="p-0630" num="0779">The cartridge may have one or a plurality of geometric features to allow for one or a plurality of void(s), galley(s), channel(s), or similar to allow for airflow to enter and travel down the feature(s) in between the outer surface of the cartridge and the inner surface of the light transmitting sleeve. In the cylindrical embodiment this may be as the circular diameter of the cartridge having one or a plurality of geometries such that part of the circular shape is removed and replace by a linear line where the removal of the portion of the circular shape results in a void space when the cylindrical element of the cartridge is inserted in to the tubular light transmitting sleeve (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>209</b></figref>). Other embodiments are also possible and envisioned using compatible geometries such as an ovoid cartridge or cartridge assembly and light transmitting sleeve or pipe or similar, triangle shaped cartridge or cartridge assembly and light transmitting sleeve or pipe or similar, square or rectangular cartridge or cartridge assembly and light transmitting sleeve or pipe or similar, trapezoidal cartridge or cartridge assembly and light transmitting sleeve or pipe or similar, or multisided geometries such as pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, octagonal, or and n-gonal (where &#x201c;n&#x201d; is the number of sides of the multisided shape) cartridge or cartridge assembly and light transmitting sleeve or pipe or similar.</p><p id="p-0631" num="0780">The alteration of a geometric feature or features of the cartridge outer diameter or dimension allows for control of the amount of airflow that may be drawn into the PVU by the user through the suction, or vacuum pressure, generated during inhalation. The airflow may be limited, restricted, of otherwise mediated through the modification of the geometries of the outer surface of the cartridge and inner surface of the light transmitting sleeve. It may be desirable to modify, mediate, or set the resistance of the device during inhalation, in one embodiment the draw resistance of the PVU would match the draw resistance of a typical smoking article such as a cigarette. In one embodiment, the airflow that flows into the device may be controlled such that it displaces the fluid from the distal wick, or the distal wick and proximal wick such that the air flow travels down the space between the outer surface of the cartridge and inner surface of the light transmitting sleeve and then is forced into the air intake port of the atomizer housing, once the airflow enters the atomizer housing it must passed through liquid or gel saturated wick material, such as a porous ceramic where the liquid or gel in the porous ceramic is forced as droplets or micro-droplets or as an aerosol of droplets or micro-droplets of the approximate size of the pores of the ceramic onto or in close proximity of the heating element to be vaporized.</p><p id="p-0632" num="0781">In some embodiments, for optimal PVU operation there may be an adjustment of the amount of allowable airflow to be correlated to the type of liquid or gel material being used in the vaporizer. Less airflow may be desirable for highly viscous or gel type materials and greater airflow may be desirable for less viscous and more liquid type material. As more liquid materials will diffuse more rapidly, or be more actively transported though capillary action by and through the wick material such that having a greater allowable airflow results in greater delivery of liquid material to the heating element or heating element proximity. Conversely, as more viscous or gel type material does not diffuse as rapidly as less viscous material and does not transfer by capillary action as quickly as less viscous material resultantly it would be desirable in order to effect optimal activation of the PVU to reduce the airflow such that the airflow is metered to account for the slower rate of transport of the more viscous or gel type material by diffusion or capillary action. This may allow for the metering of the airflow to corresponded the amount of fluid displaced from the wick or wicks such that am optimal fluid to air ratio is achieved to allow for optimal vaporization, volatilization, or aerosolization of the material for inhalation by the user. In another embodiment, the air intake fluid displacement ratio may be modulated, adjusted, configured such as to achieve a desirable particle size for the inhalation product (e.g. 1-3 micron, 3-5, micron, 3-10 micron, 5-10 micron, 5-15 micron, 10-20 micron, or greater then 15 micron, or greater then 20 micron particle size, or range of particle sizes, or similar) to achieve pulmonary delivery of the active compound or medicament(s), to the pulmonary vasculature, or to the oral pharyngeal mucosa, or to selectively the pulmonary vasculature and the oral pharyngeal mucosa or to both the pulmonary vasculature and the oral pharyngeal mucosa. In such an embodiment it may be desirable to deliver liquid components that have a flavor component to the oral mucosa such that the particles interact with the taste receptors on the user's tongue. In another embodiment, it may be desirable to deliver the medicament or active component to the oral mucosa or oral pharyngeal mucosa for slower systemic absorption or absorption than absorption or absorption achieved through the more rapid systemic absorption or absorption achieved by pulmonary deliver of the medicament(s). In another embodiment, it may be desirable to deliver the medicament to the pulmonary vasculature (e.g. nicotine to replicate the pharmacodynamics of nicotine delivered by smoking tobacco).</p><p id="p-0633" num="0782">Additionally, the light transmitting sleeve is positioned such that the proximal aspect of the light transmitting component is in contact or close proximity with a light emitting diode (LED) or LED array such that light from the LED is transferred, transmitted, or conveyed from the LED to the light transmitting sleeve. The light transmitting sleeve may be configured to be in proximity to the cartridge, or cartridge element of the cartridge assembly such that light is transferred, transmitted, or conveyed to the cartridge. This allows for the light transmitting sleeve and cartridge to send visual indicators to the user. Visual indicators may include indicators of device activation, cartridge status such as an empty cartridge or new cartridge or cartridge status in the range of either being new and fully or partially consumed, cartridge or cartridge assembly recognition such that the cartridge or cartridge assembly is recognized as being the correct cartridge, battery or capacitor or battery and capacitor status, charging status, remaining activation cycles, reminder notifications, device error(s), and similar.</p><p id="p-0634" num="0783">Following vaporization, volatilization, or aerosolization, collectively referred to in this paragraph as the &#x201c;vapor&#x201d; of the liquid or gel type material by the heating element airflow generated by the user forces the vapor out of the atomizer housing and related area of the heating element and proximal wick through a flow galley, or galleys, that serve as the aspiration tube.
