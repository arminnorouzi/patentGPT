They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the market place, each revision tends to become its own standard.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">The 802.11 family consists of a series of half-duplex over-the-air modulation techniques that use the same basic protocol. 802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family (c-f, h, j) are service amendments and extensions or corrections to the previous specifications.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4 GHz ISM band, operating in the United States under Part 15 of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b and g equipment may occasionally suffer interference from microwave ovens, cordless telephones, and Bluetooth devices. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively. 802.11a uses the 5 GHz U-NII band, which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, where adjacent channels overlap&#x2014;e.g., WLAN channels. Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">The segment of the radio frequency spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4 GHz amateur radio band. Licensed amateur radio operators may operate 802.11b/g devices under Part 97 of the FCC Rules and Regulations, allowing increased power output but not commercial content or encryption.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">Bluetooth is a wireless technology using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz from fixed and mobile devices, and in-building networks. Invented by telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994, it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization. Bluetooth is managed and oversees the development of the specification and manages the qualification program. Bluetooth technology is a global wireless communication standard that is present on a majority of mobile devices.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has evolved to develop a specification for a mesh network, Bluetooth Mesh Network, Version 1.0.1, Revision Date Dec. 2, 2020. BLE Mesh Network allows where every BLE IoT device can communicate with every other device within the same network and extends the distance and scope overall communication of a BLE IoT network.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">ZigBee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios. Its low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10-100 meters line-of-sight, depending on power output and environmental characteristics. ZigBee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking. ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">Zigbee is capable of a Mesh Network as defined in an IEEE Standard 802.15.4-200. Zigbee Mesh Network addresses low-power and close distance IoT systems.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">Wi-Fi has become a very ubiquitous, cost effective, and popular wireless network technology. Service and Network Providers are increasing their Wi-Fi services as a cost effective technology to provide wireless services. These Providers typically deploy Wi-Fi services using a wireless router and an Ethernet Access Switch or Network Interface Device (NID). The Ethernet Access Switch or NID provides data transport to and from the telecommunication network. The wireless router provides the media conversion and protocol processing of the data received from the Ethernet Access Switch or NID. The Ethernet Access Switch or Network Interface Device will typically have one or more SFP ports. The SFP port will be populated with an SFP device, which the SFP device will connect to the wireless router with a cable, as illustrated in prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">Communication equipment will typically use a secondary technology to provide information on device status, identity, and configuration to other devices. This secondary technology can also be used to provision or configure the device or communicate information to other remote devices or systems. This secondary technology is typically a wired technology and requires the use of a cable. The device will have a DB9 connector or RJ45 modular jack if RS232 is the communication protocol, as shown in prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. The device can also use an RJ45 modular jack if Ethernet is the communication protocol, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. The disadvantage of using wired technology for secondary communication is the added cost of the cable and the requirement to have a cable of proper length, wiring, and matching physical connectors. The cable also restricts the mobility of both the devices, where both devices must remain stationary to facility efficient communications.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">Mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets, or wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) devices cannot support large physical connectors such as a DB9 connector or an RJ45 modular jack. In addition, communications with mobile and wearable devices should not restrict the mobility of these devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">SFP devices are very popular due to the low cost, standardization, and interoperability. SFP devices have endured many functional and mechanical changes. Since the initial development of the SFP in 2000, there have been many SFP improvements in functionality and mechanical form factor, such as XFP, X2, SFP, SFP+, QSFP, QSFP+, and CXP technologies. Presently, SFP support optical, wire, or coax services, such as Ethernet, SONET, Fiber Channel, DS3, DS1, video, etc. SFPs supporting optical fiber service use an LC or SC connector. SFPs supporting wired Ethernet or DS1 services use an RJ45 modular connector. SFPs supporting wired DS3 or video services use a coax connector.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0034">Generally, the SFP of the present disclosure comprises a small pluggable housing, a printed circuit board (PCB) located in the housing, and wireless circuitry.

It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without such details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, hardware and/or circuitry have been described at a relatively high-level, without detail, in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present disclosure. While the description refers by way of example to wireless SFP devices and methods and systems, it should be understood that the method(s), system(s) and device(s) described herein may be used in any situation where wireless telecommunication services are needed or desired.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0119">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the wireless SFP device of the present disclosure replaces the Wi-Fi router, the SFP device in the NID, and the associated cabling and mounting hardware depicted in prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Due to the wireless SFP device conformance to applicable SFF specifications, the wireless SFP device can be installed and deployed by any equipment which supports SFP devices. In doing so, this allows any SFP supported equipment the added ability to provide wireless service. Further, the wireless SFP device of the present disclosure also simplifies the deployment and installation of wireless service by simply inserting the wireless SFP device into any equipment which supports SFP devices.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0120">Unlike the wired systems of prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a method and system of the present disclosure employs the use of a secondary wireless technology to communicate with equipment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Accordingly, the wireless SFP of the present disclosure uses wireless as additional technologies to communicate with devices. This additional wireless technology will be different than the Wi-Fi wireless technology, which Wi-Fi used as the primary data transport for the network. There may be two or more wireless technologies used to communicate with other mobile and wearable devices.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0121">Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee wireless technologies represent wireless technologies which one, two, or all these technologies will coexist. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz. Bluetooth is typically used as a secondary wireless communication method of mobile devices. The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies incorporated into the wireless SFP of the present invention allows for the provision of location and tracking of the wireless SFP, such that it is readily available or accessible during wireless service outage or maintenance.

The wireless SoC also includes a memory and a switch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the wireless system on a chip (SoC).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0133">(1a) SoC Processor</p><p id="p-0132" num="0134">The wireless SoC processor is a 32-bit ARM Cortex type processor which offers high CPU performance and is optimized for low interrupt latency, low power consumption, in a very small size. The processor provides protocol processing for the Wireless and Bluetooth sub-systems. The processor also provides other general status and maintenance tasks.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0135">(1b) SoC Wireless Sub-System</p><p id="p-0134" num="0136">The SoC wireless sub-system includes an 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac radio, physical layer interface (PHY), and media access controller (MAC). The radio is a dual-band WLAN RF transceiver that has been optimized for use in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The radio provides communications for applications operating in the globally available 2.4 GHz unlicensed ISM or 5 GHz U-NII bands. The wireless PHY provides signal processing, modulation and decoding of the received signal from wireless medium. The wireless MAC controls the access to the wireless PHY and mediates data collisions. The wireless MAC are comprised with transmit and receive controllers, transmit and receive FIFOs to buffer sending and receiving data, and circuitry to manage the RF system and the wireless PHY. The SOC wireless sub-system will interface to the antenna either through an antenna connector or without the antenna connector by means of an antenna etched on an extended PCB. The etch PCB antenna can achieve performance of 2 dB with minimal increase in the wireless SFP size. The use of an external antenna can achieve performance of 5 dB and the flexibility to position the external antenna by mean of a coaxial cable, as discussed above. The SoC will also support other wireless technologies such as IMT-2000 (4G), IMT-2020 (5G), and LoRa&#xae; and LoRaWAN&#xae; (trademarks of Semtech) exclusively or in combination with other wireless technologies.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0137">(1c) SoC Bluetooth Sub-System</p><p id="p-0136" num="0138">The SoC Bluetooth sub-system also includes an integrated Bluetooth radio and baseband core. The Bluetooth radio and baseband core is optimized for use in 2.4 GHz to provide low-power, low-cost, robust communications for applications operating in the globally available 2.4 GHz unlicensed ISM band. It is fully compliant with the Bluetooth Radio Specification and EDR specification and meets or exceeds the requirements to provide the highest communication link quality. Bluetooth Baseband Core (BBC) implements all of the time critical functions required for high-performance Bluetooth operation. The BBC manages the buffering, segmentation, and routing of data for all connections. It also buffers data that passes through it, handles data flow control, schedules transactions, monitors Bluetooth slot usage, optimally segments and packages data into baseband packets, manages connection status indicators, and composes and decodes packets and events.

IEEE 1588v2 is a standard that defines a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) used in packet networking to precisely synchronize the real Time-of-Day (ToD) clocks and frequency sources in a distributed system to a master ToD clock, which is synchronized to a global clock source. The Ethernet precision time block provides IEEE1588 and SyncE functionality. IEEE1588 standard defines the Precision Time Protocol (PIP) that enables precise synchronization of clocks in a distributed network of devices. The PTP applies to systems communicating by local area networks supporting multicast messaging. This protocol enables heterogeneous systems that include clocks of varying inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize. In both the transmit and receive directions <b>1588</b> packets are identified and timestamped with high precision. Software makes use of these timestamps to determine the time offset between the system and its timing master. Software can then correct any time error by steering the device's <b>1588</b> clock subsystem appropriately.

Each encryption type offers a compromise between service application speed, FPGA logic area, and customer application. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a 64-bit block cipher which uses a 56-bit key to encrypt or decrypt each block of data. Given the short key length, DES has been proven to be susceptible to brute force attacks and so is no longer considered secure for general use. Triple-DES (3DES) strengthens the security by combining three DES operations; an encrypt, a decrypt, and a final encrypt; each using a 56-bit key. This increases the effective key length, improving security. However, latterly 3DES has been superseded by the faster Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, although it still finds use in security protocols such as IPsec and SSI/TLS for legacy purposes.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0161">(6e) Host Interface Description</p><p id="p-0160" num="0162">The host interface performs the data conversion from the wireless SoC sub-system to an SDIO or Ethernet media independent interface format.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0163">(6f) Processor</p><p id="p-0162" num="0164">The processor is a dual-core ARM Cortex processor system.

This restriction is referred as &#x201c;SFP Lockout&#x201d;, which the communication equipment will only allow specific SFP devices to be installed or activated. The Service Provider or Network Administrator may have operational, administration, and maintenance procedures which may require the SFP device to be monitored, provisioned, authenticated, activated, or tested independently from the communication equipment or in sequence with other operational procedures or equipment. As an example, the Service Provider's method and procedures for the installation of new communication services may require the wireless SFP to be pre-provisioned and tested before provisioning or activating the primary wireless signal, or activating the communication equipment. The ability to use the secondary wireless technology will provide the Service Provider or Network Administrator the ability to pre-provision, test, or manage the WSFP Device <b>100</b> without coordinating with the communication equipment without disruption or performance degradation of the wireless Signal <b>500</b>. To provision, authenticate, and activate the WSFP Device <b>100</b> for 802.11 wifi service, the secondary wireless signal or channel will be used to set the Service Set Identifier (SSID) of the Network, the Band type (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz. Above 6 GHz, and other band types), channel number, encryption (Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2), functionality (Access Point or Station), IP Address, and other types of identification or configuration settings. Provisioning and activation for other wireless services such as 5G, LoRa, Zigbee would be similar in scope. QR code scan, zero-touch provisioning, or minimal touch provisioning are methodologies to minimize provisioning, authenticating, and activating the WSFP Device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0190">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the network includes Communication Equipment <b>400</b> having SFP Ports <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, and <b>408</b>.
