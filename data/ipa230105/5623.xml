The recovery is fast as the treatment starts early, and thus, it is important to have an early diagnosis and an early treatment. There are various diagnostic criteria for the depression, and a diagnostic method using machine learning is also proposed (for example, refer to Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a system described in Patent Document 1, at least one speech feature is calculated from speech patterns collected from patients, a statistical model for providing a score or evaluation with respect to a depressed state of the patient is learned on the basis of at least a part of the calculated speech feature, and a mental state of the patient is determined by using the statistical model. In Patent Document 1, as an example of the speech feature that is used in the machine learning, a rhythm feature, a low-level feature calculated from a short speech sample (for example, a length of 20 milliseconds), and a high-level temporary feature calculated from a long speech sample (for example, a speech level) are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a specific example of the rhythm feature, a voice break duration, measured values of pitches and energy over various extraction regions, mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), novel cepstral features, temporary fluctuation parameters (for example, a speaking rate, a prominence in a duration, the distribution of peaks, the length and the period of a pause, a syllable duration, and the like), speech periodicity, a pitch fluctuation, and a voice/voiceless ratio are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, as a specific example of the low-level feature, damped oscillator cepstral coefficients (DOCC), normalized modulation cepstral coefficients (NMCCs), medium duration speech amplitudes (MMeDuSA) feature, gammatone cepstral coefficients (GCCs), a deep TV, and a voice acoustic feature (acoustic phonetic: for example, formant information, an average Hilbert envelope curve, periodic and non-periodic energy in a subband, and the like) are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, as a specific example of the high-level temporary feature, an inclination feature, a Dev feature, an energy contour (En-con) features, a pitch-related feature, and an intensity-related feature are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a depression evaluation model described in Patent Document 1, three classifiers (a Gaussian backend (GB), decision trees (DT), and a neural network (NN)) are used as an example. In an embodiment using the GB classifier, a specific number of features (for example, four most excellent features) are selected, and a system combination is further executed with respect to the speech of the patient. By using such a depression evaluation model, a more accurate prediction than typical clinical evaluation can be provided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 1: JP-T-2017-532082</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In Patent Document 1 described above, it is described that several speech features are calculated from the speech pattern of the patient, and input to a machine learned depression evaluation model, and thus, the possibility of the depression can be predicted. However, it is only described to use at least one of the calculated speech features. In order to increase the accuracy of the prediction according to the machine learning, the number of feature values to be used is increased as one method, but there is a limit to improve a prediction accuracy only by increasing the number.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to further increase the prediction accuracy, for example, it is considered to comprehensively use a plurality of calculated feature values. Even in Patent Document 1 described above, it is described to use a normalized cross-correlation coefficient (refer to Paragraph [0028]). However, the cross-correlation is effective to the analysis of linear correlation between two feature values, but is not capable of grasping a non-linear relationship. In the speaking voice of the patient having the depression, a plurality of feature values have a non-linear relationship, and there is a possibility that the feature values are non-stationarily changed, and thus, it is not possible to sufficiently improve the prediction accuracy only by analyzing the cross-correlation of the feature values.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention has been made to solve such problems, and an object thereof is to enable a prediction accuracy of a possibility that a subject has a specific disease or a severity to be improved.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to attain the object described above, in the invention, a feature value calculation unit calculating a plurality of types of feature values on a time-series basis for each predetermined time unit by analyzing time-series data having a value changing on a time-series basis; a matrix calculation unit calculating a spatial delay matrix including a combination of a plurality of relation values by performing processing of calculating a relation value of the plurality of types of feature values to be included in a moving window having a predetermined time length, with respect to the plurality of types of feature values calculated on a time-series basis for each predetermined time unit, by delaying the moving window by a predetermined delay amount; a matrix operation unit calculating matrix unique data unique to the spatial delay matrix by performing a predetermined operation with respect to the spatial delay matrix; and a disease prediction unit inputting the matrix unique data to a learned disease prediction model and predicting a disease level of a subject are provided, and a relation value relevant to at least one of a detrended cross-correlation analytical value and a mutual information amount is calculated as the relation value of the plurality of types of feature values.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention configured as described above, the relation value including the detrended cross-correlation analytical value or the mutual information amount is calculated on the basis of the plurality of types of feature values calculated for each predetermined time unit from the time-series data having a value changing on a time-series basis, and thus, a relation value reflecting a non-linear and non-stationary relationship in the feature values can be obtained, and a disease level of a subject can be predicted on the basis of the relation value. Accordingly, by using the time-series data of the subject in which the relationship in the plurality of types of feature values is non-linearly and non-stationarily changed over time, the disease level of the subject (a possibility that the subject has a specific disease, a severity, or the like) can be predicted with a higher accuracy.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a functional configuration example of a prediction model generation device according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a functional configuration example of a disease prediction device according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram describing calculation contents of a spatial delay matrix calculated by a matrix calculation unit of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram describing the calculation contents of the spatial delay matrix calculated by the matrix calculation unit of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a functional configuration example of a prediction model generation device according to a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a functional configuration example of a disease prediction device according to the second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a three-dimensional tensor to be generated by a tensor generation unit of the second embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hereinafter, a first embodiment of the invention will be described on the basis of the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a functional configuration example of a prediction model generation device <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment. The prediction model generation device <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment generates a disease prediction model for predicting a possibility that a subject has a specific disease or a severity in a case where the subject has the specific disease. The disease prediction model is generated by using machine learning. In the first embodiment, as an example, a disease prediction model for predicting a possibility that a subject has depression or a severity is generated.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the prediction model generation device <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment includes a learning data input unit <b>11</b>, a feature value calculation unit <b>12</b>, a matrix calculation unit <b>13</b>, a matrix decomposition unit <b>14</b> (corresponding to a matrix operation unit), and a prediction model generation unit <b>15</b>, as a functional configuration. Such functional blocks <b>11</b> to <b>15</b> can also be configured by any of hardware, a digital signal processor (DSP), and software. For example, in a case of being configured by the software, each of the functional blocks <b>11</b> to <b>15</b> practically includes a CPU, a RAM, a ROM, and the like of a computer, and is attained by operating a disease prediction program stored in a recording medium such as a RAM, a ROM, a hard disk, or a semiconductor memory.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The learning data input unit <b>11</b> inputs a series of conversational voice data between a plurality of target people with known disease levels of depression and another person (an example of time-series data having a value changing on a time-series basis) as learning data. Here, the &#x201c;target people&#x201d; are patients having the depression and normal people not having the depression, and &#x201c;another person&#x201d; having conversation with such target people, for example, is a medical doctor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The disease level is a value corresponding to the severity of the depression of the target people, and is a value corresponding to a &#x201c;depression severity evaluation scale&#x201d; that is generally used as a severity scale for the depression. The depression severity evaluation scale, for example, is a Hamilton depression evaluation scale according to an expert interview (Hamilton depression rating scale: HAM-D), a simple depressive symptom scale to be evaluated by 16 self-completed evaluation scales (quick inventory of depressive symptomatology: QIDS-J), diagnostic criteria of the American Psychiatric Association (the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV), and the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Regarding the patients having the depression, the severity of the depression is specified by the advance diagnosis of the medical doctor or the self-diagnosis, on the basis of the depression severity evaluation scale described above, and the disease level according to the severity is applied to the conversational voice data as a correct answer label. In addition, regarding the normal people not having the depression, the lowest disease level (may be a zero value) is applied to the conversational voice data as a correct answer label. Note that, applying the correct answer label to the conversational voice data does not necessarily indicate that the data of the correct answer label is integrally configured with the conversational voice data, and the conversational voice data and the data of the correct answer label may exist as separate data but may be associated with each other.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The conversational voice data is voice data in which only the speech voice of the target people is extracted from voice data recording a free conversation between the target people and the medical doctor. The free conversation between the target people and the medical doctor, for example, is performed in the form of an interview for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. That is, a conversation in which the medical doctor asks the target people and the target people answer the question is repeated. Then, such a conversation is input by a microphone and recorded, acoustic features of the target people and the medical doctor are extracted from a series of conversational voices by using a known speaker recognition technology, and then, voice data of a speech part of the target people is extracted on the basis of a difference in the acoustic features.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this case, the voice of the medical doctor may be recorded in advance, and the acoustic feature may be stored, and thus, in a series of conversational voices between the target people and the medical doctor, a voice part having the stored acoustic feature or a feature close thereto may be recognized as the speech voice of the medical doctor, and the other voice part may be extracted as the voice data of the speech voice of the target people. In addition, when recognizing the speaker on the basis of the conversational voice, noise removal processing of extracting only the speaker voice by removing a noise such as an undesired sound or a reverberating sound, and other preprocessings may be performed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Note that, a method of extracting the voice data of the target people from the conversational voice between the target people and the medical doctor is not limited thereto. For example, in a case where the target people and the medical doctor have a conversation through a call or in a case where a conversation is performed through a remote medical care system or the like in which a terminal and a server are connected through a network, the voice data of the target people can be simply acquired by recording a voice to be input from a telephone or a terminal used by the target people.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The feature value calculation unit <b>12</b> calculates a plurality of types of acoustic feature values on a time-series basis for each predetermined time unit by analyzing the conversational voice data (the voice data of the speech voice of the target people) input by the learning data input unit <b>11</b>. The predetermined time unit indicates individual time unit in which the conversational voice of the target people is divided into short parts, and for example, a time of approximately several dozen milliseconds to several seconds is used as the predetermined time unit. That is, the feature value calculation unit <b>12</b> analyzes the conversational voice of the target people by dividing the conversational voice for each predetermined time unit, and calculates the plurality of types of acoustic feature values from each predetermined time unit, and thus, obtains time-series information relevant to the plurality of types of acoustic feature values.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Here, the acoustic feature value to be calculated may be different from the acoustic feature to be extracted when recognizing the speaker as described above. The feature value calculation unit <b>12</b>, for example, calculates at least two or more of a vocal intensity of the target people, a basic frequency, a cepstral peak prominence (CPP), a formant frequency, and a mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC). In such acoustic feature values, a feature unique to the patient having the depression may be exhibited.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Specifically, it is as follows.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0032">Vocal Intensity: The vocal intensity tends to be low in a case of the depressed patient.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0033">Basic Frequency: The basic frequency tends to be lower in a case of the patient having the depression, and a repeat count of a minimum period interval for a given length of time tends to be small.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0034">CPP: CPP is a feature value indicating the properties of breathlessness in the glottis, and is used as a measured value of the severity of a phonation disorder that may occur in the depressed patient.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0035">Formant Frequency: The formant frequency is a plurality of peaks that are temporally moved in a voice spectrum, indicates the first formant, the second formant, . . . , the N-th formant in ascending order of a frequency. It is known that the formant frequency is associated with the shape of the vocal tract, and there is a correlation between the depressive and a sound volume of the formant frequency.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0036">MFCC: MFCC is a feature value indicating the properties of the vocal tract, and can be an indirect index of the degree of a loss in muscle control of the depressed patients with different severities.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">The matrix calculation unit <b>13</b> calculates a spatial delay matrix including a combination of a plurality of relation values by performing processing of calculating a relation value of the plurality of types of acoustic feature values to be included in a moving window having a predetermined time length, with respect to the plurality of types of acoustic feature values calculated by the feature value calculation unit <b>12</b> on a time-series basis for each predetermined time unit, by delaying the moving window by a predetermined delay amount. Here, the matrix calculation unit <b>13</b> calculates at least one of an analytical value of detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) (hereinafter, referred to as a DCCA coefficient) and a mutual information amount, as the relation value of the plurality of types of acoustic feature values. At least one indicates that a spatial delay matrix with the DCCA coefficient as an individual matrix element may be calculated, a spatial delay matrix with the mutual information amount as an individual matrix element may be calculated, or both of the spatial delay matrices may be calculated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">The detrended cross-correlation analysis is one type of fractal analysis, and is a method of removing the trend of the linear relationship to be included in the time-series data with a difference operation, and then, of analyzing the cross-correlation. By performing the analysis by removing the trend of a linear relationship, a non-linear and non-stationary relationship of the plurality of acoustic feature values can be analyzed. That is, it is possible to represent the nonlinear relationship among multiple acoustic features, which is a non-stationary relationship that can vary over time, can be indicated by the time-series information of the DCCA coefficient.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">The mutual information amount is an amount indicating the scale of interdependence between two random variables, in a probability theory and an information theory, and can be said as the scale of an information amount shared by two acoustic feature values. For example, the mutual information amount indicates how accurately can the other acoustic feature value be assumed in a case where one acoustic feature value is specified, and for example. In a case where two acoustic feature values are completely independent from each other, the mutual information amount is zero. In other words, the mutual information amount can be said as an index indicating the degree of a linear or non-linear relationship between two acoustic feature values, and the non-linear and non-stationary relationship of the plurality of acoustic feature values can be indicated by the time-series information of the mutual information amount.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">Hereinafter, the calculation contents of the spatial delay matrix calculated by the matrix calculation unit <b>13</b> will be described by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

That is, unlike the first embodiment in which the eigenvalue that is a scalar value is calculated from the spatial delay matrix and input to the disease prediction model, the spatial delay matrix in which the information amount is not compressed is used as the input of the disease prediction model. Accordingly, a prediction accuracy of the possibility that the subject has the specific disease or the severity can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0081">Note that, here, an example of generating the three-dimensional tensor (a case of N=3 in claims) has been described, but N may be a value 1, 2, or 4 or more. In a case of N=2, one spatial delay matrix to be generated by the same processing as that in the first embodiment corresponds to a two-dimensional tensor. In a case of N=1, in one spatial delay matrix, a spatial delay matrix in which the value of any one of m and n is 1 corresponds to a one-dimensional tensor.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0082">In the first and second embodiments described above, an example of obtaining the conversational voice data by recording the free conversation between the target people or the subjects and the medical doctor in the form of an interview has been described, but the invention is not limited thereto. For example, a free conversation of the target people or the subjects in the daily life may be recorded, and the processing described in the embodiments may be performed by using the voice data.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0083">In addition, in the first and second embodiments described above, an example of predicting the disease level of the depression has been described, but the invention is not limited thereto. For example, the disease level may be predicted for individual items relevant to various aspects of the depressed state of the subject, such as sleeping difficulty, a mental symptom of anxiety, a physical symptom of anxiety, psychomotor suppression, and diminished interest.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0084">In addition, in the first and second embodiments described above, the improvement or the degeneration of the depressed state may be grasped by repeatedly performing the prediction of the disease level of the subject periodically or non-periodically.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0085">In addition, in the first and second embodiments described above, an example of calculating at least two or more of the vocal intensity, the basic frequency, CPP, the formant frequency, and MFCC, as the acoustic feature value, has been described, but this is merely an example, and other acoustic feature values may be calculated.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0086">In addition, in the first and second embodiments described above, an example of setting the predetermined delay amount to a fixed length of &#x3b4;=2 has been described, but the invention is not limited thereto. That is, the variation of the eigenvalue to be calculated from the spatial delay matrix may be further increased by calculating the spatial delay matrix with the predetermined delay amount as a variable length.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0087">In addition, in the first and second embodiments described above, an example of predicting the disease level by analyzing the conversational voice data has been described, but data having a value changing on a time-series basis is effective for obtaining the matrix decomposition value by calculating the spatial delay matrix using at least one of the DCCA coefficient and the mutual information amount.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0088">For example, the spatial delay matrix with the relation value including at least one of the DCCA coefficient and the mutual information amount as the individual matrix element can be calculated by analyzing video data obtained by photographing a human face and by extracting a plurality of types of feature values unique to the human face. As the feature value relevant to the face, for example, a ratio, an intensity, and an average duration of an expression (a bland expression, joyfulness, astonishment, angriness, and sadness) in a predetermined time unit, a possibility to move to the next expression, and the like can be used. In addition, as another feature value relevant to the face, things relevant to eye-blink, for example, a blink timing of left and right eyes, a temporal difference, and the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0089">In addition, as another example of the data having a value changing on a time-series basis, video data obtained by photographing the motion of a human body (for example, a head, a chest, shoulders, arms, and the like) can also be used. Note that, the time-series data capturing the motion of the human body is not necessarily video data. For example, the time-series data may be time-series data to be detected by an acceleration sensor, an infrared sensor, or the like.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0090">In addition, the calculation of the spatial delay matrix and the calculation of the matrix decomposition value may be performed by using the acoustic feature value extracted from the voice data of the conversational voice, the feature value relevant to the expression or the eye-blink extracted from the video data, and the feature value relevant to the body motion extracted from the video data or the sensor data as a multimodal parameter, and the prediction of the disease level may be performed by using the obtained matrix decomposition value.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0091">In addition, in the first and second embodiments described above, an example of using at least one of the DCCA coefficient and the mutual information amount as the relation value of the acoustic feature values has been described, but it does not intend to use only at least one of the DCCA coefficient and the mutual information amount, and other relation values may be used in combination. For example, a correlation coefficient of cross-correlation effective for grasping a linear relationship in two events can be further calculated, and the spatial delay matrix can also be calculated by adding the correlation coefficient. More specifically, in a case of using the multimodal parameter as described above, the feature value for calculating the relation value by using at least one of the DCCA coefficient and the mutual information amount, and the feature value for calculating the relation value by using the correlation coefficient of the cross-correlation or the other coefficients may be used differently.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0092">In addition, in the first and second embodiments described above, an example of predicting the disease level of the depression as an example of the disease has been described, but the predictable disease is not limited thereto. For example, dementia, insomnia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), integration disorder syndrome, a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other diseases relevant to neuropsychological disturbance can also be predicted.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0093">In addition, both of the first and second embodiments described above are merely a specific example for carrying out the invention, and the technical scope of the invention is not construed to a limited extent by the embodiments. That is, the invention can be carried out in various forms without departing from the gist or the main features thereof.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0104" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0094"><b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; Prediction model generation device</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0095"><b>11</b> Learning data input unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0096"><b>12</b> Feature value calculation unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0097"><b>13</b>, <b>13</b>&#x2032; Matrix calculation unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0098"><b>14</b> Matrix decomposition unit (matrix operation unit)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0099"><b>15</b>, <b>15</b>&#x2032; Prediction model generation unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0100"><b>16</b> Tensor generation unit (matrix operation unit)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0101"><b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; Disease prediction device</li>        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0102"><b>21</b> Prediction target data input unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0103"><b>22</b> Feature value calculation unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0011" num="0104"><b>23</b>, <b>23</b>&#x2032; Matrix calculation unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0012" num="0105"><b>24</b> Matrix decomposition unit (matrix operation unit)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0013" num="0106"><b>25</b>, <b>25</b>&#x2032; Disease prediction unit</li>        <li id="ul0004-0014" num="0107"><b>26</b> Tensor generation unit (matrix operation unit)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0015" num="0108"><b>100</b> Prediction model storage unit</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
