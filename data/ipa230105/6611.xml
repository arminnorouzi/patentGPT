Such personal audio devices may include circuitry for driving a pair of headphones or one or more speakers. Such circuitry often includes a power amplifier for driving an audio output signal to headphones or speakers. Generally speaking, a power amplifier amplifies an audio signal by taking energy from a power supply and controlling an audio output signal to match an input signal shape but with a larger amplitude.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example of an audio amplifier is a class-D amplifier. A class-D amplifier (also known as a &#x201c;switching amplifier&#x201d;) may comprise an electronic amplifier in which the amplifying devices (e.g., transistors, typically metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors) operate as electronic switches. In a class-D amplifier, a signal to be amplified may be converted to a series of pulses by pulse-width modulation (PWM), pulse-density modulation (PDM), or another method of modulation, such that the signal is converted into a modulated signal in which a characteristic of the pulses of the modulated signal (e.g., pulse widths, pulse density, etc.) is a function of the magnitude of the signal. After amplification with a class-D amplifier, the output pulse train may be converted to an unmodulated analog signal by passing through a passive low-pass filter, wherein such low-pass filter may be inherent in the class-D amplifier or a load driven by the class-D amplifier. Class-D amplifiers are often used due to the fact that they may be more power efficient than linear analog amplifiers, in that class-D amplifiers may dissipate less power as heat in active devices as compared to linear analog amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Class-D amplifiers may include single-ended output class-D amplifiers and differential output class-D amplifiers. Single-ended output class-D amplifiers may be preferable in some applications, as they may require a smaller amount of area compared to differential output class-D amplifiers, as a single-ended output class-D amplifier may require only a single output driver while a differential output class-D amplifier may require two output drivers. However, a disadvantage of a single-ended output class-D amplifier is that due to its single-ended nature, a common-mode current may flow through feedback paths of the single-ended output class-D amplifier to pulse-width modulation (PWM) input buffers of the single-ended output class-D amplifier at the input signal frequency, and such common-mode current may be input-signal dependent. Such common mode current may cause a differential component at twice the input signal frequency which may be amplified by the single-ended output class-D amplifier to create degradation in total harmonic distortion. Due to presence of even-order harmonics, power supply induced intermodulation distortion degradation may also occur.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, systems and methods for minimizing total harmonic distortion and power supply induced intermodulation distortion degradation in a single-ended output class-D PWM amplifier may be desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure, one or more disadvantages and problems associated with existing approaches to minimizing distortion in a Class-D pulse width modulation amplifier may be reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, an amplifier system may include a first stage having a plurality of inputs configured to receive a differential pulse-width modulation input signal and generate an intermediate signal based on the differential pulse-width modulation input signal, a quantizer configured to generate a modulated signal based on the intermediate signal, a single-ended class-D output stage configured to generate a single-ended output signal as a function of the differential pulse-width modulation input signal, a feedback network configured to feed back the single-ended output signal to a first input of the plurality of inputs and to feed back a ground voltage to a second input of the plurality of inputs, a plurality of buffers, each particular buffer configured to receive a respective component of the differential pulse-width modulation input signal and generate a respective buffered component, and an input network coupled between the plurality of buffers and the first stage.

In some embodiments of amplifier <b>16</b>, example input buffer <b>28</b>B may be used to implement one or more of input buffers <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, input buffer <b>28</b>B may include a biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>A and a buffering subcircuit <b>70</b>. Biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>A may include a pull-up device <b>56</b> (e.g., a p-type field-effect transistor) coupled to a source voltage VDD via a non-gate terminal and configured to always be activated (e.g., on), for example by tying its gate terminal to a ground voltage. Pull-up device <b>56</b> may be coupled in series with a pull-down device <b>58</b> (e.g., a n-type field-effect transistor) gate coupled to the output of an operational amplifier <b>60</b> and coupled to a ground voltage via a non-gate terminal. The output of biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>A (e.g., the node at which pull-up device <b>56</b> and pull-down device <b>58</b> are coupled to one another) may be fed back to a non-inverting input of operational amplifier <b>60</b>. The inverting input of operational amplifier <b>60</b> may be coupled to a voltage equal to one-half of source voltage VDD.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Buffering subcircuit <b>70</b> may be similar to input buffer <b>28</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, except that a level shifter <b>62</b> is interfaced between input signal component V<sub>IN </sub>(e.g., V<sub>IN_P </sub>or V<sub>IN_N</sub>) and the gate terminal of pull-down device <b>54</b>. Accordingly, level-shifter <b>62</b> may effectively limit the voltage driven to the gate terminal of pull-down device <b>54</b> to the lesser of input signal component V<sub>IN </sub>and the voltage output by operational amplifier <b>60</b>. As a result, the output of biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>A may be held to a voltage of approximately VDD/2, thus ensuring impedances of pull-up device <b>56</b> and pull-down device <b>58</b> are approximately equal across all operating and process conditions. In turn, by limiting the voltage driven to the gate terminal of pull-down device <b>54</b> using level shifter <b>62</b>, impedances of pull-up device <b>52</b> and pull-down device <b>54</b> may be approximately equal across all operating and process conditions, thus reducing or eliminating effects of common-mode current flowing through signal feedback network <b>26</b> to input buffers <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a circuit diagram of another example input buffer <b>28</b>C, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.

Further, the output of biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>B (e.g., the node at which pull-up device <b>56</b> and pull-down device <b>58</b> are coupled to one another) may be fed back to the non-inverting input of operational amplifier <b>60</b> via a low-pass filter <b>66</b>. As a result, the output of biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>B may be held to an average voltage of approximately VDD/2, thus ensuring impedances of pull-up device <b>56</b> and pull-down device <b>58</b> are approximately equal across all operating and process conditions.

However, in many practical applications, an input resistor <b>46</b> may have a variable resistance and thus may have multiple selectable gain taps for varying a gain of amplifier <b>16</b>. In such cases, each gain tap may require its own respective buffering subcircuit <b>70</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>.

In some embodiments of amplifier <b>16</b>, example input buffer <b>28</b>E may be used to implement one or more of input buffers <b>28</b>.

For instance, biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>C may include a combiner <b>61</b> in lieu of operational amplifier <b>60</b>, which may receive a digital signal indicative of VDD/2 and thus perform the same functionality of operational amplifier <b>60</b>, but only in the digital domain.

Thus, the output of biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>C (e.g., the node at which pull-up device <b>56</b> and pull-down device <b>58</b> are coupled to one another) may be fed back, in digital form, to the non-inverting input of combiner <b>61</b> via a digital low-pass filter <b>67</b> present in biasing subcircuit <b>50</b>C in lieu of analog low-pass filter <b>66</b>.
