Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wireless network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipment (UEs). A user equipment (UE) may communicate with a base station (BS) via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. As will be described in more detail herein, a BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNB, an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a New Radio (NR) BS, a 5G Node B, or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different user equipment to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. New Radio (NR), which may also be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). NR is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink (DL), using CP-OFDM and/or SC-FDM (e.g., also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink (UL), as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, further improvements in LTE, NR, and other radio access technologies remain useful.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, an apparatus for wireless communication at a user equipment (UE) for wireless communication includes a memory and one or more processors coupled to the memory, the memory and the one or more processors configured to: transmit to at least one vehicle UE, in accordance with a first update rate, a first set of position messages indicating position information associated with the UE; and transmit a second set of position messages in accordance with a second update rate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, an apparatus for wireless communication at a UE for wireless communication includes a memory and one or more processors coupled to the memory, the memory and the one or more processors configured to: transmit, to a pedestrian UE and based at least in part on a determination that an update request condition is satisfied, an update request message indicating a request for position information associated with the pedestrian UE; and receive, from the pedestrian UE, a position message based at least in part on the request for position information.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some aspects, an apparatus for wireless communication at a UE for wireless communication includes a memory and one or more processors coupled to the memory, the memory and the one or more processors configured to: transmit to at least one vehicle UE, in accordance with a first discontinuous transmission and reception cycle, a first set of position messages indicating position information associated with the UE and at least one additional UE; and receive, from the at least one additional UE and in accordance with a second discontinuous transmission and reception cycle, a second set of position messages indicating position information associated with the at least one additional UE.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some aspects, an apparatus for wireless communication at a UE for wireless communication includes a memory and one or more processors coupled to the memory, the memory and the one or more processors configured to: receive, from a vehicle UE and based at least in part on a determination that an update request condition is satisfied, an update request message indicating a request for position information associated with the UE; and transmit, to the vehicle UE, a position message based at least in part on the request for position information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some aspects, a first apparatus for wireless communication at a first UE for wireless communication includes a memory and one or more processors coupled to the memory, the memory and the one or more processors configured to: determine that a second UE comprises a cluster head for a cluster of UEs that includes the first UE and the second UE; and transmit, to the second UE and in accordance with a discontinuous transmission and reception cycle, a set of position messages indicating position information associated with the first UE.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Aspects generally include a method, apparatus, system, computer program product, non-transitory computer-readable medium, user equipment, base station, wireless communication device, and/or processing system as substantially described herein with reference to and as illustrated by the drawings and specification.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of examples according to the disclosure in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a macro BS for a macro cell <b>102</b><i>a, </i>a BS <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be a pico BS for a pico cell <b>102</b><i>b, </i>and a BS <b>110</b><i>c </i>may be a femto BS for a femto cell <b>102</b><i>c. </i>A BS may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells.

In some aspects, the BSs may be interconnected to one another and/or to one or more other BSs or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces, such as a direct physical connection or a virtual network, using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Wireless network <b>100</b> may also include relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a BS or a UE) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE or a BS). A relay station may also be a UE that can relay transmissions for other UEs. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a relay BS <b>110</b><i>d </i>may communicate with macro BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>d. </i>A relay BS may also be referred to as a relay station, a relay base station, a relay, or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes BSs of different types, such as macro BSs, pico BSs, femto BSs, relay BSs, or the like. These different types of BSs may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and different impacts on interference in wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro BSs may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 watts) whereas pico BSs, femto BSs, and relay BSs may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 watts).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to a set of BSs and may provide coordination and control for these BSs. Network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the BSs via a backhaul. The BSs may also communicate with one another, directly or indirectly, via a wireless or wireline backhaul.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., <b>120</b><i>a, </i><b>120</b><i>b, </i><b>120</b><i>c</i>) may be dispersed throughout wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, a subscriber unit, a station, or the like. A UE may be a cellular phone (e.g., a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device or equipment, biometric sensors/devices, wearable devices (smart watches, smart clothing, smart glasses, smart wrist bands, smart jewelry (e.g., smart ring, smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (e.g., a music or video device, or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, smart meters/sensors, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless or wired medium.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Some UEs may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. MTC and eMTC UEs include, for example, robots, drones, remote devices, sensors, meters, monitors, and/or location tags, that may communicate with a base station, another device (e.g., remote device), or some other entity. A wireless node may provide, for example, connectivity for or to a network (e.g., a wide area network such as Internet or a cellular network) via a wired or wireless communication link. Some UEs may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and/or may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband internet of things) devices. Some UEs may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). UE <b>120</b> may be included inside a housing that houses components of UE <b>120</b>, such as processor components and/or memory components. In some aspects, the processor components and the memory components may be coupled together. For example, the processor components (e.g., one or more processors) and the memory components (e.g., a memory) may be operatively coupled, communicatively coupled, electronically coupled, and/or electrically coupled.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, any number of wireless networks may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may also be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, or the like. A frequency may also be referred to as a carrier, a frequency channel, or the like. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs. In some cases, NR or 5G RAT networks may be deployed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some aspects, two or more UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., shown as UE <b>120</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>) may communicate directly using one or more sidelink channels (e.g., without using a base station <b>110</b> as an intermediary to communicate with one another). For example, the UEs <b>120</b> may communicate using peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocol (e.g., which may include a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol or a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) protocol), and/or a mesh network. In this case, the UE <b>120</b> may perform scheduling operations, resource selection operations, and/or other operations described elsewhere herein as being performed by the base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Devices of wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using the electromagnetic spectrum, which may be subdivided based on frequency or wavelength into various classes, bands, channels, or the like. For example, devices of wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using an operating band having a first frequency range (FR1), which may span from 410 MHz to 7.125 GHz, and/or may communicate using an operating band having a second frequency range (FR2), which may span from 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz. The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are sometimes referred to as mid-band frequencies. Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band. Similarly, FR2 is often referred to as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band. Thus, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies less than 6 GHz, frequencies within FR1, and/or mid-band frequencies (e.g., greater than 7.125 GHz). Similarly, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies within the EHF band, frequencies within FR2, and/or mid-band frequencies (e.g., less than 24.25 GHz). It is contemplated that the frequencies included in FR1 and FR2 may be modified, and techniques described herein are applicable to those modified frequency ranges.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided as an example.

The VUE1 and VUE2 may exchange information such as position information and/or motion information, among other examples. As is further shown, the VUE2 may be configured to communicate with a pedestrian UE (PUE) associated with a pedestrian (which may be referred to, for example, as a vulnerable road user (VRU)). In some cases, the VUE1 may communicate with the PUE. The VUE1 and/or the VUE2 may communicate with the PUE via a vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) system. The V2P system may be configured to facilitate the pedestrian's safety.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some cases, for example, VUE2 may track the position and velocity of PUEs (associated with VRUs) in its surroundings and may transmit a warning indication to vulnerable pedestrians if a collision is predicted. To enable tracking of the VRU, the PUE may transmit its position (e.g., obtained through GPS) to the VUE2 periodically using a public safety message (PSM) along with its identity. VRU tracking should be accurate to ensure an accurate prediction of a potential collision. Clearly, the more frequently the VRU sends updates (PSMs), the more accurately it can be tracked. However, sending frequent PSMs may result in unnecessarily rapid battery drainage and low spectrum efficiency.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is provided as an example.

In some cases, the VUE, the VRU1, the VRU2, and/or the VRU3 may communicate with one another using a V2P system.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some cases, a VUE may track pedestrians (e.g., the illustrated VRUs) using a Kalman filter that predicts a VRU's location within some confidence region, characterized by an error covariance matrix. For example, as shown, the VRU1 has a smaller confidence region <b>610</b> than a confidence region <b>620</b> associated with the VRU2 and a confidence region <b>630</b> associated with the VRU3. Between any two position information transmissions, the confidence region may widen over time due to uncertainty in the VRU's displacement. Frequent updates may prevent the confidence region from growing too large. The VRU3, which may be farther from the vehicle than the VRU1 and the VRU2, may be in no imminent danger of impact, due to the distance between the VRU3 and the vehicle. Accordingly, frequent transmissions of position information messages may be unnecessary for the VRU3 and may lead to increased power consumption and communication traffic.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Aspects of the techniques and apparatuses described herein provide for position message update rate adaptation for vehicle-to-pedestrian communications. In some aspects, for example, a PUE may change an update rate at which the position information is transmitted. In some aspects, the new update rate may be based at least in part on position information associated with vehicles, transmissions from one or more roadside units, and/or requested minimum update rates received from VUEs. In some aspects, the PUE may transmit position information only in response to a request received from a VUE. In some aspects, a cluster of UEs may be able to determine a cluster head that can communicate with a VUE. In this way, PUEs may transmit position information less frequently.
