The assistance provided can relate to overheating in such a UE. In a further aspect, it also relates to improvements in and relating to In Device Coexistence (IDC). It relates to fifth generation (5G) or New Radio (NR) systems, and to networks beyond 5G and other systems and devices can benefit from embodiments of the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0003">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of fourth generation (4G) communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved fifth generation (5G) or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x2018;Beyond 4G Network&#x2019; or a &#x2018;Post LTE System&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), Full Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud Radio Access Networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, Coordinated Multi-Points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">In the 5G system, Hybrid Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">The Internet, which is a human centered connectivity network where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to the Internet of Things (IoT) where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of Everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the Big Data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as &#x201c;sensing technology&#x201d;, &#x201c;wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure&#x201d;, &#x201c;service interface technology&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Security technology&#x201d; have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing Information Technology (IT) and various industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Meanwhile, UEs are typically portable, battery-operated devices intended for use by users while carrying on their normal activities.

Here the UE only sets legacy fields and can thus only indicate crude/rudimentary assistance information e.g. it can request network to reduce the total number of CCs without being able to indicate whether it prefers the network to reduce the number of carriers in MCG or SCG.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">In a second mode of operation, referred to as Mode 2, the UE can report additional information in an overheating event i.e. using new fields indicating its preferences for an NR SCG. The overheating assistance for SCG comprises the max number of component carriers, CCs, for SCG as well as some new fields i.e. a) maximum aggregated BW and b) MIMO layers. Only for these new fields, that concern preferences for NR SCG, the UE can provide a value per Frequency Range x (FRx) i.e. for the max number of CCs the UE cannot provide a value per FRx.

The legacy parameters are used in both modes. As mentioned before, the value of the UE preferences indicated by these legacy fields may depend on preferences indicated by the new fields for NR SCG.

For instance, upon moving to an MeNB supporting NR SCG overheating assistance, the UE shall include legacy overheating parameters even if the value would be same as it indicated before. This also means that network shall assume that for parameters that are not signalled anymore, any previously indicated value is to be cleared. Such operation can be illustrated by an example:</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">At T1 a UE connected to a legacy MeNB reports its preference for legacy parameter reducedMaxCCs</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">At T2 the UE moved to an MeNB supporting NR SCG overheating assistance, and now only reports preferences for NR SCG i.e. maxBW for FR2.

For this single list, the number of entries is equal to the total number of entries across the multiple lists for the original fields, and listed in a defined order.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">Clarification is provided regarding the total size and the ordering as shown in the following example.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0116">If network/UE includes xxListComb, the number of entries included corresponds to the total entries across in xxListYy and xxListYy2, and with entries corresponding to xxListYy2 placed after the entries corresponding to xxListYy and with entries in the first part in the same order as in xxListYy and, likewise, entries in second part listed in the same order as in xxListYy2.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">Benefits of such an approach include helping to avoid errors i.e. due to forgetting extension for some of the multiple lists (as in NR BC example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>) and helping to reduce specification size (as shown for LTE example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). Moreover, the signalling overhead is slightly reduced (i.e. as there is just a single length determinant for the list)</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>show alternative approaches to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, for two different cases. In the first case, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, the additional parameters that were added in v1310 are replaced by a single combined list (freqPriorityListCombEUTRA) that has a larger number of entries (i.e. 16 rather than 8 frequencies), as the list was extended (i.e. covering the original list size, first 8 entries, and its extension, the additional 8 entries).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">If the network includes freqPriorityListCombEUTRA, the number of entries included corresponds to the total entries across in freqPriorityListEUTRA and freqPriorityListExtEUTRA, and with entries corresponding to freqPriorityListExtEUTRA placed after the entries corresponding to freqPriorityListEUTRA and with entries in the first part in the same order as in freqPriorityListEUTRA and, likewise, entries in second part listed in the same order as in freqPriorityListExtEUTRA.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0120">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the original single lists can already support the extensions placed within NEDC-Only, when the total number of supported BCs did not increase merely due to introduction of NEDC. In this case the UE includes within supportedBandCombinationList-v15x0 two parts i.e. first the entries corresponding to supportedBandCombinationList (again listed in same order as in that field) and after that the entries corresponding to supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only (again listed in same order as in that field)</p><p id="p-0125" num="0121">A further embodiment of the disclosure concerns the signalling aspects related to so called early measurements that the network may configure the UE to perform. These early measurements are performed while the UE is in an idle or an inactive mode. The latest results of these measurements are stored by the UE. If stored, the UE indicates availability of the measurement results when establishing or resuming a connection with the network. The network may subsequently request the UE to provide the results using the UE information procedure, which comprises a request and response message. Alternatively, the network may request the UE to provide the results during connection resumption, in which case the network blindly issues the request i.e. is not yet aware whether the UE has results available. In case the UE does not have results available, it simply ignores the blind request.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0122">The early measurement reporting feature was introduced in Release 14 (R15) of the 3GPP LTE/EUTRA standards. R15 of the 3GPP standards introduced support for 5G or NR. Correspondingly, R15 of the LTE standards were extended to cover early measurement reporting for NR frequencies, primarily to assist the network to expedite configuration of dual connectivity with LTE (EUTRA) used for the master cell group (MCG) and NR for the secondary cell group (SCG) i.e. EN-DC.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0123">The R14 early measurement procedures to involve signalling of:</p><p id="p-0128" num="0124">SIM includes a field by which the network can basically indicate that it supports early measurements</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">UE can indicate availability of results upon transition to connected i.e by a field in SetupComplete, ResumeComplete</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">UEInformationRequest includes a field by which the network can request the UE to provide early measurement results</p><p id="p-0131" num="0127">UEInformationResponse includes a field by which the UE can provide early measurement results</p><p id="p-0132" num="0128">This embodiment relates to different ways to extend the signalling to support early measurement reporting for NR frequencies, given that there is a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0129">In a first option, that is the simplest, one additional field is introduced: i.e. an additional field in SIB2 indicating that the network supports early measurement reporting for NR frequencies. In this case, the procedure is as follows:</p><p id="p-0134" num="0130">The UE uses the existing field to indicate availability of early measurement results, both for LTE and NR frequencies. i.e. the field will be used even if the UE only has results for NR frequencies</p><p id="p-0135" num="0131">The Network uses the existing field to request early measurement results. When receiving the request, the UE provides measurement result for LTE frequencies as in R14. In addition, the UE also includes results for NR frequencies it has available, but only if the new NR specific field in SIB2 indicates that the network supports this</p><p id="p-0136" num="0132">In a second option, a further additional field is introduced, specifically indicating availability of results for NR frequencies. In this case, there are more changes required to the standards specification and the procedure becomes as follows:</p><p id="p-0137" num="0133">The UE uses the existing field to indicate availability of early measurement results for LTE frequencies. The UE uses the new field to indicate availability of results for NR frequencies</p><p id="p-0138" num="0134">The Network uses the existing field to request early measurement results. If the field is set, the UE provides measurement results in the same manner as in the first option, above.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0135">In the second option, the network becomes aware whether the UE only has results for NR frequencies and can thus avoid initiating information retrieval when not interested in such results.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0136">As mentioned previously, IDC is of interest and additional issues arise in NR, as its bands comprise a relatively large bandwidth and the network may configure the UE to operate in a particular portion of such frequency band.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>show some of the issues involved, namely:</p><p id="p-0142" num="0138">What the ARFCN (absolute radio frequency channel number) indicates precisely</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">The UE operation regarding the portion of the band for which to report IDC, depending on whether the network signals a bandwidth parameter or not</p><p id="p-0144" num="0140">In the prior art, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>, the ARFCN signalled to the UE was interpreted to merely indicate the frequency band and the network could set it to some defined reference frequency within the band e.g. the centre of the band or the so-called pointA as defined in 3GPP standards. In such a case, the UE may have to provide an IDC indication whenever it detected IDC issues anywhere in the concerned frequency band even if the IDC issues related only to a limited portion of the band i.e. a limited frequency range. In this case, the network signals only a single ARFCN for a given frequency band.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0141">In a first embodiment of this disclosure, ARFCN does not indicate the entire band but rather the specific centre frequency within the concerned frequency band around which UE is requested to report IDC. In this case, the UE provides an IDC indication when it detects IDC issues within a limited portion centred around the indicated ARFCN. In this case, the network does not signal the bandwidth to monitor, different UEs may monitor IDC issues for different bandwidth portions e.g. depending on their capabilities. This is illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>which illustrates how two UEs (UE1 and UE2), given the same ARFCN will actually monitor different bandwidths according to their own configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>also illustrates that the network can actually signal multiple ARFCNs for a given frequency band, as shown by ARFCN1 and ARFCN2. In this way, the network can determine that although the UE experiences IDC issues around ARFCN1, it may have no IDC issues in the band portion centred around ARFCN2.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0142">In a second embodiment of this disclosure, the network explicitly signals ARFCN, in addition to the bandwidth, BW, for which the UE shall report IDC issues. In this case, there is no doubt about the exact frequency range over which the UE is required to report IDC issues. Also, if the UE provides an IDC report, the network clearly knows which portion of the frequency band is affected by IDC problems and should therefore be avoided. i.e. this concerns the portion centred on ARFCN-2 and having the indicated bandwidth BW. This is illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>, which also shows that the network may still request different UEs to report IDC around different ARFCNs and/or for different BW. Note that the band portion for UE2 is different for each ARFCN, indicating that UE2 is asked to monitor different bandwidths for each ARFCN.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0143">In a further embodiment of this disclosure, in the case, above, where the BW is not indicated to the UE, then, the BW used for UE reporting is derived from the UE capabilities. If this is derived from UE capabilities according to some defined rule, the network would know which BW the UE employed when reporting IDC issues.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0144">UE capabilities clarify what BW the UE can support for different possible configurations, in particular for different supported band combinations (BCs). One option is that the BW that UE uses for reporting IDC for a band can be the largest BW it supports for the concerned band across all supported band combinations including the concerned band as it indicated within the UE capabilities. As an example, if a band b1 is supported for 3 BCs (BC-a, BC-b, BC-c), with BW values respectively 10, 20 and 10 MHz. In such a case, the UE reports IDC if within a BW of 20 MHz, IDC issues are detected or expected.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0145">If in the above example, the IDC issue is outside the centre 10 MHz, the UE will suffer from IDC problems only for BC-a and BC-c, but not for BC-b. The network may, however, have to refrain from configuring any of the three BCs, when unaware of the further details.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0146">Another option would be that the UE applies the BW that the UE supports for the concerned band for all of the supported BCs including the concerned band. In the example above, this would be 10 MHz. Other options are however not excluded.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0147">In case the UE is configured with a band combination including the band for which it is requested to report IDC issues, another option would be that UE applies the BW portion (or BWP) that the UE is actually configured to use. Alternatively, even if configured with a BC including the concerned band, the UE may still use for IDC reporting the BW according to a rule based on UE capabilities as described above. The alternative option may be more appropriate if the ARFCN indicated in the IDC configuration is outside the frequency range/BWP that UE is currently using.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0148">The following concerns LTE IDC for an NR BW portion, and the signalling related thereto.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0149">In a first case, the network indicates ARFCN for each BW portion to monitor. Prior art signalling may be sufficient. However, a larger number of ARFCNs may be needed so, for instance, four ARFCNs may be configured to a particular band. ASN.1 variants achieving the same or similar also apply.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example of a configuration which illustrates this first case.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0151">In a second case, the network indicates ARFCN plus BW for each BW portion to monitor. The known prior art signalling requires an extension, at least to indicate BW.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0152">As before, a larger number of ARFCNs may be needed so, for instance, four ARFCNs may be configured to a particular band.
