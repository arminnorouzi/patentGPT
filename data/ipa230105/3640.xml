The present invention furthermore refers to the use of such a LWIR imaging system as well as to the LWIR imaging system itself.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Printing of substrates, for example papers, with printing inks is a wide known technique. Newspapers, leaflets, labels, pictures etc. are nowadays printed with various printing techniques and printing colors. The print on the substrate can be detected by human eyes, but only if there is a further light source like sun light. Furthermore, the print can only be detected if the colour of the print and the substrate are different. However, in some cases it is desirable to detect the printing or coating on a substrate even in the dark. Furthermore, it is desirable to print or coat a substrate with a pattern that is not visible or hardly visible to human eyes, but can be detected easily with other detecting methods, for example, by irradiation with Infra Red (IR) light.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">IR light has a longer wavelength than visible light. Even if IR light shares many of the properties of visible light, its different wavelength has several unique characteristics. For example, materials that are opaque to visible light may be transparent to IR, and vice-versa. Furthermore, IR light is much less subject to scattering and absorption by smoke or dust than visible light, and IR light cannot be seen by the human eye. Contrary to visible light that is emitted by objects only at very high temperatures, IR energy is also emitted by all objects at temperatures higher than 0 Kelvin (&#x2212;273.15&#xb0; C.). Therefore, IR energy is omnipresent all the time, even in the dark and at very low temperatures. Different objects emit varying amounts of IR energy, depending on the temperature of the object and their emissivity. IR detecting devices can sense or detect differing intensities of IR energy coming from the various areas of a scene. Usually, an IR detecting device converts the detected electromagnetic radiation to corresponding intensities of visible light by electronics, for example a computer device for display purposes. This permits true see-in-the-dark capability as well as the ability to observe thermal properties under all light conditions. Furthermore, this permits the ability to detect structural differences on objects or within objects, for example, due to different compounds, that are not detectable by the human eye.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">IR detecting devices and methods are known to the skilled person, for example from US2018157012 A1 that refers to an infrared optical system using the wavelength range of 3 to 5 &#x3bc;m, in the order from an object side, a first lens having a negative power and formed with a convex meniscus toward an object, a second lens that is convex on both sides, and a cold aperture.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">TW200511592 A refers to an IR camera system which includes an array of thermally-tunable optical filter pixels, an NIR source and an NIR detector array.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">CN107729907 A refers to an infrared thermal imaging system-based fault recognition method, the method comprising the steps of shooting electric equipment by adoption of an infrared thermal imaging system so as to obtain an infrared image of the electric equipment and fusing the infrared image of the electric equipment after the expansion processing with a visible image of original electric equipment so as to differentiate heating targets in the electric equipment from surrounding background.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 9,204,109 B1 refers to IR detection of small cracks during fatigue testing and especially, a process for producing a small crack in a turbine rotor blade for use in training inspectors to be qualified for inspecting blades with small crack, where each blade is vibrated in order to initiate a small crack under observation using an IR camera that can detect for a small crack, and when a small crack at a desired size is produced on the blade, the vibration is stopped and the blade removed and then used in a training process to train and qualify an inspector for an inspection process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">US20080042063 A1 refers to an IR imaging system including a lens module and an imaging module coupled to the lens module, wherein the lens module includes a barrel defining a through hole, at least one lens received in the through hole and an IR bandpass filter received in the barrel and configured for filtering out visible light.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, not only the print or coating on the substrate but also the substrate itself is detectable by an IR detecting device. Often the scattered and/or emitted and/or reflected electromagnetic radiation by the substrate itself and the scattered and/or emitted and/or reflected electromagnetic radiation by the print or coating interfere or are superposed and, therefore, detection of the print or coating is impossible. Furthermore, the devices for detecting prints or coatings on a substrate or within a substrate are often large and unhandy and need special settings and/or equipment. Additionally, focusing with such devices is often not possible or complicated and complex and, therefore, the detected prints or coatings on the substrate or within the substrate are blurred and unclear and the information contained in these prints or coatings cannot be read out.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is a need for providing an improved method for detecting prints or coatings on a substrate or within a substrate that are not or only hardly detectable by the human eye, but can be detected easily by an IR detecting device. Furthermore, there is a need for a method that detects prints or coatings on a substrate or within a substrate that do not interfere with the substrate or parts of the substrate. Additionally, the method should keep the substrate as well as the print or coating on the substrate intact and not destroy them. The method should be easily performable and should be safe for the operator. Furthermore, there is a need for providing an improved LWIR imaging system that avoids or reduces the problems described above in relation to the known imaging systems. More precisely, there is a need for providing a LWIR imaging system for detecting prints or coatings on a substrate or within a substrate that are not or hardly detectable by the human eye, but can be detected easily by an IR detecting device. Furthermore, there is a need for providing a LWIR imaging system for detecting prints or coatings on a substrate or within a substrate that do not interfere with the substrate or parts of the substrate. Furthermore, the substrate as well as the print or coating on the substrate should not be destroyed by the LWIR imaging system. Additionally, it is desirable that the LWIR imaging system is small, lightweight, compact and/or transportable and preferably can be operated as a handheld device. The device can be, for example, an all-in-one device or a multi component system or a snap-on device or the like. Furthermore, the operation of the LWIR imaging system has to be easily and safe for the operator and should work efficient, fast, reliable and/or accurate. Especially, there is a need for providing a LWIR imaging system with a simple to operate focusing mechanism in order to image the prints or coatings on the substrate or within the substrate clearly, sharp and focused.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One or more of the foregoing objects have been solved by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for detecting an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of a substrate or within a substrate, the method comprising the steps of</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">i) providing a LWIR imaging system, the LWIR imaging system comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a) an infrared light emitting source that emits over the whole range of 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">b) a LWIR detecting device and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">c) a ToF distance sensor,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">ii) providing a substrate comprising an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of the substrate or within the substrate,</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">ii) irradiating the provided substrate with the infrared light emitting source and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">iii) detecting, with the LWIR detecting device and using and/or based on the TOF distance sensor, the intensity of electromagnetic radiation scattered, emitted and/or reflected by the substrate and the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">According to another aspect of the present invention, a LWIR imaging system for detecting an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of a substrate or within a substrate is provided, the system comprising<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0021">a) an infrared light emitting source that emits over the whole range of 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0022">b) a LWIR detecting device configured to detect the intensity of electromagnetic radiation scattered, emitted and/or reflected by the substrate and the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0023">c) a ToF distance sensor configured to determine a distance between the substrate and the LWIR detecting device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0024">The inventors surprisingly found that if a substrate is provided comprising an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of the substrate and/or within the substrate, this structure can be detected with a LWIR imaging system and using and/or based on the TOF distance sensor, if the LWIR imaging system comprises an infrared light emitting source that emits over the whole wavelength range of 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m, a LWIR detecting device and a ToF distance sensor. More precisely, the inventors have surprisingly found that the LWIR imaging system according to the present invention can be used to detect an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of a substrate or within a substrate by irradiating a substrate comprising an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of a substrate or within a substrate with an infrared light emitting source that emits over the whole range of 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m and detecting the intensity of electromagnetic radiation scattered, emitted and/or reflected by the substrate and the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts due to the irradiation with a LWIR detecting device. Additionally, the inventors surprisingly found that the ToF distance sensor in the LWIR imaging system provides different advantages. According to one embodiment it can be used as a simple to operate focusing mechanism. By this focusing mechanism the pictures or patterns of the prints or coatings on the substrate or within the substrate can be imaged clearly, sharp and focused without complex settings. Furthermore, it can be used to determine and/or measure the distance between the LWIR imaging system and the substrate based on and/or using the ToF distance sensor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">In particular, the ToF distance sensor, after calibration, allows for the capturing of an image and/or ranges of images being partially and/or completely in focus, out of images captured not only from flat surfaces, but also on distorted, curved or angled surfaces. This is achieved by combing sharp areas taken from several partially sharp areas of several images, captured during the image capturing process. Such image capturing process is characterized by the set triggering distance. In focus, from a physical point of view, has to understood as the image point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">Furthermore, the distance between the LWIR imaging system and the substrate may be adjusted based on and/or using the ToF distance sensor. This may be done, for example, by instructing a user and/or providing user instructions to a user to increase or decrease the distance between the LWIR imaging system and the substrate. By such an adjustment the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the substrate or within the substrate is focusable with the LWIR detection device. The method of the present invention may comprise another step of focusing the LWIR detecting device onto the substrate based on determining a distance between the LWIR imaging system and the substrate using the ToF distance sensor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">Substrates such as, for example, papers, sheets, foils, cardboards, polymer films, woven or non-woven polymeric textiles comprising an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of the substrate or within the substrate such that the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts is not or only hardly detectably by the human eye are known to the skilled person. The manufacture or application of such substrates with amorphous and/or crystalline structures of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of the substrate or within the substrate is known to the skilled person and, for example, described in EP3067214 B1. The methods and materials described therein are incorporated herein by reference. If the substrate comprising the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts is irradiated with infrared light at least over the whole wavelength range of 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m, the intensity of electromagnetic radiation emitted, scattered and/or reflected by the substrate and the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts can be detected with the inventive LWIR (longwave infrared) imaging system. The inventors surprisingly found that by the above described method and especially by the LWIR imaging system, the prints or coatings comprising the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts can be easily detected without destroying or damaging the substrate and the print or coating. Furthermore, the inventors surprisingly found that by the above LWIR imaging system, the electromagnetic radiation emitted, scattered and/or reflected by the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts can be easily detected since it does not or not significantly interfere with the substrate, especially if the substrate comprises cellulose. Furthermore, the above LWIR imaging system is small, light, compact and/or transportable and can be operated as a handheld device. Additionally the operation of the LWIR imaging system is easily and safe for the operator.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">According to another aspect of the present invention, the LWIR imaging system according to the present invention is used for detecting the intensity of the contrast of electromagnetic radiation emitted, scattered and/or reflected by a substrate and an amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts, due to the irradiation with the infrared light emitting source. Which is the contrast of the printed area comprising the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts, versus the non-printed area of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0024"

LWIR is part of the infrared (IR) spectrum.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0080">Infrared radiation (IR) is electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths than those of visible light, and is therefore generally invisible to the human eye. It is also known as infrared light. IR wavelengths extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430 THz), to 1 millimeter (300 GHz). The infrared comprises the near infrared (NIR), the short wavelength infrared (SWIR), the mid wavelength infrared (MWIR) and the long wavelength infrared (LWIR). The NIR refers to a range of 0.75 to 1.4 &#x3bc;m, having a frequency of 214 to 400 THz, and a photon energy of 886 to 1653 meV.

It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment and afterwards by the transformation of the adsorbed light to a vibrational force. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range and is known to the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0082">A LWIR detecting device according to the present invention is a detection device that can detect LWIR. Such detecting devices are known to the skilled person and commercially available.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0083">According to one embodiment of the present invention the LWIR detecting device is a bolometer or a sensor comprising mercury cadmium telluride and preferably the LWIR detecting device is a bolometer.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0084">A bolometer is a device for measuring the power or intensity of electromagnetic radiation via the heating of a material with a temperature-dependent electrical resistance. A bolometer consists of an absorptive element, such as a thin layer of metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal link. The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir&#x2014;the greater the absorbed power, the higher the temperature. The intrinsic thermal time constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir. The temperature change can be measured directly with an attached resistive thermometer, or the resistance of the absorptive element itself can be used as a thermometer. Metal bolometers usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films. Alternatively the bolometer may use a semiconductor or a superconductor absorptive element rather than a metal. Bolometers are known to the skilled person and are commercially available, for example from Seek Thermal, (https://www.thermal.com); Thermal Expert (http://www.i3-thermalexpert.com); Flir, (https://www.flir.com); or Ulis, (https://www.Ulis-ir.com).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0085">Alternatively, a sensor comprising mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) can be used as LWIR detecting device. HgCdTe or mercury cadmium telluride (also cadmium mercury telluride, MCT, MerCad Telluride, MerCadTel, MerCaT or CMT) is an alloy of cadmium telluride (CdTe) and mercury telluride (HgTe) with a tunable bandgap spanning the shortwave infrared to the very long wave infrared regions. The amount of cadmium (Cd) in the alloy can be chosen so as to tune the optical absorption of the material to the desired infrared wavelength. CdTe is a semiconductor with a bandgap of approximately 1.5 electronvolts (eV) at room temperature. HgTe is a semimetal, which means that its bandgap energy is zero. Mixing these two substances allows one to obtain any bandgap between 0 and 1.5 eV. Such a device is known, for example, from U.S. Pat. No. 5,828,068 A.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0086">The intensity of the scattered, emitted and/or reflected electromagnetic radiation by the substrate and the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts due to the irradiation with the infrared light emitting source of the LWIR imaging system is detected with the LWIR detecting device. More precisely, when a substrate as mentioned below is irradiated with infrared light at least over the whole wavelength range of 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m, the atoms and molecules of the substrate comprising the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of the substrate or within the substrate are stimulated and, therefore, scatter and/or emit electromagnetic radiation that can be detected with a LWIR detecting device even if the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts is not or only hardly detectably by the human eye. There are differences in the absorption of the infrared light of amorphous and/or crystalline structures of phosphate and/or sulphate salts and the substrate, especially if the substrate comprises cellulose. These differences can be detected when detecting the intensity of electromagnetic radiation scattered and/or emitted and/or reflected by the substrate and the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate. The differences in the absorption occur because the energy (wavelength) and the intensity is determined by the possible vibrational modes in the excited substance, which is dependent on the type of atoms and the atomic arrangements present in the specific substance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="2">The ToF Distance Sensor</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0087">According to feature c) the LWIR imaging system comprises a ToF distance sensor.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0088">A ToF distance sensor is a sensor that can determine and/or measure the distance from the sensor to the subject. ToF is the abbreviation for &#x201c;Time of Flight&#x201d;. The ToF distance sensor employs time-of-flight techniques to resolve the distance between the sensor and the subject for each point of the image, by measuring the round trip time of an artificial light signal provided by a solid state device called VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser). The ToF distance sensor of the present invention emits and detects between 800 and 1500 nm (in the near infrared NIR), preferably between 815 and 1200 nm, more preferably 830 and 1000 nm and most preferably at about 850 nm. Therefore, the ToF distance sensor does not interact with the infrared light emitting source and the LWIR detecting device of the present invention. More precisely, the infrared light emitting source of the present invention emits over the whole range of 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m which is above the range of 800 to 1500 mm. Furthermore the LWIR detecting device detects at 8 to 14 &#x3bc;m and, therefore, above the range of 800 to 1500 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0089">ToF distance sensors usually comprise an illumination unit, an imaging sensor, imaging optics and processing electronics. The illumination unit illuminates the scene and normally uses infrared light to make the illumination unobtrusive. The imaging sensor can comprise several pixels and each pixel measures the time the light takes to travel from the illumination unit (VCSEL) to the object and back to the focal plane array. Alternatively, the imaging sensor can comprise only one pixel. Several different approaches are used for timing. The imaging optics can comprise one or more lenses and gather the reflected light and images the environment onto the image sensor (focal plane array). Often an optical band-pass filter is present that only passes the light with the same wavelength as the illumination unit. This helps suppress non-pertinent light and reduce noise. The processing electronics drives the ToF sensor so as to, among several features, filter out light of frequencies different from the ones emitted, scattered and/or reflected by the illumination unit but having a similar wavelength (typically the sunlight). By filtering out unwanted wavelengths or frequencies, background light can effectively be suppressed. The processing electronics further include drivers for both the illumination unit and the imaging sensor so that these components can accurately be controlled in synchrony to ensure that an accurate image capture or distance of a single point is performed and that a reliable depthmap of the scene is determined. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the ToF distance sensor measures the distance to one point, on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0090">Several different ToF distance sensors are available, such as RF-modulated light sources with phase detectors, range gated imagers or direct time of flight imagers. RF-modulated light sources with phase detectors work by modulating the outgoing beam with an RF carrier, then measuring the phase shift of that carrier on the receiver side. Range gated imagers have a built-in shutter in the image sensor that opens and closes at the same rate as the light pulses are sent out. Because part of every returning pulse is blocked by the shutter according to its time of arrival, the amount of light received relates to the distance the pulse has traveled. Direct time of flight imagers measure the direct time-of-flight required for a single laser pulse to leave the camera and reflect back onto the focal plane array.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0091">ToF distance sensors are known to the skilled person, for example from US20140240692 A1, WO2015097284 A1, EP3191870 A1 or EP2743724 B1 and are commercially available, for example from, Terabee under the trade name Terabee 3DCAM 80&#xd7;60 or Teraranger EVO 64PX or from STMicroelectronics under the trade name VL53L1X, VL6180X or VL53LOX or from AMS under the trade name TMF8701 or TMF8801 or from Sony under the trade name IMX456QL.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0092">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ToF distance sensor is located in the beam path between the infrared light emitting source and the LWIR detecting device. The &#x201c;beam path&#x201d; in the meaning of the present invention is the path of the infrared light from the infrared light emitting source to the LWIR detecting device. This beam path can be in the geometrical form of a line. However, by lenses, mirrors and further devices, the beam path can be deflected. Furthermore, the beam path can be deflected by the substrate itself as well as by the amorphous and/or crystalline structure of phosphate and/or sulphate salts on the surface of the substrate or within the substrate.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0093">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ToF distance sensor is equidistant from the infrared light emitting source and the LWIR detecting device.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0094">However, the ToF distance sensor can be located at another position in the LWIR imaging system. For example, the ToF distance sensor is located on the extension of the beam path between the infrared light emitting source and the LWIR detecting device. Alternatively, the ToF distance sensor has the same distance from the LWIR detecting device than the infrared light emitting source but is not located in the beam path between the infrared light emitting source and the LWIR detecting device. The ToF distance sensor alternatively is located in the LWIR imaging system such that during illumination of the substrate with the infrared light emitting source of the LWIR imaging system, the ToF distance sensor has an unobstructed view to the illuminated substrate.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0095">The ToF distance sensor can be designed or set such that an acoustic or optic signal is released when the ToF distance sensor has a specific distance from the substrate. This specific distance can be set, after calibration, such that the pictures or patterns of the prints or coatings on the substrate or within the substrate can be detected clearly, sharp and focused with the LWIR detecting device, thereby triggering or executing the image capturing process at a frequency of 1 to 100 Hz, which means taking 1 to 100 images per second. This allows for either accumulating low amounts of images for a set time frame, or for accumulating high amounts of images in a set time frame. This enables for a customized image capturing process as well as fast and efficient data processing of the captured images depending on the origin of the taken images e.g. taken from flat surfaces, but also from distorted, curved or angled surfaces. For example the specific distance from the substrate can be 11.2 cm+/&#x2212;3 mm. 1 or more, for example, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20 or 40 images can be taken in a set time frame, for example one second. However, also other specific distances below and above are possible and depend on the substrate or geometry of the substrate and the print or pattern. Furthermore, other amounts of images in the set time frame can be taken. Therefore, the ToF distance sensor provides a simple to operate focusing mechanism. This is advantageous since commercial available LWIR detecting devices known to the skilled person do not comprise a focusing device.

The derived code information may then be transmitted from the LWIR imaging system and/or the LWIR imaging arrangement to the server, and the server may transmit the authentication data for the corresponding product, item and/or object to the LWIR imaging system and/or the LWIR imaging arrangement. Optionally, the user may visually inspect the product, item and/or object and compare its specification with the at least part of the authentication data as shown and/or displayed on the computer device of the LWIR imaging arrangement.

Further, as the picture, pattern and/or code on the label and/or on the substrate thereof is invisible to the human eye, the picture, pattern and/or code cannot be modified or altered by unauthorized persons, at least not without destroying the picture, pattern and/or code. Moreover, as the code information of the picture, pattern and/or code is stored in the server's database and the corresponding authentication data are retrieved by the LWIR imaging arrangement from the server, the association between the code information and the product, item and/or object cannot be altered. Accordingly, a failsafe authentication method or system can be provided, e.g. allowing to ensure correct manufacturing and distribution of any object, item and/or product across or over an entire supply chain from the manufacturer to the customer.
