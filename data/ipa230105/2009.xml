FIGS., an example of a bimini system <b>10</b> is shown. The bimini system <b>10</b> includes a bimini assembly <b>20</b> having a frame <b>22</b> that is adapted to support a covering or material <b>24</b> thereon is illustrated. As shown, the bimini frame <b>22</b> may include several pieces that are formed from a strong, durable, corrosion-resistance material, such as a stainless steel or aluminum alloy for example. The frame <b>22</b> includes a substantially identical first support member <b>26</b><i>a </i>and second support member <b>26</b><i>b </i>coupled at a first end <b>28</b> to a structure <b>30</b> of a vehicle, watercraft, or boat, such as a tower or arch for example. The first end <b>28</b> may be coupled to the structure <b>30</b> directly, or through another component, such as a side plate or bracket <b>32</b> for example. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the first end <b>28</b> of the first and second support members <b>26</b>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>are rotatably mounted to the tower structure <b>30</b>, the first end <b>28</b> of the first support member <b>26</b><i>a </i>being disposed adjacent an inner surface of a first side <b>34</b> of the tower <b>30</b> and the first end <b>28</b> of the second support member <b>26</b><i>b </i>being arranged at an inner surface of a second, opposite side <b>36</b> of the tower <b>30</b>. Although the first and second support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>are illustrated and described as being mounted to an inner surface of the tower structure <b>30</b>, in other embodiments, the support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>may alternatively be mounted to an outer surface of the tower structure <b>30</b> or to another portion of the vehicle entirely.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bimini frame <b>20</b> additionally includes one or more bows <b>40</b> raised and extending between the first and second support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Each bow <b>40</b> typically includes a tubular member formed in a substantially U-shaped configuration having a crossbar extending between opposite side legs which are connected to the support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>. However, a bow <b>40</b> having another configuration is also contemplated herein. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the frame <b>22</b> includes three separate bows arranged at different positions along the length of the first and second support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>. As shown, the frame <b>22</b> includes a rear bow <b>40</b><i>a</i>, which is coupled to a second end of both the first and second support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, an intermediate bow <b>40</b><i>b</i>, which is coupled to a central portion of the first and second support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, and a front bow <b>40</b><i>c </i>which is also coupled to a central portion of the first and second support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>at some location between the first end <b>28</b> and the intermediate bow <b>40</b><i>b</i>. However, it should be understood that that bimini frame <b>22</b> illustrated and described herein is intended as an example only, and that a bimini frame <b>22</b> having any suitable configuration is within the scope of the disclosure. For example, the bimini frame <b>22</b> may have any number of bows <b>40</b>, or alternatively, may have one or more members coupled to the first and/or second support members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>individually.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The bimini assembly <b>20</b> additionally may include a permanent or removable cover <b>24</b>, formed from any suitable material, including but not limited to canvas, plastic, etc. for example, that stretches across the frame <b>22</b> and is secured thereto via one or more affixing mechanisms. Examples of such affixing mechanisms include Velcro&#xae;, ties, snaps, and other suitable fasteners. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the cover <b>24</b> includes one or more openings or pockets through which each of the bows <b>40</b> of the frame <b>22</b> extend to couple the cover <b>24</b> to the frame <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the cover <b>24</b> may include flaps that are configured to wrap about each of the bows <b>40</b> of the frame <b>22</b> and secure to another portion of the cover <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown, each of the bows <b>40</b> is movable between a first, extended position, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> &#x26;<b>4</b></figref>) and a second, retracted position (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> &#x26; <b>6</b></figref>).

The various configurations of the gathering mechanisms <b>70</b> illustrated and described herein are intended as an example only. It should be understood that any suitable mechanism for applying tension to the one tension straps <b>56</b> affixed to the cover <b>24</b> are within the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">When transformation of the bimini assembly <b>20</b> between an open configuration and a closed configuration is initiated, the gathering mechanism <b>70</b> is operated, such as by driving the roller about its axis X for example, or by driving each of the individual spools about a respective. In an embodiment, operation of the gathering mechanism <b>70</b> may be used to initiate transformation of the bimini assembly between an open configuration and a closed configuration. Alternatively, operation of one or more of the actuation mechanisms may initiate transformation of the bimini assembly <b>20</b>. As the gathering mechanism <b>70</b> operates, a force is applied to each of the plurality of tension straps <b>56</b>, causing the bows <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>to pivot about their respective axes from the extended position toward the retracted position. In some embodiments, this force applied to the rear bow <b>40</b><i>a </i>causes the movable portion of the at least one second actuator <b>52</b> associated therewith to retract. At substantially the same time, the at least one first actuator <b>50</b> gradually lowers the distal end of the first and second members <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>into the first position. The first support member <b>26</b><i>a </i>and the second support member <b>26</b><i>b </i>remain generally parallel to one another throughout the transformation of the frame assembly <b>22</b> between the open and closed configurations.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As the bows <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>pivot, the material of the cover <b>24</b> is folded or gathered by the continuous tension applied to the cover <b>24</b> via the engagement between the gathering mechanism <b>70</b> and the tension straps <b>56</b>. Because the first and second support member <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>are rotated relative to the tower structure <b>30</b> simultaneously with the rotation of the bows <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c</i>, the plurality of bows <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>may be generally vertically aligned despite their difference in height once reaching the retracted position. Although the tension straps <b>56</b> are illustrated and described herein as being wound about a gathering mechanism, in other embodiments, another suitable gathering mechanism, such as one or more springs or weights located at or in the tower structure <b>30</b> or even gravity for example, may be used to effectively gather the material of the cover <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>, the gathering mechanism <b>70</b> includes a lever mounted to a portion of the tower structure <b>30</b>, such as at least one side thereof for example.

When the bimini assembly <b>20</b> is in an open configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>), the first connector <b>77</b> may extend generally vertically and within the path of movement of the bimini assembly <b>20</b>. During transformation to the closed configuration, the front bow <b>40</b><i>c </i>rotates about a pivot point toward the tower structure <b>30</b>, for example driven by one of the actuators. As the front bow <b>40</b><i>c </i>moves, it engages the first connector <b>77</b> of the gathering mechanism <b>70</b>. The contact between the front bow <b>40</b><i>c </i>and the first connector <b>77</b> causes the gathering mechanism <b>70</b> to rotate about its axis. As the intermediate bow <b>40</b><i>b </i>and the rear bow <b>40</b><i>a </i>pivot toward the tower structure <b>30</b>, the second connector <b>79</b> of the gathering mechanism <b>70</b> extends behind and applies a rotational force to the rear bow <b>40</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>). As a result of the engagement between the second connector <b>79</b> and the rear bow <b>40</b><i>a</i>, the bimini assembly <b>20</b> is gathered between the tower structure <b>30</b> and the gathering mechanism <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the bimini system <b>10</b> additionally includes a boot <b>80</b> mounted to the tower structure <b>30</b>.
