The loudspeaker is provided with a vibration system and a magnetic circuit system, wherein the vibration system includes a voice coil and a diaphragm, when a current is applied to the voice coil, the voice coil vibrates under the force of a magnetic field of the magnetic circuit system, and the vibration of the voice coil drives the diaphragm to vibrate and produce sound.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The voice coil is generally made by winding a voice coil wire. In the prior art, metal wires are generally chosen as the voice coil wire. Among them, copper clad aluminum wire is widely used in loudspeakers due to its high strength and light weight. However, there is a current skin effect in the voice coil wire. That is, when a current is applied to a conductor, the current is concentrated in a thin layer on an outer surface of the conductor, and the current density increases as a distance from the surface of the conductor decreases, and the actual current inside the conductor is small. The skin effect of current leads to a low use efficiency of a central portion of the voice coil wire, which reduces the overall utilization rate of the voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, in view of the influence of the current skin effect, it is necessary to improve the structure of the existing voice coil wire to improve the utilization rate of the voice coil wire.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a voice coil wire for a sound generating device, aiming at solving the technical problem of low utilization rate of the existing voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a voice coil provided with the above-mentioned voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a sound generating device provided with the above-mentioned voice coil.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A voice coil wire, including a wire body and a cavity provided in the wire body, the wire body is configured to be applied with a current signal, wherein the cavity is in a vacuum state or is filled with an insulating gas.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, the cavity is arranged along an axis direction of the voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the cavity includes a cavity portion in a cross section of the voice coil wire, and a center of the cross section of the voice coil wire is located within the cavity portion.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, the cavity includes two or more cavity portions in a cross section of the voice coil wire, and two adjacent cavity portions are spaced with the wire body positioned therebetween.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, a cross section of the cavity portion has a circular or polygonal shape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, the wire body is made of a single-layered or double-layered metal material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, the wire body is made of copper or copper clad aluminum.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, with respect to the center axis of the voice coil wire, a distance between the outermost of the wire body and the outermost of the cavity is 0.1 to 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A voice coil, the voice coil is provided with the above-mentioned voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A sound generating device, including:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a vibration assembly including a diaphragm and the above-mentioned voice coil, and the diaphragm is coupled to the voice coil;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">a magnetic circuit assembly configured to provide a magnetic field for the voice coil assembly;

Accordingly, other examples of the exemplary embodiment may have different values.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that similar numerals and letters represent similar items in the following drawings. Therefore, once an item is defined in a drawing, it does not need to be further discussed in subsequent drawings.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a voice coil generally used in the prior art, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows structure of a voice coil wire <b>10</b>. Generally, the voice coil wire has a solid core structure, and the utilization rate inside the voice coil wire is low due to the skin effect of current. Therefore, in view of the problems existing in the prior art, it is necessary to improve the structure of the voice coil wire to improve the overall utilization rate of the voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present disclosure provides a hollow core voice coil wire, including a wire body and a cavity provided in the wire body, the wire body is configured to be applied with a current signal, wherein the cavity is in a vacuum state or is filled with an insulating gas.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an embodiment of the present disclosure, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the voice coil wire <b>10</b> includes a wire body <b>11</b> and a cavity <b>12</b> which is formed inside the wire body. Optionally, the cavity may be defined by the wire body. In the present disclosure, the wire body allows a current to flow therethrough. That is, electrons move in an axis direction of the voice coil wire within the wire body. Optionally, the cavity may be set to be in a vacuum state. That is, gas in the cavity is sealed to be in a vacuum state, and thus the cavity exhibits insulating properties. Alternatively, the cavity may be filled with an insulating gas, and thus the cavity also exhibits insulating properties. Optionally, the insulating gas may be air, nitrogen, argon, etc., but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and it may be selected by those skilled in the art as required.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present disclosure, the cavity is enclosed inside the wire body, the wire body allows a current to be applied, and the cavity is filled with an insulating gas or the cavity is configured to be in a vacuum state. With such a structure, the electrical signal conduction characteristics of the voice coil wire is ensured, and the influence of the skin effect of current on the conductive efficiency inside the voice coil wire is reduced. By configuring the cavity to be in an insulating vacuum state or filling the cavity with an insulating gas, the flow uniformity of current in the cross section of the voice coil wire may be improved, and the overall conductive efficiency inside the voice coil wire may be improved. Meanwhile, the setting of the cavity can greatly reduce the weight of the voice coil wire, since the voice coil made of the weight-reduced voice coil wire has smaller weight, and thus the device can generate a larger amplitude under the same level of applied current, and allow a vibration of a wider frequency range, which can significantly improve the vibration sensitivity of the voice coil, thereby improving the acoustic performance of the sound generating device using the voice coil. The reduced weight of the voice coil may facilitate the reducing of the weight of sound generating device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Optionally, the cavity is arranged along the axis direction of the voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As an embodiment of the present disclosure, the cavity <b>12</b> may be configured as a communication body extending along the axis direction of the voice coil wire <b>10</b>. Configuring the cavity as a communication body extending along the axis direction of the voice coil wire can minimize the weight of the voice coil wire, improve the amplitude and applicable frequency range of the corresponding voice coil, and improve the vibration sensitivity of the voice coil, thereby optimizing the acoustic performance of the sound generating device. In addition, configuring the cavity as a communication body extending along the axis direction of the voice coil wire can greatly reduce the influence of the current skin effect and improve the current flow efficiency of the voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As another embodiment of the present disclosure, the cavity <b>12</b> may be provided with a constant interval in the axial direction of the voice coil wire <b>10</b>. Optionally, a size of each cavity <b>12</b> in the axial direction of the voice coil wire may be larger than a size thereof in a radial direction of the voice coil wire or may be smaller than or equal to the size thereof in the radial direction of the voice coil wire, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In this case, the breakage of the voice coil wire may not affect the sealing property of the cavity. In addition, the cavity spaced along the axial direction of the voice coil wire can ensure the strength of the voice coil wire.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Optionally, the cavity includes a cavity portion in a cross section of the voice coil wire, and a center of the cross section of the voice coil wire is located within the cavity portion.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As an embodiment of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which illustrates a cross section of the voice coil wire <b>10</b>, the cavity <b>12</b> may include a cavity portion <b>121</b>. Optionally, a center of the cross section of the voice coil wire is located within the cavity portion. That is, the cavity portion is arranged around the center axis of the voice coil wire. With such a structure, the distribution uniformity of electrons in the cross section of the voice coil wire may be improved, the influence of the current skin effect may be reduced, and the current conduction efficiency of the voice coil wire may be improved. Meanwhile, the cavity portion being arranged around the center axis of the voice coil wire can improve the structural symmetry of the voice coil wire, which may facilitate the reducing of the polarization of the corresponding voice coil.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optionally, the cavity includes two or more cavity portions in a cross section of the voice coil wire, and two adjacent cavity portions are spaced with the wire body positioned therebetween.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As an embodiment of the present disclosure, the cavity <b>12</b> may include two or more cavity portions <b>121</b> on the cross section of the voice coil wire <b>10</b>, and two adjacent cavity portions are spaced with the wire body <b>11</b> positioned therebetween. As such, the influence of the current skin effect may be reduced and the current conduction efficiency of the voice coil wire may be improved. In addition, a damage in the sealing of the cavity caused by a damage to an outer surface damage of the voice coil wire or a local defect can be avoided. Meanwhile, due to the cavity portion, the weight of the voice coil wire may be effectively reduced, increase the amplitude of the voice coil, the vibration frequency range may be expanded, and the vibration sensitivity of the voice coil may also be improved. In an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the cavity <b>12</b> may include seven cavity portions <b>121</b>, one of which is located at the center of the cross section of the voice coil wire, and the other six cavity portions are arranged around it. This arrangement makes the voice coil wire have good symmetry, which can reduce or avoid the polarization of the voice coil caused by an asymmetric structure. Of course, the distribution form of the cavity portions on the cross section can be arranged according to actual situations, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optionally, a cross section of the cavity portion has a circular or polygonal shape.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As an embodiment of the present disclosure, the cross section of the cavity portion <b>121</b> may have a circular shape, which facilitates the processing of the cavity portion. Optionally, the cavity portion may also be provided with a polygonal shape. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Optionally, the wire body is made of a single-layered or double-layered metal material.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Optionally, the wire body is made of copper or copper clad aluminum.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As an embodiment of the present disclosure, the wire body <b>11</b> may be made of a single-layered metal material to facilitate the conducting of the current. Optionally, the wire body may be made of metal copper, which has the advantages of good conductivity, high strength and low price, and can reduce the manufacturing cost of the voice coil. Alternatively, the wire body may be made of a double-layered metal material to facilitate the conducting of the current. Optionally, the wire body may be made of copper clad aluminum, which has the advantages of good conductivity, light weight, small specific gravity, high strength and low price, can not only reduce the manufacturing cost of the voice coil, but also effectively improve the vibration performance of the voice coil, thereby improving the acoustic performance of the sound generating device. The wire body of the present disclosure may also be other metal materials or conductive non-metallic materials, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Optionally, with respect to the center axis of the voice coil wire, a distance between the outermost of the wire body and the outermost of the cavity is 0.1 to 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The outermost of the wire body in the present disclosure refers to a position where the wire body is farthest from the center in a cross section of the voice coil wire.

Optionally, when the cross-sectional shape of the wire body is circular and the cavity only includes a circular cavity portion, the distance refers to the thickness of the wire body. Optionally, the thickness of the wire body may also be &#xbc; of the diameter of the voice coil wire, but the thickness of the wire body of the present disclosure is not limited to it. When the distance between the outermost of the wire body and the outermost of the cavity is within 0.2 to 0.3 mm, due to the reduced weight of the voice coil wire with which the voice coil is wound, and the voice coil may vibrate in a larger frequency range, and a larger amplitude can be achieved at the same time, and the acoustic performance of the sound generating device having the voice coil is also good.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present disclosure also provides a voice coil having the above-mentioned voice coil wire.
