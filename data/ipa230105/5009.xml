num="0001">The specification relates generally to e-commerce systems, and more particularly to e-commerce systems for managing loyalty rewards programs of different merchants.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">E-commerce programs, commonly referred to as e-commerce platforms, allow users to shop at their merchant websites (&#x201c;estore&#x201d;) and there may be loyalty programs associated with the merchants. The users typically peruse the merchant websites, adding things to an online shopping cart typically until they are ready to &#x201c;check-out,&#x201d; in order to consummate their purchase. Upon completing their purchases, the user typically may also receive a notification of the reward points awarded from the purchase as well as their total accumulated reward points with the merchant. Typically, the users would join or become a member of the loyalty reward program in order to earn reward points when they purchase from the merchant who provides the loyalty reward program.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ultimately, the purpose of the loyalty reward programs of merchants is to retain their customers or shoppers through many repeat purchases. This is accomplished by the shoppers redeeming their reward points (from previous purchases) when purchasing an item. For small and medium sized businesses (SMBs), the individual merchants are frequently not big enough for their customers to regularly redeem their reward points due the merchants' limited selection of products and services.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an aspect of the present specification an example system includes: an e-commerce platform to support e-commerce activities of a plurality of merchants; a loyalty rewards system in communication with the e-commerce platforms, the loyalty rewards system to: track, for each merchant operating on the e-commerce platform, customer accounts and associated loyalty rewards points for each respective customer account; a hub system in communication with the loyalty rewards system, the hub module to: track, for a hub account, a set of associated customer accounts, each associated customer account corresponding to one of the merchants; retrieve, from the loyalty rewards system, the associated loyalty rewards points for each respective customer account in the set of associated customer accounts; and aggregate the associated loyalty rewards points for the hub account; and output the aggregated associated loyalty rewards points to a client device associated with the hub account.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another aspect of the present specification, an example method includes: tracking, for each merchant operating on the e-commerce platform, customer accounts and associated loyalty rewards points for each respective customer account; tracking, for a hub account, a set of associated customer accounts, each associated customer account corresponding to one of the e-commerce platforms; retrieving the associated loyalty rewards points for each respective customer account in the set of associated customer accounts; and aggregating the associated loyalty rewards points for the hub account; and outputting the aggregated associated loyalty rewards points to a client device associated with the hub account.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Implementations are described with reference to the following figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of an e-commerce system <b>100</b> according to an example embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a flowchart implementing a part of a loyalty rewards system in accordance with an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart depicting a part of Match <b>215</b> in an example implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of a hub implemented in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a web page displaying information by the hub of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a web page displaying combined information in the Combined Total section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a web page for redemption from the collaborative section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> according to an example embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments described herein provide enhanced computer- and network-based methods and systems of a Hub for viewing and utilizing loyalty reward programs. The hub may also be known as a customer portal or Dashboard. The functions of the Hub include acting as a loyalty rewards center for the customer or user to locate their rewards information associated with loyalty reward programs that which they have accounts or are members thereof. For example, their accounts may be located from their email address(es) across all merchants within a platform which manages loyalty reward programs of the merchants.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Hub has functions which further include acting as a shopping center where the customer may discover merchants and their stores with products and services of interest to them. These discovered merchants include merchants where the customer may use rewards or reward points from one merchant with one loyalty rewards program at another merchant with another loyalty reward program. These discovered merchants' websites may also be accessed from the Hub to purchase products and services.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The Hub may be a software program running on a server which can be accessed over the Internet at a website from a browser or from an application running on a computing device. The application may be a client of the Hub.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For customers, the Hub functions include listing the overall status of rewards for all merchants associated with the Hub where the customer has made purchases/earned points, or redeemed points for rewards, including: reward point balances, a list of redeemed rewards (coupon codes, etc) with usage status (available, used, etc), referral links and usage, VIP tier statuses and info (like expiry times), rewards available to redemption, and a search function (hereinafter referred to as Discovery) to discover merchants having products and services for which the customer's rewards and reward points may be used.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For merchants, the functions of the Hub include providing a directory of merchants who permits their reward points (from their loyalty reward programs) to be used or redeemed at other merchants listed in the directory, and providing advertising opportunities for merchants to promote their business. The Hub may also list merchants who do not permit their reward points (from their loyalty reward programs) to be used or redeemed at other merchants listed in the directory.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It would be advantageous for SMBs to collaborate in allowing the reward points earned at other merchants to be used in a merchant's e-store. It would be advantageous for a system and method for viewing and utilizing loyalty reward programs of merchants where a customer has earned reward points. Further, with many SMBs, it would be advantageous for customers to be able to discover other merchants who are willing to allow them to use their earned reward points.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">There are a number of methods to identify and/or track customers or users such as by telephone numbers and email addresses. Identifiers of a user comprise one or more of the following: name of a person or entity, telephone number, text messaging identifier, email address, payment information, physical address, delivery address, billing address, IP address, advertising ID, device ID, customer ID, social network ID, payment wallet, digital wallet, and such other contact information as may be used or developed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">E-commerce platforms, such as SHOPIFY, support merchants going online to sell their products and services. Some of the e-commerce platforms further provide tracking or matching of the registered users and guest users on merchant websites. For example, a customer identifier (customer ID), for example a number, is assigned to each new guest when a purchase is made at a merchant's website. The e-commerce platform would assign the same custom ID to the same guest, where detected as the same guest, for a subsequent transaction or purchase. For example, a transaction record (such as for a purchase) in the accounts of the merchant as provided by the e-commerce merchant may include customer ID, details of the purchase, date, and amount. Where the guest is matched to an existing guest, the previously assigned customer ID is used. The matching algorithms of the e-commerce platforms may include payment information, telephone number, and email address of the guest. This matching or association of guests to their transactions is generally accurate enough to allow a loyalty rewards program to grant reward points for the guests in the records of the merchant. For example, the merchant can grant and accumulate reward points for their guest users using the customer ID provided by their e-commerce platform. The merchant records would grant the reward points based on a guest's purchase(s). The granted reward points would then be added to the reward points associated with the customer ID in the merchant's records.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The customer ID from some e-commerce platforms may also be associated with other identifiers of the purchaser like the purchaser's name, telephone number and email address. For example, some customer IDs may only be associated with a name and telephone number. Other customer IDs may only have a name and email address. Some other customer IDs may only have just an email address. The number of possible combinations of associations with an example purchaser is very large and may further change over time. For example, a purchaser may change their telephone number, physical address, or email address. A purchaser's identifiers may have more than one telephone number, email address, etc. A purchaser's identifiers may also be transferred to other purchasers for various reasons such as a telephone number transferring to another purchaser.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The identifiers which may identify (or associate with) a guest user may be highly complex. It is thus advantageous to use a guest matching service, which may provide customer IDs, as provided by some e-commerce platforms along with some example identifiers like telephone numbers and email addresses which can further be used to authenticate the guest or guests.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once a guest user is identified by various means including the techniques noted in this document, technical means may also be used to continuously track when the guest user visits a merchant website using the same computing device. For example, cookies (as is commonly known) or information packets may be used where the guest user may be identified when visiting a merchant's website. Similarly, a user with a registered account may be automatically signed into the account when visiting a merchant's website using known methods.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition to purchases of products or services, reward points may also be earned for other activities such as referring another user to a merchant, providing a review on a social network for the merchant, and creating an account with the merchant.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The description herein provides a loyalty rewards system comprising a hub for a customer to manage their reward points in the loyalty reward program of more than one merchant. In one embodiment, the hub comprises exchanging and transferring the reward points earned at one merchant to those of another merchant. In another embodiment, the hub provides group accounts. In another embodiment, the hub provides a combined total of reward points using one of a currency and points.

The Ecommerce System <b>100</b> includes a Platform <b>110</b> that has an ecommerce platform application that communicates with a Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>, a Client <b>130</b>, and a Merchant <b>140</b>. The Platform <b>110</b> can communicate with the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>, the Client <b>130</b>, and the Merchant <b>140</b> via any suitable connection such as the Internet or another communications network <b>150</b>. While certain embodiments are described in which parts of the Ecommerce System <b>100</b> are implemented in software, it will be appreciated that one or more acts or functions of the loyalty award system may be performed by hardware, software, or a combination thereof, as may be embodied in one or more computing systems. For example, the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>, the Platform <b>110</b>, the Client <b>130</b>, and the Merchant <b>140</b> can be embodied as stand alone application programs or as a companion program to a web browser having messaging and storage capabilities.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, although one Client <b>130</b> and one Merchant <b>140</b> are shown for ease of illustration, it should be appreciated that there may be any number of merchants and/or clients who can be served by the Platform <b>110</b> in the manner described herein.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similarly, although one Platform <b>110</b> is shown for ease of illustration, it should be appreciated that any number of them can be included in the Ecommerce System <b>100</b>, for example in cloud-based and/or server-farm systems, or where the ecommerce platform and the application are located on separate but still connected/accessible servers (for example the recurrence application can call the ecommerce platform's API using the HTTP protocol). Each Platform <b>110</b> is an e-commerce platform of a particular company and may support e-commerce activities (e.g., sales, etc.) of a plurality of Merchants <b>140</b>. There are a number of e-commerce platform companies which could be represented by Platform <b>110</b> or Platforms <b>110</b>. The description herein should be read to apply to one or more companies accordingly. For example, the Customer ID a user has with one company may not be the same as the Customer ID of the same user with another company unless the companies had agreed to standardize their Customer IDs.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b>, the Platform <b>110</b>, the Client <b>130</b>, the Merchant <b>140</b> and/or other data processing resources as may be required, can communicate over the network <b>150</b>. For example, the network <b>150</b> can include a telecommunications network, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an intranet, an Internet, or any combination thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, the communication between the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b>, the Platform <b>110</b>, the Client <b>130</b>, and the Merchant <b>140</b> can be encrypted to protect and secure the data communication between the systems. It will be appreciated that the network connections disclosed are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b>, the Platform <b>110</b>, the Client <b>130</b>, and the Merchant <b>140</b> can be used.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b>, the Platform <b>110</b>, the Client <b>130</b>, and the Merchant <b>140</b> are communications to provide the services to the user on the Client <b>130</b>. In providing the services to the user, the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> is able to track what the user is doing at the Merchant <b>140</b>, the merchant's website. The tracking includes receiving information on what items are in the user's shopping cart at any one time, and what page is the user accessing at the merchant's website at any given time such as whether the user is viewing the details of an item. This tracking may be carried out using known methods. For example, the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> has a LRS Database <b>160</b> that has information including about each merchant (such as physical address), whether the merchant has joined Marketplace or collaboration where the reward points earned by the customers at each of the merchants may be redeemed at each of the other merchants, the merchant's customers, about each customer (such as customer ID, physical address, email address, and telephone number) whether registered with an account or not, the transaction history (such as purchase orders) of each of the customers, and the loyalty rewards transactions of each of the customers (such as reward points earn by transaction, and reward points redemptions for what rewards). That is, the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> tracks, for each merchant operating on the e-commerce platform <b>110</b> and subscribed (or authorized) into the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b>, customer accounts (e.g., as represented by customer IDs) and associated loyalty rewards points for each respective customer account.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> further comprises a Hub <b>400</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The functions of the Hub <b>400</b> include providing customers or users with a means to discover merchants including merchants where the customer may use rewards or reward points from one merchant with one loyalty rewards program at another merchant with another loyalty reward program.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The Hub <b>400</b> further comprises acting as a loyalty rewards center for the customer or user to locate their rewards information associated with loyalty reward programs that which they have accounts or are members thereof. For example, the Hub <b>400</b> may track hub accounts for a customer to log into the Hub <b>400</b> and view their Hub activities. The Hub <b>400</b> may additionally track, for each hub account, a set of associated customer accounts corresponding to one of the Merchants <b>140</b>. For example, the customer accounts associated with a given hub account may be located based on corresponding email addresses used for both the hub account and the customer account at the merchant (i.e., on the Platform <b>110</b>/in the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The Hub <b>400</b> therefore centralizes the loyalty rewards across the set of associated customer accounts from a variety of different Merchants <b>140</b>, and, as applicable, Platforms <b>110</b>. More particularly, the Hub <b>400</b> may retrieve, from the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>, and in particular from the LRS Database <b>160</b>, the associated loyalty rewards points for each respective customer account in the set of associated customer accounts. The loyalty rewards points can include a point balance, rewards available for redemption, and the like. The Hub <b>140</b> may then aggregate the associated loyalty rewards points, and output the aggregated associated loyalty rewards points for a user (e.g., at a client device being used to access the hub account). For example, aggregating the associated loyalty rewards points may include displaying the loyalty rewards points earned in association with each merchant (i.e., as separated by the customer account for each merchant).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The Hub <b>400</b> may be a software program running on a server which can be accessed over the Internet at a website from a browser or from an application running on a computing device. The application may be a client of the Hub <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For customers, the functions of the Hub <b>400</b> include listing the overall status of rewards for all merchants associated with the Hub <b>400</b> where the customer has made purchases/earned points, or redeemed points for rewards, including: reward point balances, a list of redeemed rewards (coupon codes, etc) with usage status (available, used, etc), referral links and usage, VIP tier statuses and info (like expiry times), rewards available to redemption, and a search function (hereinafter referred to as Discovery) to discover merchants having products and services for which the customer's rewards and reward points may be used. In other words, the LRS <b>120</b> may additionally track loyalty rewards usage data for each respective customer account. The usage data may include the above data, such as redeemed rewards, usage status, referral links, VIP tier statuses and the like. The Hub <b>400</b> may then retrieve the associated loyalty rewards usage data and aggregate it for output to the user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For merchants, the functions of the Hub <b>400</b> include providing a directory of merchants who permits their reward points (from their loyalty reward programs) to be used or redeemed at other merchants listed in the directory (i.e., a list of merchants permitting exchange of loyalty rewards points), and providing advertising opportunities for merchants to promote their business. The Hub <b>400</b> may also list merchants who do not permit their reward points (from their loyalty reward programs) to be used or redeemed at other merchants listed in the directory.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The Hub <b>400</b> has functions which further include acting as a shopping center where the customer may discover merchants and their stores with products and services of interest to them. These discovered merchants include merchants where the customer may use rewards or reward points from one merchant with one loyalty rewards program at another merchant with another loyalty reward program. These discovered merchants' websites may also be accessed from the Hub to purchase products and services.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The Platform <b>110</b> can include, for example, applications stored in its memory storage medium. Such applications can provide for receiving, processing, and reconciling orders, billing, and inventory, and presenting such information to the Merchant <b>140</b>. For example, such applications can include the ecommerce platform for hosting an ecommerce storefront (e-storefront) for the Merchant(s) <b>140</b> and making the e-storefront interface accessible to the Client <b>130</b>. And such applications can include an interface to the Merchant <b>140</b> to customize rule sets for offering products for sale to the users (e.g. users accessing e-storefront from Clients <b>130</b>), and accepting orders for such products.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The Platform <b>110</b> further provides functionality to assist the merchants in managing their e-storefront. The merchants are able to track their users', whether registered or not (i.e. guests), activities relating to their e-storefronts. For example, Platform <b>110</b> generates an event of each purchase order of a user from a merchant's e-storefront. The event is associated with the merchant and the user and is accessible by both parties for their records. A record of the event can include customer ID (of the user), guest or registered (whether the user has created an account with the merchant), telephone number (of the user), email address (of the user), product purchased, date of purchase, and payment amount. This short list of information relating to a record is for illustration only. Such records may typically contain more or less information.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some platforms, the telephone number or email address (or any other identifiers) of the user may be used as the customer ID by the platform to identify the user. The Platform <b>110</b> may assign a new customer ID to an event if it is not able to match the user to an existing user. If it is able to match the user to an existing user, the Platform <b>110</b> will provide the customer ID of the user to their purchase order. A registered user will have already created an account (store account) with the merchant and if the purchase is made under their account then the record of the event will have their assigned customer ID. Where a guest user (who does not have an account) makes a purchase, the record of the event will have the customer ID either as newly assigned where there is no match to an existing guest user, or an existing customer ID where a match is detected based on the profile of an existing guest user (for example, the same email address is used by the guest user).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The Merchant <b>140</b> is, for example, a computer from which a merchant can access and run their business through their e-storefront on the Platform <b>110</b>. The Client <b>130</b> is, for example, a computer from which a user (who may be a shopper or customer) can access and interact with the e-storefront of various merchants to, for example, purchase their products.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> implements a loyalty reward program for merchants through their e-storefronts. The Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> is configured to create, collect, manage, and modify information associated with user loyalty rewards accounts. Information associated with a loyalty rewards account can include, for example, user identification information, user contact information, user purchase information, historical user information, a loyalty award amount (the reward points), and other information necessary for implementing the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> may further comprise a nudge module configured to interact with users including presenting information to users and receiving instructions from users, such as text input by users in a field, clicking of buttons, selection of boxes and the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> is further extendable to the web pages of the e-storefront in the form of an embedded application within the web pages. The embedded application provides a user interface for interacting with users and displaying data relevant to a user's loyalty rewards account. The interactions with the users further include presenting nudges to the user while the user is shopping anywhere on a website including viewing the cart, home page, and product pages. Further, the user may also be presented with action items such as click to use points, select what to redeem for in a panel, apply rewards to items in a cart, apply code, and click to view rewards.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The records of events are processed by the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> and reward points are awarded for each of the events which are then added to the loyalty rewards accounts of the users. The loyalty rewards accounts are identified by their respective customer IDs for both guest users and registered users. The record of events processed by the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> may additionally be stored in the LRS database <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some examples, the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> may be implemented on a server or suite of servers separate from the Platform <b>110</b>, while in other examples, the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> may be integrated with and implemented by the Platform <b>110</b>. The functionality described herein may be performed by the loyalty rewards system <b>120</b> in cooperation with the platform <b>110</b> (e.g., by communicating instructions and data therebetween) and/or directly by the loyalty rewards system <b>120</b> when the loyalty rewards system <b>120</b> is, for example, integrated with and implemented by the platform <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The Platform <b>110</b> can also include sending a text message using a messaging service to confirm the events, e.g., purchase order, to the user's messaging address. The message address may be a telephone number for text messages, an email address for text messages, and any other messaging service. Messages on the reward points earned by the users may similarly be sent to the users whether they are guest users or registered users.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting a Method <b>200</b> of implementing a part of the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> in accordance with an example embodiment. The method <b>200</b> may be implemented in part or in whole by the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>, the Platform <b>110</b>, or a combination of the two, or other suitable computing devices and/or systems. An example entry point into the Method <b>200</b> for a guest user starts with identifying the user (with for example a customer ID), for example by the Platform <b>110</b>. Once identified (or signed in), the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b>, through the nudge module, interacts with the user to further present nudges to the user while the user is shopping anywhere on a website including viewing the cart, home page, and product pages. Further, the Nudge module may also present users with action items such as click to use reward points, select what you to redeem for in a panel, click to apply reward to items in a cart, click to apply code, and click to view reward. The terms &#x201c;click&#x201d; and &#x201c;select&#x201d; are user actions and are used for clarity. They are not intended to limit the types of user interactions available with the Nudge module. The Nudge module may use any of the types of user interactions known in the art.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The user starts with a Purchase <b>210</b> of a product(s) from a Website of a Merchant Store (e.g., from an e-storefront serviced by the Platform <b>110</b>). From the Client <b>130</b>, the user selects the product(s) to purchase. The selected product(s) or item(s) to purchase may be added to what is commonly known as a shopping cart.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The Purchase <b>210</b>, once submitted for checkout (a commonly known process), is received by the Platform <b>110</b> for Matching <b>215</b> to verify the customer ID (verification is optional), to obtain payment information and other information as is needed (for example, an email address), and to apply any discount or promotional codes. The Platform <b>110</b> fully Processes <b>220</b> the purchase once the user clicks to purchase or finally confirms such. A record of the event, this purchase, is updated for the merchant's account on the Platform <b>110</b>. The step of verifying the customer ID is optional and may be skipped if the customer ID verification has sufficient accuracy such as when the user has signed into their account with the merchant in their purchase or such as when the customer ID is provided by the Platform <b>110</b> based on the user's provided information (such as the email address). The Processes <b>220</b> further includes providing this purchase event to the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> so that reward points or rewards can be awarded to the user's account or the customer ID if the user is a guest user. The customer ID is effectively a loyalty award account in this example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The customer ID may be verified to actually belong to the registered user or guest user by a number of known methods such as confirmation from an email sent to the user's email address.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A Confirmation <b>225</b> of the purchase is also sent to the user so that they may have a written confirmation of their purchase. Further, the Confirmation <b>225</b> includes a URL link as an invitation to the guest users to Create <b>230</b> a store account with the merchant so that the user (where it is a guest user) may become a registered user and be able to access their loyalty award account and to Redeem <b>235</b> their rewards accordingly. An example redemption of reward points is redeeming 100 reward points for a $10 discount code which the user can enter on their next purchase from the merchant for the discount.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, the URL link of Confirmation <b>225</b> sent via email, or an unsecured messaging service, can initially point to Redeem <b>235</b> for redemption within a limited time period (for example one hour) and after the time period, the URL link can then point to Create <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further alternatively, the URL link of Confirmation <b>225</b> sent via email, or an unsecured messaging service, can point to a web page indicating that a new URL link has been sent to the user's email address with Redeem <b>235</b> for redemption within a limited period (for example one hour). After the time period, this new URL link may be directed to the same web page indicating that another URL link has been sent to the user email address with Redeem <b>235</b> for redemption within a limited period (for example one hour). This cycle of emails and URL links may be repeated as authentication for users to access their loyalty award accounts to view and/or redeem their reward points. Other authentication methods may also be used, such Verification codes instead of URL links.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Where the Confirmation <b>225</b> has been sent to a guest user via a secured communications means such as via SMS to their telephone number, a URL link to Redeem <b>235</b> is included in the confirmation so that a guest user may accordingly redeem their reward points without becoming a registered user.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting a part of Match <b>215</b> in an example implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Similar to the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the example entry point into the method <b>300</b> is the identification of a user. That is, the Platform <b>110</b> identifies a customer identifier (e.g., based on email address etc. for a guest user or account information for a registered user) associated with the user or customer browsing the e-storefront of the Merchant <b>140</b> serviced by the Platform <b>110</b>. The Platform <b>110</b> may then send the customer identifier to the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> receives the customer identifier from the e-commerce platform and identifies a point balance associated with the customer identifier. In particular, the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> determines whether the point balance for the user satisfies a threshold condition. For example, the threshold condition may be a threshold point balance. If the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> determines that the user has reward Points <b>310</b> satisfying the threshold condition (e.g., a point balance exceeding the threshold point balance), then the method <b>300</b> proceeds to Enough <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> determines that the user does not have enough reward Points <b>310</b>, then the method <b>300</b> proceeds to generate Nudges <b>315</b>. In particular, the Nudge module of the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> generates encouragement Nudges <b>315</b> for presentation to the customer or user to encourage the user to earn reward points (or reward discounts or reward amounts of money) to the user. Example encouragement nudge messages include &#x201c;Earn 100 reward points for every $10 purchase&#x201d; (example encouragement) and &#x201c;Click &#x2018;Allow&#x2019; and get $3 off your 1st order&#x201d; (example amount reward as well as being an interaction).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> may cooperate with the Hub <b>400</b> to determine whether the user has sufficient transferrable reward points at other merchants. The Nudges <b>315</b> may then present an example message like &#x201c;You have Marketplace points at other merchants use?&#x201d; with a &#x201c;Use Now&#x201d; button&#x201d;. By clicking the &#x201c;Use Now&#x201d; button, the Hub <b>400</b> then converts and transfers sufficient reward points to this merchant for the user to redeem the reward.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Alternatively, instead of nudging the user to use the points at other merchants, the user may set the Hub <b>400</b> of the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> to automatically convert and transfer sufficient reward points from other merchants to this merchant for the user to redeem the reward.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">If the user has reward Points <b>310</b> (YES) to satisfy the threshold condition, then the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> determines whether or not the user has Enough <b>320</b> reward points, or already has a reward like a &#x201c;$3 off your 1st order&#x201d;. If the user does not have Enough <b>320</b> rewards points, then Nudges <b>315</b> would be presented and may include further example messages like &#x201c;Only need to purchase $37 to earn 10% discount&#x201d; and &#x201c;Only need another 25 reward points to qualify for a $10 discount&#x201d;. If the user does have Enough <b>320</b> rewards points, then the loyalty rewards system <b>120</b> determines the Rewards <b>325</b>. That is, the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> selects a reward option (Rewards <b>325</b>). The reward option may be, for example, a discount percentage, a discount amount, or the like. The reward option selected based on the largest available reward option, a smallest available reward option, a randomly-selected available reward option, or other criteria. The available reward options may be based on possible redemption options based on the point balance associated with the customer identifier.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The nudge module may then send a nudge (Rewards <b>325</b>) including the selected reward option for presentation to the customer. For example, the Rewards <b>325</b> nudges may include messages such as &#x201c;Congratulations! You have $5 off your next purchase&#x201d; with a &#x201c;Use Now&#x201d; button to Redeem <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The e-commerce Platform <b>110</b> and/or the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> may then receive a response to the Rewards <b>325</b> nudge from the customer or user. If the response indicates that the customer does not wish to apply the reward option (e.g., by closing the nudge or not receiving a response), then the method <b>300</b> ends.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the response includes an indication from the customer to apply the reward option (e.g., the customer clicks the &#x201c;Use Now&#x201d; button), then the method <b>300</b> proceeds to Redeem <b>330</b>. The e-commerce Platform <b>110</b> may then store the reward option for a subsequent purchase. In response to selection of one or more items for the subsequent purchase, the reward option is applied to the selection.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, the e-commerce Platform <b>110</b> may determine whether a cart of a current session includes one or more selected items. When the cart includes one or more selected items, the Platform <b>110</b> may apply the reward option to the cart (i.e., the current purchase). When there are no items in the cart, the reward option would be applied to the next items in the cart which could be during the same session or a later session when the user returns to the merchant website after, for example, a few days. In some examples, the reward option may be stored by the Platform <b>110</b>, while in other examples, the reward option may be sent back to the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> to store, for example, if the current session ends without the customer making a purchase to which to apply the reward option. An example of applying the $5 off to the purchase is the Loyalty Rewards System <b>120</b> entering the discount code for the $5 off for the user.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">After the reward option is redeemed at <b>330</b>, the Loyalty Reward System <b>120</b> updates the point balance associated with the customer identifier, for example in LRS Database <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The nudges of Nudges <b>315</b> and Rewards <b>325</b> may be presented at any of the pages of the merchant's website including the home page and the checkout pages. Further, the nudges of Nudges <b>315</b> and Rewards <b>325</b> may be presented at the same time at any of the pages of the merchant's website. For clarity, more than one nudge may be presented on one page of a merchant's website at any one time.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example implementation of the Hub <b>400</b>. The Hub <b>400</b> includes an Access Module <b>410</b>, a Hub Module <b>420</b>, and a Hub Database <b>430</b>. The Hub Module <b>420</b> further accesses the LRS Database <b>160</b> to search for a customer's loyalty reward information and to update the LRS Database <b>160</b> with the customer's information that has changed due to redeeming reward points or other activities through the Hub <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The Hub Database <b>430</b> stores a plurality of hub accounts and data associated with each hub account, such as customer name, credentials to access the Hub <b>400</b>, transaction history of the customer using the Hub <b>400</b> (such as redemptions of reward points), and customer identifications. In particular, each hub account may be associated with a plurality of customer accounts, where the customer accounts are accounts as identified by individual Merchants <b>140</b> on Platform <b>110</b> or LRS <b>120</b>. The hub accounts may be identified based on customer identifiers such as email addresses where the customer has been verified to have access thereto, telephone numbers where the customer has been verified to have access thereto, and customer IDs which may have been verified by others such as the Platforms <b>110</b>. The associated customer accounts may be identified by the Hub <b>400</b> based on the same email address or other customer identifier used for both the hub account and a customer account with a Merchant <b>140</b>. In other examples, the associated customer accounts may be added by the customer or user. In such examples, the user may be prompted by the Hub <b>400</b> to provide verification to access the requested customer account. In this way, the Hub <b>400</b> may support group accounts, in which a single hub account may be authorized to access a variety of customer accounts with different merchants, including multiple customer accounts (e.g., associated with different users or customers). Similarly, the same customer account may be associated with multiple hub accounts.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The Access Module <b>410</b> functions as the gateway into Hub <b>400</b> by the customer through their access credentials (such as their username and password) and for each of the customers to create their hub account. The Access Module <b>410</b> further on-boards customers onto the Hub <b>400</b> by receiving the customer identifications (such as their telephone number and email addresses) from the customers and to verify that the customer has access to their customer identifications using known methods. When the received customer identifications have been verified, the verified customer identifications are stored in the Hub Database <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, the Access Module <b>410</b> permits one hub account to be accessed and controlled by one or more customers where family or group hub accounts may be created. Each customer may have their own access credentials for their one family or group hub account.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The Hub Module <b>420</b> implements the operations of the Hub <b>400</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The functions of the Hub Module <b>420</b> further include converting reward points of different loyalty reward programs to normalized reward points, and selecting which merchant's reward points (that the customer has earned) are to be redeemed in priority before another merchant's reward points associated with the same customer.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The normalization of reward points is desired so that the value of a reward point from one merchant is approximately the same as another reward point earned from another merchant. This issue is further complicated where the merchants may be in different countries and as such further adjustments may be considered due to currency exchange rates. The term &#x201c;reward points&#x201d; as used in this document means points, but may also be set as a currency such as US dollars (USD). A loyalty rewards program may use, for example, $1 in reward points for every purchase costing $100 instead of 1 reward point for every purchase costing $100.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">For normalization, the Hub <b>400</b> (and in particular, the Hub Module <b>410</b>) selects a reference basis and determines an exchange rate for points (ERP) for each merchant based on the reference basis so the reward points of a merchant may be converted to a nominal reference value per reward point. The ERP of a reward point may be based a number of different reference bases such as (1) value of the points from the redemption of rewards (reward value), (2) value of the points from earnings (earning value), or (3) any combination (e.g., a weighted combination) of the reward value and the earning value such as an average based on (reward value+earning value)/2.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In particular, each merchant <b>140</b> may define their own ERP based on the redemption options available. The ERP may be set by each merchant in their own interests and may also be adjusted by each merchant at any time. For example, the merchant may adjust the ERP to a lower value to encourage customers to use points from other merchants to purchase from the merchant such as during a sales campaign. In another example, a new merchant may set their ERP to a low value (low as compared to other merchants) in order to encourage customers to use points from other merchants as the new merchant may not have issued many reward points.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Loyalty reward programs frequently provide for earning points for rewards that do not directly correspond to monetary amounts. For example, the value of a 10% discount or free shipping reward may not have a known monetary amount at the time of redemption. Another example, not having a known monetary amount, is earning a 100 points for referring another customer. For such examples of rewards, a fixed monetary amount may be assigned such as the 10% discount being equivalent to a $10 coupon. Similarly, such examples of non-monetary earnings (such as referrals and following on social media) may also be assigned monetary amounts. In other examples, other quantitative bases (i.e., other than monetary) may be provided.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">An example calculation using the earning value method for a reward point is a Merchant B having a monetary earning rule of 1 reward point is earned per purchase amount of $10. The ERP is then calculated as one point having a value of $10 based on the required purchase amount divided by the number of points. Where there is also a non-monetary earning rule, such as 100 points for a referral, the assigned monetary amount assigned to a referral may be $100 (or some other arbitrary assignment of a value for referral&#x2014;e.g., based on an average increased earning amount Merchant B expects to receive from the referral) to derive an ERP of one point having a value of $1 based on the assigned monetary amount divided by the number of points.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an example of normalization using reward value as a reference basis, there are two merchants: Merchant A and Merchant B. They each have a setup with a single monetary earning rule, and multiple spending or reward rules. For this example, they are both selling and discounting in American dollars (USD).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Merchant A's loyalty rewards program provides: earn 1 point for every $10 spent, where 50 points is needed to redeem a $5 coupon reward and 80 points is needed to redeem a $10 coupon reward. The ERP using the earning value as a reference basis is $10 per point.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">While Merchant B's loyalty rewards program provides: earn 2 points for every $10 spent where 100 points is needed to redeem a $6 coupon reward, 140 points is needed to redeem a $12 coupon reward, and 180 points is needed to redeem a $18 coupon reward. The ERP using the earning value as a reference basis is $5 per point.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">For Merchant A, redeeming for a $5 coupon costs 50 points (=$5.00/50) where 1 point is worth $0.10 (i.e., the ERP using the reward value as a reference basis is $0.10 per point) and redeeming for a $10 coupon costs 80 points where 1 point is worth $0.13 (i.e., the ERP using the reward value as a reference basis is $0.13 per point).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For Merchant B, redeeming for a $6 coupon costs 100 points where 1 point is worth $0.6 (i.e., the ERP using the reward value as a reference basis is $0.6 per point), redeeming for a $12 coupon costs 140 points where 1 point is worth $0.9 (i.e., the ERP using the reward value as a reference basis is $0.9 per point), and redeeming for a $18 coupon costs 180 points where 1 point is worth $0.10 (i.e., the ERP using the reward value as a reference basis is $0.10 per point). Where there is also a % discount reward, the % discount reward may be assigned a $10 coupon value, for example, and calculated accordingly.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As can be seen, the ERP per point may vary depending on the reward option. Accordingly, the determined ERP for exchange purposes may be set using a number of different methods such as: at the average value of a point, at the highest value of a point, at the lowest value of a point, and any combination thereof where the ERP for exchange purposes may be any combination of the reward point values. For example, if a merchant expects that 90% of rewards points issued will be redeemed based on the monetary reward rules and 10% of rewards points issued will be redeemed based on the non-monetary reward rules, then the determined ERP may be a weighted average of the ERP as calculated based on monetary reward rules (i.e., weighted at 90%) and the ERP as calculated based on non-monetary reward rules (i.e., weighted at 10%). As will be appreciated, the ERP as calculated based on monetary reward rules may further be defined as a weighted average based on the different monetary reward options and expected redemption rates for each reward option. As will be appreciated, similar weighted averages may be applicable to monetary earning rules and non-monetary earning rules.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Returning to the example, for Merchant B; the highest value for a point is $0.10, the lowest value of a point is $0.6, and the average value of a point is $0.8 using ($0.6+$0.10)/2. Other suitable representative values other than the arithmetic mean (e.g., median, mode, weighted averages, etc.) may also be used. Where the arithmetic mean is used, Merchant A has an ERP of 1 point=$0.11 USD and Merchant B has an ERP of 1 point=$0.8 USD.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once their ERPs have been calculated and set using reward value as a reference basis, Merchants A and B may continue to adjust their earning rules without changing the redemption value of the points. Conversely, once their ERPs have been calculated and set using earning value as a reference basis, Merchants A and B may continue to adjust their reward rules without changing the earning value of the points.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Alternatively, the ERPs of Merchant A and Merchant B may be from any combination of the value of the points from both earning value and reward value as reference bases.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The ERPs for Merchant A and for Merchant B is, for example, associated with the merchants in the LRS database <b>160</b>. The ERPs may be re-calculated if and when the merchants change their earning rules and reward rules as applicable.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As will be appreciated, the ERPs allow conversion of the points to a common basis (e.g., dollars), and hence allow loyalty rewards points associated with a customer account with Merchant A and loyalty rewards points associated with a customer account with Merchant B to be normalized in the common basis and fairly compared. As described above, the ERPs may be based on different reference basis to define the value of a single point. Additionally, in other examples, the common basis may be a different quantitative amount other than dollars as presented above. For example, the common basis may be the loyalty rewards points of either Merchant A or Merchant B (or another Merchant <b>140</b>), or a different currency, or another point system basis (e.g., of the Hub <b>400</b>).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As will be further appreciated, where Merchant A and Merchant B are using different currencies, the ERPs may account for currency exchange rates to obtain equivalent values in the common basis between merchants.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some examples, the Hub <b>400</b> may use an intermediate common basis to convert to prior to completing the conversion to the common basis. For example, since most merchants may define their earning rules and reward rules based on local currency, the local currency may be used as an intermediate common basis, and then the Hub <b>400</b> may define an exchange rate from the local currency to another common basis (e.g., Marketplace points, as will be described further below, or the points of a given merchant, etc.).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some examples, the ERPs and common basis may be used to transfer loyalty rewards points from one merchant to another. In particular, the Hub <b>400</b> may facilitate transfers between two customer accounts (e.g., with different merchants) associated with the same hub account.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Where a customer F has 150 Points at Merchant A and wants to transfer them all to Merchant B, the calculation to facilitate this would be the steps: (1) convert the points to USD using (&#x3c;# of Points at Merchant A&#x3e;&#xd7;&#x3c;Merchant A Exchange Rate&#x3e;=USD) to have 150&#xd7; $0.11 USD=$16.50 USD; and (2) convert the US Dollars back to Points using &#x3c;USD&#x3e;&#xf7;&#x3c;Merchant B Exchange Rate&#x3e;=Points at Merchant B to result in $16.50&#xf7;$0.8=206 Points at Merchant B.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Where customer F redeems points of Merchant A for $18 coupon at Merchant B requiring 180 points of Merchant B, the steps are: (1) convert the Points to US Dollars using &#x3c;Points Cost of Coupon at Merchant B&#x3e;&#xd7;&#x3c;Merchant B Exchange Rate&#x3e;=USD to result in 180&#xd7;$0.8 USD=$14.40 USD; (2) Convert the US Dollars back to Points using &#x3c;USD&#x3e;&#xf7;&#x3c;Merchant A Exchange Rate&#x3e;=Points at Merchant A to result in $14.40&#xf7;$0.11=131 Points at Merchant A. 131 points of Merchant A is redeemed at Merchant B for the $18 coupon of Merchant B. For simplicity of illustration, only one merchant's points (Merchant A's points) were used in this redemption example; the points of other merchants may similarly be calculated and used, in addition to those points of Merchant A, in the redemption of the $18 coupon reward of Merchant B.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">While the USD is used in this example, any other currency or any &#x201c;unit&#x201d; may be used as the intermediate transfer unit. It does not matter which currency or unit is used in the calculations to redeem the points at one merchant for the rewards of another merchant.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some examples, the transfer and redemption of points between merchants may create friction for customers to consider the math. Accordingly, the Hub <b>400</b> may provide a summed or combined total of the amount of reward points so that the customers are dealing with a single, normalized common basis (e.g., a single type of currency or reward point) for all of their redemptions in a Marketplace (i.e., a common platform for merchants and customers, as supported by the Hub <b>400</b>). The combined total is a proxy currency or proxy points to represent the total reward points of the customer at the merchants. The Marketplace comprises merchants which permit the customers to redeem the points of other merchants at their estore. Once the customer selects where they would like to spend their combined reward points, the Hub <b>400</b> processes their request accordingly. The &#x201c;summed up&#x201d; or combined reward points may be referred to herein as Marketplace points (MPs).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">While the examples as described have shown merchants with either currency or points, the merchants in the Marketplace or in collaboration, in some embodiments, the Marketplace has heterogeneous merchants where some merchants use currency type of reward points and the rest of the merchants use points type of reward points. These heterogeneous Marketplaces may use the ERPs to convert the reward points into the same type of reward points (e.g., the Marketplace points) for a combined total. In other examples, another common basis may be used by the Hub <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In a further example, the Hub <b>400</b> may aggregate and output a combined total in both a points type and a currency type of reward points. Different exchange rates for points may be used to provide all types of reward points from whatever types of reward points a merchant may use. Such combined totals may have the advantages of both types of reward points.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">To further the example; Merchant A has 1 Point=$0.11 USD resulting 9.9 Points=$1.00 USD, Merchant B has 1 Point=$0.8 USD resulting in 12.50 Points=$1.00 USD. When each of these merchants opted-in to Marketplace, there is provided their points to dollar conversion rate (rounded exchange rate): Merchant A has 9 Points=$1.00 USD, and Merchant B has 13 Points=$1.00 USD.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">For example, a customer A with 100 points at Merchant A has $11.00 USD (100&#xd7;$0.11) redeemable value and with 200 points at Merchant B has $16.00 USD (200&#xd7;$0.8). The combined total would then be $27.00 USD ($11.00+$16.00).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The combined total could be displayed to the customer in a number of different ways including (1) to show the combined total in currency (USD), for example $27.00, of available coupons that they may spend, and (2) to show the combined total in MPs where 1 MP is set at $0.10 USD. The value of one MP may be set at any number, but a convenient value is the average value of the reward points over all of the merchants. In a Marketplace of only Merchant A and Merchant B, the average of $0.11 and $0.80 is rounded to or is approximately $0.10 USD. Setting the value of one MP to $0.10 USD would allow the MPs to approximate the reward points at the merchants in this example.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Where value of one MP is set at $0.10 USD, the 100 points at Merchant A converts to 110 MPs (100&#xd7;$0.11=$11.00 USD redeemable value divided by $0.10=110 MPs), and the 200 points at Merchant B converts to 160 MPs (200&#xd7;$0.8=$16.00 USD redeemable value divided by $0.10=160 MP). The combined total of 110 MPs and 160 MPs results in 270 MPs being displayed as the amount points available to be spent or redeemed.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">For implementations using actual monetary amounts as the combined total; the customer may expect one dollar deduction for each dollar spent or redeemed, but many merchants have complex redemption rules such as tiered redemption rules where higher spending customers (such as VIPs) have reduced redemption costs. There may not be one dollar deduced for each dollar spent or redeemed unless the Marketplace sets a rule requiring one dollar deduction for each dollar spending. Accordingly, the Hub <b>400</b> may use MPs instead of monetary amounts to hide such complex redemption rules as customers may not be expecting one point deduction for each point spent or redeemed.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a web page displaying the information of a customer by the Hub <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in accordance with an example embodiment. This example embodiment is set up to use MPs where each merchant sets their own exchange rate for points (ERP). By setting their own ERP, the merchants may be able to more flexibly adjust the value of their reward points to match the needs of each of their businesses.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Upon a customer signing into their hub account through the Access Module <b>410</b>, Hub Module <b>420</b> identifies a set of associated customer accounts associated with the hub account using the Hub Database <b>430</b>. Each associated customer account in the set corresponds to a customer account with one of the merchants on the e-commerce platform <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the Hub Module <b>420</b> may then retrieve data from the LRS database <b>160</b> for each associated customer account. In particular, the data retrieved by the Hub Module <b>420</b> may include the associated loyalty reward point balances for the customer account. The associated loyalty rewards points for each respective customer account may then be converted to a common basis, such as MPs. In particular, the Hub Module <b>420</b> may use the ERPs for each merchant to convert the corresponding loyalty rewards points of the customer account for that merchant. As a result of the conversion, the Hub Module <b>420</b> obtains a nominal value representing the associated loyalty rewards points for the customer account in the common basis.

This method creates more work for the customer and some customers may prefer a method requiring less work.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">A low to high method is provided where to transfer from is based on the assumption that a smaller number of points are less &#x201c;useful&#x201d; to a customer than a larger number of points at a single store. This is because many loyalty reward programs are structured to prevent fraud, thereby requiring the customer to have made at least a couple purchases before they can redeem.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The low to high method has three steps: (1) sort the available reward point balances from lowest to highest, (2) Subtract from the balance at the top of the list (up to a max of target total), and (3) if more points are still required, repeat steps 1 and 2.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">For customer Fran's target total of $27.00 MD at Eight Ounce, the transfers required based on customer Fran's current balances are: (1) sorted listed of balances from lowest to highest of opted-in stores, and (2) transferring from Sloane Tea=50 Points&#x2192;$4.00 MD ($23.00 MD still needed), Boathouse=100 Points&#x2192;$10.00 MD ($13.00 MD still needed), and Ivory Ella=300 Points&#x2192;$24.00 MD but only transfer $13.00 MD (163 points used) as the target total of $20.00 MD is achieved. The remaining reward points are not transferred leaving at Ivory Ella=137 Points&#x2192;$11.00 MD and L'Oreal=400 Points&#x2192;$32.00 MD</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In this example, the actual number of points subtracted from each merchant would be computed based on [currency-backed normalization] such at Ivory Ella, each point is worth $0.8 USD, and $13.00 worth of value is needed for transfer, 13&#xf7;0.8=162.5 Points (rounded to <b>163</b>) should be subtracted.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Once the transfer is complete, customer Fran's balances would be: Sloane Tea=0 Points, Boathouse=0 Points, Ivory Ella=137 Points, L'Oreal=400 Points, and Eight Ounce=500 Points&#x2192;$45.00 MD.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Once the transfer is complete, customer Fran redeems her 500 Points for the 10% off discount at Eight Ounce.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Alternatively, a high to low method is used which has three steps: (1) sort the available reward point balances from highest to lowest, (2) Subtract from the balance at the top of the list (up to a max of target total), and (3) if more points are still required, repeat steps 1 and 2. Further, the list of reward point balances may be sorted into random order. It will be understood that there are other known methods to sort the list of reward point balances.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Alternatively, a black list and white list of accounts or merchants may further be incorporated into the list of merchants who are part of the collaboration or Marketplace. For example, the reward points on black list of accounts are not to be taken for exchange and transfer except manually by the customer, and reward points on white list of accounts may be taken for exchange and transfer. Such black list may be selected from a list of merchants (not shown).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific devices, methods, conditions, or parameters described and/or shown herein, and that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments by way of example only.
