including a camera system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, image sensors may include a large number of imaging elements as pixels. Since a lot of imaging elements have to be arranged in an image sensor having a limited area, miniaturization of imaging elements is desired. Specifically, there is a demand for scaling down of an imaging sensor mounted on a mobile device such as a mobile phone, and therefore imaging elements arranged in such an imaging sensor have to be miniaturized. Generally, smaller imaging elements have poorer electrical and optical performance. In contrast, users demand images having higher quality.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A photodiode is generally used as an imaging element for an imaging sensor. A photodiode converts light impinging thereon into an electric charge. Intensities of light impinging on respective photodiodes can be detected and constructed as an image by reading the converted charges as electrical signals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One important property of a photodiode is the upper limit of the capacity for storing charges converted when light impinges on the photodiode, i.e., full well capacity (FWC). If an imaging element, and therefore a photodiode, becomes smaller, the FWC decreases. FWC is a maximum signal charge which a photodiode can store. Therefore, the decrease of the FWC results in a decrease of the dynamic range. Since imaging sensors having a small dynamic range have a narrow latitude, it becomes difficult to obtain an image having a high quality without being affected by exposure conditions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an imaging element <b>900</b> including a conventional photodiode having a pinned photodiode structure. If electrons are utilized as signal charges, an n type region and a p+ type region on the n type region are disposed on a p type semiconductor substrate or a p type well <b>902</b> such as silicon to form a photodiode <b>904</b>. An n+ type floating diffusion region <b>906</b> is disposed adjacent to the photodiode <b>904</b>. A transfer gate electrode <b>908</b> is disposed between the photodiode <b>904</b> and the floating diffusion region <b>906</b>. A detecting node (not shown) for reading signals from the photodiode <b>904</b> is connected to the floating diffusion region <b>906</b> directly or via an amplifier. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows a configuration utilizing electrons as signal charges by way of example, it should be noted that if holes are utilized as signal charges, conductivity types of respective regions are opposite to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When light impinges on the photodiode <b>904</b> in the imaging element <b>900</b>, the photodiode <b>904</b> converts light into electrons and stores the electrons as a photodiode signal charge. After finishing the exposure, a relatively high voltage is applied on the transfer gate electrode <b>908</b>, and the photodiode signal charge stored in the photodiode <b>904</b> is transferred to the floating diffusion region <b>906</b>. The intensity of light impinging on the imaging element <b>900</b> can be detected by reading the photodiode signal charge on the detecting node.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such an imaging sensor <b>900</b> reduces a dark current generated and functioning as noise when light does not impinge. However, miniaturization of the imaging sensor <b>900</b> results in a decrease of the FWC, and therefore decreases the dynamic range. In order to increase the FWC, a lateral overflow integrated capacity (LOFIC) structure, for example, is proposed (for example, Patent Publication 1).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows an imaging element <b>1000</b> having an LOFIC structure. The imaging element <b>1000</b> includes: a photodiode <b>1004</b>; a floating diffusion region <b>1006</b>; and a first transfer gate electrode <b>1008</b> disposed between the photodiode <b>1004</b> and the floating diffusion region <b>1006</b>. A reset transistor <b>1023</b> for resetting charges remaining in the photodiode <b>1004</b> and the floating diffusion region <b>1006</b> is connected to the floating diffusion region <b>1006</b>. A detecting node <b>1026</b> is connected to the floating diffusion region <b>1006</b> via an amplifier <b>1022</b> and a row-selecting transistor <b>1024</b>. Therefore, these elements are configured as a pinned photodiode structure similar to the conventional imaging element <b>900</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. Furthermore, a storage capacitor <b>1014</b> is connected to the photodiode <b>1004</b> via an overflow gate <b>1016</b>. The storage capacitor <b>1014</b> is connected to the floating diffusion region <b>1006</b> via a second transfer gate electrode <b>1018</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">When light impinges on the photodiode <b>1004</b> of the imaging element <b>1000</b>, the photodiode <b>1004</b> converts light into electrons and stores the electrons as a photodiode signal charge. If the photodiode signal charge exceeds the FWC of the photodiode <b>1004</b>, charges, which are no longer stored in the photodiode <b>1004</b>, are transferred via the overflow gate <b>1016</b> to and stored in the storage capacitor <b>1014</b> as a storage signal charge. After finishing the exposure, the imaging element <b>1000</b> transfers the photodiode signal charge to the floating diffusion region <b>1006</b> via the first transfer gate electrode <b>1008</b>. The photodiode signal charge has a small amount of dark current noise as discussed above. The imaging element <b>1000</b> then transfers the storage signal charge to the floating diffusion region <b>1006</b> via the second transfer gate electrode <b>1018</b>. Noise included in the storage signal charge and resulting from a dark current is larger than the noise of the photodiode signal charge. However, since the photodiode signal charge is read separately from the storage signal charge, the dark current noise of the storage signal charge is not important. Since an imaging element having an LOFIC structure utilizes a photodiode signal charge having a reduced dark current noise while utilizing a larger storage signal charge stored in a storage capacitor, a dynamic range of the imaging element can be improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, it is known that an imaging element having an LOFIC structure has large reading noise such as thermal noise, Johnson noise, or Nyquist noise (e.g., kT/C noise, describing the total thermal noise power added to a signal when a sample is taken on a capacitor). Since a storage signal charge cannot be completely transferred from a storage capacitor to a detecting node, the storage signal charge cannot be read by using correlating double sampling (CDS). Therefore, non-negligible kT/C noise is generated. The large kT/C noise degrades a signal when switching from reading a photodiode signal charge to reading a total signal charge of the photodiode signal charge and a storage signal charge.</p><heading

In this case, the VDD voltage is applied to the floating diffusion regions <b>106</b>, <b>120</b>, and the floating diffusion regions <b>106</b>, <b>120</b> are reset. Since the potentials of the photodiode <b>104</b> and the gate-controlled storage <b>112</b> are shallower than those of the floating diffusion regions <b>106</b>, <b>120</b>, residual signal charges are transferred to the floating diffusion regions <b>106</b>, <b>120</b>.

Since the first and second transfer gate electrodes <b>108</b>, <b>114</b> are pulled down, the first and second transfer gate transistors have high potentials. Since the photodiode <b>104</b> has a relatively low well-type potential due to its n type region. Since the storage-controlling gate electrode <b>114</b> is pulled up, the gate-controlled storage <b>112</b>, which is the n type region, has a well-type potential lower than that of the photodiode <b>104</b>. The overflow path <b>110</b> has a potential lower than those of the first and second transfer gate transistors and higher than those of the photodiode <b>104</b> and the gate-controlled storage <b>112</b> due to the n&#x2212; type region of the overflow path <b>110</b>.

If the storage-controlling gate electrode <b>114</b> remains pulled up, the potential of the gate-controlled storage <b>112</b> is deep and the storage signal charge cannot be completely transferred to the floating diffusion region <b>120</b>. Therefore, the storage-controlling gate electrode <b>114</b> is pulled down and the potential of the gate-controlled storage <b>112</b> is lowered. The first transfer gate electrode <b>108</b> is also pulled up, and charges remaining in the photodiode <b>104</b> in operation <b>1110</b> and charges which have flown back from the gate-controlled storage <b>112</b>, are transferred to the floating diffusion region <b>106</b>.

These voltages are read out directly or, in case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, by amplified through the amplifier <b>122</b>. Comparing the voltage of the read signal charges with the reset signal discussed above, the correlation double sampling (CDS) can be carried out.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The imaging element <b>100</b> can store the electrons in the gate-controlled storage <b>112</b> via the overflow path <b>110</b> even if the photodiode <b>104</b> has saturated. Therefore, the imaging element <b>100</b> can have an FWC larger than that of conventional imaging elements. Furthermore, the signal charge can be read by using correlation double sampling (CDS) and therefore the effect of the kT/C noise can be reduced. When light impinging on the photodiode <b>104</b> is small, the photodiode signal charge having a small dark current can be used. When light impinging on the photodiode <b>104</b> is large, the photodiode signal charge and the storage signal charge can be used. Therefore, an image having a high quality and a large dynamic range can be obtained. This effect becomes more significant by reading the photodiode signal charge at a higher gain first, and then by reading the photodiode signal charge and the storage signal charge at a lower gain.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although an example utilizing electrons as a signal charge was described in this embodiment, it should be noted that respective regions of an imaging element have inverted conductivity types if holes are utilized as a signal charge.

Since an image sensor employing the global shutter imaging elements as global shutter pixels can carry out the exposure at all of the imaging elements at the same time, the image sensor does not cause image distortions even if an object moving at a fast speed is shot as a still image or recorded as a movie. All of the imaging elements also can carry out the exposure at the same time during reading the charges. Furthermore, a global memory signal charge with a small dark current can be utilized by making the potential of the global memory shallower and reducing charges stored in the global memory. Since charges overflowing from the global memory can be utilized as a storage signal charge stored in the gate-controlled storage, the charges can be stored without saturation even if the amount of light impinging on the imaging element is large.

Therefore, according to the embodiment, the pixel <b>770</b> can synthesize an image having a large dynamic range by using outputs of the sub-pixels which are complementarily effective in low and high illuminance conditions, respectively.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a plan view of a pixel <b>870</b> according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of the pixel <b>870</b>. The pixel <b>870</b> includes a red-green-blue (RGB) sub pixel <b>840</b> including photodiodes <b>844</b>, <b>848</b>, <b>852</b>, having color filters for transmitting red, green, and blue light, respectively. The subpixel <b>840</b> further includes transfer gate electrodes <b>846</b>, <b>850</b>, and <b>854</b> respectively for the photodiodes <b>844</b>, <b>848</b>, and <b>852</b>. The pixel <b>870</b> also includes a white sub pixel <b>800</b> (including a photodiode <b>804</b>, a transfer gate electrode <b>808</b>, and other elements <b>806</b>, <b>814</b>, etc.) not having a filter, or a complementary color sub pixel <b>800</b> having a complementary color filter, e.g., yellow, cyan, and magenta. The elements (e.g., <b>823</b>, <b>822</b>, <b>824</b>, and <b>826</b>) of the pixel <b>870</b> are similarly configured as examples mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The white/complementary color sub pixel has a wavelength bandwidth wider than that of the RGB sub pixel, and therefore generally generates photoelectrons more than the RGB sub pixel even in the same illuminance condition. For example, when imaging is carried out under a white light source, the output of the white/complementary color sub pixel may be three times as the RGB sub pixel. Therefore, the white/complementary color sub pixel has an advantage of a high sensitivity in a low illuminance condition, while the sub pixel is saturated with light having a one-third of intensity of the RGB sub pixel. Therefore, the white/complementary color sub pixel is disadvantageous in the high illuminance condition. However, the white/complementary color sub pixel <b>800</b> of the pixel <b>870</b> according to the embodiment includes a large FWC due to the same configuration as the imaging element <b>100</b>. Therefore, the white/complementary color sub pixel <b>800</b> of the pixel <b>870</b> is not saturated in the same illuminance level as the RGB sub pixel <b>840</b> and can provide a large output in a low illuminance level, and therefore improves the dynamic range.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">An image sensor including imaging elements according to some embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied to an imaging device such as a camera system.
