No. 62/943,997 is incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of orthopedic supports and braces, and more particularly to a knee brace with improvements in more intuitive donning, doffing and comfort.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain specialized orthopedic knee braces and supports are used to address osteoarthritis (OA). This is typically achieved by employing a plurality of rigid support members positioned adjacent to the body on either side of the skeletal joint being stabilized. The manner of fixation and articulation of the brace creates corrective forces that relieve condyle knee pain. Orthopedic braces are medical devices where design focus is mainly on function. While they can be effective, they are often bulky and heavy with excessive rigid framework. They typically employ a multitude of straps that require continuous lacing and unlacing each time, making it tedious to don and doff. Their overall size and coverage area over the limb can trap heat generated by activities of daily living making the brace uncomfortable to wear. These factors decrease patient compliance even against the benefits of pain relief and mobility.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As will be disclosed below, the present invention addresses all of these issues. The device is designed to be light by reducing the size of the framework. It uses a single sided framework made of light but strong metal components. The frame is integrated with plastic cuffs that are designed for toughness and a balance of flexibility and rigidity where necessary. The cuffs have significant openings to allow air flow.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of a multitude of straps is most effective in stabilization of the knee and migration of the brace. The straps are engineered with quick release attachments. This eliminates the need for threading the straps each time it is used. Additionally, it allows for the strap lengths to be preset, minimizing the need to adjust the straps.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unloading is achieved by independently articulating the frame section directly adjacent to the knee joint. The present invention includes means to easily adjust the amount of unloading while providing minimal intrusion into site of the knee infirmity.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present invention is embodied as an orthopedic device, including an articulating frame; and, a plurality of straps attachable to the articulating frame. The articulating frame includes a thigh portion, a calf portion, and a center hinge. The thigh portion includes a semi-flexible curved thigh cuff having an upper end configured to wrap anterior to the leg and a lower end. The calf portion includes a semi-flexible curved calf cuff having a lower end configured to wrap posterior to the leg and an upper end. The center hinge assembly connects the thigh portion and the calf portion. The center hinge assembly includes a center hinge element, a first Q-angle adjuster, and a second Q-angle adjuster. The first Q-angle adjuster is positioned between the center hinge element and the thigh portion and is configured to adjust a Q-angle of the thigh portion of the articulating frame. The second Q-angle adjuster is positioned between the center hinge element and the calf portion and is configured to adjust a Q-angle of the calf portion of the articulating frame.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each Q-angle adjuster is configured to adjust the varus valgus corrective angle (i.e. Q-angle) of the articulating frame.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment, the thigh portion includes an upright thigh bar having an upright thigh bar first end and an upright thigh bar second end. The upright thigh bar first end is connected to the center hinge assembly. The upright thigh bar second end fits into a thigh pocket formed in the thigh cuff. The calf portion includes an upright calf bar having an upright calf bar first end and an upright calf bar second end. The upright calf bar first end is connected to the center hinge assembly. The upright calf bar second end fits into a calf pocket formed in the calf cuff.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">While other soft braces with rigid internal components do exist, few if any, utilize a rigid upright (i.e. articulating frame) with the ability to adjust the that can significantly affect the 3-point pressure system that unloads the affected osteoarthritic compartment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one preferred embodiment the straps for both the thighs and calves preferably utilize pushbutton clips and receptacles that provide easy fastening. In another preferred embodiment double location latches, with levers having easy to engage loop ends provide this easy fastening.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, the invention is a supplemental orthopedic support wrap used in conjunction with an orthopedic device (i.e. brace). The support wrap includes a substrate, at least one relocatable stay and a support wrap tab. The substrate includes an elastic layer, a loop material layer bonded to one side of the elastic layer, and a target area located on the loop material layer for defining a placement position for a thigh portion of an articulating frame of an orthopedic brace.

This embodiment utilizes separate locations for engagement and release of lever <b>102</b>. It provides mechanical advantage for snap fit hook <b>110</b> engagement. The press location <b>112</b> is at the approximate midline of lever <b>102</b>. This ensures the snap fit hook <b>110</b> is engaged with a light tactile force. The location <b>112</b> is configured for intuitive use by its distinctive geometry differentiation from the surrounding area. The lever release, i.e. looped first end <b>103</b>, is at an alternate location and is at the end of the lever <b>102</b>. This looped first end <b>103</b> tab-like geometry is configured to flex and allow convenient access thereunder. This ensures the snap fit hook <b>110</b> is disengaged when intended. The flexion characteristic of the looped first end (i.e. end tab) <b>103</b> minimized undesired hook <b>110</b> engagement and encourages the user to the press location <b>112</b> to engage the lever <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, a second embodiment of the orthopedic device is illustrated, designated generally by <b>10</b>&#x2032;. This embodiment includes attachment elements that are pushbutton assemblies <b>114</b> rather than latch mechanisms <b>66</b>. Other than the differing strap attachments, orthopedic device <b>10</b> is the same as <b>10</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the straps <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> has a pushbutton clip at a free end, i.e. strap clip engagement end <b>116</b> thereof. A strap pushbutton clip <b>118</b> includes a D-ring section. The strap pushbutton clip <b>118</b> provides means for quick attachment or release of the thigh strap <b>18</b> from the articulating frame <b>14</b> for donning and doffing.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C</figref>, the pushbutton clip <b>118</b> and integral pushbutton receptacle <b>120</b> provide quick attachment or release of the strap <b>18</b> from the articulating frame <b>14</b> for donning and doffing. The pushbutton assembly is illustrated, which collectively includes the receiver component (i.e. receptacle <b>120</b>) that is integral with the cuff, and the pushbutton clip <b>118</b> (i.e. chafe) that attaches to the strap <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, or <b>22</b>. The receptacle <b>120</b> has a slot <b>123</b> for the pushbutton clip <b>118</b> to slide into, a hole <b>124</b> for a button <b>126</b> to snap into and retain the clip <b>118</b> plus a dished-out area <b>128</b> that allows the finger to easily navigate to the button that also helps prevent accidental pressing of the button. The pushbutton clip <b>118</b> has a slot <b>123</b> for the strap to attach through, a thin area of plastic <b>125</b> between the slot <b>124</b> and the button <b>126</b> (on the concave pushbutton portion of the clip), that allows the pushbutton clip to flex in order to match the circumference of the anatomy and the button <b>126</b>. The button <b>126</b> has a round shape that allows the pushbutton clip <b>118</b> to rotate so that the strap can follow the shape of the anatomy. The button <b>126</b> in the middle of this round shape has a dished out area <b>130</b> that helps prevent accidental pressings which is also more intimate with the shape of the finger that allows for easier pressing. There is a dome <b>131</b> in the middle of this dish and a concentric ridge <b>132</b> on the exit side that helps the finger get a good grip to activate the button. This button has a flexible hinge area <b>134</b> that allows the button <b>126</b> to flex out of the way of the receiver hole's wall <b>136</b> for removal. The receiver hole's wall <b>136</b> has a lead-in chamfer <b>138</b> on the upper outside edge created by the slot opening <b>122</b>. The chamfer <b>138</b> assists an entry side <b>140</b> of the button <b>126</b> through slot <b>122</b>. It also has two stops <b>142</b> that allows the button to not get flexed up into the receiver's hole <b>124</b> too far so that the flexible hinge <b>134</b> does not get sprung. The height of the button <b>126</b> is lower on the entry side <b>140</b> so that it is easy to insert but is higher on an exit side <b>144</b> for retention. This graded height also flexes the receiver's top section with the hole <b>124</b> to slightly flex out of the way for insertion. The entry side <b>140</b> is still high enough that the button <b>126</b> doesn't accidently disengage itself when the pushbutton clip <b>118</b> is rotated while in the receiver <b>120</b>. The exit side <b>144</b> is high enough for retention, but still can slide through the slot opening <b>122</b> of the receiver <b>120</b> when being activated. The location of the hinge <b>134</b> and stops <b>142</b> along with the exit side <b>144</b> of the button allows the button to flex and remain intimate with the receiver's hole wall <b>136</b> when being flexed around the anatomy and when stronger forces are being applied from the strap so that the pushbutton clip <b>118</b> does not get pulled out of the receiver <b>120</b> (receptacle).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref> strap adjustment is illustrated.
