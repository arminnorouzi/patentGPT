compound or molding composition (T) comprising at least one type of recycled polymer material (A) containing recycled acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (r-ABS) as component (A1), at least one graft copolymer (B) different from (A) and at least one block copolymer (C). Further, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), the use of the thermoplastic molding composition (T) for preparing a shaped article and a shaped article prepared from the thermoplastic molding composition (T).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Products made from, or incorporating plastic components are part of almost any work place or home environment. Most of these plastics are virgin plastics that are produced from petroleum. In the recent years, there has been a strong movement to recycle and reuse petrochemical products, such as plastics, in addition to metallic material. Recycling plastic (recycling material) from waste plastic materials has a variety of benefits compared to producing virgin plastic from petroleum, e.g. less energy is required, the need for disposing waste material is reduced, and the use of limited geological resources, such as petroleum, is reduced. Typically, waste plastic materials include post-consumer and post-industrial waste materials and plastic scrap. Some of the most common polymer types in waste plastic materials from durable goods are acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers (ABS), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), polypropylene (PP) and polycarbonate (PC).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Durable goods, such as automobile equipment, appliance and electronic equipment, represents a significant portion of municipal waste and are increasingly being collected at the end of their lives and partly recycled in order to avoid disposal cost and to recover metals and other marketable raw materials. Generally, the metal content in automobiles, appliances and electronics is higher than the plastics content (typically plastics content is less than 30%). Thus, the metal recovery operation often precedes plastic recovery. Most metal recovery operations shred equipment, in order to cost-effectively liberate metals from the durable goods.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The recovery of plastics from durable goods often requires a plastic-rich raw material. Typically, such plastic rich raw materials obtained from metal recyclers or automotive shredder residues are highly variable mixtures obtained from different types of durable goods, and as a consequence they are highly variable mixtures of different types and grades of polymers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Often, highly contaminated scrap is hand-separated at significant local environmental cost. The challenges in recycling plastics from durable goods include multiple plastic types, multiple resin grades of the same plastic types, large amounts of contaminants, such as fillers, reinforcing agents, and pigments, metal, paint and metallic coatings, as well as highly variable part sizes and shapes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Different grades of certain plastics have particular sets of targeted physical characteristics or properties. The particular physical characteristics or properties of a grade are controlled by the chemical composition of the polymers in the grade, the average molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of polymers in the grade, the rubber morphology for impact modified grades, and the types of additives in the grade.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Different grades of a given plastic type are generally compatible. Grades can generally be melt-mixed to create a new material with a different property profile. Different plastic types, on the other hand, cannot generally be melt-combined as easily unless the types happen to be compatible. Blends of different polymers, which are not compatible, lead to decreased mechanical performance. The adhesion between phases of non-compatible polymers is low. Contamination at lower levels, which does not affect the mechanical properties, can still lead to surface defects such as stripes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to create high value products, the plastic recycling process often must be able to separate highly mixed streams of a plastic type on a flake-by-flake basis to achieve products with acceptable purity. Methods, such as separation by density, density differential alteration (DDA), froth flotation, color sorting and tribo-electrostatic separation (TES), have been used to achieve some purification of the plastics derived from durable goods, as described, for example, in Paul Allen, Development of Hydrocyclones for Use in Plastics Recycling (American Plastics Council, 1999), patents U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,238,579, 6,335,376, 5,653,867 and 5,399,433.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The document WO 2003/086733 describes a process for preparing recycled plastics wherein a plastic rich mixture is separated in multiple steps selected from preprocessing operations, size reduction operations, gravity concentration operations, color sorting, sorting by thickness, friction, or differential terminal velocity or drag in air, surface to mass control operations, separating processes enhanced by narrow surface to mass distribution, blending operations, and extrusion and compounding operations. For example the process described in WO 03/086733 may provide a recycled ABS plastic stream, wherein the plastic source may be refrigerators or automation equipment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Often, the materials obtained from the above-mentioned methods do not meet today's requirements of highly pure and defined post-consumer recycling plastic.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">EP-A 1494843 (MBA) claims a multistep recycling method for producing recycled plastic materials, that are characterized by a sequence of operations selected from the group consisting of preprocessing operations, size reduction operations, gravity concentration operations, color sorting, sorting by thickness, friction, or differential terminal velocity or drag in air, control operations based on the ratio of surface area to mass, separation processes enhanced by narrow surface to mass distributions, blending operations and extrusion and compounding operations. Plastic-rich mixtures are subjected to the process, and one or more recycled plastic materials are collected as outputs of the sequence of processes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still, this improvement typically does not provide recycled plastic materials with properties that are required for certain high quality applications, e.g. for use in electronic and automobile equipment. It is therefore necessary to provide recycling products that can be used for such purposes as an alternative to the corresponding virgin polymer products. There is a high demand for thermoplastic molding compositions containing recycled acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers, having constantly good properties such as impact strength and flowability (melt flow rate/melt viscosity rate; MVR).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Surprisingly, it was found that combinations of a recycled material comprising recycled acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene-copolymer (ABS) with a block copolymer and a graft copolymer as additives have a favorable property profile. There is a synergistic effect of the graft copolymer and the block copolymer on the impact strength of the recycled material whereas the negative effects of these copolymers on other properties of the recycled polymer material, which are usually observed if either the graft-copolymer or the block-copolymer is added alone, are surprisingly mitigated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention proposes to a thermoplastic molding composition (T) comprising (or consisting of):</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">A 10 to 99% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of at least one type of recycled polymer material (A), containing<br/>A1 20 to 100% by weight, based on the total weight of the recycled material (A), of at least one recycled acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (A1);<br/>A2 optionally up to 80% by weight, based on the total weight of the recycled material (A), of at least one recycled styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (A2);<br/>A3 optionally up to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the recycled material<br/>(A), of recycled polymeric impurities (A3), different from (A1) and (A2);<br/>B 0.1 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of at least one graft copolymer (B), different from (A);<br/>C 0.1 to 18% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of at least one block copolymer (C);<br/>D optionally up to 89.8% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of at least one further polymer component (D), different from (A), (B) and (C);<br/>E optionally up to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of at least one filler and/or reinforcing agent (E) and<br/>F optionally up to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of at least one further additive (F).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Preferably, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) comprises 20 to 99% by weight, more preferably 50 to 98% by weight, even more preferably 70 to 96% by weight, particularly preferably 80 to 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of the at least one type of recycled polymer material (A).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Furthermore, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) preferably comprises 0.5 to 25% by weight, more preferably 1 to 20% by weight, even more preferably 2 to 15% by weight, particularly preferably 5 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of the at least one graft copolymer (B).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Moreover, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) preferably comprises 0.5 to 16% by weight, more preferably 1 to 15% by weight, even more preferably 2 to 12% by weight, particularly preferably 5 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of the at least one block copolymer (C).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Optionally, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) preferably comprises up to 79% by weight, more preferably up to 48% by weight, even more preferably up to 26% by weight, particularly preferably up to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of the at least one further polymer component (D).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">Furthermore, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) optionally comprises preferably up to 25% by weight, more preferably up to 20% by weight, even more preferably up to 10% by weight, particularly preferably up to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of at least one filler and/or reinforcing agent (E).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">Moreover, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) optionally comprises preferably up to 20% by weight, more preferably up to 10% by weight, even more preferably up to 8% by weight, particularly preferably up to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the thermoplastic molding composition (T), of the at least one further additive (F).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) comprises, preferably consists of, the components (A), (B), (C), optionally (D), optionally (E) and optionally (F) in the preferable amounts defined above.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) comprises, preferably consists of, the components (A), (B), (C), optionally (D), optionally (E) and optionally (F) in the more preferable amounts defined above.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the thermoplastic molding composition (T) comprises, preferably consists of, component (A), which contains at least one ABS and one SAN-copolymer;
