technical field related to healthcare, and particularly relates to a biological information measurement device, a method for controlling the biological information measurement device, and a non-transitory recording medium storing a program.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, it has become widespread to perform health management by: measuring information (hereinafter, also referred to as biological information) on the body and health of an individual such as a blood pressure value and an electrocardiographic waveform with a measurement device; and recording and analyzing the measurement result with an information terminal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As an example of the measurement device as described above, a portable electrocardiographic measurement device for measuring an electrocardiographic waveform immediately when an abnormality occurs in everyday life (so-called event electrocardiographic testing), such as pain and palpitation in a chest, has been proposed, and a contribution to an early detection or appropriate treatment of heart disease is expected (for example, Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Incidentally, when the measured electrocardiographic waveform is confirmed, there is a need to confirm only the electrocardiographic waveform measured at timing when the subject becomes aware of some symptom. In this regard, Patent Document 1 proposes a portable electrocardiographic measurement device that includes a liquid crystal display and an operation button, and is capable of inputting subjective symptoms of a subject and recording them together with the electrocardiographic waveform at the time of electrocardiographic measurement.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the electrocardiographic measurement device described in Patent Document 1, it is possible to efficiently confirm a biological waveform corresponding to a state of the subject at the time of measurement, such as an electrocardiographic waveform measured at the timing when the subject becomes aware of a certain symptom.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST&#x2014;PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 1: JP 2009-28153 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the technology described in Patent Document 1, a display device such as a liquid crystal display and an operation unit need to be provided, and thus the size of the measurement device is increased accordingly. This causes a problem that the holding of the device becomes unstable and the accuracy of the measurement is lowered when the measurement is performed. Also, in the first place, there is a problem in that the portability of the portable electrocardiographic measurement device is reduced.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the problems described above, an object of the present invention is to provide a technology that enables input of predetermined information in a portable biological information measurement device including an electrode, and enables reduction in size by excluding an operation unit and a display screen for information input from a configuration of the device.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To solve the problem described above, the biological information measurement device according to the present invention includes a first electrode, a second electrode, and a third electrode, the biological information measurement device measuring biological information of a measurement target based on a potential difference between the first electrode and the third electrode. The biological information measurement device includes an electrode contact state detector including a first contact detection circuit connected to either the first electrode or the second electrode among the electrodes, a second contact detection circuit connected to the third electrode, and a contact state determinator configured to determine a contact state indicating which of the electrodes is in contact with a surface of the measurement target based on a first signal output from the first contact detection circuit and a second signal output from the second contact detection circuit, and an input receiver configured to receive a contact of the electrode with respect to the surface of the measurement target as input of predetermined operation associated with the contact state.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the configuration described above, by using the electrode for measuring biological information, it is possible to input an operation corresponding to each contact state to the device in accordance with a difference in the contact state of the electrode with the body (which electrode is in contact). Therefore, it is not necessary to separately provide an operation unit for inputting operation, and it is possible to input predetermined information to the device without increasing the size of the device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, a contact detection electrode switcher configured to switch an electrode connected to the first contact detection circuit between the first electrode and the second electrode may be provided. Further, the contact detection electrode switcher may connect one of the first electrode and the second electrode, which is not connected to the first contact detection circuit, to a ground.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With such a configuration, even when input is performed using an electrode optimally arranged for measurement of biological information, the circuit of the electrode contact state detector for determining the input at the time of input of the operation can be switched so as to be connected to an electrode which is not inconvenient for performing the input operation, thereby improving convenience for the user.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the contact state determinator may switch and execute, depending on the electrode connected to the first contact detection circuit, the determination of the contact state between a determination at time of measurement when the biological information of the measurement target is measured and a determination at time of operation input when the input of the predetermined operation is received, and the input receiver may receive a contact of each of the electrodes with respect to the surface of the measurement target as the input of the predetermined operation associated with the contact state when the contact state determinator is executing the determination at the time of operation input.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to such a configuration, the contact determination of the electrode can be properly used depending on the case of performing the measurement of the biological information and the case of performing the input of the information, so that it is possible to prevent the input of the information from being erroneously performed at the time of the measurement of the biological information from occurring, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the predetermined operation corresponding to the contact state may include selecting at least a predetermined item. With such a configuration, it is possible to make the input of the intended information related to the predetermined item only by intentionally changing the contact state of the electrode.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the predetermined item may include a physical condition or an exercise load state when the biological information of the measurement target is measured. Here, the physical condition means a condition that a measurement target (hereinafter, also referred to as a user) becomes aware at the time of measurement of biological information, and may include items such as chest pain, dizziness, malaise, nausea, palpitations, shortness of breath, syncope, and no abnormality. The exercise load state means an amount of exercise perceived by the user at the time of measurement of biological information, and may include, for example, large, normal, small, and rest.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">By associating the physical condition or the exercise load state at the time of measurement of the biological information with the measurement data as described above, it is possible to contribute to efficient confirmation of the measurement data, improvement in analysis accuracy of the measurement data, and the like.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, the biological information measurement device may further include a notifier, and the notifier may be configured to notify information related to measurement of the biological information when the biological information of the measurement target is measured, and notify information related to a content of the predetermined item when the input of the predetermined operation is received. When the notifier is provided, it is possible to notify various types of information, and the convenience of the user can be improved. In addition, when a component such as an LED that does not occupy a large space is used as the notifier, it is also possible to minimize the adverse effect of an increase in the device size. Note that the notifier is not limited to the LED, but may be a liquid crystal display, a speaker, or the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, the biological information may be an electrocardiographic waveform. The present invention is suitable for such a device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, a method for controlling a biological information measurement device according to the present invention is a method for controlling a biological information measurement device including a first electrode, a second electrode, and a third electrode, the biological information measurement device measuring biological information of a measurement target based on a potential difference between the first electrode and the third electrode, the method including a measurement step of measuring the biological information of the measurement target, and an input reception step of receiving input of predetermined operation. In the input reception step, a contact state of each of the electrodes with respect to a surface of the measurement target is determined, and in accordance with a result of the determination, a contact of each of the electrodes with respect to the surface of the measurement target is received as input of predetermined operation associated with the contact state.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the present invention can be considered as a program for causing the biological information measurement device to execute the above-described method, and a computer-readable recording medium including such a program recorded therein in a non-transitory manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also, the configurations and processing described above can be combined with one another to constitute the present invention unless the combination leads to contradiction.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a technology that enables input of predetermined information in a portable biological information measurement device including an electrode, and enables reduction in size by excluding an operation unit and a display screen for information input from a configuration of the device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various embodiments are disclosed, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings in which corresponding reference symbols indicate corresponding parts, in which:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a six-sided view illustrating a configuration of a portable electrocardiograph according to a first embodiment.
