Aspects of the disclosure relate to a smart digital platform that collects, analyzes, and renders appropriate information about fugitive gas emissions identified by a sensor network-based emissions monitoring system in a facility.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The concern for clean living, working, and the industrial environment has increased over the recent decades. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated, as part of leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs, Method 21 to determine and limit fugitive emissions of gases from industrial facilities (e.g., petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing facilities, etc.). Fugitive gases may include, but are not limited to, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and volatile hazardous air pollutants (VHAPs). Such LDAR programs are widely adopted in the United States.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The EPA has specified techniques for measuring/estimating/monitoring fugitive emissions in a document entitled &#x201c;Protocol for Equipment Leak Emissions Estimates,&#x201d; published in November 1995 as EPA-453/R-95-017 (accessible online at https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/efdocs/equiplks.pdf). In general, an industrial facility has to conduct manual Method 21-specified inspections at individual components of the facility using a portable gas monitoring equipment (e.g., VOC analyzers) and record the highest measured value for each component. The EPA-specified correlation factors are then applied to the measured values in order to approximate the total emissions for the facility.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In execution of EPA Method 21, an inspector places an extractive hand-held probe in direct contact with the component under test and traces its circumference, waiting an appropriate amount of time to register a reading of leak concentration (mixing ratio of combustible fraction). If the highest concentration reading is above a control limit, typically 500 to 2000 parts per million, then the component is tagged for repair. The EPA Method 21-determined concentrations are sometimes used to approximate mass flow rates through correlation equations to estimate annual emission leak rates for the facility&#x2014;a procedure with several sources of uncertainty. It is well known that manual leak detection methods to monitor and repair sources of fugitive emissions are resource intensive and difficult to apply on hard-to-reach sources. Additionally, EPA Method 21 is expensive to execute and can produce safety concerns for inspectors. This manual inspection procedure only checks a subset of potential emissions points inside a facility and possesses high temporal latency since some components may not be visited for more than a year, creating the potential for a leak to go undetected for an extended time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many LDAR programs rely heavily on the EPA's Method 21. As described above, Method 21, however, has a number of drawbacks including: (a) heavy reliance on manual inspections with a portable instrument; (b) extreme inefficiencies (e.g., only a small percentage of all components inspected may have active leaks); (c) safety issues related to manual measurements (e.g., technicians may have to climb towers, may be exposed to inhospitable conditions such as high temperatures, and/or may need to access difficult to reach components); (d) high labor costs; and (e) long time periods between LDAR cycles (e.g., during which large leaks and emissions may remain undetected). For example, due to the infrequent monitoring schedule, some large leaks may not be detected in a timely manner and, therefore, the total emissions estimations may not be accurate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the following description of various illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, various embodiments in which aspects of the disclosure may be practiced.

Various examples herein describe a network of sensors for gas detection and an emissions monitoring platform, in communication with the network of sensors. In one example, the emissions monitoring platform may comprise a processor, a memory, and/or a communication interface. The processor may process and analyze the data stored in the memory. In some embodiments, the memory may store computer-executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause an emissions monitoring platform to perform one or more of the steps disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the emissions monitoring platform may generate emission reports based on values received (e.g., from the one or more sensors) through the communications interface. The emission reports may provide an estimation of fugitive emissions during a particular time interval. Additionally, or alternatively, the emissions reports may provide a comparison between total emissions estimated in multiple different time intervals and/or multiple different facilities.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The emissions monitoring platform may output to a graphical user interface (GUI) on a screen display. The emissions monitoring platform may analyze, filter, and transform collected sensor data into a visual output that is capable of being rendered on a GUI on a screen display. In some embodiments the emissions monitoring platform may include a desktop computer, a smartphone, a wireless device, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, and/or the like. The emissions monitoring platform may be physically located locally or remotely and may be connected by one or more communications links to other devices/systems associated with a facility.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Other embodiments are also disclosed herein involving derivations and combinations of the various method steps and system components disclosed herein. While the disclosure may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there is shown in the drawings, and herein will be described in detail, specific embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the disclosure to that as illustrated and described herein. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, features disclosed herein may be combined to form additional combinations that were not otherwise shown for purposes of brevity. It will be further appreciated that in some embodiments, one or more elements illustrated by way of example in a drawing(s) may be eliminated and/or substituted with alternative elements within the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Remote detecting of gas plumes created by component leaks provides an innovative way of monitoring fugitive emissions of VOC compounds&#x2014;it is faster and more effective in detecting large leaks and controlling total emissions from the plants. Thus, efforts have been put forth to develop sensor network-based emissions monitoring systems that are configured to detect plumes of VOCs, or other gases of interest, within the boundaries of a facility. The monitoring system generally includes sensor nodes placed throughout the facility, meteorological stations, and a data analytics and visualization platform. The sensors are installed in fixed locations throughout the process unit and wirelessly communicate with a central data platform in the cloud, which estimates leak locations by analyzing data with site-specific algorithms. With proper sensor placement, a system can quick detect VOC leaks as low as a few grams per hour as far as 60 ft away from the leak.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a sample two-dimensional layout of a representative facility <b>100</b> with a wireless (or wired) sensor network. The facility <b>100</b> may comprise multiple LDAR components, such as process units, buildings, etc. (e.g., units 1-6, tank farm, terminal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Gas sensors <b>102</b> in the sensor network may be placed in the facility in an optimized way that provides full (or at least substantially full) three-dimensional (3D) detection coverage of LDAR components within a facility, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. With sensors <b>102</b> depicted as stars in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a higher sensor density may provide better leak detection results or even allow the construction of a dynamic plume profile in a 3D space.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A sensor network may provide a simpler and more reliable solution for conducting LDAR and for monitoring total emissions levels. A network of sensors may be used to detect small plumes created by gas leaks and wind sensors may be used to help triangulate sensor detections to the source of leaks. Multiple sensor nodes may be designed and evenly distributed to provide full coverage of an industrial facility. The sensor system may operate continuously and may be able to detect large leaks from individual components in a timely manner (e.g., within hours/days, as opposed to several months to one year between scheduled inspections based on Method 21). Furthermore, the sensor systems, even if unable to detect individual small leaks from an individual component, may be able to detect a collection of small leaks from a plurality of closely positioned components. The collection of small leaks may be identified by the sensor system as a large leak within an area (e.g., where multiple components may be closely positioned). A component-based approach for estimating/monitoring fugitive emissions, where each component in an industrial facility is independently and manually measured, would no longer be necessary.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A detection zone of a sensor may be depicted by a dot indicating the location of the sensor and a circle to represent the zone within which the sensor may be able to detect a gaseous plume. For simplicity, in some examples, the detection zone of each sensor may be depicted by a circle (or sphere in 3-dimensional representations). However, in other examples, the detection zone may be altered to accommodate the one or more structures, obstructions, and/or openings in the facility. For example, in a 3-dimensional digital representation, the height of an obstructing structure may have direct bearing on sensor placement, specifically whether the height of a structure is such that a sensor placed at a location may be futile to detect a gaseous plume originating from the opposite side of the obstructing structure. Moreover, the detection zone of a sensor may be affected by the type of sensor being used, the sensitivity of the sensor to a particular gas compound, etc.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A wide variety of sensor technologies may be used for gas detection in various examples described herein. Gas sensors may comprise electrochemical sensors, infrared sensors, catalytic bead sensors, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors, photoionization detectors (PIDs), flame ionization detectors (FIDs), thermal conductivity sensors, colorimetric sensors, sensors based on passive sampling techniques, and/or any other sensors configured to measure concentrations of VOCs and/or other hazardous gases.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Detecting gases in open air requires high sensitivity (typically at concentrations in parts per billion (ppb) level) and fast response times (e.g., due to possible wind and changes in wind speed and direction). Several sensor technologies such as MOS and PID meet the requirements and may be used in fence-line and outdoor air quality monitoring applications.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A PID is equipped with a high energy ultraviolet (UV) lamp and electrodes. Gas molecules with low ionization energy entering a UV chamber in a PID are ionized. Resultant ions flow toward a collecting electrode giving rise to an electric current that is directly proportional to the concentration of the gas. Depending on the target gas to be measured, a PID may use a 9.6 eV, 10.0 eV, 10.2 eV, 10.6 eV, or 11.7 eV lamp. The higher the lamp energy, the more gas species can be measured. A lower energy lamp may be preferred for measurement of aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene) because of better specificity.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Gas sensors have varying sensitivities to different gas species and sometimes need to be calibrated properly before use. A surrogate gas of known concentration may be used to calibrate the sensor. For measuring other gases, a cross-sensitivity factor called response factor may be used to correct a sensor output to provide a measurement. For example, isobutylene is typically used for calibrating PIDs due to its moderate sensitivity and low toxicity. When measuring isobutylene concentration, the calibrated PIDs may directly provide a measurement of the concentration. For other gases, a response factor may be used (e.g., by the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b>) for determining the concentration based on measurements provided by the isobutylene-calibrated PIDs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows examples of ionization potentials and response factors for some common gas species. The values in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are one example of data based on PID manufacturer Honeywell's publicly available data; other manufacturers may provide their own data for PIDs, FIDs, MOSs, or other sensors. The example response factors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may correspond to a PID calibrated with isobutylene and using a 10.6 eV UV lamp. The emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may determine a true gas concentration by scaling a sensor output by the response factor (F) of that gas.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Gas Concentration=Sensor output&#xd7;Response factor (<i>F</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">For example, if the sensor is calibrated with isobutylene and used to measure isobutylene (which has a response factor of 1) then the concentration of isobutylene is considered the same as the sensor reading. If the sensor is used to measure n-octane (which has a response factor value of 1.8) and the sensor output corresponds to a concentration of 10 ppm, then the actual concentration of n-octane is 10 ppm&#xd7;1.8=18 ppm. If the sensor is used to measure benzene (which has a response factor value of 0.53) and the sensor output corresponds to a concentration of 1 ppm, then the actual concentration of benzene is 1 ppm&#xd7;0.53=0.53 ppm. Based on equation 1, a low response factor for a gas implies that the sensor is more sensitive to the gas. Conversely, a high response factor for a gas implies that the sensor is less sensitive to the gas. For example, a sensor with response factors given by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is more sensitive to isopropanol than butane.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Many sensor manufacturers provide response factors of different compounds in an instrument built-in software library. When the appropriate response factor is called up (e.g., via a user input), the sensor may determine a true concentration of the compound based on sensor output. Additionally, or alternatively, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may retrieve (e.g., from the data store <b>290</b>) a response factor to be used for a sensor (e.g., based on sensor location and/or gases that may be present within the detection zone of the sensor) and determine a true concentration based on received sensor output.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">For PID sensors, a gas must have an ionization potential below an output energy of the UV lamp in order to be detected. For example, a sensor corresponding to the response factors of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be unable to detect formaldehyde because the ionization potential of formaldehyde is below the output energy of the UV lamp (10.6 eV).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In an industrial facility, gases may often be present in the form of mixtures. For a gas mixture whose composition is known, an overall response factor F Overall of a sensor for the mixture can be calculated based on response factors of the sensor for each of the component in the mixture. For example, if a gas mixture to be measured by a sensor has n gases, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may determine F</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Overall as:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>F</mi>      <mi>Overall</mi>     </msub>     <mo>=</mo>     <mfrac>      <mn>1</mn>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>X</mi>         <mn>1</mn>        </msub>        <mo>/</mo>        <msub>         <mi>F</mi>         <mn>1</mn>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>X</mi>         <mn>2</mn>        </msub>        <mo>/</mo>        <msub>         <mi>F</mi>         <mn>2</mn>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>X</mi>         <mn>3</mn>        </msub>        <mo>/</mo>        <msub>         <mi>F</mi>         <mn>3</mn>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mo>&#x2026;</mo>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>X</mi>         <mi>n</mi>        </msub>        <mo>/</mo>        <msub>         <mi>F</mi>         <mi>n</mi>        </msub>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Equation</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mn>2</mn>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">where X<sub>1</sub>-X<sub>n </sub>are the mole ratios of each species in the gas mixture, and F<sub>1</sub>-F<sub>n </sub>are the response factor of the sensor for each species in the gas mixture.

Sensors in an area subject to maintenance related emissions may show substantially higher sensor outputs, which may skew the total emission indicator values in the facility and may result in inaccurate emissions calculations and improper comparisons for regulatory compliance purposes. To avoid this, measurements obtained during a maintenance activity may be excluded from calculations of the total emission indicator value. For example, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may exclude sensor outputs, from all sensors in the facility, that are determined to be impacted during the maintenance activity. Alternatively, the emissions monitoring platform may exclude sensor outputs, corresponding to sensors which have detection zones that overlap with areas that may be subject to maintenance related emissions during the maintenance activity. Excluding sensors outputs may comprise ignoring any detection events (e.g., peaks) that may be recorded in sensor outputs during the maintenance related activity.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates example sensor outputs <b>800</b> as observed over a time interval. The time interval may include time corresponding to a maintenance activity. The sensor outputs correspond to three sensors that may be in an area that is subject to maintenance activities during a maintenance time <b>804</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the sensors may record a high sensor output during the maintenance time <b>804</b> and may skew total emission values that may be calculated for a time interval that may include the maintenance time <b>804</b>. To avoid this, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may, for calculating the total emission indicator values, exclude any sensor outputs (e.g., detection events) from the three sensors during the maintenance time. Alternatively, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may exclude any detection events that may be recorded by any sensor in the facility during the maintenance time.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0085">A software platform in the emissions monitoring system <b>255</b> may be used to document the maintenance activities. Each maintenance activity may be associated with a specific time window, specific unit(s)/component(s) within the facility, and/or sensor(s) that may be impacted. A user may input (e.g., via the user computing device <b>285</b>) maintenance activity information to the system before/after each maintenance activity with starting time, ending time, specific location or area and nature of activity. Once the maintenance activity information is added, any plume detections (peaks) recorded by the sensors during that time window may be excluded from total emissions calculation. The exclusion time may be prorated by the software platform in order to make valid comparisons for the same period of time. In one example, a unit was running only 9 months (January 1-September 30) this past year due to a major construction work, but it was fully operating the year before. In order to compare emissions levels of these two years, the emissions monitoring platform may calculate the average monthly emission indicator value of this past year over the 9 operating months and multiply the monthly average by a factor of 12 to obtain an estimation for the whole year, and then use this number to compare with that of the prior year. Alternatively, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may only use the 9-month emission indicator data calculated from this year to compare with the 9-month data for the same time period January 1 to September 30 of the prior year.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0086">In another example, emissions calculations and/or comparison may be performed with all the detections including detections during a maintenance period (e.g., for research and/or documentation purposes. For example, a plant may want to monitor total emissions associated with a particular maintenance task. A research organization may compare total emissions in two or more geographic regions for air quality or climate change studies, etc.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example maintenance dashboard <b>900</b>, based on user input, which may be used to document maintenance activities in a facility. The maintenance dashboard <b>900</b> may record maintenance activities that are scheduled for the future, are being currently being performed, and/or have already been completed. Each maintenance activity may be associated with unit(s) <b>902</b> in the facility that are subject to the maintenance activity, a maintenance start date/time <b>904</b>, a maintenance end date/time <b>906</b>, a work description <b>908</b> associated with the maintenance activity, and sensors <b>910</b> that are affected by the maintenance activity.

The post-processing is a data operation performed in a server computer in the cloud or network initiated from the software platform, manually or automatically. Various embodiments disclosed herein may be used as an add-on feature on a fugitive emission monitoring software platform, while the system itself may collect, stream, and process sensor data from the field (e.g., of an industrial facility) and provide real-time/near real-time feedback including, but not limited to severity of leakage and potential leak source locations. In some embodiments, the system may further manage sensor health data and detection notifications and investigations conducted under each notification. The post-processing of sensor data in this application may be performed independently from the real-time features, and it may analyze archived data or data collected in the past time period. It doesn't interfere with the operation or affect the real-time performance of the sensor network system in the detection of gas leaks in the field.

For example, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may ignore (e.g., not include) any detection events recorded by any sensor in the facility for calculation of emission indicator values and/or total detected emissions (e.g., as described with reference to Equations (5) and (6)). Alternatively, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may ignore (e.g., not include) any detection events recorded by a sensor associated with a maintenance activity for calculation of emission indicator values and/or total detected emissions. For example, with reference to maintenance activity <b>912</b>, the affected sensors are S-17, S-20, and S-30. The emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may ignore any detection events recorded by the sensors S-17, S-20, and S-30 during the maintenance time corresponding to the maintenance activity <b>912</b>. In another example, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may ignore any detection events recorded by any sensor in the facility during the maintenance time corresponding to the maintenance activity <b>912</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0090">While the above examples illustrate the use of a maintenance dashboard to record maintenance activities and determine emission indicator values and/or total detected emissions, maintenance activities may be determined based on locations associated with employees in the facility. For example, each employee may be equipped with a location tracking device (e.g., a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) tracker, a smartphone with built-in tracking capabilities, or any other tracking device) that may be used to determine an employee location. The emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may assume/determine that a unit in the facility is subject to maintenance activities, for example, if an employee is located in a proximity of the unit. The emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may further determine one or more sensors with detection zones that may comprise the unit. Any detection events recorded by the one or more sensors may be ignored (e.g., for the duration of time that the employee is located in the proximity of the unit) by the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> for determination of emission indicator values and/or total emission indicator values. For example, the emissions monitoring platform <b>260</b> may exclude any detection events that may be detected by a sensor, for example, if an employee is detected in a proximity of sensor or in a proximity of unit within a detection zone of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example method <b>1000</b> of monitoring fugitive gas emissions.
