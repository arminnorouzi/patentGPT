An inspection system utilizing an optical microscope typically has resolution down to a few hundred nanometers; and the resolution is limited by the wavelength of light. As the physical sizes of IC components continue to reduce down to sub-100 or even sub-10 nanometers, inspection systems capable of higher resolution than those utilizing optical microscopes are needed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Optical inspection of a mask is based on a comparison of the light signals in patterned regions of the mask to the light signals in non-patterned regions of the mask. A high contrast in the comparison may be needed to obtain sufficient sensitivity for defect detection in the mask. The transmissive masks used in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography may be inspected with little difficulty since there is high contrast at UV/DUV wavelengths between the opaque regions and the transparent regions on the mask. But there is more difficulty in inspecting reflective masks (e.g., extreme ultraviolet masks) used in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography since there is a lower contrast at UV/DUV wavelengths between the absorber regions and the mirror regions on the mask and because the wavelengths of the UV/DUV are too long to inspect reflective masks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A charged particle (e.g., electron) beam microscope, such as a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or a transmission electron microscope (TEM), capable of resolution down to less than a nanometer, serves as a practicable tool for inspecting reflective masks. With a SEM, electrons of a single primary electron beam, or electrons of a plurality of primary electron beams, can be focused at locations of interest of a mask under inspection. The primary electrons interact with the mask and may be backscattered or may cause the mask to emit secondary electrons. The intensity of the electron beams comprising the backscattered electrons and the secondary electrons may vary based on the properties of the internal and external structures of the mask, and thereby may indicate whether the mask has defects.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments consistent with the present disclosure include systems for grounding a mask in a charged particle system.

The following description refers to the accompanying drawings in which the same numbers in different drawings represent the same or similar elements unless otherwise represented. The implementations set forth in the following description of exemplary embodiments do not represent all implementations consistent with the invention. Instead, they are merely examples of apparatuses and methods consistent with aspects related to the invention as recited in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Electronic devices are constructed of circuits formed on a piece of silicon called a substrate. Many circuits may be formed together on the same piece of silicon and are called integrated circuits or ICs. The size of these circuits has decreased dramatically so that many more of them can fit on the substrate. For example, an IC chip in a smart phone can be as small as a thumbnail and yet may include over 2 billion transistors, the size of each transistor being less than 1/1000th the size of a human hair.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Making these extremely small ICs is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process, often involving hundreds of individual steps. Errors in even one step have the potential to result in defects in the finished IC rendering it useless. Thus, one goal of the manufacturing process is to avoid such defects to maximize the number of functional ICs made in the process, that is, to improve the overall yield of the process.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Defects may be generated during various stages of semiconductor processing. For the reason stated above, it is important to find defects accurately and efficiently as early as possible. A charged particle (e.g., electron) beam microscope, such as a scanning electron microscope (SEM), is a useful tool for inspecting a mask (e.g., EUV mask, DUV mask, etc.) surfaces to detect defects. During operation, the charged particle beam microscope scans a primary charged-particle beam, such as an electron beam (e-beam), over a mask on a holder, and generates an image of the mask surface by detecting a secondary charged-particle beam reflected from the mask surface. Inspection of the mask may be employed by comparing light signals in patterned regions of the mask to light signals in non-patterned regions of the mask. A high contrast between the light signals of the different mask regions may result in sufficient sensitivity for defect detection.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the charged-particle beam scans the mask, charges may be accumulated on the mask due to large beam current, which may affect the quality of the image. For example, if charges accumulate on the surface of a mask during inspection, then the contrast and intensity of the scanned images at different areas of the mask may be inconsistent. To regulate the accumulated charges on the mask, the mask may be grounded so as to control the accumulated charges. It is thus important to improve the grounding mechanism so as to effectively control the accumulated charges.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Some masks, however, suffer from design constraints. For example, a mask may not be easily grounded because the substrate and an upper layer of the mask are dielectric. The upper dielectric layer of the mask may have openings where a conductive layer of the mask is exposed. Because the conductive layer of the mask may be beneath an upper dielectric layer, a planar grounding component may not contact the conductive layer of the mask. This reduced contact between the planar grounding component and the conductive layer of the mask results in charge accumulation on the mask, which results in reduced inspection quality of the mask. Because of the upper dielectric layer above the conductive layer of the mask, a grounding component may have a conductive prong that may contact the conductive layer exposed by the upper dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The disclosed embodiments provide an e-beam system that includes a grounding component that addresses some or all of these disadvantages. The disclosed embodiments provide an e-beam system having a grounding component that may sufficiently contact a mask so that charge accumulation on the mask may be reduced, thereby allowing for a better image of the mask.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a charged particle beam apparatus in which an electron beam system may comprise a single primary beam that may be configured to generate a secondary beam.
