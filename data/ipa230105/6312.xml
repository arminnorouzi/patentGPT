When the first electrode plate is a negative electrode plate, the first electrode plate may include, for example, but is not limited to, a negative electrode coating portion in which a negative electrode active material is coated on a negative electrode current collector plate made of a thin conductive metal plate, for example, copper or nickel foil or mesh, and a negative electrode non-coating portion in which a negative electrode active material is not coated. Here, the negative active material may be made of, for example, but is not limited to, a carbon-based material, Si, Sn, tin oxide, a tin alloy composite, a transition metal oxide, lithium metal nitrite, or a metal oxide.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second electrode plate may be the other one of the negative electrode plate and the positive electrode plate. As described above, when the first electrode plate is a negative electrode plate, the second electrode plate may be a positive electrode plate. In this case, the second electrode plate may include a positive electrode coating portion in which a positive electrode active material is coated on a positive electrode current collector plate made of a thin metal plate having excellent conductivity, for example, aluminum foil or mesh, and a positive electrode non-coating portion in which a positive electrode active material is not coated. Here, the positive electrode active material may be, for example, but is not limited to, a chalcogenide compound, for example, a composite metal oxide, such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, LiNiMnO<sub>2</sub>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The separator is interposed between the first electrode plate and the second electrode plate to prevent or substantially prevent a short circuit between the first electrode plate and the second electrode plate. The separator may be made of, for example, but is not limited to, polyethylene, polypropylene, a porous copolymer of polyethylene and polypropylene, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The electrode assembly <b>110</b> may be stacked, for example, in such a manner that the lower end of the first electrode plate protrudes lower than the lower end of the second electrode plate, and the upper end of the second electrode plate protrudes higher than the upper end of the first electrode plate, and thus may be wound in the form of a jelly roll.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the case <b>120</b> is shaped of a cylinder having a surface open to accommodate the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and another surface (e.g., an opposite surface) closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that the lower surface is open and the upper surface is closed, but the upper surface may be open and the lower surface may be closed, as desired. However, for purposes of understanding, as shown in the drawing, the following description will be made with respect to a case in which the upper surface is closed and the lower surface is open. In an embodiment, the case <b>120</b> may have a protrusion <b>121</b> and a bent portion <b>122</b> formed at a lower portion thereof. When the first current collector plate <b>150</b> is installed, the protrusion <b>121</b> slightly protrudes inward from the upper side of the first current collector plate <b>150</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to support the first current collector plate <b>150</b>. In addition, when the cap plate <b>130</b> is installed, the bent portion <b>122</b> is bent inward from the lower side of the cap plate <b>130</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, such as by using a crimping process, to cover the edge of the cap plate <b>130</b>, thereby preventing or substantially preventing the cap plate <b>130</b> from being separated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cap plate <b>130</b> is shaped to correspond to the lower surface of the case <b>120</b>, for example, in a disk shape, and serves to seal the lower surface of the case <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, the cap plate <b>130</b> has a notch <b>131</b> formed in a certain shape (e.g., a predetermined shape) at a certain position (e.g., a predetermined position). The notch <b>131</b> serves as a safety vent. Therefore, when gas is generated inside the secondary battery <b>100</b> due to an abnormal operation, and the inside pressure exceeds a specific pressure, the cap plate <b>130</b> is automatically cut along the notch <b>131</b> by the force to quickly release the gas and pressure, thereby preventing or substantially preventing the secondary battery <b>100</b> from exploding. In an embodiment, a receiving portion <b>132</b>, which is locally spaced apart from the first current collector plate <b>150</b> to provide a space (e.g., a predetermined space) therebetween, is formed at the edge of the cap plate <b>130</b>. This space allows for placing a conductive paste P, which will later be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that the cap plate <b>130</b> has a substantially plate shape and the receiving portion <b>132</b> is formed by bending the edge of the cap plate <b>130</b> away from the first current collector plate <b>150</b> as a whole, or away from an edge of the first current collector plate <b>150</b>. In this case, the conductive paste P is positioned in a space defined by an inner peripheral, or circumferential, surface of the case <b>120</b>, the edge of the cap plate <b>130</b>, and the edge of the first current collector plate <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the first gasket <b>140</b> may be installed between the bent portion <b>122</b> of the case <b>120</b> and the edge of the cap plate <b>130</b>, which increases sealing strength.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first current collector plate <b>150</b> is disposed between the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> inside the case <b>120</b>, and electrically connects the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> to each other. As described above, when the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> is a negative electrode plate, the first current collector plate <b>150</b>, the case <b>120</b> in contact with the first current collector plate <b>150</b>, and the cap plate <b>130</b> have a negative polarity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The case <b>120</b> and the first current collector plate <b>150</b> may be bonded to each other by the conductive paste P. To this end, first, in a state in which the electrode assembly <b>110</b> is installed in the case <b>120</b>, the first current collector plate <b>150</b> is disposed under the case <b>120</b> so as to allow the first current collector plate <b>150</b> to be in contact with the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b>, and the conductive paste P is applied to a region corresponding to a boundary between the inner peripheral surface of the case <b>120</b> and the edge of the first current collector plate <b>150</b>. Next, the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> is closed with the cap plate <b>130</b> so as to allow the cap plate <b>130</b> to be in contact with the first collector plate <b>150</b>, and, in an embodiment, the conductive paste P is cured through local thermal compression. Thereafter, the first gasket <b>140</b> is disposed at the edge of the cap plate <b>130</b>, and the lower end of the case <b>120</b> is bent inward to fix the cap plate <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">By using the conductive paste P in this way, in addition to fixing the cap plate <b>130</b> by using the bent portion <b>122</b>, the first current collector plate <b>150</b> is fixed by using the conductive paste P, thereby further improving the sealing strength.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The conductive paste P itself may be a material known in the art. In addition, with reference to the present disclosure, a person skilled in the art could electrically connect the case <b>120</b> with the first current collector plate <b>150</b> while physically fixing the case <b>120</b> and the first current collector plate <b>150</b> and would be able to appropriately select and use materials that do not have inappropriate physical properties to be applied to a secondary battery, and, thus a detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although it has been described above that the case <b>120</b> and the first current collector plate <b>150</b> are bonded to each other by the conductive paste P, the cap plate <b>130</b> may also be bonded together by the conductive paste P, as desired. For example, the conductive paste P may be applied to a region corresponding to the boundary between the inner peripheral surface of the case <b>120</b> and the edge of the first current collector plate <b>150</b> by a relatively smaller volume than the receiving portion <b>132</b> of the cap plate <b>130</b>, thereby bonding the case <b>120</b> and the first current collector plate <b>150</b> to each other by the conductive paste P. Alternatively, by applying the conductive paste P by a volume that is substantially the same as or slightly larger than the receiving portion <b>132</b> of the cap plate <b>130</b>, the cap plate <b>130</b> may also be bonded by the conductive paste P.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first current collector plate <b>150</b> may be formed in a disk shape as a whole and may be configured such that a first region <b>151</b> is cut to be bent with respect to a second region <b>152</b>. In an embodiment, the first current collector plate <b>150</b>, which includes the first region <b>151</b> mainly in contact with the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the second region <b>152</b> mainly in contact with the cap plate <b>130</b>, may be constructed so as to be elastically deformably bent to allow the first region <b>151</b> to have a height difference (e.g., a vertical offset) with respect to the second region <b>152</b>. Accordingly, even if tolerances occur in the electrode assembly <b>110</b>, the case <b>120</b>, the cap plate <b>130</b>, the first current collector plate <b>150</b>, etc. during manufacturing, assembling may be carried out, such that the first region <b>151</b> comes into close contact with the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the second region <b>152</b> comes into close contact with the cap plate <b>130</b>, through the flexible first current collector plate <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, the cap plate <b>130</b> may or may not have an electrolyte injection hole formed therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that the electrolyte injection hole is not formed. If the electrolyte injection hole is formed, as described above, the process may be carried out such that, after the first collector plate <b>150</b> is disposed to apply the conductive paste P, the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> is closed with the cap plate <b>130</b> to cure the conductive paste P, and the cap plate <b>130</b> is then fixed by using a crimping process, for example, the electrolyte may be injected through an electrolyte injection hole, followed by sealing. If the electrolyte injection hole is not formed, the process may be carried out such that the electrolyte solution may be injected through the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> before closing the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> with the cap plate <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The terminal <b>160</b> is installed on the upper surface of the case <b>120</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that, in an embodiment, the terminal <b>160</b> is installed in a rivet manner.
