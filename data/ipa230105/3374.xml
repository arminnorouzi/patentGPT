Circuit components, such as a power switch, a transformer and a drive board, are mainly mounted in the base, thus requiring strict waterproof performance to the base. In order to achieve waterproof performance, base in the existing stage light fixtures is mostly in form of a cylinder with two openings at each end forming by stretching of aluminum material. The two openings are respectively sealed by two plates to achieve sealing of the base. However, such method for forming the base is high in cost, and inconvenient in disassembling and assembling, and may cause poor universality of the cylinder and two plates when designing base in different types, components thus cannot be shared according to actual requirements.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention thus provides a waterproof spliced base and a stage light fixture with the base, which is free from the above-mentioned defects. The base according to the present invention is made of plates which is easy to be processed and ensures sealability of the base.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the present invention, the waterproof spliced base includes a top plate and a bottom plate arranged opposite to each other, and a plurality of side plates arranged around the periphery of the bottom plate and the top plate. The top plate, the bottom plate and the side plates are spliced together to form an accommodating cavity for accommodating electronic components. At least one sealing rubber strip for sealing the accommodating cavity is arranged between the side plate and the bottom plate as well as between the side plates and the top plate. The top plate is provided with a pivoting hole for mounting a pivoting shaft of the stage light.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The base according to the present invention is spliced by the top plate, the bottom plate and the side plates, which has advantages of convenience to disassemble and assemble and low manufacturing cost. Due to the splicing configuration, for bases in different types, only components of the base with size changed are required to be replaced, while other components of the base are in the existing designed specifications. For example, when bases with different height are in need, it is only required to change the height of the side plate, while changes for the top plate and the bottom plate are not necessary. When only changes for the length or width of the base are in need, the side plates in the width or length direction can remain for reuse. Therefore, versatility of the components of the base in such configuration is much higher, and the base can be easily sealed with sealing rubber strips to ensure waterproof performance of the base.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to at least one embodiment, at least one side plate is provided with a signal interface for signal input and at least one side plate is provided with a display screen for information display.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to at least one embodiment, the top plate, the bottom plate, and the side plates are all in form of profile plates. That is, the plates are formed by extrusion-drawing, die-casting or injection molding, which have high strength, can locally increase the thickness or make modeling, and can be conveniently spliced with other components or used for engaged with other components.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to at least one embodiment, the side plates are fastened with the top plate <b>110</b> and the bottom plate <b>120</b> by screws. The screws are located outside the sealing rubber strip to avoid destroying sealability of the accommodating cavity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to at least one embodiment, the side of each sealing rubber strip in contact with the top plate and the bottom plate, and/or the side of each sealing rubber strip in contact with the side plate is provided with at least one protruding waterproof rib. The configuration of the waterproof rib can enhance the sealing performance and prevent liquid from entering the accommodating cavity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to at least one embodiment, at least one support column is arranged between the top plate and the bottom plate, and two ends of each support column are respectively connected with the top plate and the bottom plate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to at least one embodiment, the top plate and the bottom plate are both quadrilateral. Four side plates are provided, including a front plate, a rear plate, a left plate and a right plate which are independent from each other, and are respectively arranged corresponding to four sides of the top plate and the bottom plate. The four side plates and the top and bottom plates together form a hexahedral housing conforming to the universal shape of the base.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to at least one embodiment, the positions where the left plate and the right plate attached to the top plate and the bottom plate are each provided with a thickened portion, the thickness of the thickened portion can be greater than or equal to 4 mm. With such configuration, it is convenient to mount the sealing rubber strip, and the left plate and the right plate can be attached to the top plate and the bottom plate more tightly and stably, without any random waggling.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to at least one embodiment, the sealing rubber strip includes at least one waterproof strip and at least one waterproof ring.

The end portion of the waterproof strip is abutted against the waterproof ring.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sealing rubber strip according to the present invention is also divided into a plurality of portions corresponding to the plurality of side plates constituting the base. When making bases in different types, the plate not changed in size and the corresponding sealing rubber strip can remain in use, which increases versatility of the sealing rubber strip. As the positions where the left plate and the right plate are attached to the top plate and the bottom plate are in a long strip shape, the sealing rubber strip in such positions is waterproof strip which is in strip shape correspondingly. While the positions where the front plate and the rear plate are attached to the top plate and the bottom plate are in an irregular-shaped ring shape, the sealing rubber strip in such positions is waterproof ring which is in nearly ring shape correspondingly. The sealing rubber strip according to the present invention thus achieves a more reasonable design.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to at least one embodiment, the top plate and the bottom plate are each provided with an accommodating groove corresponding to the waterproof strip, and/or the left plate and the right plate are provided with an accommodating groove corresponding to the waterproof strip. With such configuration, the waterproof strips <b>210</b> can be limited easily, which can avoid waggling randomly and changes in position to affect sealability of the base.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to at least one embodiment, the front plate and the rear plate are each provided with an accommodating groove corresponding to the waterproof ring, which is served to receive the corresponding waterproof ring <b>220</b>.

The top plate <b>110</b> is provided with a pivoting hole <b>111</b> for mounting a pivoting shaft of the stage light fixture.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The base <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is spliced by the top plate <b>110</b>, the bottom plate <b>120</b> and the plurality of side plates. Such configuration has advantages of convenience to disassemble and assemble and low manufacturing cost. Due to the splicing configuration, for base in different types, only components with size changed are required to be replaced, other components are in the existing designed specifications. For example, when bases with different height are in need, it is only required to change the height of the side plates, while changes for the top plate <b>110</b> and the bottom plate <b>120</b> are not necessary.
