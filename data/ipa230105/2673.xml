as related systems, and methods of detection using the same, are described herein. As described further below, the scintillator material composition may comprise a Tl-based scintillator material. For example, the composition may comprise a thallium-based halide and/or a thallium-based elpasolite. Such materials have been shown to have particularly attractive scintillation properties and may be used in a variety of applications for detection radiation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the thallium-based halide composition further comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Li, Na, Cs, Li, Rb, and K. In some embodiments, the thallium-based composition further comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Sr, Ba, Ca, and Mg. In some embodiments, the thallium-based composition further comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, I and F. In some embodiments, the thallium-based composition further comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Hf, Zr and Ti. In some embodiments, the thallium-based composition further comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of La, Ce, Pr, Lu, Y, Sc, Gd, Yb, Bi, In, B and Al. In some embodiments, the thallium-based halide composition further comprises one or more elements selected from the group consisting of La, Lu, Gd, Y, Ce and Bi.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some cases, the thallium-based halide composition may include one or more halide element(s) such as F, Cl, Br, and I. For example, in some embodiments, it may be preferable for the halide element(s) to be Br and/or Cl.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The scintillator composition may have the general formula: (Tl, Cs, In, K, Na)<sub>2</sub>(Li, Na, Cs, Tl)(La, Lu, Gd, Y, Ce, Bi)(F, Cl, Br, I)<sub>6</sub>. In some cases, the thallium-based halide composition has the general formula: Tl<sub>2</sub>(Li, Na, K, Tl)(La, Gd, Lu, Y, Bi)(Br, Cl, I)<sub>6</sub>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some cases, the thallium-based halide composition comprises Tl<sub>2</sub>LiLaBr<sub>6 </sub>(TLLB) and may, for example, be doped with Ce. As described further below, TLLB may have particularly attractive scintillation properties including excellent energy resolution, proportionality and light yield. TLLB may also be suitable for gamma ray and/or neutron detection, as well as differentiation between gamma rays and neutrons using pulse shape discrimination (PSD). Furthermore, TLLB may have increased density and/or effective atomic number as compared to other elpasolite scintillator materials which may advantageously lead to increased stopping power. For example, the density of TLLB may be greater than 5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, e.g., on the order of 6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The effective atomic number of TLLB may be greater than 60, e.g., 64. TLLB scintillator materials may be particularly well suited for PET applications. It should be understood, however, that TLLB materials may be well suited for use in other radiation detection applications.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some cases, the thallium-based halide composition is Tl<sub>2</sub>LiYCl<sub>6 </sub>(TLYC) and may, for example, be doped with Ce. As described further below, TLYC may have particularly attractive scintillation properties including excellent energy resolution, proportionality and light yield. TLYC may also be suitable for gamma ray and/or neutron detection, as well as differentiation between gamma rays and neutrons using pulse shape discrimination (PSD). Furthermore, TLYC may have increased density and/or effective atomic number as compared to other elpasolite scintillator materials which may advantageously lead to increased stopping power. For example, the density of TLYC may be greater than 4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, e.g., on the order of 4.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The effective atomic number of TLYC may be greater than 60, e.g., 71.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some cases, the thallium-based halide composition is Tl<sub>2</sub>(Li, Na)BiBr<sub>6 </sub>(e.g., Tl<sub>2</sub>(Li<sub>0.5</sub>Na<sub>0.5</sub>)BiBr<sub>6</sub>). As described further below, Tl<sub>2</sub>(Li, Na)BiBr<sub>6 </sub>may have attractive scintillation properties.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the thallium-based halide composition has the general formula: (Tl, Cs, In, K, Na)<sub>3</sub>(La, Lu, Gd, Y, Ce, Bi)(F, Cl, Br, I)<sub>6</sub>. For example, the thallium-based halide composition comprises Tl<sub>3</sub>LaBr<sub>6</sub>. As described further below, Tl<sub>3</sub>LaBr<sub>6 </sub>may have attractive scintillation properties.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the thallium-based halide composition has the general formula: (Tl, Cs, In, K, Na)<sub>2</sub>(La, Lu, Gd, Y, Ce, Bi)(F, Cl, Br, I)<sub>5</sub>.

Dopants can affect certain properties, such as physical properties (e.g., brittleness, etc.) as well as scintillation properties (e.g., luminescence, etc.) of the scintillator composition. The dopant can include, for example, Ce (e.g., Ce<sup>3+</sup>), Pr, Eu (e.g., Eu<sup>2+</sup>), Sr, Ca, Ba, Mg, and Cd. In some cases, Ce may be preferred. In some cases, the composition is undoped.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The amount of dopant present will depend on various factors, such as the application for which the scintillator composition is being used; the desired scintillation properties (e.g., emission properties, timing resolution, etc.); and the type of detection device into which the scintillator is being incorporated. For example, the dopant may be employed at a level in the range of about 0.01% to about 20%, by molar weight. In certain embodiments, the amount of dopant is in the range of about 0.01% to less than about 20% (and any integral number therebetween), or less than about 0.1%, 1.0%, 5.0%, or 20% by molar weight.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the thallium-based composition has the general formula: (Tl, Cs, Li, K, Rb, Na)(Sr&#x2014;Ba&#x2014;Ca&#x2014;Mg)<sub>2</sub>(F&#x2014;Br&#x2014;Cl&#x2014;I)<sub>5</sub>.

In these embodiments, the compositions may be undoped or doped, e.g., with Pr or Ce. For example, in some of these embodiments, the thallium-based composition may have the following general formulas: Tl<sub>2</sub>LiYCl<sub>6</sub>; Tl<sub>2</sub>LiYBr<sub>6</sub>; Tl<sub>2</sub>LiYI<sub>6</sub>; Tl<sub>2</sub>LiLaCl<sub>6</sub>; Tl<sub>2</sub>LiLaBr<sub>6</sub>; Tl<sub>2</sub>LiLaI<sub>6</sub>; Tl<sub>2</sub>Li(La&#x2014;Y)(Br&#x2014;Cl-I-F)I<sub>6</sub>; and Tl<sub>2</sub>(Li, Na, Tl)(Y, La, Ce, Lu, Gd, Bi)(F, Cl, Br, I).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the thallium-based composition has the general formula: (Tl&#x2014;Li&#x2014;Cs&#x2014;K&#x2014;Rb&#x2014;Na)<sub>2</sub>(La&#x2014;Ce&#x2014;Pr&#x2014;Lu&#x2014;Y&#x2014;Sc&#x2014;Gd&#x2014;Yb&#x2014;Bi&#x2014;In&#x2014;B&#x2014;Tl&#x2014;B&#x2014;Al)(Cl&#x2014;Br&#x2014;F&#x2014;I)<sub>5</sub>. In these embodiments, the compositions may be undoped or doped, e.g., with Pr or Ce. For example, in some of these embodiments, the thallium-based composition may have the following general formulas: Tl<sub>2</sub>La(Cl, Br, I, F)<sub>5 </sub>and (Tl&#x2014;Li)<sub>2</sub>(La, Ce, Lu, Y, Gd, Bi)(Cl, Br, I, F)<sub>5</sub>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As can be understood from the formulas above, the thallium-based compositions may include one or more additional elements that substitute for thallium. For example, Cs, Li, K, Rb and/or Na may substitute for thallium on the thallium site (e.g., 1 site). In such embodiments, the thallium site includes at least 20 thallium; in some embodiments, at least 30% thallium; in some embodiments, at least 40% thallium; in some embodiments, at least 50% thallium; in some embodiments, at least 60% thallium; in some embodiments, at least 70% thallium; in some embodiments, at least 80% thallium; in some embodiments, at least 90% thallium; and, in some embodiments, only thallium is present on the thallium site.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the lithium content of the composition is enriched to include a Li-6 content above that which is found in naturally occurring lithium sources. It should be understood, however, that not all compositions of the invention are enriched. Enrichment refers to a change through processing of a nuclear species mixture found on Earth or as naturally occurring so that the resultant material has a different mix of nuclear species. In naturally occurring sources of lithium, 93% of the lithium is in the form of Li-7 or <sup>7</sup>Li, having an atomic weight of approximately 7 and includes a nucleus with three protons (defining the chemical species) and four neutrons. Approximately 7% of naturally occurring lithium is Li-6 or <sup>6</sup>Li, which has an atomic weight of approximately six, including three protons and three neutrons. Although the chemical properties are substantially similar, the physical (weight) and nuclear properties are significantly different.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, Li-6 enriched compositions of the present invention will include compositions where the Li-6 content is higher or above that which is found in naturally occurring lithium sources. Compositions can include lithium with a Li-6 content that is at least about 10% or higher, and will typically include lithium with a Li-6 content of about 50% or more, and in some instances about 80%, 90%, 95% or more (as well as any integral number in the specified ranges). For example, Li-6 may be present in an amount greater than or equal to about 10%, about 25%, about 50%, about 75%, about 90%, or about 95%. In certain embodiments, the amount of Li-6 is in the range of about 7.5% to less than about 100% (and any integral number therebetween).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The disclosed compositions may be prepared in any number of different forms. In some embodiments, the composition is an elpasolite. In some embodiments, the composition is in a crystalline form (e.g., monocrystalline). In some embodiments, the composition is formed as a crystalline structure including, for example, monoclinic, cubic, hexagonal, or any other appropriate crystalline structure. However, the composition can include other forms as well, and the selected form may depend, in part, on the intended end use of the scintillator. For example, a composition can be in a powder form. It can also be prepared in the form of a ceramic or polycrystalline ceramic. Other forms of compositions will be recognized and can include, but are not limited to, glasses, deposits, vapor deposited films, and the like. A crystal may have any suitable size and shape. Non-limiting examples of shapes include sheets, cubes, cylinders, hollow tubes, spheres, and the like.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Methods for making the disclosed compositions can include the methods described herein or any other appropriate technique. Typically during the manufacture of many types of scintillator compositions, the appropriate reactants are melted at a temperature sufficient to form a congruent, molten composition. The melting temperature depends on the identity of the reactants themselves (e.g., melting points of reactants), but is usually in the range of about 300&#xb0; C. to about 1350&#xb0; C. Non-limiting examples of possible crystal-growing methods include the Bridgman-Stockbarger method; Czochralski growth method, zone-melting growth method (or &#x201c;floating zone&#x201d; method), the vertical gradient freeze (VGF) method, and the temperature gradient method.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Following formation of the compositions, crystals may be processed using techniques and methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such processes include cutting, polishing, and/or packaging (e.g., under an inert atmosphere). In addition, the compositions may be analyzed using methods and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art to determine the compositional make-up of the compositions, for example, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and/or crystal structure (XRD).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The compositions, methods, and systems described herein may be employed for detecting radiation. In some cases, the radiation is gamma radiation and/or neutron radiation. In some cases, the compositions (e.g., TLLB, TLYC), methods, and systems may be employed to differentiate neutrons from gamma rays. The timing profile of a gamma-ray scintillation event differs compared to a neutron scintillation event. For incident gamma-rays, scintillation is very fast, including a fast light decay. The neutron scintillation event exhibits a relatively slower timing profile. The difference in the timing profile between gamma-ray scintillation events and neutron scintillation events can facilitate differentiation between gamma-ray detection and neutron detection. In particular, such differences enable gamma-ray detection and neutron detection to be differentiated using pulse shape discrimination (PSD) analysis.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">PSD analysis, in general, involves comparing the luminescence signal pulse shape resulting from gamma-ray detection to the luminescence signal pulse shape resulting from neutron detection. In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to use PSD analysis over relatively long time periods to differentiate gamma-ray detection and neutron detection.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The compositions described herein can be used in systems for detecting radiation. The system may comprises a detector include a scintillator material comprising a composition as described herein coupled (e.g., optically coupled) to a light detector assembly (e.g., a light photodetector, an imaging device). In use, the detector detects energetic radiation (e.g., light pulse luminescence) emitted from a source (e.g., the scintillator material).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Non-limiting examples of light detector assemblies include photomultiplier tubes (PMT), photodiodes, CCD sensors, image intensifiers, and the like. Choice of a particular photodetector will depend in part on the type of radiation detector being fabricated and on the intended use of the device. In certain embodiments, the photodetector may be position-sensitive.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A data analysis system may be coupled to the detector. The data analysis system may include, for example, a module or system to process information (e.g., radiation detection information) from the detector/light detector assembly. The data analysis system may also include, for example, a wide variety of proprietary or commercially available computers, electronics, systems having one or more processing structures, or the like. The systems may have data processing hardware and/or software configured to implement any one (or combination of) the method steps described herein. The methods may further be embodied as programming instructions in a tangible non-transitory media such as a memory, a digital or optical recording media, or other appropriate device.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The systems themselves, which can include the detector and the light detector assembly, can be connected to a variety of tools and devices, as mentioned previously. Non-limiting examples include monitoring and detection devices (e.g., for nuclear weapons), physics research devices, well-logging tools, and imaging devices such as X-ray CT, X-ray fluoroscopy, X-ray cameras (such as for security uses), PET, and other nuclear medical imaging or detection devices. Various technologies for operably coupling or integrating a radiation detector assembly containing a scintillator to a detection device can be utilized with the presently disclosed materials, including various known techniques.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The systems may also be connected to a visualization interface, imaging equipment, or digital imaging equipment (e.g., pixilated flat panel devices). In some embodiments, the scintillator may serve as a component of a screen scintillator. For example, powdered scintillator material could be formed into a relatively flat plate, which is attached to a film, such as photographic film. Energetic radiation, e.g., gamma-rays and neutron, originating from a source, would interact with the scintillator and be converted into light photons, which are visualized in the developed film. The film can be replaced by amorphous silicon position-sensitive photodetectors or other position-sensitive detectors, such as avalanche diodes and the like.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, methods of radiation detection are provided. In some embodiments, a method of radiation detection comprises providing a detection system (e.g., as described here), positioning the detection system such that a radiation source is within a field of view of the system so as to detect emissions from the source; and measuring a scintillation event luminescence signal from the scintillator material with the detection assembly. In some embodiments, the detection system comprises a detector comprising a scintillator material as described herein (e.g., thallium-based halide composition), and a light detection assembly coupled to the scintillator material to detect a light pulse luminescence from the scintillator as a measure of a scintillation event.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The following examples are provided to illustrate certain embodiments described herein and not intended to be limiting.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0068">This example illustrates production and characterization of a Tl<sub>2</sub>LiLaBr<sub>6</sub>:Ce scintillator material sample.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A Tl<sub>2</sub>LiLaBr<sub>6</sub>:Ce crystal was grown using a Bridgeman growth technique. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a photograph of the Tl<sub>2</sub>LiLaBr<sub>6</sub>:Ce scintillator material crystal sample.
