id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an apparatuses, and methods of installing, glass shower doors. More specifically, the disclosure is directed towards an apparatus and methods to secure glass shower doors within a frame.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sliding doors are commonly used for shower and tub enclosures. Typical sliding shower door assemblies include one or more door panels in rolling engagement with respective rails of a door header. Each of the door panels are configured to slide along the rails within the header to allow for ingress and egress of a user from, for example, a shower or a tub enclosure. The door header is typically coupled between fixed portions of a shower enclosure and may include a track for receiving a roller assembly. The roller assembly slides along the track forming part of the header. These headers, however, are typically bulky and metallic, which reduce the aesthetic appeal of the sliding doors. With sliding door assemblies, there is also a risk that the sliding door may &#x201c;jump&#x201d; or move from the track such that the sliding door may derail. Given that sliding doors are generally made of glass and are heavy and fragile, derailment of the sliding door may result in serious injury or risk of injury, as well as damage to the sliding door.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, the installation of sliding shower door assemblies requires a significant amount of effort by an installer. For example, the installer may need to measure and mark locations for drilling holes, mount various components (for example, headers, frame rails, and guide members) align various components, and hang door assemblies. The installation process can be challenging and time-consuming. The installer may also be required to use numerous different tools in installing the various components of the shower door assemblies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for improved components of sliding shower door assemblies and more efficient and simplistic methods to install the components of the sliding shower door assemblies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problems expounded above, as well as others, are addressed by the following inventions, although it is to be understood that not every embodiment of the inventions described herein will address each of the problems described above.

It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a further embodiment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations that come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Other objects, features, and aspects of the present disclosure are disclosed in or are apparent from the following description. It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present disclosure is a description of exemplary embodiments only and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For the sake of clarity, not all reference numerals are necessarily present in each drawing Figure. In addition, positional terms such as &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;side,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; etc. refer to the handle when in the orientation shown in the drawings. The skilled artisan will recognize that the handle can assume different orientations when in use.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>65</b>D</figref>, an apparatus <b>10</b>, such as a shower door frame kit, is disclosed. The apparatus <b>10</b> may be provided as a kit with one or more components thereof or only individual component(s). The apparatus <b>10</b> can be installed with one or more glass shower doors <b>12</b> such that the glass shower doors <b>12</b> are slidable (i.e., translatable) along a shower door axis <b>14</b>. One, or each, of the glass shower doors <b>12</b> may be slidable. In some embodiments, one of the glass shower doors <b>12</b> may be stationary. Advantageously, the apparatus <b>10</b> enables secure and convenient installation of the glass shower doors <b>12</b>, while keeping water that may escape a shower area <b>16</b> to a surrounding area <b>18</b> to a minimum. While the apparatus <b>10</b> has been exemplified for installation with the glass shower doors <b>12</b>, it should be appreciated that the various components disclosed herein may be used in conjunction with other types of shower door assemblies having different configurations (for example, a different number of door panels and door panels having different shapes and sizes) and made of different materials (for example, partially made of glass and/or additional or different sections of materials, such as metal, wood, plastic, composite, or any other suitable material).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The apparatus <b>10</b> may include a shower door header <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the shower door header <b>20</b> may have a concealed design, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b>D</figref>. The shower door header <b>20</b> may comprise an elongated body <b>22</b>. The elongated body <b>22</b> may be configured and dimensioned such that it extends along a shower door header axis <b>24</b>. The shower door header axis <b>24</b> may be parallel with the shower door axis <b>14</b>, including such that the shower door header axis <b>24</b> and the shower door axis <b>14</b> may be in the same plane.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The body <b>22</b> includes a sidewall <b>26</b>. The sidewall <b>26</b> may be disposed centrally on the body <b>22</b>. The sidewall <b>26</b> may be comprised of any number of sidewall walls <b>28</b>, such as one, two, three, or four. One or more open cavities <b>30</b> may be disposed in the sidewall <b>26</b>, such as between the sidewall walls <b>28</b>. Beneficially, the one or more open cavities <b>30</b> may enable the sidewall <b>26</b> to have a sufficient width to properly space the glass shower doors <b>12</b> from each other when installed while minimizing the material needed to construct the header <b>20</b> as well minimizing weight of the header <b>20</b>, which is important for easy installation.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The sidewall <b>26</b> may comprise a first side <b>32</b> facing a first direction and a second side <b>34</b> facing a second direction that is opposite of the first direction. When the header <b>20</b> is installed, the first direction may face the shower area <b>16</b>, and the second direction may face the surrounding area <b>18</b>. The sidewall <b>26</b> may comprise a top portion <b>36</b> and a bottom portion <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A first arm <b>40</b> may extend, such as orthogonally, from the first side <b>32</b> and top portion <b>38</b> of the sidewall <b>26</b>. A second arm <b>42</b> may extend, such as orthogonally, from the second side <b>34</b> and top portion <b>36</b> of the sidewall <b>26</b>. The first arm <b>40</b> and the second arm <b>42</b> may each include one or more ribs <b>44</b> extending downwardly. The one or more ribs <b>44</b> may comprise an outer rib <b>46</b> comprising an outwardly extending protuberance <b>48</b>. For example, the outer rib <b>46</b> having the outwardly extending protuberance <b>48</b> may be positioned at the outermost location on each of the first arm <b>40</b> and the second arm <b>42</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The apparatus <b>10</b> may include an elongated cover <b>50</b> configured to be disposed over the elongated body <b>22</b>. The cover <b>50</b> may comprise a cover base <b>52</b> and opposing side supports <b>54</b> extending from the cover base <b>52</b>. The cover <b>50</b> may include opposing extensions <b>56</b> that extend inwardly from the opposing side supports <b>54</b>, the opposing extensions <b>56</b> configured to friction fit with the outwardly extending protuberance <b>48</b> of the shower door header <b>20</b>. Each of the opposing side supports <b>54</b> may comprise an inwardly extending lip <b>58</b> that extends inwardly from the side supports <b>54</b>. The inwardly extending lips <b>58</b> may be disposed oppositely on the side supports <b>54</b> from the cover base <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Advantageously, opposing extensions <b>56</b> and lips <b>58</b> create a &#x201c;double snap&#x201d; feature such that when the cover <b>50</b> is being secured with (e.g., installed with) the shower door header <b>20</b>, the lips <b>58</b> create a first friction fit with outwardly extending perturbances <b>48</b> of the header <b>20</b> to assist the installer aligning the cover <b>50</b> with the header <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. The cover <b>50</b> may be moved past (e.g., downwardly) this first friction fit position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C</figref>) such that the opposing extensions <b>56</b> engage, and friction fit with, with the header <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>. This second friction fit, or &#x201c;snap,&#x201d; indicates to the installer that cover is secure and in the properly installed position.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The elongated body <b>22</b> may include a guide <b>60</b> disposed on the bottom portion <b>38</b> of the sidewall <b>26</b> for guiding movement of the sliding, or translating, glass shower doors <b>12</b> along the elongated body <b>22</b> of the header <b>20</b>. The guide <b>60</b> may comprise a first channel <b>62</b> disposed lengthwise along the first side <b>32</b> of the sidewall <b>26</b>. The guide <b>30</b> may comprise a second channel <b>64</b> disposed lengthwise along the second side <b>34</b> of the sidewall <b>36</b>. The channels <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may each be configured such as to cooperatively receive a roller, wheel, or boss of a glass shower door, such as those described herein. The channels <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may each comprise, or be defined by, a first downwardly extending leg <b>66</b> and a second downwardly extending leg <b>68</b>. The first leg <b>66</b> extends from the sidewall <b>26</b> and the second leg <b>68</b> extends from the first leg <b>66</b> oppositely from the sidewall <b>26</b>. A channel stanchion <b>70</b> for securing an installed roller, wheel, or boss of a glass door may extend upwardly from the second leg <b>68</b> and be disposed on the second leg <b>68</b> opposite from the first leg <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the body <b>22</b> may include an anti jump element <b>72</b> for preventing an installed shower door roller, wheel, or boss of a glass shower door <b>12</b> (such as those disclosed herein) from being &#x201c;lifted off&#x201d; the guide <b>60</b>. In particular, the anti jump element <b>72</b> is advantageous, as it prevents the door from becoming unsecured due to an upward force on the door, which while not a typical force applied to shower doors <b>12</b>, may nevertheless sometimes be applied, such as during the cleaning of the door. The anti jump element <b>72</b> may be disposed between the first and second arms <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and the guide <b>60</b> (i.e., disposed between the bottom portion <b>36</b> and the top portion <b>38</b>). The anti jump element <b>72</b> may comprise a first protrusion <b>73</b> extending orthogonally from the first side <b>32</b> of the sidewall <b>26</b> in the first direction, a second protrusion extending orthogonally from the second side <b>34</b> of the sidewall <b>26</b> in the second direction, or both.
