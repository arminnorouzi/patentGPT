level="1">CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the French patent application No. 2107055 filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by way of reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fastening shackle for realizing a connection between an aircraft engine and an engine pylon. The invention relates more particularly to an arrangement of anti-friction coatings on a ball joint of such a shackle, and to an aircraft comprising such a shackle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Two-point or three-point fastening shackles, also sometimes called links or connecting rods, are commonly used for fastening aircraft engines to the engine pylons secured to the structure of the aircraft. These engine mounts participate in a so-called &#x201c;isostatic&#x201d; mechanical interface system for transferring forces, immobilizing in six degrees of freedom and making it possible to ensure non-stressed mounting while complying with certification and safety requirements. The mechanical interface systems between an engine and an engine pylon have the particular feature of being subjected to high temperatures, given the proximity of the engine, in particular with regard to the so-called rear engine mounts. Premature ageing phenomena occur, in particular owing to the numerous thermomechanical cycles experienced by these elements of the aircraft. Recent fastening techniques make it possible to carry out quick mounting and demounting operations of aircraft engines by using engine fastening shackles into which are inserted pins which also pass through devises of fittings arranged on an engine pylon or on an engine. These engine fastening shackles use anti-friction coatings to limit the wear of contact surfaces between connection elements and to improve the characteristics of the connection interface. It unfortunately arises that these coatings degrade or flake progressively, mainly on their edges or starting from their edges, thus resulting in a stripping or peeling (or delaminating) phenomenon prejudicial to the quality of the mechanical connections realized. These phenomena make it necessary to change the connection parts bearing the coatings.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The situation can therefore be improved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is aimed, in particular, at creating an encapsulation of the anti-friction surface coatings of the connection elements of a shackle for fastening an aircraft engine and to make it possible to thus preserve these coatings from premature wear.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the subject of the invention is a shackle for fastening an engine of an aircraft to a pylon secured to the structure of the aircraft, via at least one pin, the shackle comprising a body and a point for fastening to said pin via a ball joint, the ball joint comprising a ring having a spherical outer region and a first bore, the ring being assembled in a cavity of the body of the shackle having a shape complementary to said spherical outer region,</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">the shackle further having the following features:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">the ball joint comprises a sleeve assembled in the first bore and having a second bore configured to receive said pin and the diameter of which progressively increases to have a flared inner surface at each of its ends,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">the spherical outer surface of the ring bears a first anti-friction coating produced on a first region extending beyond its contact region with the body of the shackle and said first region is bordered by first rims forming a projection with respect to the spherical outer surface of the ring, around the first coating, so as to form a protective stop around the first coating and to encapsulate it, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">the second bore, of the sleeve, bears a second anti-friction coating on a second region extending beyond its contact region with said pin and said second region is bordered by second rims forming a projection with respect to the surface of the second bore, around the second anti-friction coating, at the ends of the flared inner surface of the sleeve.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">Advantageously, it is thus possible to protect, by means of a border forming a projection and flange, the edges of the anti-friction coatings applied to the surfaces of mechanical connection elements and to consequently increase the life of the coatings by consequently avoiding or reducing peeling or disaggregation phenomena. This therefore makes it possible to reduce the maintenance operations and the associated costs. It appears moreover to be easier to coat the surfaces in question again in the event of wear of the coatings.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">The fastening shackle according to the invention may also comprise the following features, considered alone or in combination:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013">The first and second rims have a height greater than or equal to 0.1 mm</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014">The surface of the cavity of the body of the shackle having a shape complementary to said spherical outer region of the ring bears a third anti-friction coating. This advantageously increases the qualities of the connection interface between the surface of the spherical region of the ring and the surface of the cavity of the body of the shackle in which the ring is housed.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0015">The first anti-friction coating is made of a copper-nickel-indium alloy of type Cu36Ni5In or of a cobalt alloy and has a thickness of between 50 &#x3bc;m and 300 &#x3bc;m, preferably 100 &#x3bc;m.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0016">The second anti-friction coating is made of a copper-nickel-indium alloy of type Cu36Ni5In, of a copper-aluminum-Fe alloy of type CuAlFe, or of a cobalt alloy and has a thickness of between 50 &#x3bc;m and 300 &#x3bc;m, preferably 100 &#x3bc;m.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0017">The third anti-friction coating is produced by bulk treatment or made of nanocomposite material of type WC:C&#x2014;H and has a thickness of between 0.2 &#x3bc;m and 50 &#x3bc;m, preferably 5 &#x3bc;m.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0018">The body of the shackle, the ring and the sleeve are made of the same material chosen from: titanium alloys or steel alloys.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0019">Another subject of the invention is a fastening assembly comprising a shackle as described above and a pin bearing on its outer surface, a fourth anti-friction coating made of nanocomposite material of WC:C&#x2014;H or WCCo type and having a thickness of between 0.2 &#x3bc;m and 50 &#x3bc;m, preferably 5 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0020">According to one embodiment, the pin of the fastening assembly is made of a material chosen from: titanium alloys or steel alloys.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0021">A further subject of the invention is an aircraft comprising a shackle as described above or a fastening assembly as already stated.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0022">The above-mentioned features of the invention, together with others, will become more clearly apparent from reading the following description of at least one exemplary embodiment, said description being given with reference to the attached drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates, schematically and in perspective, an assembly for fastening an aircraft engine to an engine pylon secured to the structure of an aircraft, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates, in a front plan view, the fastening assembly already shown in perspective in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, defining a section plane A-A useful for a subsequent description of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partial section of a ball joint of the fastening assembly already shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, along the section A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates, schematically and in an enlarged manner, details of the implementation of elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates a ball joint of a shackle for fastening an aircraft engine; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view showing an aircraft comprising a shackle for fastening an aircraft engine according to one embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a fastening assembly <b>10</b> comprising a fastening shackle <b>100</b> having a substantially flat body, a first ball joint with a pin <b>170</b> and a second ball joint with a pin <b>180</b>. Such a fastening shackle is commonly referred to as a two-point shackle. It should be noted that the invention described here can be applied to any connection element comprising at least one ball joint and is not limited to the case of a shackle. The fastening assembly <b>10</b> is provided and configured to realize a fastening point between an aircraft engine and an aircraft engine pylon secured to the structure of the aircraft. Thus, for example, the pin <b>170</b> is intended to be inserted through through-holes of a fitting of the engine pylon or more precisely through through-holes arranged in flanks of an engine pylon fastening clevis, and the pin <b>180</b> is intended to be inserted through through-holes of an aircraft engine fastening fitting, or more precisely through through-holes arranged in flanks of a fastening clevis secured to this engine. Fastening assemblies such as that shown here are used to realize fastening points in a so-called &#x201c;front&#x201d; part of an aircraft engine, or else in a so-called &#x201c;rear&#x201d; part of such an engine. What is to be understood here by front part of an aircraft engine is a part of the engine situated on the side towards which the aircraft moves in flight, and what is to be understood by rear part of an aircraft engine is a part of the engine situated on the side opposite that towards which the aircraft moves in flight, that is to say on the side the aircraft is coming from.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0030">The front part of an engine is generally made up of the fan and compressor stages of a turbomachine and the rear part of an engine is generally made up of the turbine stages of the turbomachine.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">The ball joint between the body of the shackle <b>100</b> and the fastening pin <b>170</b> is produced by virtue of a ring <b>110</b>, termed inner ring, of generally spherical shape that is arranged in a through-cavity having a surface with a shape complementary to the surface of the spherical region of the ring <b>110</b>. The ring <b>110</b> comprises a bore into which there is inserted a sleeve <b>120</b> intended to receive the pin <b>170</b>. Similarly, the ball joint between the body of the shackle <b>100</b> and the fastening pin <b>180</b> is produced by virtue of a ring <b>130</b>, itself also termed inner ring, of generally spherical shape that is arranged in a through-cavity having a surface with a shape complementary to the surface of the spherical region of the ring <b>130</b>. The ring <b>130</b> comprises a bore into which there is inserted a sleeve <b>140</b> intended to receive the pin <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">The rings <b>110</b> and <b>130</b> therefore have spherical regions intended to be in contact with the surfaces of the through-cavities, of complementary shapes, into which they are respectively inserted. The rings <b>110</b> and <b>130</b>, thus arranged, are free to rotate in their housings and are configured to realize ball joints.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">Advantageously, anti-friction coatings are used for the ball joints described, as well as between the pin <b>170</b> and the sleeve <b>120</b> and between the pin <b>180</b> and the sleeve <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0034">Specifically, such anti-friction coatings make it possible to produce a lubrication and hardness adaptation interface interposed for example between two parts made of titanium or of titanium alloy performing relative movements between them.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0035">Such an interface most often comprises two coatings forming adaptation layers, among which:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0036">a first adaptation layer is deposited on the first part and has a hardness less than that of the first part, this first layer comprising a microporous morphology, giving it a lubrication adaptation function by retaining the grease of a liquid lubricant in micropores,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0037">a second adaptation layer cooperating with the first layer and deposited on the second part, this second layer comprising a hardness greater than that of the first layer and further comprising a lubrication adaptation function by releasing solid lubricants under the effect of friction with the first part.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0038">Conventionally, the fastening points of the rear parts of the engines are subjected to greater temperature stresses owing to the high temperatures produced by the operation of the engines and certain characteristics of such a fastening assembly can vary depending on whether this fastening assembly is intended to realize a connection at a front point (of a front part) or at a rear point (of a rear part) of an aircraft engine.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0039">Thus, for example, the body of the shackle <b>100</b>, the rings <b>110</b> and <b>130</b> and also the sleeves <b>120</b> and <b>140</b> are preferably made of titanium (Ta6V or, in another variant, titanium alloy) in the case of the use for realizing a fastening point at the front of the engine; in that case a so-called &#x201c;cold shackle&#x201d; use mode, and the same elements are preferably made of Inconel <b>718</b> (or, in another variant, steel alloy) in the case of the use for realizing a fastening point at the rear of the engine; and in that case a so-called &#x201c;hot shackle&#x201d; use mode.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0040">In the same way as with regard to the materials used for the manufacture of the body of the shackle <b>100</b>, the rings <b>110</b> and <b>130</b> and the sleeves <b>120</b> and <b>140</b>, characteristics of the anti-friction coatings used may vary in the presence of a so-called &#x201c;cold shackle&#x201d;

The flared shape of the bore of the sleeve <b>120</b> is present on both sides of the sleeve <b>120</b> in order to simplify the insertion of the pin <b>170</b> by facilitating its guidance and by preventing any risk of damage to the coatings during the insertion, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bore of the sleeve <b>120</b>. Of course, the dimensions of the elements shown in the figures do not correspond to a reference scale and features are shown in an oversized manner to facilitate the legibility of the description of the embodiments.
