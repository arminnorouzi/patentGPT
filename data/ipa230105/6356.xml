As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, one radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> is located in space enclosed by four narrow beam radiation units <b>14</b>. This can effectively reduce a space area occupied by the radiation units.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">The radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> and the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> may be fastened to the substrate <b>16</b> in a patch manner. Alternatively, a metal layer may be formed through vapor deposition on the first surface <b>161</b> of the substrate <b>16</b>, and then the metal layer is etched to form the radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> and the wide beam radiation unit.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in an optional solution, the lens antenna is a dual-polarized antenna, and the radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> and the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> of the lens antenna are all square radiation units, so as to ensure that polarization directions of each radiation unit are perpendicular to each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, two adjacent sides of any radiation unit (the radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> or the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b>) are separately connected to one pin, and the two pins are respectively corresponding to feeds in two opposite polarization directions.

In an optional solution, a diagonal line of each narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> is parallel to the direction a, and a diagonal line of each radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> is parallel to the direction a. In this arrangement manner, the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> may overlap in both the direction b and the direction a. Therefore, an area occupied by the radiation units on the first surface <b>161</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">It should be understood that the foregoing arrangement manner of the wide beam radiation unit and the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> is only a specific example. In this embodiment of this application, the wide beam radiation unit and the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> may be alternatively disposed in another arrangement manner. During antenna design, a specific arrangement manner of the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> and the wide beam radiation unit may be determined based on a region that needs to be covered by the lens antenna. For example, when the radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> is to be determined, an equation between a composite beam of the radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> and a feeding amplitude and a phase of the radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> is obtained by using a calculation formula of array antenna beam combination. By using a beam direction, a beam width, and a beam gain as optimization target values, an arrangement manner of the radiation sub-units <b>151</b> is obtained by using a computer to search for and calculate an optimal solution for a feeding relationship of each radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> to meet a constraint. The foregoing calculation formula of array antenna beam combination and a formula used by the computer to search for and calculate the feed relationship of each radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> are common formulas in a conventional technology. Therefore, details are not described herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In an optional solution, a distance between each narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> and any adjacent radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> or narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> is not less than a wavelength &#x3bb;. corresponding to an operating frequency band of the lens antenna.

When the foregoing manner is used, it is ensured that there is an enough distance between any two radiation units, to avoid impact on performance of the radiation unit in operation that is from a parasitic current generated on an adjacent radiation unit when any one of the radiation sub-units <b>151</b> or the narrow beam radiation units <b>14</b> operates.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a bottom view of an antenna of a lens antenna according to an embodiment of this application. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the substrate <b>16</b> further has a second surface <b>162</b>. The power splitter <b>13</b>, the radio frequency switch <b>12</b>, and the feed source <b>11</b> in the antenna are disposed on the second surface <b>162</b>. The second surface <b>162</b> and the first surface are two opposite surfaces. When components of the antenna are respectively carried on the first surface and the second surface <b>162</b>, a quantity of components disposed on each surface may be reduced by using two different surfaces.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">This facilitates antenna arrangement. When the lens antenna is a dual-polarized antenna, there are two feed sources <b>11</b>, two power splitters <b>13</b>, and two radio frequency switches <b>12</b>. One feed source <b>11</b> is connected to the radiation sub-unit and the narrow beam radiation unit in one polarization direction by using one radio frequency switch <b>12</b>. The other feed source <b>11</b> is connected to the radiation sub-unit and the narrow beam radiation unit in the other polarization direction by using the other radio frequency switch <b>12</b>. In addition, each radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> is connected to one power splitter <b>13</b> in one polarization direction.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In one embodiment, the power splitter <b>13</b> is an equal-power splitter. When there are four radiation sub-units, the power splitter <b>13</b> is a quad power splitter <b>13</b>. The power splitter <b>13</b> divides signals transmitted from the feed source <b>11</b> into four equal parts, and sends each equal part of signals to a corresponding connected radiation sub-unit. The four radiation sub-units have equal power. In addition, the power splitter <b>13</b> transmits a same phase signal to each radiation sub-unit <b>151</b>, so that the four radiation sub-units have equal power and a same phase. Therefore, the wide beam radiation unit has a widest first radiation region. In addition, when equal power is used, design of the power splitter <b>13</b> is simplified, and no additional power and phase adjustment units need to be inserted. When there is another quantity of radiation sub-units, the power splitter <b>13</b> is connected to the radiation sub-unit <b>151</b> in a corresponding equal power division manner, so that the radiation sub-units can also have equal power and a same phase.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">When the power splitter <b>13</b> is specifically disposed, different power splitters <b>13</b> may be used.

The radiation unit is separated from a feeding network (a circuit including the power splitter <b>13</b> and the radio frequency switch <b>12</b>) by using the stratum. When the stratum is disposed between the first surface <b>161</b> and the second surface <b>162</b>, the first via <b>163</b> and the second via <b>164</b> separately pass through the stratum, but the first via <b>163</b> and the second via <b>164</b> are separately insulated from the stratum.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">When the foregoing lens antenna is used, when a signal is required to cover a large region, the wide beam radiation unit may be connected to the feed source by using the radio frequency switch <b>12</b>. The feed source covers the large first radiation region by using the wide beam radiation unit. When targeted communication needs to be performed for a specific region, the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> corresponding to the region may be connected to the feed source by switching the switch, and the feed source covers the region that requires targeted communication by using the second radiation region of the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b>. It may be learned from the foregoing description that the lens antenna provided in this embodiment of this application can perform scanning in a large region, and can perform the targeted communication for the specific region. This improves a detection effect of the antenna. According to the lens unit provided in this embodiment of this application, for an application scenario in which a plurality of narrow beams are required, when there is a small quantity of narrow beams, the wide beam radiation unit may not be disposed. The targeted communication can be implemented only by switching of the narrow beam radiation units <b>14</b>. However, when there is a large quantity of the narrow beam radiation units <b>14</b>, switching one by one causes low operating efficiency of the antenna. Therefore, after the wide beam radiation unit is first used to perform large range scanning, and then the region that requires targeted communication is determined, the narrow beam radiation unit <b>14</b> corresponding to the region can be directly switched. This can effectively improve operating efficiency of the antenna.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a second lens antenna according to an embodiment of this application.
