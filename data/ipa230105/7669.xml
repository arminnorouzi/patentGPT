DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to a wireless communication system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sidelink (SL) communication is a communication scheme in which a direct link is established between User Equipments (UEs) and the UEs exchange voice and data directly with each other without intervention of an evolved Node B (eNB). SL communication is under consideration as a solution to the overhead of an eNB caused by rapidly increasing data traffic.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) refers to a communication technology through which a vehicle exchanges information with another vehicle, a pedestrian, an object having an infrastructure (or infra) established therein, and so on. The V2X may be divided into 4 types, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-network (V2N), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P). The V2X communication may be provided via a PC5 interface and/or Uu interface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, as a wider range of communication devices require larger communication capacities, the need for mobile broadband communication that is more enhanced than the existing Radio Access Technology (RAT) is rising. Accordingly, discussions are made on services and user equipment (UE) that are sensitive to reliability and latency. And, a next generation radio access technology that is based on the enhanced mobile broadband communication, massive Machine Type Communication (MTC), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and so on, may be referred to as a new radio access technology (RAT) or new radio (NR). Herein, the NR may also support vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a drawing for describing V2X communication based on NR, compared to V2X communication based on RAT used before NR. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be combined with various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding V2X communication, a scheme of providing a safety service, based on a V2X message such as Basic Safety Message (BSM), Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM), and Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM) is focused in the discussion on the RAT used before the NR. The V2X message may include position information, dynamic information, attribute information, or the like. For example, a UE may transmit a periodic message type CAM and/or an event triggered message type DENM to another UE.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, the CAM may include dynamic state information of the vehicle such as direction and speed, static data of the vehicle such as a size, and basic vehicle information such as an exterior illumination state, route details, or the like. For example, the UE may broadcast the CAM, and latency of the CAM may be less than 100 ms. For example, the UE may generate the DENM and transmit it to another UE in an unexpected situation such as a vehicle breakdown, accident, or the like. For example, all vehicles within a transmission range of the UE may receive the CAM and/or the DENM. In this case, the DENM may have a higher priority than the CAM.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thereafter, regarding V2X communication, various V2X scenarios are proposed in NR. For example, the various V2X scenarios may include vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, based on the vehicle platooning, vehicles may move together by dynamically forming a group. For example, in order to perform platoon operations based on the vehicle platooning, the vehicles belonging to the group may receive periodic data from a leading vehicle. For example, the vehicles belonging to the group may decrease or increase an interval between the vehicles by using the periodic data.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, based on the advanced driving, the vehicle may be semi-automated or fully automated. For example, each vehicle may adjust trajectories or maneuvers, based on data obtained from a local sensor of a proximity vehicle and/or a proximity logical entity. In addition, for example, each vehicle may share driving intention with proximity vehicles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, based on the extended sensors, raw data, processed data, or live video data obtained through the local sensors may be exchanged between a vehicle, a logical entity, a UE of pedestrians, and/or a V2X application server. Therefore, for example, the vehicle may recognize a more improved environment than an environment in which a self-sensor is used for detection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, based on the remote driving, for a person who cannot drive or a remote vehicle in a dangerous environment, a remote driver or a V2X application may operate or control the remote vehicle. For example, if a route is predictable such as public transportation, cloud computing based driving may be used for the operation or control of the remote vehicle. In addition, for example, an access for a cloud-based back-end service platform may be considered for the remote driving.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Meanwhile, a scheme of specifying service requirements for various V2X scenarios such as vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like is discussed in NR-based V2X communication.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Objects</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Meanwhile, in SL communication, the UE needs to perform congestion control. For example, the UE may determine the power for SL transmission based on congestion control. Meanwhile, if the UE performs SL transmission in a specific slot, it may be ambiguous as to which slot the UE should use the measured congestion level. Accordingly, there is a need to propose a method for the UE to perform congestion control and an apparatus supporting the same.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, a method for performing, by a first device, wireless communication is provided. The method may comprise: measuring, in a first slot, a channel busy ratio (CBR) for a resource pool; determining power for physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) transmission in a second slot, based on the CBR measured in the first slot; and performing, to a second device, the PSSCH transmission in the second slot based on the power. For example, the first slot may be a slot before N slots from the second slot, and the N may be determined based on subcarrier spacing (SCS) related to the PSSCH transmission, and the N may be a positive integer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, a first device configured to perform wireless communication is provided. The first device may comprise: one or more memories storing instructions; one or more transceivers; and one or more processors connected to the one or more memories and the one or more transceivers. The one or more processors may execute the instructions to: measure, in a first slot, a channel busy ratio (CBR) for a resource pool; determine power for physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) transmission in a second slot, based on the CBR measured in the first slot; and perform, to a second device, the PSSCH transmission in the second slot based on the power. For example, the first slot may be a slot before N slots from the second slot, and the N may be determined based on subcarrier spacing (SCS) related to the PSSCH transmission, and the N may be a positive integer.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Effects of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The user equipment (UE) may efficiently perform SL communication. The understanding/assumption of the UE for the congestion control-related CBR measurement time and PSSCH PRG unit may be clarified.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

IEEE 802.16m is an evolved version of IEEE 802.16e and provides backward compatibility with a system based on the IEEE 802.16e. The UTRA is part of a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) is part of an evolved UMTS (E-UMTS) using the E-UTRA. The 3GPP LTE uses the OFDMA in a downlink and uses the SC-FDMA in an uplink.

For example, the BS <b>20</b> may include a next generation-Node B (gNB) and/or an evolved-NodeB (eNB). For example, the UE 10 may be fixed or mobile and may be referred to as other terms, such as a mobile station (MS), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a mobile terminal (MT), wireless device, and so on. For example, the BS may be referred to as a fixed station which communicates with the UE 10 and may be referred to as other terms, such as a base transceiver system (BTS), an access point (AP), and so on.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> exemplifies a case where only the gNB is included.

An AMF may provide functions, such as Non Access Stratum (NAS) security, idle state mobility processing, and so on. A UPF may provide functions, such as Mobility Anchoring, Protocol Data Unit (PDU) processing, and so on. A Session Management Function (SMF) may provide functions, such as user equipment (UE) Internet Protocol (IP) address allocation, PDU session control, and so on.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Layers of a radio interface protocol between the UE and the network can be classified into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the lower three layers of the open system interconnection (OSI) model that is well-known in the communication system. Among them, a physical (PHY) layer belonging to the first layer provides an information transfer service by using a physical channel, and a radio resource control (RRC) layer belonging to the third layer serves to control a radio resource between the UE and the network. For this, the RRC layer exchanges an RRC message between the UE and the BS.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a radio protocol architecture, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be combined with various embodiments of the present disclosure. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a radio protocol architecture for a user plane, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> shows a radio protocol architecture for a control plane. The user plane corresponds to a protocol stack for user data transmission, and the control plane corresponds to a protocol stack for control signal transmission.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a physical layer provides an upper layer with an information transfer service through a physical channel. The physical layer is connected to a medium access control (MAC) layer which is an upper layer of the physical layer through a transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and the physical layer through the transport channel. The transport channel is classified according to how and with what characteristics data is transmitted through a radio interface.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Between different physical layers, i.e., a physical layer of a transmitter and a physical layer of a receiver, data are transferred through the physical channel. The physical channel is modulated using an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and utilizes time and frequency as a radio resource.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The MAC layer provides services to a radio link control (RLC) layer, which is a higher layer of the MAC layer, via a logical channel. The MAC layer provides a function of mapping multiple logical channels to multiple transport channels. The MAC layer also provides a function of logical channel multiplexing by mapping multiple logical channels to a single transport channel. The MAC layer provides data transfer services over logical channels.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The RLC layer performs concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of Radio Link Control Service Data Unit (RLC SDU). In order to ensure diverse quality of service (QoS) required by a radio bearer (RB), the RLC layer provides three types of operation modes, i.e., a transparent mode (TM), an unacknowledged mode (UM), and an acknowledged mode (AM). An AM RLC provides error correction through an automatic repeat request (ARQ).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A radio resource control (RRC) layer is defined only in the control plane. The RRC layer serves to control the logical channel, the transport channel, and the physical channel in association with configuration, reconfiguration and release of RBs. The RB is a logical path provided by the first layer (i.e., the physical layer or the PHY layer) and the second layer (i.e., the MAC layer, the RLC layer, and the packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer) for data delivery between the UE and the network.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Functions of a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer in the user plane include user data delivery, header compression, and ciphering. Functions of a PDCP layer in the control plane include control-plane data delivery and ciphering/integrity protection.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A service data adaptation protocol (SDAP) layer is defined only in a user plane. The SDAP layer performs mapping between a Quality of Service (QoS) flow and a data radio bearer (DRB) and QoS flow ID (QFI) marking in both DL and UL packets.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The configuration of the RB implies a process for specifying a radio protocol layer and channel properties to provide a particular service and for determining respective detailed parameters and operations. The RB can be classified into two types, i.e., a signaling RB (SRB) and a data RB (DRB). The SRB is used as a path for transmitting an RRC message in the control plane. The DRB is used as a path for transmitting user data in the user plane.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">When an RRC connection is established between an RRC layer of the UE and an RRC layer of the E-UTRAN, the UE is in an RRC_CONNECTED state, and, otherwise, the UE may be in an RRC_IDLE state. In case of the NR, an RRC_INACTIVE state is additionally defined, and a UE being in the RRC_INACTIVE state may maintain its connection with a core network whereas its connection with the BS is released.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Data is transmitted from the network to the UE through a downlink transport channel. Examples of the downlink transport channel include a broadcast channel (BCH) for transmitting system information and a downlink-shared channel (SCH) for transmitting user traffic or control messages. Traffic of downlink multicast or broadcast services or the control messages can be transmitted on the downlink-SCH or an additional downlink multicast channel (MCH). Data is transmitted from the UE to the network through an uplink transport channel. Examples of the uplink transport channel include a random access channel (RACH) for transmitting an initial control message and an uplink SCH for transmitting user traffic or control messages.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Examples of logical channels belonging to a higher channel of the transport channel and mapped onto the transport channels include a broadcast channel (BCCH), a paging control channel (PCCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a multicast control channel (MCCH), a multicast traffic channel (MTCH), etc.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The physical channel includes several OFDM symbols in a time domain and several sub-carriers in a frequency domain. One sub-frame includes a plurality of OFDM symbols in the time domain. A resource block is a unit of resource allocation, and consists of a plurality of OFDM symbols and a plurality of sub-carriers. Further, each subframe may use specific sub-carriers of specific OFDM symbols (e.g., a first OFDM symbol) of a corresponding subframe for a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), i.e., an L1/L2 control channel. A transmission time interval (TTI) is a unit time of subframe transmission.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a structure of an NR system, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

A radio frame has a length of 10 ms and may be defined to be configured of two half-frames (HFs). A half-frame may include five 1 ms subframes (SFs). A subframe (SF) may be divided into one or more slots, and the number of slots within a subframe may be determined based on subcarrier spacing (SCS). Each slot may include 12 or 14 OFDM(A) symbols according to a cyclic prefix (CP).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In case of using a normal CP, each slot may include 14 symbols. In case of using an extended CP, each slot may include 12 symbols.

A Bandwidth Part (BWP) may be defined as a plurality of consecutive (Physical) Resource Blocks ((P)RBs) in the frequency domain, and the BWP may correspond to one numerology (e.g., SCS, CP length, and so on). A carrier may include a maximum of N number BWPs (e.g., <b>5</b> BWPs). Data communication may be performed via an activated BWP.

In various embodiments of the present disclosure, the L1 layer may imply a physical layer. In addition, for example, the L2 layer may imply at least one of a MAC layer, an RLC layer, a PDCP layer, and an SDAP layer. In addition, for example, the L3 layer may imply an RRC layer.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">Hereinafter, a bandwidth part (BWP) and a carrier will be described.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">The BWP may be a set of consecutive physical resource blocks (PRBs) in a given numerology. The PRB may be selected from consecutive sub-sets of common resource blocks (CRBs) for the given numerology on a given carrier.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">When using bandwidth adaptation (BA), a reception bandwidth and transmission bandwidth of a UE are not necessarily as large as a bandwidth of a cell, and the reception bandwidth and transmission bandwidth of the BS may be adjusted. For example, a network/BS may inform the UE of bandwidth adjustment. For example, the UE receive information/configuration for bandwidth adjustment from the network/BS. In this case, the UE may perform bandwidth adjustment based on the received information/configuration. For example, the bandwidth adjustment may include an increase/decrease of the bandwidth, a position change of the bandwidth, or a change in subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">For example, the bandwidth may be decreased during a period in which activity is low to save power. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in a frequency domain. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in the frequency domain to increase scheduling flexibility. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed to allow a different service. A subset of a total cell bandwidth of a cell may be called a bandwidth part (BWP). The BA may be performed when the BS/network configures the BWP to the UE and the BS/network informs the UE of the BWP currently in an active state among the configured BWPs.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">For example, the BWP may be at least any one of an active BWP, an initial BWP, and/or a default BWP. For example, the UE may not monitor downlink radio link quality in a DL BWP other than an active DL BWP on a primary cell (PCell). For example, the UE may not receive PDCCH, physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), or channel state information-reference signal (CSI-RS) (excluding RRM) outside the active DL BWP. For example, the UE may not trigger a channel state information (CSI) report for the inactive DL BWP. For example, the UE may not transmit physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) or physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) outside an active UL BWP. For example, in a downlink case, the initial BWP may be given as a consecutive RB set for a remaining minimum system information (RMSI) control resource set (CORESET) (configured by physical broadcast channel (PBCH)). For example, in an uplink case, the initial BWP may be given by system information block (SIB) for a random access procedure. For example, the default BWP may be configured by a higher layer. For example, an initial value of the default BWP may be an initial DL BWP. For energy saving, if the UE fails to detect downlink control information (DCI) during a specific period, the UE may switch the active BWP of the UE to the default BWP.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0089">Meanwhile, the BWP may be defined for SL. The same SL BWP may be used in transmission and reception. For example, a transmitting UE may transmit a SL channel or a SL signal on a specific BWP, and a receiving UE may receive the SL channel or the SL signal on the specific BWP. In a licensed carrier, the SL BWP may be defined separately from a Uu BWP, and the SL BWP may have configuration signaling separate from the Uu BWP. For example, the UE may receive a configuration for the SL BWP from the BS/network. The SL BWP may be (pre-)configured in a carrier with respect to an out-of-coverage NR V2X UE and an RRC_IDLE UE. For the UE in the RRC_CONNECTED mode, at least one SL BWP may be activated in the carrier.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example of a BWP, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

For example, length-127 M-sequences may be used for the S-PSS, and length-127 gold sequences may be used for the S-SSS. For example, a UE may use the S-PSS for initial signal detection and for synchronization acquisition. For example, the UE may use the S-PSS and the S-SSS for acquisition of detailed synchronization and for detection of a synchronization signal ID.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0097">A physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) may be a (broadcast) channel for transmitting default (system) information which must be first known by the UE before SL signal transmission/reception. For example, the default information may be information related to SLSS, a duplex mode (DM), a time division duplex (TDD) uplink/downlink (UL/DL) configuration, information related to a resource pool, a type of an application related to the SLSS, a subframe offset, broadcast information, or the like. For example, for evaluation of PSBCH performance, in NR V2X, a payload size of the PSBCH may be 56 bits including 24-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0098">The S-PSS, the S-SSS, and the PSBCH may be included in a block format (e.g., SL synchronization signal (SS)/PSBCH block, hereinafter, sidelink-synchronization signal block (S-SSB)) supporting periodical transmission.

For example, the S-SSB may have a bandwidth of 11 resource blocks (RBs). For example, the PSBCH may exist across 11 RBs. In addition, a frequency position of the S-SSB may be (pre-)configured. Accordingly, the UE does not have to perform hypothesis detection at frequency to discover the S-SSB in the carrier.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a UE performing V2X or SL communication, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

For example, the BS may perform resource scheduling to a UE 1 through a PDCCH (more specifically, downlink control information (DCI)), and the UE 1 may perform V2X or SL communication with respect to a UE 2 according to the resource scheduling. For example, the UE 1 may transmit a sidelink control information (SCI) to the UE 2 through a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH), and thereafter transmit data based on the SCI to the UE 2 through a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, in the LTE transmission mode 2, the LTE transmission mode 4, or the NR resource allocation mode 2, the UE may determine a SL transmission resource within a SL resource configured by a BS/network or a pre-configured SL resource. For example, the configured SL resource or the pre-configured SL resource may be a resource pool. For example, the UE may autonomously select or schedule a resource for SL transmission. For example, the UE may perform SL communication by autonomously selecting a resource within a configured resource pool. For example, the UE may autonomously select a resource within a selective window by performing a sensing and resource (re)selection procedure. For example, the sensing may be performed in unit of subchannels. In addition, the UE 1 which has autonomously selected the resource within the resource pool may transmit the SCI to the UE 2 through a PSCCH, and thereafter may transmit data based on the SCI to the UE 2 through a PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows three cast types, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In case of the groupcast-type SL transmission, the UE may perform SL communication with respect to one or more UEs in a group to which the UE belongs. In various embodiments of the present disclosure, SL groupcast communication may be replaced with SL multicast communication, SL one-to-many communication, or the like.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0111">Hereinafter, sidelink (SL) congestion control will be described.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0112">If a UE autonomously determines an SL transmission resource, the UE also autonomously determines a size and frequency of use for a resource used by the UE. Of course, due to a constraint from a network or the like, it may be restricted to use a resource size or frequency of use, which is greater than or equal to a specific level. However, if all UEs use a relatively great amount of resources in a situation where many UEs are concentrated in a specific region at a specific time, overall performance may significantly deteriorate due to mutual interference.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0113">Accordingly, the UE may need to observe a channel situation. If it is determined that an excessively great amount of resources are consumed, it is preferable that the UE autonomously decreases the use of resources. In the present disclosure, this may be defined as congestion control (CR). For example, the UE may determine whether energy measured in a unit time/frequency resource is greater than or equal to a specific level, and may adjust an amount and frequency of use for its transmission resource based on a ratio of the unit time/frequency resource in which the energy greater than or equal to the specific level is observed. In the present disclosure, the ratio of the time/frequency resource in which the energy greater than or equal to the specific level is observed may be defined as a channel busy ratio (CBR). The UE may measure the CBR for a channel/frequency. Additionally, the UE may transmit the measured CBR to the network/BS.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a resource unit for CBR measurement, based on an embodiment of the present disclosure. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may be combined with various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0115">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, CBR may denote the number of sub-channels in which a measurement result value of a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has a value greater than or equal to a pre-configured threshold as a result of measuring the RSSI by a UE on a sub-channel basis for a specific period (e.g., 100 ms). Alternatively, the CBR may denote a ratio of sub-channels having a value greater than or equal to a pre-configured threshold among sub-channels for a specific duration. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, if it is assumed that a hatched sub-channel is a sub-channel having a value greater than or equal to a pre-configured threshold, the CBR may denote a ratio of the hatched sub-channels for a period of 100 ms. Additionally, the UE may report the CBR to the BS.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0116">Further, congestion control considering a priority of traffic (e.g., packet) may be necessary. To this end, for example, the UE may measure a channel occupancy ratio (CR). Specifically, the UE may measure the CBR, and the UE may determine a maximum value CRlimitk of a channel occupancy ratio k (CRk) that can be occupied by traffic corresponding to each priority (e.g., k) based on the CBR. For example, the UE may derive the maximum value CRlimitk of the channel occupancy ratio with respect to a priority of each traffic, based on a predetermined table of CBR measurement values. For example, in case of traffic having a relatively high priority, the UE may derive a maximum value of a relatively great channel occupancy ratio. Thereafter, the UE may perform congestion control by restricting a total sum of channel occupancy ratios of traffic, of which a priority k is lower than i, to a value less than or equal to a specific value. Based on this method, the channel occupancy ratio may be more strictly restricted for traffic having a relatively low priority.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0117">In addition thereto, the UE may perform SL congestion control by using a method of adjusting a level of transmit power, dropping a packet, determining whether retransmission is to be performed, adjusting a transmission RB size (Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) coordination), or the like.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0118">Hereinafter, a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) procedure will be described.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0119">An error compensation scheme is used to secure communication reliability. Examples of the error compensation scheme may include a forward error correction (FEC) scheme and an automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme. In the FEC scheme, errors in a receiving end are corrected by attaching an extra error correction code to information bits. The FEC scheme has an advantage in that time delay is small and no information is additionally exchanged between a transmitting end and the receiving end but also has a disadvantage in that system efficiency deteriorates in a good channel environment. The ARQ scheme has an advantage in that transmission reliability can be increased but also has a disadvantage in that a time delay occurs and system efficiency deteriorates in a poor channel environment.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0120">A hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme is a combination of the FEC scheme and the ARQ scheme. In the HARQ scheme, it is determined whether an unrecoverable error is included in data received by a physical layer, and retransmission is requested upon detecting the error, thereby improving performance.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0121">In case of SL unicast and groupcast, HARQ feedback and HARQ combining in the physical layer may be supported. For example, when a receiving UE operates in a resource allocation mode 1 or 2, the receiving UE may receive the PSSCH from a transmitting UE, and the receiving UE may transmit HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE by using a sidelink feedback control information (SFCI) format through a physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0122">For example, the SL HARQ feedback may be enabled for unicast. In this case, in a non-code block group (non-CBG) operation, if the receiving UE decodes a PSCCH of which a target is the receiving UE and if the receiving UE successfully decodes a transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may generate HARQ-ACK. In addition, the receiving UE may transmit the HARQ-ACK to the transmitting UE. Otherwise, if the receiving UE cannot successfully decode the transport block after decoding the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE, the receiving UE may generate the HARQ-NACK. In addition, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ-NACK to the transmitting UE.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0123">For example, the SL HARQ feedback may be enabled for groupcast. For example, in the non-CBG operation, two HARQ feedback options may be supported for groupcast.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0124">(1) Groupcast option 1: After the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE, if the receiving UE fails in decoding of a transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ-NACK to the transmitting UE through a PSFCH. Otherwise, if the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE and if the receiving UE successfully decodes the transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may not transmit the HARQ-ACK to the transmitting UE.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0125">(2) Groupcast option 2: After the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE, if the receiving UE fails in decoding of the transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ-NACK to the transmitting UE through the PSFCH. In addition, if the receiving UE decodes the PSCCH of which the target is the receiving UE and if the receiving UE successfully decodes the transport block related to the PSCCH, the receiving UE may transmit the HARQ-ACK to the transmitting UE through the PSFCH.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0126">For example, if the groupcast option 1 is used in the SL HARQ feedback, all UEs performing groupcast communication may share a PSFCH resource. For example, UEs belonging to the same group may transmit HARQ feedback by using the same PSFCH resource.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0127">For example, if the groupcast option 2 is used in the SL HARQ feedback, each UE performing groupcast communication may use a different PSFCH resource for HARQ feedback transmission. For example, UEs belonging to the same group may transmit HARQ feedback by using different PSFCH resources.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0128">For example, when the SL HARQ feedback is enabled for groupcast, the receiving UE may determine whether to transmit the HARQ feedback to the transmitting UE based on a transmission-reception (TX-RX) distance and/or RSRP.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0129">For example, in the groupcast option 1, in case of the TX-RX distance-based HARQ feedback, if the TX-RX distance is less than or equal to a communication range requirement, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE. Otherwise, if the TX-RX distance is greater than the communication range requirement, the receiving UE may not transmit the HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE. For example, the transmitting UE may inform the receiving UE of a location of the transmitting UE through SCI related to the PSSCH. For example, the SCI related to the PSSCH may be second SCI. For example, the receiving UE may estimate or obtain the TX-RX distance based on a location of the receiving UE and the location of the transmitting UE. For example, the receiving UE may decode the SCI related to the PSSCH and thus may know the communication range requirement used in the PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0130">For example, in case of the resource allocation mode 1, a time (offset) between the PSFCH and the PSSCH may be configured or pre-configured. In case of unicast and groupcast, if retransmission is necessary on SL, this may be indicated to a BS by an in-coverage UE which uses the PUCCH. The transmitting UE may transmit an indication to a serving BS of the transmitting UE in a form of scheduling request (SR)/buffer status report (BSR), not a form of HARQ ACK/NACK. In addition, even if the BS does not receive the indication, the BS may schedule an SL retransmission resource to the UE. For example, in case of the resource allocation mode 2, a time (offset) between the PSFCH and the PSSCH may be configured or pre-configured.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0131">For example, from a perspective of UE transmission in a carrier, TDM between the PSCCH/PSSCH and the PSFCH may be allowed for a PSFCH format for SL in a slot. For example, a sequence-based PSFCH format having a single symbol may be supported. Herein, the single symbol may not an automatic gain control (AGC) duration. For example, the sequence-based PSFCH format may be applied to unicast and groupcast.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0132">For example, in a slot related to a resource pool, a PSFCH resource may be configured periodically as N slot durations, or may be pre-configured. For example, N may be configured as one or more values greater than or equal to 1. For example, N may be 1, 2, or 4. For example, HARQ feedback for transmission in a specific resource pool may be transmitted only through a PSFCH on the specific resource pool.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0133">For example, if the transmitting UE transmits the PSSCH to the receiving UE across a slot #X to a slot #N, the receiving UE may transmit HARQ feedback for the PSSCH to the transmitting UE in a slot #(N+A). For example, the slot #(N+A) may include a PSFCH resource. Herein, for example, A may be a smallest integer greater than or equal to K. For example, K may be the number of logical slots. In this case, K may be the number of slots in a resource pool. Alternatively, for example, K may be the number of physical slots. In this case, K may be the number of slots inside or outside the resource pool.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0134">For example, if the receiving UE transmits HARQ feedback on a PSFCH resource in response to one PSSCH transmitted by the transmitting UE to the receiving UE, the receiving UE may determine a frequency domain and/or code domain of the PSFCH resource based on an implicit mechanism in a configured resource pool. For example, the receiving UE may determine the frequency domain and/or code domain of the PSFCH resource, based on at least one of a slot index related to PSCCH/PSSCH/PSFCH, a sub-channel related to PSCCH/PSSCH, and/or an identifier for identifying each receiving UE in a group for HARQ feedback based on the groupcast option 2. Additionally/alternatively, for example, the receiving UE may determine the frequency domain and/or code domain of the PSFCH resource, based on at least one of SL RSRP, SINR, L1 source ID, and/or location information.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0135">For example, if HARQ feedback transmission through the PSFCH of the UE and HARQ feedback reception through the PSFCH overlap, the UE may select any one of HARQ feedback transmission through the PSFCH and HARQ feedback reception through the PSFCH based on a priority rule. For example, the priority rule may be based on at least priority indication of the related PSCCH/PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0136">For example, if HARQ feedback transmission of a UE through a PSFCH for a plurality of UEs overlaps, the UE may select specific HARQ feedback transmission based on the priority rule. For example, the priority rule may be based on at least priority indication of the related PSCCH/PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0137">Hereinafter, SL measurement and reporting will be described.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0138">For the purpose of QoS prediction, initial transmission parameter setting, link adaptation, link management, admission control, or the like, SL measurement and reporting (e.g., RSRP, RSRQ) between UEs may be considered in SL. For example, a receiving UE may receive a reference signal from a transmitting UE, and the receiving UE may measure a channel state for the transmitting UE based on the reference signal. In addition, the receiving UE may report channel state information (CSI) to the transmitting UE. SL-related measurement and reporting may include measurement and reporting of CBR and reporting of location information. Examples of channel status information (CSI) for V2X may include a channel quality indicator (CQI), a precoding matrix index (PM), a rank indicator (RI), reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), pathgain/pathloss, a sounding reference symbol (SRS) resource indicator (SRI), a SRI-RS resource indicator (CRI), an interference condition, a vehicle motion, or the like. In case of unicast communication, CQI, RI, and PMI or some of them may be supported in a non-subband-based aperiodic CSI report under the assumption of four or less antenna ports. A CSI procedure may not be dependent on a standalone reference signal (RS). A CSI report may be activated or deactivated based on a configuration.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0139">For example, the transmitting UE may transmit CSI-RS to the receiving UE, and the receiving UE may measure CQI or RI based on the CSI-RS. For example, the CSI-RS may be referred to as SL CSI-RS. For example, the CSI-RS may be confined within PSSCH transmission. For example, the transmitting UE may perform transmission to the receiving UE by including the CSI-RS on the PSSCH.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0140">Meanwhile, in the present disclosure, for example, a transmitting UE (TX UE) may be a UE which transmits data to a (target) receiving UE (RX UE). For example, the TX UE may be a UE which performs PSCCH transmission and/or PSSCH transmission. For example, the TX UE may be a UE which transmits SL CSI-RS(s) and/or a SL CSI report request indicator to the (target) RX UE. For example, the TX UE may be a UE which transmits (pre-defined) reference signal(s) (e.g., PSSCH demodulation reference signal (DM-RS)) and/or a SL (L1) RSRP report request indicator, to the (target) RX UE, to be used for SL (L1) RSRP measurement. For example, the TX UE may be a UE which transmits a (control) channel (e.g., PSCCH, PSSCH, etc.) and/or reference signal(s) on the (control) channel (e.g., DM-RS, CSI-RS, etc.), to be used for a SL RLM operation and/or a SL RLF operation of the (target) RX UE.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0141">Meanwhile, in the present disclosure, for example, a receiving UE (RX UE) may be a UE which transmits SL HARQ feedback to a transmitting UE (TX UE) based on whether decoding of data received from the TX UE is successful and/or whether detection/decoding of a PSCCH (related to PSSCH scheduling) transmitted by the TX UE is successful. For example, the RX UE may be a UE which performs SL CSI transmission to the TX UE based on SL CSI-RS(s) and/or a SL CSI report request indicator received from the TX UE. For example, the RX UE is a UE which transmits a SL (L1) RSRP measurement value, to the TX UE, measured based on (pre-defined) reference signal(s) and/or a SL (L1) RSRP report request indicator received from the TX UE. For example, the RX UE may be a UE which transmits data of the RX UE to the TX UE.

Accordingly, a power transient period may be additionally required. Herein, for example, in order to alleviate the above-mentioned problem, the TX UE may be configured not to allocate/distribute the PSD on the zero-power PT-RS RE to the data RE located in the form of FDM with the zero-power PT-RS RE (within the same symbol). For example, the TX UE may not allocate/distribute the PSD on the zero-power PT-RS RE to the data RE located in the form of FDM with the zero-power PT-RS RE (within the same symbol). For example, the TX UE may determine/interpret that data mapping is virtually performed on the zero-power PT-RS RE, and the TX UE may not allocate/distribute the PSD on the zero-power PT-RS RE to the data RE located in the form of FDM with the zero-power PT-RS RE (within the same symbol).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0264">For example, the UE may determine whether to apply at least one of the rules proposed in various embodiments of the present disclosure, based on whether the UE performs a chain-based resource reservation operation.
