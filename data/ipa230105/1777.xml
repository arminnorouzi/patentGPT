id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns a rolling device for mounting or integration into a device for enabling the movement of device along a surface. The rolling device may be remotely controlled and may be arranged for automatically moving a group of devices according to pre-set scenarios.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">More specifically the device to be moved may be suitable both for indoor and outdoor use. The device for indoor use is typically a piece of furniture or an interior building element such as a wall or a door. For outdoor use the rolling device may be used for instance for moving euro pallet or other devices that are cumbersome to move.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is suitable for moving all kind of devices that is to be moved between different locations both indoors and outdoors, where the movement is to occur along a surface, for instance a floor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various devices and especially furniture, may be provided with wheels or roller elements for facilitating the movement of devices from one location to another, for instance for regrouping devices or moving a device to get access to the space the device occupies or to provide access to the device itself.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The applicant has previously developed a rolling device capable of being integrated in devices, such as a piece of furniture, a movable wall etc., for moving the device along a surface. The rolling device facilitates the moving of an object and can be used by everyone regardless of physical condition and capacity to lift different devices in which the rolling device is integrated. This device is described in Norwegian Patent NO 316760 B1.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The rolling device of NO 316760 B1 comprises a cylindrical sleeve device for mounting in, for example, the leg of a piece of furniture, and a piston that is movably arranged in the cylindrical sleeve device. A ball-shaped or spherical wheel is arranged in the piston. The piston is movable, with the aid of a click system comprising a spring, between an upper position and a lower position. When the piston is in the lower position, the piece of furniture can be rolled across the floor it is standing on, whilst when the piston is in the upper position, the wheel is inside the cylindrical sleeve device and the leg of the piece of furniture, in which the rolling device is arranged, thus stands on the floor. The piece of furniture thus stands in the desired position without rolling inadvertently across the floor when small forces are applied to the piece of furniture. The solution is completely mechanical.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The applicant has further developed the concept and provided a rolling device with an automatic actuator system for moving a piston with a rolling element between an upper and lower position. This concept is disclosed in EP 3102429. The upper position is a passive stationary position where the wheel element is retracted in the rolling device, and the lower position is an active position for moving the rolling device along a surface. The actuator can be wirelessly controlled.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further version as described in WO 2018138320, the applicant has evolved the concept of the rolling device further. WO 2018138320 presents a rolling device for arrangement for autonomously moving a device from a first position to a second position along a surface. The rolling device controls the movements of a rolling element according to position acquisitions and given position and movement instructions. The rolling element may have a set or fixed vertical position relative to the rolling device or may be arranged for displacement between a retracted position where the wheel element is prevented from moving along a surface and an extended position where the wheel element is prepared for movement along the surface, as described in EP 3102429 and NO 316760 B1.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The rolling device as described in the publications of the applicant as described above, comprises interacting mechanical components and electrical components. When there is a need for repair or if one the components needs to be exchanged with a new or alternative one, the procedure for disengage and later engage the component in question, involves the complexity of all interacting components. Whereas most of the components of the roller device is stationary, the rolling element is moving and is exposed to wear and thus requires replacement from time to time. Consequently, a need has evoked for facilitating the replacement of one of the components of the rolling device, such as the roller element.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a rolling device capable of a simple and reliable arrangement for disassembly and assembly for replacement of the roller element. It is further an object of the invention to provide a solution that minimizes the costs for replacing the roller element, and also makes it possible for the customer or user of the roller device to replace the roller element, without the expertise of the skilled mechanic.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another example is to integrate one or more rolling arrangements in a supporting structure or framework for transporting different product form one location to another along a surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The rolling arrangement can be used both indoor and outdoor. It can be used onshore and offshore, e.g. offshore installations such as rigs and on decks of ships.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rolling arrangement according to the invention can be integrated in a device when the device is produced, or it may be retrofitted in a device not initially intended to be movable. The invention can be used both indoor and outdoor of buildings.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other characteristics of the invention will be clear from the following description of an exemplary embodiment, given as a non-restrictive example, with reference to the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention relates a rolling device for a device to enable moving the device along a surface. The rolling device may typically be configured for engagement with a device such as piece of furniture of various kind, a euro pallet or other devices where the moving is facilitated by the use of one or more rolling devices. The rolling device may be mounted to the device in various ways; by integration of the rolling device into a cavity in the device to be moved (for instance a part of the furniture), by mounting the rolling device directly or indirectly to the device to be moved by fixation means.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The rolling device comprises a housing arranged for attachment to the device and arranged for accommodation of a rolling element. The housing is arranged for accommodation of a control and communication module comprising; a wireless receiver connected to a control device, position means connected to the control device for acquiring the position of rolling device relative to its surroundings. The roller device further comprises driving means connected to the control device and the rolling element for driving and controlling the movements of the rolling element according to the first position acquired by the position means, and a received wireless signal comprising movement instructions and the second position. Further the roller device comprises power supply means for powering the control and communication module and the driving means.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The housing is further arranged with a support assembly for bearing the rolling element and is configured for establishing a releasable connection with the housing. The housing also comprises an electrical interface adapted for establishing connection between the rolling element and at least one of the control and communication module and the power supply means.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">By the arrangement of the rolling device in accordance with the invention, the support assembly carrying the rolling element may easily be released from the housing by applying a release force as typically be provided by a handgrip pulling force from a user.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The rolling element may comprise various elements such as an ordinary wheel shape or having more of a ball shape or a spherical shape or any other shape capable of providing a rolling movement in interaction with a surface.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The rolling element may typically comprise a wheel element arranged with a wheel axle. And in that case the support assembly may comprise a first and a second wheel bearing member each connected to an end portion of the wheel axle. The first wheel bearing member may be releasably arranged in a first guiding recess arranged in the interior of the housing. The second wheel bearing member may be releasably arranged in a second guiding recess arranged in the interior of the housing. The first and second guiding recesses may be configured in the inner wall of the housing or in a construction component installed in housing. The first wheel bearing member, the second wheel bearing member carrying the wheel element is to be released from and installed into the housing as a unit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One example of a wheel for use with the rolling device is a Mecanum wheel. The Mecanum wheel has a configuration allowing movement in any direction, and it is a conventional wheel with a series of rollers attached to its circumference. These rollers may typically each have an axis of rotation at 45&#xb0; to the plane of the wheel and at 45&#xb0; to a line through the centre of the roller parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel but may of course also be arranged with axis of rotation having other inclinations than 45&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Also, when the rolling element has more of a ball shape or a spherical shape the support assembly carrying the rolling element may be releasably arranged in first and second guide recesses in the interior of the housing. The guide recesses may then have a configuration where the support assembly with the rolling element fits into place when positioned at a designated installation position and may further be arranged with inclined portions of the guide recesses for easing the support assembly with the rolling element into and out of installation position. In this case the support assembly may also be released by a handgrip pulling force from a user.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The rolling device may further comprise attachment means for establishing releasable connection between the support assembly and the housing. These attachment means may be selected among the following devices; magnets, click/out connection, releasable claw connection, plug and socket connection.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The rolling device may further comprise a first guide member arranged in the first guiding recess. The first guide member may be arranged for establishing releasable connection with the first wheel bearing member, for instance by the use of the previously mentioned attachment means. Further, the rolling device may comprise a second guide member arranged in the second guiding recess. The second guide member may be arranged for establishing releasable connection with the second wheel bearing member, for instance by the use of the previously mentioned attachment means.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rolling device may comprise a drive motor for displacement of the the first guide member and the first wheel bearing member when connected as a unit by the attachment means. The united first guide member and the first wheel bearing member is displaced in the first guide recess. Further the drive motor is arranged for displacement of the second guide member and the second wheel bearing member when connected as a unit by the attachment means. The united second guide member and the second wheel bearing member is displaced in the second guide recess. The displacement of the these units in their respective guide recess by the drive motor causes the movement of the rolling element into an extended position where a portion of the rolling element projects outside the housing and a retracted position where the rolling element is located inside the housing.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The drive motor may be arranged with a spindle connected to a bridge structure by means of a toothed intermeshing arrangement. The bridge structure may be arranged with a first attachment section connected to the first guide member, and a second attachment section connected to the second guide member for displacement of the wheel element between an extended and retracted position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an alternative version the drive motor may be arranged with a centred spindle having two free end portions wherein<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0028">one of the end portion forms a toothed intermeshing engagement with a first attachment section connected to the first guide member,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0029">the other end portion forms a toothed intermeshing engagement with a second attachment section, for displacement of the wheel element between an extended and retracted position.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">The electrical interface may comprise a wired interface or wireless interface for communication to and from the roller element. When the electrical interface comprises a wired interface, a releasable electrical connection may be provided to ensure the release of the support assembly from the housing. The second guide member may then comprise first connector parts and the second wheel bearing member may comprise second connector parts. The first and second connector parts may then be arranged in a releasable connection and may be arranged as plugs and sockets.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">The guide member (s), wheel bearing member(s), interior housing part(s), and the wheel element, may be arranged as a module unit such as a cassette to be inserted into and removed from the housing. The drive motor may have a location above the wheel element or a location laterally displaced from the wheel element.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">The driving means may typically be arranged in the interior of the rolling element but may also be located elsewhere in the rolling device. A gear mechanism may also be arranged in the in the interior of the rolling element, and the rolling element may for instance be provided as a hub wheel.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">The driving means and gear mechanism may alternatively be located above the wheel element or in a position laterally displaced from the wheel element. However, the driving means and gear mechanism may then still be integrated as a part of the module unit.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0034">In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the enclosed drawings, where:</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of the main components of the rolling device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> are two schematic side views of the rolling device with the rolling element in two different positions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the rolling device arranged for the release of the wheel element.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>-<b>9</b></figref> show details of the rolling device arranged for the release of the wheel element.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref> show an alternative embodiment of the arrangement of the rolling device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> show further an alternative embodiment of the arrangement of the rolling device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0040" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic set up of different components and devices of the rolling device for mounting to, or integration into a device for enabling the movement of device along a surface.
