only. As such, other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Also, the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications. Functional and structural features as described in the present disclosures can be combined, adjusted, and modified with one another and in ways not specifically depicted in the drawings, such that these combinations, adjustments, and modifications are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be readily understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest manner such that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; something but also includes the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something with an intermediate feature or a layer therebetween, and that &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; not only means the meaning of &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something but can also include the meaning it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something with no intermediate feature or layer therebetween (i.e., directly on something).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layers thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers. For example, an interconnect layer can include one or more conductors and contact layers (in which interconnect lines and/or vertical interconnect access (via) contacts are formed) and one or more dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">With the development of 3D memory devices, such as 3D NAND Flash memory devices, the more stacked layers (e.g., more word lines and the resulting more memory cells) require more peripheral circuits (and the components, e.g., transistors, forming the peripheral circuits) for operating the 3D memory devices. For example, the number and/or size of page buffers needs to increase to match the increased number of memory cells. In another example, the number of string drivers in the word line driver is proportional to the number of word lines in the 3D NAND Flash memory. Thus, the continuous increase of the word lines also increases the area occupied by the word line driver, as well as the complexity of metal routings, sometimes even the number of metal layers. Moreover, in some 3D memory devices in which the peripheral circuits are fabricated under the memory cell array, sometimes known as &#x201c;periphery under cell&#x201d; (PUC) architecture or &#x201c;complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) under the array&#x201d; (CuA) architecture, the continuous increase of peripheral circuits' areas makes it the bottleneck for reducing the total chip size since the memory cell array can be scaled up vertically by increasing the number of levels instead of increasing the planar size.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, it is desirable to reduce the planar areas occupied by the peripheral circuits of the 3D memory devices with the increased numbers of peripheral circuits and the transistors thereof. However, scaling down the transistor size of the peripheral circuits following the advanced CMOS technology node trend used for the logic devices would cause a significant cost increase and higher leakage current, which are undesirable for memory devices. Moreover, because the 3D NAND Flash memory devices require a relatively high voltage (e.g., above 5 V) in certain memory operations, such as program and erase, unlike logic devices, which can reduce its working voltage as the CMOS technology node advances, the voltage provided to the memory peripheral circuits cannot be reduced. As a result, scaling down the memory peripheral circuit sizes by following the trend for advancing the CMOS technology nodes, like the normal logic devices, becomes infeasible.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">To address one or more of the aforementioned issues, the present disclosure introduces various solutions in which the peripheral circuits of a memory device are disposed in different planes (levels, tiers) in the vertical direction, i.e., stacked over one another, to reduce the planar chip size of the peripheral circuits, as well as the total chip size of the memory device. In some implementations, the memory cell array (e.g., NAND memory strings), the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively high voltage (e.g., above 3.3 V), and the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively low voltage (e.g., below 2 V) are disposed in different planes in the vertical direction, i.e., stacked over one another, to further reduce the chip size. The 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed in the present disclosure can be easily scaled up vertically to stack more peripheral circuits in different planes to further reduce the chip size. Moreover, the 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed herein can be compatible with the PUC/CuA architecture and process. In some implementations, the memory cell array (e.g., NAND memory strings) can be formed on a deposited polysilicon (a.k.a. polycrystalline silicon) layer (e.g., in contact with a polysilicon source plate), as opposed to a single crystalline silicon substrate, which is suitable for &#x201c;floating gate&#x201d; type of NAND memory strings or certain designs of channel structures in &#x201c;charge trap&#x201d; type of NAND memory strings, for example, that are suitable for gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) erase operations.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The peripheral circuits can be separated into different planes in the vertical direction based on different performance requirements, for example, the voltages applied to the transistors thereof, which affect the dimensions of the transistors (e.g., gate dielectric thickness), dimensions of the substrates in which the transistors are formed (e.g., substrate thickness), and thermal budgets (e.g., the interconnect material). Thus, peripheral circuits with different dimension requirements (e.g., gate dielectric thickness and substrate thickness) and thermal budgets can be fabricated in different processes to reduce the design and process constraints from each other, thereby improving the device performance and fabrication complexity.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to some aspects of the present disclosure, the memory cell array and various peripheral circuits with different performance and dimension requirements can be fabricated in parallel on different substrates and then stacked over one another using various joining technologies, such as hybrid bonding, transfer bonding, etc. As a result, the fabrication cycle of the memory device can be further reduced. Moreover, since the thermal budgets of the different devices become independent to each other, interconnect materials with desirable electric performance but low thermal budget, such as copper, can be used in interconnecting the memory cells and transistors of the peripheral circuits, thereby further improving the device performance. Bonding technologies can introduce additional benefits as well. In some implementations, hybrid bonding in a face-to-face manner achieves millions of parallel short interconnects between the bonded semiconductor structures to increase the throughput and input/output (I/O) speed of the memory devices. In some implementations, transfer bonding re-uses a single wafer to transfer thin semiconductor layers thereof onto different memory devices for forming transistors thereon, which can reduce the cost of the memory devices.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed in the present disclosure also have the flexibility to allow various device pad-out schemes to meet different needs and different designs of the memory cell array. In some implementations, the pad-out interconnect layer is formed from the side of the semiconductor structure that has the peripheral circuits to shorten the interconnect distance between the pad-out interconnect layer and the transistors of the peripheral circuits to reduce the parasitic capacitance from the interconnects and improve the electric performance. In some implementations, the pad-out interconnect layer is formed on a thinned substrate to enable inter-layer vias (LLVs, e.g., submicron-level) for pad-out interconnects with high I/O throughput and low fabrication complicity.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a schematic view of a cross-section of a 3D memory device <b>100</b>, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. 3D memory device <b>100</b> represents an example of a bonded chip. In some implementations, the components of 3D memory device <b>100</b> (e.g., memory cell array and peripheral circuits) are formed separately on different substrates in parallel and then jointed to form a bonded chip (a process referred to herein as a &#x201c;parallel process&#x201d;). In some implementations, a semiconductor layer (e.g., single crystalline silicon) is attached onto another semiconductor structure using transferring bonding, then some of the components of 3D memory device <b>100</b> (e.g., some peripheral circuits) are formed on the attached semiconductor layer (a process referred to herein as a &#x201c;series process&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is noted that x- and y-axes are added in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> to further illustrate the spatial relationships of the components of a semiconductor device. A substrate of a semiconductor device, e.g., 3D memory device <b>100</b>, includes two lateral surfaces (e.g., a top surface and a bottom surface) extending laterally in the x-direction (the lateral direction or width direction). As used herein, whether one component (e.g., a layer or a device) is &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; or &#x201c;below&#x201d; another component (e.g., a layer or a device) of a semiconductor device is determined relative to the substrate of the semiconductor device in the y-direction (the vertical direction or thickness direction) when the substrate is positioned in the lowest plane of the semiconductor device in they-direction. The same notion for describing the spatial relationships is applied throughout the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">3D memory device <b>100</b> can include a first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> including an array of memory cells (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;memory cell array&#x201d;). In some implementations, the memory cell array includes an array of NAND Flash memory cells. For ease of description, a NAND Flash memory cell array may be used as an example for describing the memory cell array in the present disclosure. But it is understood that the memory cell array is not limited to NAND Flash memory cell array and may include any other suitable types of memory cell arrays, such as NOR Flash memory cell array, phase change memory (PCM) cell array, resistive memory cell array, magnetic memory cell array, spin transfer torque (STT) memory cell array, to name a few.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">First semiconductor structure <b>102</b> can be a NAND Flash memory device in which memory cells are provided in the form of an array of 3D NAND memory strings and/or an array of two-dimensional (2D) NAND memory cells. NAND memory cells can be organized into pages or fingers, which are then organized into blocks in which each NAND memory cell is coupled to a separate line called a bit line (BL). All cells with the same vertical position in the NAND memory cell can be coupled through the control gates by a word line (WL). In some implementations, a memory plane contains a certain number of blocks that are coupled through the same bit line. First semiconductor structure <b>102</b> can include one or more memory planes, and the peripheral circuits that are needed to perform all the read/program (write)/erase operations can be included in a second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> and first semiconductor structure <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some implementations, the array of NAND memory cells is an array of 2D NAND memory cells, each of which includes a floating-gate transistor. The array of 2D NAND memory cells includes a plurality of 2D NAND memory strings, each of which includes a plurality of memory cells connected in series (resembling a NAND gate) and two select transistors, according to some implementations. Each 2D NAND memory string is arranged in the same plane (i.e., referring to herein a flat, two-dimensional (2D) surface, different from the term &#x201c;memory plane&#x201d; in the present discourse) on the substrate, according to some implementations. In some implementations, the array of NAND memory cells is an array of 3D NAND memory strings, each of which extends vertically above the substrate (in 3D) through a stack structure, e.g., a memory stack. Depending on the 3D NAND technology (e.g., the number of layers/tiers in the memory stack), a 3D NAND memory string typically includes a certain number of NAND memory cells, each of which includes a floating-gate transistor or a charge-trap transistor.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Consistent with the scope of the present disclosure, first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> can also include a polysilicon layer <b>106</b> on which the memory cell array is formed. In some implementations, the memory cell array includes an array of NAND memory strings, and polysilicon layer <b>106</b> is in contact with the sources of the NAND memory strings. That is, polysilicon layer <b>106</b> can serve as a common source plate of multiple NAND memory strings. As described below in detail, polysilicon layer <b>106</b> can be formed in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> using one or more thin film deposition processes including, but not limited to, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), or any combination thereof, which are compatible with PUC/CuA processes. It is understood that in some examples, polysilicon layer <b>106</b> may be a semiconductor layer in general that is not limited to polysilicon.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> can further include some of the peripheral circuits of the memory cell array, and the memory cell array and the peripheral circuits in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> can be separated by polysilicon layer <b>106</b> in the vertical direction. That is, polysilicon layer <b>106</b> can be disposed vertically between the memory cell array and the peripheral circuits in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the peripheral circuits are disposed under polysilicon layer <b>106</b> and the memory cell array formed thereon. Depending on the thickness of polysilicon layer <b>106</b>, interconnects (e.g., inter-layer vias (ILVs) in the submicron-level or through substrate vias (TSVs) in the micron- or tens micron-level) can be formed through polysilicon layer <b>106</b> to make direct, short-distance (e.g., submicron- to tens micron-levels) electrical connections between the memory cell array and the peripheral circuits in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, 3D memory device <b>100</b> can also include a second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> including some of the peripheral circuits of the memory cell array in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b>. That is, the peripheral circuits of the memory cell array can be separated into at least two semiconductor structures (e.g., <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The peripheral circuits (a.k.a. control and sensing circuits) can include any suitable digital, analog, and/or mixed-signal circuits used for facilitating the operations of the memory cell array. For example, the peripheral circuits can include one or more of a page buffer, a decoder (e.g., a row decoder and a column decoder), a sense amplifier, a driver (e.g., a word line driver), an I/O circuit, a charge pump, a voltage source or generator, a current or voltage reference, any portions (e.g., a sub-circuit) of the functional circuits mentioned above, or any active or passive components of the circuit (e.g., transistors, diodes, resistors, or capacitors). The peripheral circuits in first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> can use CMOS technology, e.g., which can be implemented with logic processes in any suitable technology nodes.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are stacked over one another in different planes, according to some implementations. As a result, the memory cell array in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b>, the peripheral circuits in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b>, and the peripheral circuits in second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> can be stacked over one another in different planes to reduce the planar size of 3D memory device <b>100</b>, compared with memory devices in which all the peripheral circuits are disposed in the same plane.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, 3D memory device <b>100</b> further includes a bonding interface <b>103</b> vertically between first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and second semiconductor structure <b>104</b>.

Different from 3D memory device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> in which the memory cell array in first semiconductor structure is vertically between the peripheral circuits in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and the peripheral circuits in second semiconductor structure <b>104</b>, in 3D memory device <b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the peripheral circuits in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> are vertically between the memory cell array in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and the peripheral circuits in second semiconductor structures.
