Further, in the present specification, when referring to the top, bottom, right, and left of the drawing, the direction of the notation in the drawing is taken as a reference.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">(Substrate Processing System)</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a substrate processing system <b>1</b> (substrate processing apparatus) configured to process a substrate W will be explained. The substrate processing system <b>1</b> includes a carry-in/out station <b>2</b>, a processing station <b>3</b>, and a controller Ctr (control unit). The carry-in/out station <b>2</b> and the processing station <b>3</b> may be arranged side by side in, for example, a horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The substrate W may be of a circular plate shape, or may be of a plate shape such as a polygon other than a circle. The substrate W may have a groove portion which is partially cut out. The groove portion may be, for example, a notch (a U-shaped or V-shaped groove) or a linear portion (so-called orientation flat) extending linearly. The substrate W may be, by way of non-limiting example, a semiconductor substrate (silicon wafer), a glass substrate, a mask substrate, a flat panel display (FPD) substrate, or any of various other kinds of substrates. The substrate W may have a diameter of, e.g., about 200 mm to 450 mm.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The carry-in/out station <b>2</b> includes a placing section <b>4</b>, a carry-in/out section <b>5</b>, and a shelf unit <b>6</b>. The placing section <b>4</b> includes a plurality of placing tables (not shown) arranged in a width direction (up-and-down direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Each placing table is configured to place a carrier <b>7</b> (receptacle) thereon. The carrier <b>7</b> is configured to accommodate at least one substrate W in a sealed state. The carrier <b>7</b> includes an opening/closing door (not shown) through which the substrate W is carried in or out.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The carry-in/out section <b>5</b> is disposed adjacent to the placing section <b>4</b> in the direction in which the carry-in/out station <b>2</b> and the processing station <b>3</b> are arranged (left-and-right direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The carry-in/out section <b>5</b> includes an opening/closing door (not shown) provided to correspond to the placing section <b>4</b>. If the opening/closing door of the carrier <b>7</b> and the opening/closing door of the carry-in/out section <b>5</b> are both opened in the state that the carrier <b>7</b> is placed on the placing section <b>4</b>, the inside of the carry-in/out section <b>5</b> and the inside of the carrier <b>7</b> communicate with each other.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The carry-in/out section <b>5</b> incorporates therein a transfer arm A<b>1</b> and the shelf unit <b>6</b>. The transfer arm A<b>1</b> is configured to be movable horizontally in the width direction (up-and-down direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), movable up and down in a vertical direction, and pivotable about a vertical axis. The transfer arm A<b>1</b> serves to take out the substrate W from the carrier <b>7</b> and hand it over to the shelf unit <b>6</b>, and also serves to receive the substrate W from the shelf unit <b>6</b> and return it back into the carrier <b>7</b>. The shelf unit <b>6</b> is located near the processing station <b>3</b>, and is configured as a transit area for the transfer of the substrate W between the carry-in/out section <b>5</b> and the processing station <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The processing station <b>3</b> includes a transfer section <b>8</b> and a plurality of processing units U. For example, the transfer section <b>8</b> extends horizontally in the direction (left-and-right direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in which the carry-in/out station <b>2</b> and the processing station <b>3</b> are arranged. The transfer section <b>8</b> incorporates a transfer arm A<b>2</b> therein. The transfer arm A<b>2</b> is configured to be movable horizontally in a lengthwise direction (left-and-right direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the transfer section <b>8</b>, movable up and down in the vertical direction, and pivotable about a vertical axis. The transfer arm A<b>2</b> serves to take out the substrate W from the shelf unit <b>6</b> and pass it over to the corresponding processing unit U, and also serves to receive the substrate W from the processing unit U and return it back into the shelf unit <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The plurality of processing units U are arranged side by side in a row along the lengthwise direction (left-and-right direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the transfer section <b>8</b> at both sides of the transfer section <b>8</b>. The processing units U are configured to perform predetermined processings (for example, a cleaning processing for the substrate W, an etching processing for a film formed on a surface of the substrate W, and so forth) on the substrate W.

The rectifying unit <b>30</b> is a plate-shaped body provided with a multiple number of holes, such as a punching metal, an extended metal, a wire mesh, or the like. The rectifying unit <b>30</b> is configured to rectify the downflow formed by the blower unit <b>20</b> to thereby uniform a distribution of the downflow in the chamber <b>10</b> below the rectifying unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The rotating/holding unit <b>40</b> includes a rotation shaft <b>41</b>, a driving unit <b>42</b>, a supporting plate <b>43</b> (holder), a plurality of supporting pins <b>44</b>, an annular member <b>45</b>, and an inner cup body <b>46</b>.

The rotation shaft <b>41</b> is configured to be rotatable around a central axis Ax.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The driving unit <b>42</b> is connected to the rotation shaft <b>41</b>. The driving unit <b>42</b> is operated based on an operation signal from the controller Ctr, and is configured to rotate the rotation shaft <b>41</b>. The driving unit <b>42</b> may be a power source such as, but not limited to, an electric motor.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The supporting plate <b>43</b> is, for example, a flat plate having a ring shape, and extends horizontally. That is, a through hole <b>43</b><i>a </i>is formed at a central portion of the supporting plate <b>43</b>. An inner periphery of the supporting plate <b>43</b> is connected to a leading end of the rotation shaft <b>41</b>. Accordingly, the supporting plate <b>43</b> is configured to be rotated around the central axis Ax of the rotation shaft <b>41</b> along with the rotation shaft <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The plurality of supporting pins <b>44</b> are provided at the supporting plate <b>43</b> so as to be protruded upwards from a top surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the supporting plate <b>43</b>.

The plurality of supporting pins <b>44</b> may have, for example, a columnar shape or a frustum shape. In the vicinity of an outer periphery of the supporting plate <b>43</b>, the plurality of supporting pins <b>44</b> may be arranged at a substantially equal distance therebetween so that they form a circular shape as a whole when viewed from above. By way of example, when the number of the plurality of supporting pins <b>44</b> is twelve, these supporting pins <b>44</b> may be arranged at an angular distance of about 30&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The annular member <b>45</b> has an annular shape (for example, a circular ring shape), and is provided at the supporting plate <b>43</b> so as to be protruded upwards from the top surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the supporting plate <b>43</b>.

When using the multiple kinds of cleaning liquids, these multiple kinds of cleaning liquids may be supplied to the mist guard <b>70</b> at the same time, or may be supplied to the mist guard <b>70</b> while being switched sequentially.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Other Examples</heading><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Example 1. A substrate processing apparatus includes a holder configured to hold a substrate; a driving unit configured to rotate the holder; an inner cup body provided in the holder to surround the substrate held by the holder from an outside thereof; a mist guard, surrounding the holder and the inner cup body from an outside thereof such that the holder and the inner cup body are located inside the mist guard, configured to be moved up and down; a processing liquid supply configured to supply a processing liquid to the substrate held by the holder; a cleaning liquid supply configured to supply a cleaning liquid; and a controller. The controller is configured to perform: supplying the processing liquid to the substrate from the processing liquid supply, in a state that the substrate is held by the holder and the mist guard is raised; and dispersing, after the supplying of the processing liquid, the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply to an entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard, in a state that the substrate is carried out from the holder and the mist guard is raised. However, if mist of the processing liquid remains adhering to the inner peripheral surface of the mist guard, there is a risk that the mist may be crystallized, and the crystals may drop off the mist guard and adhere to the substrate. According to Example 1, however, the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard to which the mist of the processing liquid adheres is cleaned by the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply. Therefore, it becomes possible to clean the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard effectively.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Example 2. In the substrate processing apparatus of Example 1, the inner cup body may include an annular groove configured to store therein the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply, and formed in a top surface of the inner cup body to extend along an entire circumference of the inner cup body, and the dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include supplying the cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid supply to the annular groove, and rotating the inner cup body along with the holder by the driving unit to disperse the cleaning liquid stored in the annular groove to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, as the inner cup body is rotated, the cleaning liquid stored in the annular groove is scattered toward the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard all at once. Accordingly, it becomes possible to clean the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard in a very short time. Therefore, productivity may be raised.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Example 3. In the substrate processing apparatus of Example 2, an inner wall surface of the annular groove at an outer side may be an inclined surface that slopes upwards as it goes outwards in a diametrical direction. In this case, as the inner cup body is rotated, the cleaning liquid stored in the annular groove flows along the inclined surface, so that it becomes easy for the cleaning liquid to reach the mist guard. Therefore, the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard may be cleaned more effectively.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Example 4. In the substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 1 to 3, the holder may include an annular member disposed to be protruded upwards from a top surface of the holder, and the dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include supplying the cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid supply to a storage space surrounded by the annular member and the top surface of the holder, and rotating the inner cup body along with the holder by the driving unit to disperse the cleaning liquid stored in the storage space to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, as the inner cup body is rotated, the cleaning liquid stored in the storage space is scattered toward the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard all at once. Accordingly, it becomes possible to clean the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard effectively in a very short time. Therefore, productively may be raised.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Example 5. In the substrate processing apparatus of Example 4, an inner wall surface of the annular member at an inner side may be an inclined surface that slopes upwards as it goes outwards in a diametrical direction. In this case, since the cleaning liquid stored in the storage space flows along the inclined surface as the inner cup body is rotated, the cleaning liquid may easily reach the mist guard. Thus, the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard may be cleaned more effectively.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Example 6. The substrate processing apparatus of Example 1 may further include a diffusing member configured to diffuse the cleaning liquid in a horizontal direction, and disposed above the holder. The cleaning liquid supply may be configured to discharge the cleaning liquid upwards through a through hole provided at the holder, and the dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include discharging the cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid supply toward the diffusing member through the through hole, thus allowing the cleaning liquid diffused in the horizontal direction after colliding with the diffusing member to be dispersed to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, the cleaning liquid having collided with the diffusing member is dispersed toward the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard at once. Thus, as compared to a case where the cleaning liquid is supplied to the inner peripheral surface of the mist guard by using a nozzle or the like, it becomes possible to effectively clean the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard in a very short time. As a result, productivity may be improved.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Example 7. The substrate processing apparatus of Example 6 may further include an additional driving unit configured to rotate the diffusing member around a rotation axis extending in a vertical direction. The dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include discharging the cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid supply toward the diffusing member through the through hole while rotating the diffusing member with the additional driving unit, thus allowing the cleaning liquid diffused in the horizontal direction after colliding with the diffusing member to be dispersed to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, as the diffusing member is rotated, the cleaning liquid having collided with the diffusing member may be easily scattered around. Thus, it becomes possible to clean the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard more effectively.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Example 8. The substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 1 to 5 may further include an additional cleaning liquid supply configured to discharge a cleaning liquid upwards through a through hole provided at the holder; and a diffusing member configured to diffuse the cleaning liquid supplied from the additional cleaning liquid supply in a horizontal direction, and configured to be disposed above the holder. The dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include dispersing the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard in a state that the substrate is carried out from the holder and the mist guard is raised, and discharging the cleaning liquid from the additional cleaning liquid supply toward the diffusing member through the through hole, thus allowing the cleaning liquid diffused in the horizontal direction after colliding with the diffusing member to be dispersed to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, the same effects as in Examples 1 and 6 may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Example 9. The substrate processing apparatus of Example 8 may further include an additional driving unit configured to rotate the diffusing member around a rotation axis extending in a vertical direction. The dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include dispersing the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard in the state that the substrate is carried out from the holder and the mist guard is raised, and discharging the cleaning liquid from the additional cleaning liquid supply toward the diffusing member through the through hole while rotating the diffusing member by the additional driving unit, thus allowing the cleaning liquid diffused in the horizontal direction after colliding with the diffusing member to be dispersed to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, the same effects as in Example 7 may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Example 10. In the substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 6 to 9, the diffusing member may include a concave curved surface recessed upwards in a state that the diffusing member is disposed above the holder. In this case, since the cleaning liquid having collided with the diffusing member flows along the concave curved surface, it becomes easy for the cleaning liquid to reach the mist guard. Therefore, the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard may be cleaned more effectively.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Example 11. The substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 6 to 10 may further include a holding arm configured to be moved above the holder. The diffusing member may be detachably mounted to the holding arm, and the controller may be configured to further perform, prior to the dispersing of the cleaning liquid, locating the diffusing member at a position above the holder by holding the diffusing member placed at a standby position at an outside of the mist guard with the holding arm. In this case, by keeping the diffusing member at the standby position when it is not in use, it becomes possible to suppress a situation in which the cleaning liquid adhering to the diffusing member falls down onto the substrate.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Example 12. The substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 6 to 10 may further include a gas supply configured to supply a drying gas to the diffusing member. The controller may be configured to further perform supplying the drying gas from the gas supply to the diffusing member after the dispersing of the cleaning liquid. In this case, the cleaning liquid adhering to the diffusing member is dried by the drying gas. Therefore, it becomes possible to suppress a situation in which the cleaning liquid adhering to the diffusing member falls down onto the substrate.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Example 13. In the substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 1 to 12, the cleaning liquid supply may include a discharge nozzle configured to radially discharge the cleaning liquid from multiple discharge openings opened on a circumferential surface thereof. In this case, the cleaning liquid discharged radially from the discharge nozzle to the vicinity thereof is scattered toward the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard all at once. Therefore, it becomes possible to clean the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard effectively in a very short time. As a consequence, productively may be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Example 14. In the substrate processing apparatus of Example 13, the discharge nozzle may be configured such that positions of the multiple discharge openings are allowed to be moved in an up-and-down direction. In this case, a height position at which the cleaning liquid discharged radially from the discharge nozzle reaches the inner peripheral surface of the mist guard is changed. Accordingly, the cleaning liquid can be supplied to a wider range of the inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. Therefore, it becomes possible to clean the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard more effectively.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Example 15. The substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 1 to 14 may further include a cleaning cup, surrounding at least a lower portion of the mist guard from an outside thereof, configured to store the cleaning liquid therein. The controller may be configured to further perform immersing at least the lower portion of the mist guard in the cleaning liquid within the cleaning cup in a state that the mist guard is lowered. In this case, at least the lower portion of the mist guard is cleaned by the cleaning liquid in the cleaning cup. Thus, it becomes possible to more effectively clean the lower portion of the mist guard to which the mist may easily adhere.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Example 16. In the substrate processing apparatus of Example 15, the immersing of the at least the lower portion of the mist guard may be performed prior to the dispersing of the cleaning liquid. In this case, after at least the lower portion of the mist guard is cleaned with the cleaning liquid in the cleaning cup, the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard is cleaned by the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply. Typically, the degree of cleanliness of the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply is higher than the degree of cleanliness of the cleaning liquid stored in the cleaning cup. Thus, by performing the processing in the sequence as described in Example 16, it becomes possible to further purify the inner peripheral surface of the mist guard after being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Example 17. In the substrate processing apparatus of any one of Examples 1 to 16, the cleaning liquid supplied from the cleaning liquid supply may include a first liquid and a second liquid selected from an acidic chemical liquid, an alkaline chemical liquid and water, and the dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include supplying the first liquid and the second liquid from the cleaning liquid supply while switching the first liquid and the second liquid in turn, thus allowing the first liquid and the second liquid to be sequentially dispersed to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, the mist guard is cleaned by the multiple kinds of cleaning liquids. Therefore, it becomes possible to further purify the inner peripheral surface of the mist guard after being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Example 18. In the substrate processing apparatus of Example 17, the first liquid may be the acidic chemical liquid or the alkaline chemical liquid, and the second liquid may be water. The dispersing of the cleaning liquid may include supplying the first liquid and the second liquid from the cleaning liquid supply while switching the first liquid and the second liquid in turn, thus allowing the first liquid and the second liquid to be dispersed to the entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard in this order. In this case, the water is supplied to the mist guard at the end. Accordingly, the acidic chemical liquid or alkaline chemical liquid previously supplied to the mist guard is washed away by the water. Therefore, it becomes possible to further purify the inner peripheral surface of the mist guard after being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Example 19. A cleaning method of a mist guard includes supplying a processing liquid from a processing liquid supply to a substrate in a state that the substrate is held by a holder and in a state that a mist guard is raised, the mist guard surrounding the holder and an inner cup body from an outside thereof to locate the holder and the inner cup body inside the mist guard, the inner cup body being provided in the holder to surround the substrate held by the holder from an outside thereof; storing, after the supplying of the processing liquid, a cleaning liquid supplied from a cleaning liquid supply in an annular groove provided in a top surface of the inner cup body to be extended along an entire circumference of the inner cup body or in a storage space surrounded by a top surface of the holder and an annular member protruded upwards from the top surface of the holder, in a state that the substrate is carried out from the holder and the mist guard is raised; and rotating, after the storing of the cleaning liquid, the inner cup body along with the holder in a state that the mist guard is raised, thus allowing the cleaning liquid stored in the annular groove or the storage space to be dispersed to an entire inner peripheral surface of the mist guard. In this case, the same effects as in Examples 1, 2 and 4 are achieved.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Example 20. The cleaning method of the mist guard of Example 19 may further include immersing at least a lower portion of the mist guard in the cleaning liquid stored in a cleaning cup.
