Further, by figuring out a type, in particular a length, of the end effector <b>20</b> in advance, it is possible to figure out an amount of an offset between the tool center point TCP and the control point CP. Therefore, it is possible to figure out the position of the tool center point TCP in the robotic coordinate system.

The &#x201c;force control&#x201d; means control of an operation of the robot <b>1</b> of changing a position of the end effector <b>20</b>, namely a position of the tool center point TCP, and postures of the first arm <b>12</b> through the sixth arm <b>17</b> based on the detection result of the force detection section <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The force control includes, for example, force trigger control and impedance control. In the force trigger control, the force detection is performed by the force detection section <b>19</b>, and the robot arm <b>10</b> is made to perform an operation such as a displacement or a change in posture until a predetermined force is detected by the force detection section <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The impedance control includes imitation control. In the impedance control, the operation of the robot arm <b>10</b> is controlled so as to keep the force applied to the tip portion of the robot arm <b>10</b> to a predetermined force as precisely as possible, namely so as to keep the force in a predetermined direction detected by the force detection section <b>19</b> at the target force f<sub>St </sub>as precisely as possible. Thus, for example, when the impedance control is performed on the robot arm <b>10</b>, the robot arm <b>10</b> performs an operation imitating an external force applied from the object or an operator with respect to the predetermined direction. It should be noted that the target force f<sub>St </sub>includes 0. For example, as one of the settings when performing the imitation operation, it is possible to set the target value to &#x201c;0.&#x201d; It should be noted that it is possible to set the target force f<sub>St </sub>to a numerical value other than 0. It is possible for the operator to arbitrarily sect the target force f<sub>St </sub>via, for example, the teaching device <b>4</b>.

Here, the character &#x201c;S&#x201d; is assumed to represent any one of the directions (X, Y, and Z) of the axes defining the robotic coordinate system.

It should be noted that the control device <b>3</b> stores a correspondence relationship which defines a direction of a detection axis in a sensor coordinate system of the force detection section <b>19</b> for every positional posture S of the tool center point TCP in the robotic coordinate system. Therefore, it is possible for the control device <b>3</b> to identify the acting force f<sub>S </sub>in the robotic coordinate system based on the positional posture S of the tool center point TCP in the robotic coordinate system and the correspondence relationship. Further, the torque acting on the robot <b>1</b> can be calculated from the acting force f<sub>S </sub>and a distance from the contact point to the force detection section <b>19</b>, and is identified as a torque component.

The impedance control is active impedance control which realizes an imaginary mechanical impedance with the motor M<b>1</b> through the motor M<b>6</b>. The control device <b>3</b> performs such impedance control when performing direct teaching and a step in a contact state in which the end effector <b>20</b> receives a force from the object such as a fitting task, a screwing task, or a polishing task.

Specifically, it is possible to adopt a configuration in which the display colors are automatically assigned so that an area high in pressing force becomes, for example, red, and an area low in pressing force becomes, for example, green in accordance with the magnitude of the pressing force thus input.
