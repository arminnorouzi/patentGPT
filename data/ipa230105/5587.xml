No. 15/362,642, filed Nov. 28, 2016, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate generally to medical devices, and more particularly, embodiments of the subject matter relate to facilitating patient operation of a medical device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Infusion pump devices and systems are relatively well known in the medical arts, for use in delivering or dispensing an agent, such as insulin or another prescribed medication, to a patient. A typical infusion pump includes a pump drive system which typically includes a small motor and drive train components that convert rotational motor motion to a translational displacement of a plunger (or stopper) in a reservoir that delivers medication from the reservoir to the body of a user via a fluid path created between the reservoir and the body of a user. Use of infusion pump therapy has been increasing, especially for delivering insulin for diabetics.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Control schemes have been developed that allow insulin infusion pumps to monitor and regulate a user's blood glucose level in a substantially continuous and autonomous manner. However, regulating blood glucose level is still complicated by variations in a user's individual insulin response and daily activities (e.g., exercise, carbohydrate consumption, bolus administration, and the like) in conjunction with variations associated with the devices or components used to implement continuous glucose monitoring and related controls, and potentially other factors that may contribute to variations, uncertainty, or otherwise impair accuracy or reliability. Since many of the variables influencing glucose regulation and control may often be dynamically or periodically changing, some user involvement with the infusion pump may be desirable to achieve the desired performance and outcomes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modern devices may incorporate or support any number of potential features as well as utilizing various user interface(s), which may be unique to a particular device. Therefore, it is desirable for device manufacturers to provide additional consumer education. Traditionally, product manuals or guides documenting the various aspects of the device were provided. For some users, printed documentation can be disfavored and neglected. At the same time, due to regulatory requirements or other concerns, medical devices may not be as equipped as other computer devices for providing consumer education features electronically. Though customer service or other manufacturer support may be available by phone or email, many users tend to find invoking such services to be time consuming and inconvenient. Accordingly, there is a need to provide consumer education in a manner that is simple, convenient, and efficient to enable maximizing device performance for optimal patient outcomes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Medical devices and related systems and operating methods are provided. An exemplary method of interactively providing guidance facilitating operation of a medical device involves identifying, at a computing device communicatively coupled to the medical device, a user objective associated with the medical device, obtaining, at the computing device from the medical device, user interface status information corresponding to a current state of a user interface of the medical device, and providing, on a display associated with the computing device, guidance information influenced by the user interface status information and the user objective. Subsequently, updated user interface status information for the infusion device responsive to a user input with respect to the infusion device may be provided to the computing device, with the guidance information being dynamically updated in response to the updated status information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, an apparatus for a medical device is provided. The medical device includes a display to provide one or more graphical user interface displays, a user interface element to receive a user input, a data storage element to maintain settings information, a communications interface communicatively coupled to a network, and control module coupled to the display, the user interface element, the data storage element, and the communications interface.

As used herein, the word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; means &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Exemplary embodiments of the subject matter described herein are implemented in conjunction with medical devices, such as portable electronic medical devices. Although many different applications are possible, the following description focuses on embodiments that incorporate a fluid infusion device (or infusion pump) as part of an infusion system deployment. For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to infusion system operation, insulin pump and/or infusion set operation, and other functional aspects of the systems (and the individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in detail here. Examples of infusion pumps may be of the type described in, but not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,562,751; 4,685,903; 5,080,653; 5,505,709; 5,097,122; 6,485,465; 6,554,798; 6,558,320; 6,558,351; 6,641,533; 6,659,980; 6,752,787; 6,817,990; 6,932,584; and 7,621,893; Each of which are Herein Incorporated by Reference. That Said, the Subject Matter Described Herein can be Utilized more generally in the context of overall diabetes management or other physiological conditions, and the subject matter described herein is not limited to any particular type of medication or medical device being utilized.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally, a fluid infusion device includes a motor or other actuation arrangement that is operable to linearly displace a plunger (or stopper) of a reservoir provided within the fluid infusion device to deliver a dosage of fluid, such as insulin, to the body of a user. Dosage commands that govern operation of the motor may be generated in an automated manner in accordance with the delivery control scheme associated with a particular operating mode, and the dosage commands may be generated in a manner that is influenced by a current (or most recent) measurement of a physiological condition in the body of the user. For example, in a closed-loop operating mode, dosage commands may be generated based on a difference between a current (or most recent) measurement of the interstitial fluid glucose level in the body of the user and a target (or reference) glucose value. In this regard, the rate of infusion may vary as the difference between a current measurement value and the target measurement value fluctuates. For purposes of explanation, the subject matter is described herein in the context of the infused fluid being insulin for regulating a glucose level of a user (or patient); however, it should be appreciated that many other fluids may be administered through infusion, and the subject matter described herein is not necessarily limited to use with insulin.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Exemplary embodiments described herein generally relate to systems and methods of interactively providing guidance information pertaining to a medical device for review or action by a user on an auxiliary device, such as a computer, a smartphone, or the like, to help facilitate the configuration or operation of various features of a medical device. As described in greater detail below, the auxiliary device identifies or otherwise determines the user's objective associated with the medical device, such as, for example, what the user wants to accomplish using the medical device, what aspect of the medical device the user has questions about, or the like. The auxiliary device also obtains, from the medical device, status information that characterizes, describes, or otherwise corresponds to a current state of a user interface of the medical device. In this regard, the user interface status information may indicate a current graphical user interface (GUI) displayed on a display of the medical device and a current selection or position of a user input element on the display. Based on the current user interface status information and the user's objective, the guidance information indicative of the user actions for accomplishing the user's objective is determined and presented or otherwise provided on a display associated with the auxiliary device for review by the user. In this regard, the user may concurrently view the guidance information for accomplishing the objective presented on the auxiliary device while interacting with the medical device in accordance with the guidance information.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In exemplary embodiments, the auxiliary device and the medical device are paired over a communications network, so that the medical device may upload, push, or otherwise transmit updated user interface status information to the auxiliary device substantially in real-time in response to a user input or other interaction with the medical device. In response to obtaining indication of the updated state of the user interface of the medical device, the guidance information presented on the auxiliary device is dynamically updated to reflect how the user input influenced the user actions for accomplishing the user's objective from the updated user interface state. Thus, as the user navigates through various menus or GUI display screens on the medical device, the guidance information on the auxiliary device may be dynamically updated substantially concurrently, allowing the user to move back and forth across displays seamlessly.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one or more embodiments, the auxiliary device also obtains operational settings or other device configuration information from the medical device to provide guidance information consistent with the current device setup or other user- or patient-specific configurations. For example, if the user's objective is to administer a bolus using the infusion device, the operational settings information obtained by the auxiliary device may indicate that a bolus wizard feature of the infusion device has not been setup, in which case the guidance information may provide instructions for how to configure or setup the bolus wizard. Conversely, when the operational settings information indicates the bolus wizard feature has been setup and is currently enabled, the guidance information may provide instructions for utilizing the bolus wizard. In this regard, for device features or modes that require specific user inputs, patient-specific parameters, or other actions before they are enabled or operable, the guidance information may instruct the user for configuring and enabling such features. At the same time, by virtue of obtaining the settings information, the provided guidance information does not pertain to device features or operating modes that the user has not enabled, configured, or otherwise activated. Thus, the user may be provided only with guidance information pertinent to both the current device configuration and the user's objective. As such, providing potentially non-pertinent or non-actionable information is avoided, which improves the user experience.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of a patient guidance system <b>100</b>.

In exemplary embodiments, the network <b>110</b> is realized as a Bluetooth network, a ZigBee network, a wireless local area network (WLAN), or another suitable personal area network or local area network (LAN). That said, in other embodiments, the infusion device <b>102</b> and the auxiliary device <b>106</b> may communicate via a direct communications interface, such as a wire, cable, infrared, or some other short range communications medium. Depending on the embodiment, the auxiliary device <b>106</b> may be realized as any sort of electronic device capable of communicating with the infusion device <b>102</b> via network <b>110</b>, such as a mobile telephone, a smartphone, a laptop or notebook computer, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, a personal digital assistant, or the like. For purposes of explanation, but without limitation, the auxiliary device <b>106</b> may alternatively be referred to herein as a client device. The client device <b>106</b> includes or is coupled to a display device, such as a monitor, screen, or another conventional electronic display, capable of graphically presenting data and/or information. The client device <b>106</b> also includes or is otherwise associated with a user input device, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, or the like, capable of receiving input data and/or other information from the user of the client device <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one or more embodiments, a user, such as the patient, the patient's doctor or another healthcare provider, or the like, manipulates the client device <b>106</b> to execute a client application <b>108</b> that communicates with the infusion device <b>102</b> via the network <b>110</b> using a networking protocol. The client application <b>108</b> supports establishing a communications session with the infusion device <b>102</b> on the network <b>110</b> and receiving data and/or information from the infusion device <b>102</b> via the communications session. In this regard, the infusion device <b>102</b> may execute or otherwise implement a corresponding application or process that supports establishing the communications session with the client application <b>108</b>. The client application <b>108</b> generally represents a software module or another feature that is generated or otherwise implemented by the client device <b>106</b> to support the processes described herein. In such embodiments, the client device <b>106</b> includes a processing system and a data storage element (or memory) capable of storing programming instructions for execution by the processing system, that, when read and executed, cause processing system to create, generate, or otherwise facilitate the client application <b>108</b> and perform or otherwise support the processes, tasks, operations, and/or functions described herein. Depending on the embodiment, the processing system may be implemented using any suitable processing system and/or device, such as, for example, one or more processors, central processing units (CPUs), controllers, microprocessors, microcontrollers, processing cores and/or other hardware computing resources configured to support the operation of the processing system described herein. Similarly, the data storage element or memory may be realized as a random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), flash memory, magnetic or optical mass storage, or any other suitable non-transitory short or long term data storage or other computer-readable media, and/or any suitable combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more embodiments, the infusion device <b>102</b> and the client device <b>106</b> establish an association (or pairing) with one another over the network <b>110</b> to support subsequently establishing a peer-to-peer communication session between the infusion device <b>102</b> and the client device <b>106</b> via the network <b>110</b>. For example, in accordance with one embodiment, the network <b>110</b> is realized as a Bluetooth network, wherein the infusion device <b>102</b> and the client device <b>106</b> are paired with one another (e.g., by obtaining and storing network identification information for one another) by performing a discovery procedure or another suitable pairing procedure. In this regard, the pairing information obtained during the discovery procedure allows either of the infusion device <b>102</b> or the client device <b>106</b> to initiate the establishment of a secure peer-to-peer communication session via the network <b>110</b>. Some examples of an infusion device pairing with a client device are described in United States Patent Application Publication Nos. 2015/0057807 and 2015/0057634, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one or more exemplary embodiments, the client application <b>108</b> is configured to store or otherwise maintain an address and/or other identification information for a remote device <b>114</b> on another network <b>112</b>. In this regard, the second network <b>112</b> may be physically and/or logically distinct from the network <b>110</b>, such as, for example, the Internet, a cellular network, a wide area network (WAN), or the like. The remote device <b>114</b> generally represents a computing device that includes or otherwise implements a support application <b>116</b> configured to receive or otherwise obtain the current user interface status information for the infusion device <b>102</b> and the current user objective from the client application <b>108</b> and present the information to another user operating the remote device <b>114</b> for analysis. For example, the remote device <b>114</b> may be utilized by customer service personnel to provide customer support in the event the patient or user of the client device <b>108</b> is having difficulty accomplishing his or her objective with respect to the infusion device <b>102</b>, as described in greater detail below in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The remote device <b>114</b> may reside at a location that is physically distinct and/or separate from the infusion device <b>102</b>, such as, for example, at a facility that is owned and/or operated by or otherwise affiliated with a manufacturer of the infusion device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a simplified representation of a patient guidance system <b>100</b> for purposes of explanation and is not intended to limit the subject matter described herein in any way. For example, in various embodiments, one or more of the devices <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>114</b> may be absent from the patient guidance system <b>100</b>. Additionally, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a single sensing arrangement <b>104</b>, in practice, embodiments of the patient guidance system <b>100</b> may include multiple different sensing arrangements, which may be configured to sense, measure, or otherwise quantify any number of conditions or characteristics. For example, multiple instances of a glucose sensing arrangement <b>104</b> may be deployed for redundancy or other purposes (e.g., averaging or other statistical operations). In other embodiments, additional sensing arrangements <b>104</b> may be deployed to measure different physiological conditions of the patient, such as, for example, the patient's heart rate, oxygen levels, or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an exemplary interactive guidance process <b>200</b> suitable for implementation by a patient guidance system to provide guidance to a patient or user to facilitate desired operation of a medical device, such as infusion device <b>102</b>. The various tasks performed in connection with the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> may be performed by hardware, firmware, software executed by processing circuitry, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following description refers to elements mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In practice, portions of the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> may be performed by different elements of the patient guidance system <b>100</b>, such as, for example, the infusion device <b>102</b>, the sensing arrangement <b>104</b>, the client device <b>106</b>, the client application <b>108</b>, the remote device <b>114</b> and/or the support application <b>116</b>. It should be appreciated that the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> may include any number of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks need not be performed in the illustrated order and/or the tasks may be performed concurrently, and/or the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not described in detail herein. Moreover, one or more of the tasks shown and described in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> could be omitted from a practical embodiment of the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> as long as the intended overall functionality remains intact.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The interactive guidance process <b>200</b> begins by determining or otherwise identifying an objective associated with operation of the medical device (task <b>202</b>). In this regard, the client application <b>108</b> identifies what the patient or user of the client device <b>106</b> is trying to accomplish or achieve using the infusion device <b>102</b> or what feature or aspect of the infusion device <b>102</b> is of interest to the patient. For example, the client application <b>108</b> may generate or otherwise provide a GUI display that allows the patient to select, input, or otherwise indicate what the patient's objective is. In one embodiment, the client application <b>108</b> generates a list of selectable GUI elements, where each of the GUI elements corresponds to a different objective, as described in greater detail below in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other embodiments, the client application <b>108</b> may determine what the patient's objective is based on the current state of the infusion device <b>102</b>. For example, when the patient manipulates the client device <b>106</b> to initiate or open the client application <b>108</b>, the client application <b>108</b> may establish a communications session with the infusion device <b>102</b> via the network <b>110</b>, obtain information characterizing the current device state from the infusion device <b>102</b> via the network <b>110</b>, and then determine a likely patient objective based on the current device state. In this regard, if there is an active alert or notification presented to generated by the infusion device <b>102</b>, the client application <b>108</b> may determine the patient's objective is to resolve or understand the current alert or notification. As another example, if the delivery of fluid by the infusion device <b>102</b> is suspended, the client application <b>108</b> may determine the patient's objective is to enable or resume delivery. It should be noted that are numerous different potential device statuses and corresponding objectives that may be determined based thereon, and the subject matter described herein is not limited to any particular example described herein.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other embodiments, the client application <b>108</b> may determine what the patient's objective is based on a GUI element selected within the client application <b>108</b>. For example, the client application <b>108</b> may include a selectable GUI element for activating a help feature, and thereby indicate a patient objective indicative of a desire to obtain explanatory information or other help understanding the GUI display currently presented by the infusion device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The interactive guidance process <b>200</b> continues by obtaining status information indicative of the current state of the display on the medical device, the current state of the user input element(s) associated with the medical device, and the current operational settings or configuration of the medical device (tasks <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>). In this regard, the client application <b>108</b> receives or otherwise obtains, from the infusion device <b>102</b> via the network <b>110</b>, information or data that indicates, identifies, or otherwise describes the current screen, menu, or other GUI display presented on the infusion device <b>102</b>. The client application <b>108</b> also receives or obtains information that indicates or identifies the state of a user input selection (or a mouse, icon, or other graphical representation thereof) on the screen, menu, or other GUI display presented on the infusion device <b>102</b>. The client application <b>108</b> may also obtain information pertaining to preceding user inputs or the sequence of user input selections made prior to performing the interactive guidance process <b>200</b>. Additionally, the client application <b>108</b> obtains settings or configuration data stored or otherwise maintained onboard the infusion device <b>102</b> pertaining to the various modes, features, or other patient-specific or patient-configurable operations supported by the infusion device <b>102</b>. In this regard, the current device settings information may indicate the modes or features supported by the infusion device <b>102</b> that have been enabled, activated, or configured, which modes or features supported by the infusion device <b>102</b> that have been disabled or deactivated, which patient-specific control parameters, variables, or other patient settings for which values have been defined, entered or otherwise provided, and which patient-specific control parameters, variables, or other patient settings for which no values are maintained by the infusion device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Based on the user's objective, the current user interface status, and the current device settings, the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> generates or otherwise provides a guidance GUI display on the auxiliary device that indicates or otherwise explains how the user can achieve the objective given the current user interface status and the current device settings (task <b>210</b>). For example, the guidance GUI display on the client device <b>106</b> may provide one or more instructions or actions that the user can take from the current GUI display on the infusion device <b>102</b> given the current state of the user input(s) associated with the infusion device <b>102</b> and the current infusion device settings. In this regard, the guidance information provided by the application <b>108</b> on the client device <b>106</b> is consistent with (or context-sensitive to) both the current infusion device operational settings and the current patient-specific settings maintained by the infusion device <b>102</b>, while also being context-sensitive with respect to the user interfaces of the infusion device <b>102</b> to reflect the current GUI display on the infusion device <b>102</b> and current state of user interaction with respect to that GUI display on the infusion device <b>102</b>. In other words, the guidance information is not incompatible or inconsistent with current settings maintained by the infusion device <b>102</b>, and is also not incompatible or inconsistent with the current user interface status of the infusion device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After initially providing guidance information, the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> continues by monitoring or otherwise waiting for changes in the user interface state of the medical device, an in response to a change in the user interface state, the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> receives or otherwise obtains updated user interface status information from the medical device and dynamically updates the guidance information to reflect the change in user interface state (tasks <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>). In this regard, as the patient or other user interacts with the user interface element(s) associated with the infusion device <b>102</b> to navigate through or change the GUI display presented on the infusion device <b>102</b>, the corresponding updated status information characterizing the state or location of the user input element(s) associated with the infusion device <b>102</b> as well as the current display state of the infusion device <b>102</b> is automatically provided to the client application <b>108</b>. For example, in one embodiment, a process or application on the infusion device <b>102</b> that supports the communication session with the client application <b>108</b> automatically pushes updated user interface status information to the client application <b>108</b> whenever a new user input is received or whenever the GUI display on the infusion device <b>102</b> changes. Thus, the client application <b>108</b> automatically obtains the updated user interface status information substantially in real-time and dynamically refreshes or updates the GUI display on the client device <b>106</b> to reflect the current situation on the infusion device <b>102</b>, for example, by providing updated instructions or actions that the user can take to achieve the original objective (e.g., task <b>202</b>) from the updated GUI display on the infusion device <b>102</b> in response to intervening user input(s) associated with the infusion device <b>102</b> after the preceding guidance GUI display was originally provided.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In exemplary embodiments, as described in greater detail below in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the loop defined by tasks <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> repeats to dynamically update the guidance GUI display on the client device <b>106</b> substantially in real-time as the patient or user interacts with the infusion device <b>102</b> until the original objective is accomplished. In this regard, once the application <b>108</b> determines that the updated user interface status corresponds to the user objective being accomplished (e.g., when the user has performed all the actions or instructions provided by the guidance GUI display and the display on the infusion device <b>102</b> corresponds to the intended destination GUI display at the end of the sequence of instructed user actions), the client application <b>108</b> may update the GUI display on the client device <b>106</b> to reflect the objective being achieved or to revert back to a default or initial GUI display associated with the client application <b>108</b> (e.g., a home page or other landing page).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in accordance with one or more embodiments, the interactive guidance process <b>200</b> may identify or otherwise determine when remote assistance or other supplementary feedback is desired by the user, and in response, transmits, uploads, or otherwise provides the user objective and status information to a remote device for analysis (tasks <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>). For example, the guidance GUI display provided by the client application <b>108</b> on the client device <b>106</b> may include a GUI element that is selectable or otherwise manipulable to initiate a customer support communications session with a customer support application <b>118</b> on a remote device <b>114</b>.

In certain embodiments, the infused fluid is insulin, although many other fluids may be administered through infusion such as, but not limited to, HIV drugs, drugs to treat pulmonary hypertension, iron chelation drugs, pain medications, anti-cancer treatments, medications, vitamins, hormones, or the like. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, the reservoir <b>1205</b> typically includes a reservoir barrel <b>1219</b> that contains the fluid and is concentrically and/or coaxially aligned with the slide <b>1206</b> (e.g., in the axial direction <b>1218</b>) when the reservoir <b>1205</b> is inserted into the infusion pump <b>1200</b>.

As described above, the fitting <b>1223</b> extends from (or through) the opening <b>1220</b> of the housing <b>1202</b> and mates with tubing <b>1221</b> to establish fluid communication from the interior of the reservoir <b>1205</b> (e.g., reservoir barrel <b>1219</b>) to the user via the tubing <b>1221</b> and infusion set <b>1225</b>. The opposing end of the reservoir <b>1205</b> proximate the slide <b>1206</b> includes a plunger <b>1217</b> (or stopper) positioned to push fluid from inside the barrel <b>1219</b> of the reservoir <b>1205</b> along a fluid path through tubing <b>1221</b> to a user. The slide <b>1206</b> is configured to mechanically couple or otherwise engage with the plunger <b>1217</b>, thereby becoming seated with the plunger <b>1217</b> and/or reservoir <b>1205</b>. Fluid is forced from the reservoir <b>1205</b> via tubing <b>1221</b> as the drive system <b>1208</b> is operated to displace the slide <b>1206</b> in the axial direction <b>1218</b> toward the opening <b>1220</b> in the housing <b>1202</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, the drive system <b>1208</b> includes a motor assembly <b>1207</b> and a drive screw <b>1209</b>. The motor assembly <b>1207</b> includes a motor that is coupled to drive train components of the drive system <b>1208</b> that are configured to convert rotational motor motion to a translational displacement of the slide <b>1206</b> in the axial direction <b>1218</b>, and thereby engaging and displacing the plunger <b>1217</b> of the reservoir <b>1205</b> in the axial direction <b>1218</b>. In some embodiments, the motor assembly <b>1207</b> may also be powered to translate the slide <b>1206</b> in the opposing direction (e.g., the direction opposite direction <b>1218</b>) to retract and/or detach from the reservoir <b>1205</b> to allow the reservoir <b>1205</b> to be replaced. In exemplary embodiments, the motor assembly <b>1207</b> includes a brushless DC (BLDC) motor having one or more permanent magnets mounted, affixed, or otherwise disposed on its rotor.

When the motor assembly <b>1207</b> is powered and operated, the drive screw <b>1209</b> rotates, and the slide <b>1206</b> is forced to translate in the axial direction <b>1218</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the infusion pump <b>1200</b> includes a sleeve <b>1211</b> to prevent the slide <b>1206</b> from rotating when the drive screw <b>1209</b> of the drive system <b>1208</b> rotates. Thus, rotation of the drive screw <b>1209</b> causes the slide <b>1206</b> to extend or retract relative to the drive motor assembly <b>1207</b>. When the fluid infusion device is assembled and operational, the slide <b>1206</b> contacts the plunger <b>1217</b> to engage the reservoir <b>1205</b> and control delivery of fluid from the infusion pump <b>1200</b>.
