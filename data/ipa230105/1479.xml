A bladed wheel can be a is fixed wheel or be driven in rotation. A bladed turbine wheel is a bladed wheel which is located downstream of a combustion chamber of the turbomachine,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The bladed wheel can be a bladed wheel of a high-pressure turbine that is to say of the turbine located directly downstream of the combustion chamber, or a bladed wheel of a low-pressure turbine that is to say of the turbine located downstream of the high-pressure turbine.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The turbomachine is an aircraft turbomachine, such as for example an airplane turbomachine, or for example a helicopter turbomachine.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a method for manufacturing a bladed wheel of a turbomachine, and in particular a bladed wheel of a turbine, comprises the following steps:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">E<b>1</b>: an insert <b>1</b> made of metal matrix composite (MMC) is manufactured by winding ceramic fibers which are surrounded by a material constituting the matrix around a mandrel <b>2</b>. The insert <b>1</b> thus manufactured has an annular shape, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">E<b>2</b>: a Spark Plasma Sintering is carried out with the insert <b>1</b> and powder of metal constituting the bladed wheel to be manufactured. The spark plasma sintering is carried out by compacting the metal powder and the insert <b>1</b> and by applying an electric current which passes through the metal powder and the insert <b>1</b>. The spark plasma sintering offers the advantage of being fast, the duration of the spark plasma sintering is in particular less than 15 minutes, which limits the risk of destabilization of the metallurgical structures of the different alloys. Thus, compared to hot isostatic compaction, the risk of damage to the ceramic fibers by the formation of embrittling phases is lower.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Several variants are possible to implement the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In particular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, the insert <b>1</b> can first be consolidated so that said insert <b>1</b> can be handled without risk of deformation, then be completely densified in order to form the bladed wheel to be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, according to one possible variant, the method comprises the following steps:</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">E<b>1</b>: the MMC insert <b>1</b> is manufactured by winding the ceramic fibers surrounded by is a material constituting the matrix around the mandrel <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">E<b>2</b> : the insert <b>1</b> is consolidated while remaining on the mandrel <b>2</b> by spark plasma sintering of the insert <b>1</b> with a first powder P<b>1</b> of metal constituting the bladed wheel to be manufactured. The first metal powder P<b>1</b> is added after the winding of the insert <b>1</b>. Step E<b>20</b> is implemented by a winding and spark plasma sintering system S which comprises on the one hand the mandrel <b>2</b> on which the different fibers of the insert <b>1</b> are wound, and on the other hand a spark plasma sintering device <b>3</b> which is configured to carry out a spark plasma sintering of the insert <b>1</b> with the first metal powder P<b>1</b> directly on the mandrel <b>2</b>. The spark plasma sintering device <b>3</b> is in particular configured to compress the insert <b>1</b> and the first metal powder P<b>1</b> on the mandrel <b>2</b>, and to inject an electric current allowing the sintering of the powder, The spark plasma sintering of the step E<b>20</b> of consolidating the insert <b>1</b> is carried out so that the insert <b>1</b> can be handled while retaining its shape without the assistance of holding tools. The spark plasma sintering of step E<b>20</b> can in particular be configured so that the insert <b>1</b> reaches a compaction rate comprised between 60% and 80%. The degree of compaction of the insert <b>1</b> is in particular a function of the pressure applied during the spark plasma sintering, of the duration of the spark plasma sintering, of the intensity of the current applied during the spark plasma sintering, as well as of the amount of first powder P<b>1</b> used. Such a compaction rate allows handling of the part without risk of damage, and also allows reducing the duration of step E<b>20</b>, The compaction rate corresponds to the inverse of the porosity rate, a compaction rate of 80% corresponding to a porosity rate of 20%. By porosity rate it is meant here the volume of the porosities divided by the total volume of the part.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">E<b>3</b>: the consolidated insert <b>1</b> is removed from the mandrel <b>2</b> and is placed in a mold <b>4</b>.

The mold <b>4</b> has the shape of the bladed wheel to be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">E<b>4</b>: the bladed wheel is manufactured by densifying the insert <b>1</b> by spark plasma sintering of said insert <b>1</b> with the second metal powder P<b>2</b> in the mold <b>4</b>. The spark plasma sintering of step E<b>4</b> allows limiting the risk of appearance of embrittling phases, At the end of the densification step E<b>4</b>, the insert <b>4</b> has a compaction rate greater than 95%, and preferably greater than 99%.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At the end of the densification step E<b>4</b>, a turbomachine bladed wheel formed by a MMC fibrous insert <b>1</b> which is embedded in metal is obtained.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to one possible variant that allows creating a multi-material around the insert <b>1</b>, the first metal powder P<b>1</b> and the second metal powder P<b>2</b> are different, The two powders can for example be different by using two alloys with different shades. This variant can in particular allow adapting the mechanical characteristics of the bladed wheel to be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to another possible variant that allows obtaining a more homogeneous bladed wheel, the first metal powder P<b>1</b> and the second metal powder P<b>2</b> are identical.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As indicated above, the ceramic fibers of the insert <b>1</b> are surrounded by a layer made of material constituting the metal matrix of said insert <b>1</b>.
