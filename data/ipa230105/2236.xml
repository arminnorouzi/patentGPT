In the Siemens method, first, a silicon core wire placed inside a bell-jar type reactor is heated to silicon deposition temperature by passing current through the silicon core wire. In this state, for example, trichlorosilane (SiHCl<sub>3</sub>) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) are fed into the reactor, so that polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the silicon core wire. As a result, polycrystalline silicon in the form of a rod is obtained.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature 1 discloses a reactor which includes a feed gas system and an offgas system. One or each of the feed gas system and the offgas system has an opening or meshes, and includes at least one protective element. The protective element is provided so as to prevent polycrystalline silicon shards from falling into the opening for feed gas and the opening for offgas and blocking gas conduits or gas distributors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">[Patent Literature 1]</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Published Japanese Translation of PCT International Application Tokuhyo No. 2018-530511</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, adhesion of impurities originating from a material used for pipes and/or the like may occur in a feed channel for feeding a raw material gas into the reactor.

In consideration of economic efficiency, the filter <b>30</b> is preferably made of stainless steel which contains not less than 10% of Ni, and more desirably made of SUS316L.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first end <b>31</b> is provided on a downstream side of the feed channel, and the second end <b>32</b> is provided on an upstream side of the feed channel. The filter <b>30</b> has a structure in which the first end <b>31</b> is provided on a side opposite to the second end <b>32</b>. The first end <b>31</b> of the filter <b>30</b> is fixed to a connecting member CN<b>1</b> which is attached to the inflow port <b>111</b>. To one end of the connecting member CN<b>1</b>, the filter <b>30</b> is fixed. To the other end of the connecting member CN<b>1</b>, the feed nozzle <b>40</b> is attached.

In addition to the heating, a sufficiently purified mixed gas of trichlorosilane and hydrogen was caused to flow into the feed pipe <b>20</b> and was fed into the reactor <b>10</b>. This lead to deposition of polycrystalline silicon on the each silicon core wire (having an 8-mm square cross section).

Specifically, the sample for measurement, which was a target of measurement, was dissolved in a fluonitric acid mixed solution, and a resultant solution in which the sample was dissolved was analyzed for respective amounts of metal elements of Cr, Fe, and Ni, by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For each of the above samples for measurement, an average value of analysis values of 10 polycrystalline silicon rods was obtained as a metal concentration in each of the above portions of the polycrystalline silicon rods. Table 1 below shows the metal concentration in each of the portions, as a result of the present Example.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Cr [pptw]</entry><entry>Fe [pptw]</entry><entry>Ni [pptw]</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Core wire</entry><entry>9</entry><entry>29</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>portion</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Intermediate</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>19</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>portion</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Outer skin</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>portion</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Comparative Example</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0090">In Comparative Example, except that no filter <b>30</b>A was provided in the feed pipe <b>20</b>, polycrystalline silicon rods were produced as in the above-described Example.
