The conventional hydraulic block includes a cylinder hole, in which a piston is situated axially shiftable. The piston is shiftable in the cylinder hole with the aid of an electric motor and a threaded drive having a spindle. By shifting the piston in the cylinder hole, it is possible to push away brake fluid from the cylinder hole and to generate a hydraulic brake pressure. By moving the piston in the cylinder hole back and forth, the brake pressure may be raised and lowered, i.e., it is possible to control or regulate the pressure.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a hydraulic block including a power brake pressure generator for a hydraulic vehicle braking system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The hydraulic block according to the present invention includes a power brake pressure generator. In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, the hydraulic block includes a cylinder hole, which is open on one side of the hydraulic block and in which a piston is situated axially shiftable. By shifting the piston in the cylinder hole, it is possible to push away brake fluid from the cylinder hole and to generate a hydraulic brake pressure. By moving the piston in the cylinder hole back and forth, the brake pressure may be raised and lowered, i.e., it is possible to regulate, which is also understood to mean to control, the brake pressure by moving the piston in the cylinder hole back and forth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For the purpose of shifting the piston in the cylinder hole, the power brake pressure generator includes a threaded drive that converts a rotary driving motion into a shift and shifts the piston in the cylinder hole in a rotary drive. The threaded drive, technically speaking a rotatably drivable driving part of the threaded drive, is pivotable at the hydraulic block via a pivot bearing. The driving part is, for example, a nut or a spindle that shifts the spindle or nut and with it the piston in a rotary drive.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cylinder hole in the hydraulic block, the piston that is shiftable in the cylinder hole, the threaded drive including the pivot bearing, and potentially a drive motor for a rotary drive of the threaded drive form the power brake pressure generator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of a return stroke of the piston, during which the piston increases a volume enclosed by it in the cylinder hole and aspirates brake fluid, a negative pressure may form in the cylinder hole that results in a force on the piston that is directed into the cylinder hole. To brace against such a force directed into the cylinder hole, the present invention provides an annular step in the hydraulic block at an orifice at an open side of the cylinder hole, at whose base the pivot bearing of the threaded drive is axially supported. It is possible to support the pivot bearing directly at the base of the annular step at the orifice of the cylinder hole or indirectly via a tubular pivot bearing holder, for example. A caulking or, generally speaking, a plastic deformation of the material of the hydraulic block that surrounds the orifice of the cylinder hole holds the pivot bearing at the hydraulic block. Here, it also applies that the plastically deformed material of the hydraulic block holds the pivot bearing directly or indirectly, for example via the pivot bearing holder, at the hydraulic block.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The plastically deformed material of the hydraulic block preferably holds the pivot bearing in a form-locked manner. For this purpose, the pivot bearing or the pivot bearing holder, at which the pivot bearing is fastened, has an undercut that engages from above or behind with the plastically deformed material of the hydraulic block and thus holds the pivot bearing at the hydraulic block. The undercut is a surface at the pivot bearing or at the pivot bearing holder facing away from the hydraulic block.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Refinements and advantageous embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">All features provided in the description and the figures may be implemented individually on their own or in general in any arbitrary combination in the specific embodiments of the present invention.
