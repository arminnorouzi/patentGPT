screening, treatment, monitoring and/or assessment of visual impairments, comprising electronic means for simultaneously applying two separate and unrelated processing methods to images presented to a patient's eyes: a first processing method being applied to an non-amblyopic eye (the eye with the better vision), and a second processing method being applied to an amblyopic eye (the weaker eye, or the impaired eye). A method for screening, treatment, monitoring and/or assessment of visual impairments, comprising: a. defining a starting point, wherein differences between a patient's eyes are completely, or as closely as practically possible, corrected, to enable two identical or similar images to be transferred to the brain from the patient's eyes; b. defining an ending point, wherein there is no correction applied to any of the patient's eyes; c. defining a screening, treatment, monitoring and/or assessment plan, for initially applying correction to images according to the starting point, then gradually reducing the correction, at a controlled and predetermined rate, towards the ending point; and d. applying the plan to images presented to the patient's eyes, while monitoring patient's performance.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="104.65mm" wi="108.71mm" file="US20230000345A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded

It affects visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and depth perception and, if not timely treated properly, might result permanent reduction of visual capacity of the amblyopic eye. Amblyopia is clinically important because it prevents the visual apparatus from developing normally and it is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and young children; About 4% of children and 2% of adults suffer from amblyopia.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In healthy individuals, two slightly different images are transferred from both eyes to the brain which fuses these two images into a composite, single, 3-dimensional image.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sometimes, however, the image arriving from one eye significantly differs from that arriving from the other eye. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as the eyes not being parallel (strabismus), one eye being more far or short sighted than the other (anisometropia), or diseases that create abnormal images in an eye of a child (such as a cataract or other media opacity). Such conditions in adults lead to double or blurry vision. However, the child's brain can avoid such disturbing sensation by disregarding the image from one eye. If this condition is not successfully treated during childhood, the person will become permanently amblyopic, i.e. the brain ignores the image from the amblyopic eye and this eye will have poorer vision then the other one. Normally there is no spontaneous improvement in the vision of the amblyopic eye and in about half of the cases there is deterioration after diagnosis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Stereoscopic vision will not develop properly or not at all in amblyopic people, even if successfully treated on time; they are incapable of precise stereoscopic vision and consequently of depth perception. Amblyopic people are thus limited in their career choice in addition to being worried about having only one fully functional eye, more liable to lose the seeing eye and suffering more commonly from a variety of psychological conditions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">It was found in a survey of adult amblyopes (without strabismus) that they felt that the diseases interfered with school (52%), interfered with their work (48%), affected their lifestyle (50%), affected their sport participation (40%) and influenced their career choice (36%). These patients were found to have a significantly greater degree than normal of somatization, obsessive-compulsive behavior, excessive interpersonal sensitivity and anxiety.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Convergence Insufficiency (CI)</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Convergence insufficiency is a common near vision problem that interferes with a person's ability to see, read, learn, and work at near distances.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Signs and symptoms occur while the child is reading or engaged in other near field activities and may include eyestrain, headaches, difficulty reading, double vision, difficulty concentrating, squinting or closing one eye.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Children with CI have more symptoms and show worse attention when reading than children without CI. This might make parents or teachers suspect that a child has a learning disability, instead of an eye disorder.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">The problem exists in adults as well, especially the people who spend a considerable time looking at near objects such as computer screens.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Other Ailments</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0012">Many other eyes' deficiencies exist such as visual acuity decrements, strabismus (either tropia and phoria), stereopsis acuity, color blindness and various eye dynamics ailments. They effect many children and if not treated early in life, become incurable.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Current Amblyopia Treatments</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Amblyopia is treated by forcing the use of the amblyopic eye by preventing the non-amblyopic eye from seeing or reducing the quality of vision in that eye. Treatment of amblyopia is effective only in children up to the age of nine or younger. There are several ways, or combinations thereof, to perform the treatment detailed below.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Occluding the Dominant Eye by Patching, Electronic Shutters, Blurred Lens, Etc.</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0014">Occlusion of the dominant eye (good eye) is a long-established method and produces positive results in many cases, but only when there is a good compliance with the treatment. However, patching has many drawbacks, mainly the impaired visual functions engendered by covering the better-seeing eye in children, as well as the social and emotional problems related to wearing an unsightly eye-patch. As a result of all these factors, compliance with eye patching is limited and many children reach the critical age of nine with reduced vision in the affected eye that is considered to be incurable.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Furthermore, since the patching method stimulate alternately only one eye at a time, the stereopsis process in the visual cortex is not challenged and therefor deteriorates or no developing at the first place, disabling the patient from 3-dimention perception even if good visual acuity is attained in both eyes separately.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">In addition, a child suffering from strabismic amblyopia will be referred to a strabismus surgery. However, since eyes are not used to work together, even after the surgery the tendency of the eyes to move synchronously is weak, and the eyes might misalign again even if the surgery was a successful one and patching therapy was practiced prior to the surgery.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Atropine Penalization</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Atropine is instilled into the non-amblyopic eye and causes pupillary dilation and reduced accommodation subsequently forcing the amblyopic eye to be used for near-vision tasks. This treatment can cause reverse amblyopia. Further disadvantages are the pupillary dilatation in the treated eye causing light sensitivity, lack of development of stereopsis and irregular compliance.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Correction of Refractive Errors</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0018">This method is used for corrections of anisometropic amblyopia by equalizing the size and sharpness of the images on both eyes. This therapy can't be used to treat strabismic amblyopia and is effective only if undertaken in time. The latter is problematic, since, unlike strabismus, there are no apparent symptoms of the condition.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Dichoptic Eyes Stimulation</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0019">This method was introduced in recent years and provide different images to both eyes, introducing a better image quality for the amblyopic eye while providing a degraded image for the fellow eye.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The pictures are presented either on 3D PC monitors or on head-mounted displays.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">However, this method does not ensure the simultaneous and accurate foveal stimulation for strabismic patient, especially when the deviation angle between the two eyes is not constant for different gazing angles. Furthermore, it's nearly impossible to calibrate the apparatus to compensate for heterophoria.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Perceptual Learning</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0022">Perceptual learning&#x2014;a process by which the ability of sensory apparatuss to respond to stimuli is improved through experience. Perceptual learning occurs through sensory interaction with the environment as well as through practice in performing specific sensory tasks. The changes that take place in sensory and perceptual apparatuss as a result of perceptual learning occur at the levels of behavior and physiology. Perceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an organism's perceptual apparatus that improve its ability to respond to its environment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">Studies showed that perceptual learning provide an important method for treating amblyopia. Practicing a visual task results in a long-lasting improvement in performance in an amblyopic eye. The improvement is generally strongest for the trained eye, task, stimulus and orientation, but appears to have a broader spatial frequency bandwidth than in normal vision. Importantly, practicing on a variety of different tasks and stimuli seems to transfer to improve visual acuity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">One major drawback of the methods above is that the eyes are stimulated one at a time thus providing the brain with monocular images and preventing to exercise the stereopsis process performed in the visual cortex of the brain. Thus, depth perception is degenerated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">The success rate in childhood amblyopia treatment is about 50% [reaching vision better than 6/9 (20/30)] and is better in anisometropic than in strabismic amblyopia. This is the only amblyopia treatment which is at least partially successful in adults. However, it requires long duration of repeated perceptual training and thus is limited by low compliance which causes it not to become a regular amblyopia treatment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">Treatment of the amblyopia should always be combined with treatment of its cause, i.e. surgery for the strabismus, optical correction for the anisometropia and removal of the causes of unequal vision. Even when successful treatment took place during the critical period in children under nine years of age, the results are not permanent and about half of the patients deteriorate and may require maintenance therapy. Furthermore, deterioration of the surgically corrected strabismus often occurs as there is no stereoscopic vision which helps to keep the optical axes aligned.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">As a consequence of the relative ineffectiveness of the present-day treatment of childhood amblyopia and the difficulty of diagnosing the disease when it is still treatable, 2% to 4% of the adult population in all countries is amblyopic.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">Amblyopia is considered untreatable in people older than 9 years. However, recent studies suggest that adult amblyopia is treatable&#x2014;as can be learned from the success of perceptual learning, proving that the neural pathways, presumed lost for the amblyopic eye can be used for treatment in adults. This modality involves continuous tedious ocular exercises and is therefore rather impractical.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Prior Art Convergence Insufficiency Treatment</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0028">Treatments range from passive prism lenses to active office-based vision therapy. Scientific research by the National Eye Institute has proven that office-based vision therapy is the most successful treatment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">Home-based pencil pushups therapy appears to be the most commonly prescribed treatment, but scientific studies have shown that this treatment is ineffective.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">Even though these methods are quite simple, the requirement of occasional visit at the doctor's office is cumbersome while the home base pencil pushups therapy is boring for the child and have a low compliance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">In addition, in both methods, real time monitoring of the progress of the child to track the stimulus does not exist, therefore feedback for the therapist and parents is unavailable nor a real time feedback for the child that might stimulate him to improve his exercises.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Prior Art Eyes' Monitoring And Assessment Methods</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0032">Current approaches are performed by specialists&#x2014;either ophthalmologists, orthoptists or optometrists and require procedures that are time consuming and expensive.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">Visual acuity, strabismus and heterophoria, stereopsis depth and eyes' dynamic tests are standard and routine tests. However, they require patient cooperation which is difficult or even impossible to perform on toddlers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">Those tests are important factors in providing the ability to detect amblyopia (and other malfunctions of the eye) and to assess the progress in the amblyopia treatment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">These and other problems in prior art methods and apparatu for Screening, Diagnosing, Assessing, Monitoring and Treating Eye Diseases and Visual Impairments Using Eye Tracking are addressed with the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0036">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for Screening, Diagnosing, Assessing, Monitoring and Treating Eye Diseases and Visual Impairments, such as amblyopia and strabismus.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000">The main features and benefits of the present invention are:<br/>1. An apparatus for measuring and/or treating a vision-related disease, using two separate and unrelated processing methods being simultaneously applied to the patient's eyes.<br/>For example, the image presented to each of patient's two eyes undergoes a different processing:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">a. For the non-amblyopic eye, the processing includes an area with a controlled measure of image degradation, to cause the patient to rely more on the other, weaker eye; furthermore, the location of the degraded area is moved on the screen responsive to the measured direction of the line of sight of the non-amblyopic eye;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0038">b. For the amblyopic eye, the processing includes changing the image so as to present identical, real 3D disparity or as similar as possible images to the two eyes, to allow combining the images in the brain.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0000">Processing may include a movement of the image vertically and/or horizontally, changing the magnification of the image (zoom in or zoom out), and/or rotation of the image.<br/>The processing is responsive to the measured direction of the line of sight of the amblyopic eye-<br/>That is, as the line of sight moves vertically and/or horizontally and/or torsionally, so the presented image on the screen is moved as well.<br/>2. &#x201c;On the go&#x201d; real time treatment. The patient can receive treatment as he works, walk, during recreation, etc. The patient wears goggles with means for capturing real-time images, a processor for processing the image to one eye or both according to predefined settings adapted to that patient's ilness, and display means for presenting the processed image(s) to the patient's eye(s). This embodiment may save patient's time, and is easier to perform. Rather than visiting a clinic, waiting and receiving treatment, the patient receives treatment while he/she is doing other tasks.<br/>3. Using true tri-dimensional (3D) images for measurement and treatment. True 3D images best stimulate the brain to combine the images, so the patient perceives the depth of each object in space&#x2014;an essential benefit, which people with normal healthy vision may fail to fully appreciate.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">Presenting exact identical images to both eyes will preserve binocular vision, however, stereopsis (3D process) in the cortex will not be challenged and 3D perception will not be enhanced. 3D perception is a precious and frangible skill, which can be easily lost when there are vision problems.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0000">The present invention uses an innovative concept to achieve this benefit, including:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0040">a. Using true 3D images, that is images generated from two cameras, separately located so they will &#x201c;see&#x201d; the world just like two normal eyes, which are separately located, would see the world. The images from the two cameras are not identical but contain some tiny differences; these differences are used by the brain to reconstruct and perceive the 3D scene.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0041">b. Correcting the defects of the weak eye by processing the image presented thereto, so the brain will perceive identical, or as close to identical as possible, images from the two eyes; this allows the brain to combine the two images into one object. A digital processor is used to change the image to one eye by moving of the image vertically and/or horizontally, changing the magnification of the image (zoom in or zoom out), and/or rotating the image.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0000">c. Challenging/stimulating the patient to rely more on the weaker eye, by a controlled degradation of the image presented to the stronger (better vision) eye.<br/>4. The above main features (1-3) can be combined in many variations, and the parameters of the digital processing may be adjusted so as to best fit the visual problems of each patient.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0042">The apparatus in the present invention is modular and flexible; it is software-controlled, to achieve a very powerful and useful apparatus for Screening, Diagnosing, Assessing, Monitoring and Treating Eye Diseases and Visual Impairments.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Notes:</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0043">1. It is essential to distinguish between<br/>(a) Using true tri-dimensional (3D) images for measurement and treatment, on the one hand, and<br/>(b) 3D display devices, such as 3D monitors, 3D glasses, etc.<br/>The feature (a) is an essential part of the present invention, and relates to 3D images creation, separate processing for each eye and separate display to each eye;<br/>Whereas (b) relates to prior art equipment for presenting separate images to each eye.<br/>The present invention uses 3D devices (b) to present a different, separate image to each eye; but this is just one component of the apparatus and method presented in (a).<br/>2.

For the non-amblyopic eye, the processing includes an area with a controlled measure of image degradation, to cause the patient to rely more on the other, weaker eye; furthermore, the location of the degraded area is moved on the screen responsive to the measured direction of the line of sight of the non-amblyopic eye;<br/>b. For the amblyopic eye, the processing includes changing the image so as to present identical or as similar as possible images to the two eyes, to allow combining the images in the brain.<br/>Processing may include a movement of the image vertically and/or horizontally, changing the magnification of the image (zoom in or zoom out), and/or rotation of the image.<br/>The processing is responsive to the measured direction of the line of sight of the amblyopic eye-<br/>That is, as the line of sight moves vertically and/or horizontally, so the presented image on the screen is moved as well.<br/>Gradual image degradation: for the non-amblyopic eye, the measure of image degradation needs not be uniform in the area with image degradation; preferably, the degradation is stronger in the center of that area, and is gradually reduced toward the edges of the area, to provide a smooth transition.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="2">&#x201c;On the Go&#x201d; Real Time Treatment</heading><p id="p-0151" num="0173">The patient can receive treatment as he works, during recreation, etc. The patient wears goggles with means for capturing real-time images, a processor for processing the image to one eye or both according to predefined settings adapted to that patient's ilness, and display means for presenting the processed image(s) to the patient's eye(s). This embodiment may save patient's time, and is easier to perform. Rather than visiting a clinic, waiting and receiving treatment, the patient receives treatment while he/she is doing other tasks.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="2">Using True Tri-Dimensional (3D) Images for Measurement and Treatment</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0174">True 3D images best stimulate the brain to combine the images, so the patient perceives the depth of each object in space&#x2014;an essential benefit, which people with normal healthy vision may fail to fully appreciate. 3D perception is a precious and frangible skill, which can be easily lost when there are vision problems.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0000">The present invention uses an innovative concept to achieve this benefit, including:<br/>a. Using true 3D images, that is images generated from two cameras, separately located so they will &#x201c;see&#x201d; the world just like two normal eyes, which are separately located, would see the world. The images from the two cameras are not identical but contain some tiny differences; these differences are used by the brain to reconstruct the 3D scene.<br/>b. Correcting the defects of the weak eye by processing the image presented thereto, so the brain will perceive identical, or as close to identical as possible, images from the two eyes; this allows the brain to combine the two images into one 3D object.<br/>A digital processor is used to change the image to one eye by moving of the image vertically and/or horizontally, changing the magnification of the image (zoom in or zoom out), and/or rotating the image.<br/>c. Challenging/stimulating the patient to rely more on the weaker eye, by a controlled degradation of the image presented to the stronger (better vision) eye.<br/>Adaptive Method for Screening, Treatment, Monitoring and/or Assessment of Visual Impairments<br/>The method includes:</p><p id="p-0154" num="0175">a. defining a starting point, wherein differences between a patient's eyes are completely, or as closely as practically possible, corrected, to enable two identical or similar images to be transferred to the brain from the patient's eyes;</p><p id="p-0155" num="0176">b. defining an ending point, wherein there is no correction applied to any of the patient's eyes;</p><p id="p-0156" num="0177">c. defining a screening, treatment, monitoring and/or assessment plan, for initially applying correction to images according to the starting point, then gradually reducing the correction, at a controlled and predetermined rate, towards the ending point; and</p><p id="p-0157" num="0178">d. applying the plan to images presented to the patient's eyes, while monitoring patient's performance;</p><p id="p-0158" num="0179">e. adjusting the rate of change of the correction responsive to results of monitoring the patient's performance;</p><p id="p-0159" num="0180">f. defining a range of desired rate of improvement with minima and maxima, during monitoring comparing actual patient's performance with the desired rate of improvement, and issuing a report or a warning if the actual performance exceeds the range of desired rate of improvement.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">The Above Method can be Applied to any of the Embodiments of the Apparatus Disclosed in the Present Invention.</heading><heading id="h-0031" level="2">Combining the Above Main Features in Many Variations, and Adjusting the Parameters of the Digital Processing, so as to Best Fit the Visual Problems of Each Patient</heading><p id="p-0160" num="0181">The apparatus in the present invention is modular and flexible; it is software-controlled, to achieve a very powerful and useful apparatus for Screening, Diagnosing, Assessing, Monitoring and Treating Eye Diseases and Visual Impairments.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="2">Notes:</heading><p id="p-0161" num="0182">1.

Because the eyes of humans are located at different lateral positions on the head, binocular vision results in two slightly different images projected to the retinas of the eyes. The differences are mainly in the relative horizontal position of different objects in the two images. These positional differences are referred to as horizontal disparities. These disparities are processed in the visual cortex of the brain to yield depth perception.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0253">While binocular disparities are naturally present when viewing a real 3-dimensional scene with two eyes, they can also be simulated by artificially presenting two different images separately to each eye. The perception of depth in such cases is also referred to as &#x201c;stereoscopic depth&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0254">A person perceives 3D impression not only by the horizontal disparities effect of binocular vision, but also by monocular clues such as relative objects size, relative motion and more.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0000">Our automatic test can be performed in several ways.
