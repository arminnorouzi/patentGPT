Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 16/198,703 filed on Nov. 21, 2018, which claims the benefits and priority of the U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/590,037 filed on Nov. 22, 2017, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to meltblown equipment, meltblown products, and fabrication methods.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nonwoven sheet products, such as, for example, vacuum bags, bath wipes, tea bag filters, are often made by a conventional fabrication method called melt blowing. The related production or manufacturing equipment may be referred to as meltblown equipment and the related products may be referred to as meltblown products. Typically, the fabrication method first melts a thermoplastic polymer into a liquid or flowable form, then extrudes the polymer through nozzles (also known as a die tip), and blows high speed and high temperature gases around the nozzles to fiberize the polymer and deposit the fiberized polymer on a surface, such as a substrate surface. The deposited polymer is allowed to cure and form a nonwoven fabric sheet. These nonwoven sheet products may be used in various applications, such as, for example, filtration, sorbents, apparels, and drug delivery applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polymers having thermoplastic properties are suitable for melt blowing because of their characteristics in transition between the liquid and solid states. The transition temperature is known as glass transition temperature and varies from polymer to polymer. These polymers include, for example, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyesters, polyurethane, polyamides, polyethylene, and polycarbonate. Because these polymers have different glass transition temperatures and flow characteristics (e.g., viscosity, adhesiveness, etc.), meltblown equipment is often limited by their ability to produce products with certain uniformity, fiber size, or both. The polymer fiber uniformity is often limited by the uniformity of the high speed air surrounding the die tip. Furthermore, these specific limitations may lead to an overall limited production rate that caps productivity and economic viability of such products. The limitations are further magnified when two or more meltblown die tips are used together in a formation process involving wood pulp or other fibers, such as in a multiform process.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This disclosure describes melt blowing methods, assemblies, and systems that, in certain implementations, may improve one or more of product uniformity, fiber size, production rate, polymer production performance, and improved equipment and production operational efficiency. In one specific aspect, the disclosed meltblown die tip assembly produces more uniform high speed and high temperature airflows surrounding the die tip than traditional die tip assemblies. In certain implementations, the disclosed meltblown system produces more uniform output and reduced fiber sizes given certain polymer materials and production rates. More uniform output production efficiency may be achieved, in some implementations, through equipment design that allows for more thorough cleaning, and/or by having the equipment ready, such as on hot-standby, for replacement such that the maintenance down time can be lessened or minimized.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, the disclosed meltblown equipment includes a polymer beam and air chamber and a die tip assembly. The die tip assembly may be quickly attached, in certain implementations, onto or removed from the polymer beam and air chamber. The air chamber, along with an air feed system, may be included in an air heated beam for providing air to the die tip assembly. The air feed system can feed high velocity air though distribution holes to increase the heat transfer in the holes. The holes are located in locations to enable a corresponding structure (e.g., a plate) receiving the airflow to use the exiting air to increase the heat transfer efficiency. For example, the heat transfer efficiency may be increased on the die tip where airflow impinges, or at the air holes in the die tip, or both.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The die tip has airflows and drawn polymer converge at its nozzle, where highspeed uniform airflows of opposing sides entrain and draw out the polymer for fiberization. Because in certain implementations no fasteners or undesired obstructions are used in the airflow on polymer passageway or in or near the nozzle (as certain embodiments intentionally avoid such configurations with fasteners causing airflow obstructions), there is no disruption to the desired supply of air and/or polymer to the die tip nozzle. In particular, this disclosure shows an embodiment of a meltblown die tip structure that excludes any bolt head or countersink machined areas within approximately 10 cm (or 4&#x2033;) of the nozzle exterior surface or in the airflow channels or passageways of the interior of the die's machined areas. This greatly enhances production and product uniformity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, the meltblown system includes a single input (e.g., a polymer material). The meltblown system may include tapered structures that facilitate flow of the input. Such tapered structures may be referred to as polymer distribution components. The assembly mechanisms used in some embodiments of the disclosed meltblown systems enable more convenient and thorough cleaning of the polymer distribution components with each use than traditional polymer distribution components. For example, when a mounting plate is used with the polymer distribution components, a single polymer seal (e.g., a single round seal may be used instead of a number of round seals or an elongated gasket on a channel) may be used. This allows for ease of cleaning offline in assembly areas and a simple installation in the machine. When no mounting plate is used, cleaning can be performed, in certain implementations, using a bottom plate of an air chamber or from a bottom access of the meltblown beam.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In specific instances, the die tip assembly used in the disclosed meltblown system is replaceable or interchangeable with another replacement die tip assembly, in a manner similar to cartridge replacement in printers. In other instances, the die tip assembly has air output that includes two streams of air entrained at a sharp or otherwise desired angle for the improved ability in producing fine polymer fibers. This may be dependent on the type of polymers being used and/or the type or desired characteristics of the product being produced. In yet some other instances, the die tip assembly also provides novel geometric settings, such as a setback distance and tip to tip distances, as further explained in the detailed description.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure presents one or more implementations of the die tip assembly that may provide other advantages over existing meltblown devices and methods. For example, the disclosed die tip assembly may provide a more optimized use of heated air in an non-obstructed manner. The die tip assembly, in certain implementations, may be adapted to compact sizes depending on specific requirements, such that two or more die tip assemblies can be arranged together during production, for example, in a configuration for combining with pulp fibers. In certain embodiments, the die tip assembly has a weld-in or machined-in strength rib structure for providing good geometric stability (examples provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B-<b>4</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a first general aspect, a meltblown die tip assembly includes a mounting structure having at least one polymer flow passageway formed therein. The mounting structure is configured to receive a polymer flow, a first air passageway formed therein and configured to receive a first airflow, and a second air passageway formed therein and configured to receive a second airflow. The meltblown die tip assembly further includes an elongated die tip having a polymer flow chamber, a polymer flow tip, a first airflow regulation channel having a first impingement surface, a second airflow regulation channel having a second impingement surface, a first angled side, and a second angled side. The polymer flow chamber of the elongated die tip is in fluid communication with the at least one polymer flow passageway of the mounting structure at a first opening of the polymer flow chamber of the elongated die tip. The polymer flow chamber is configured to receive at least a portion of the polymer flow from the at least one polymer flow passageway of the mounting structure. The polymer flow chamber of the elongated die tip is in fluid communication with the elongated die tip at a first opening.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The polymer flow chamber of the elongated die tip is configured to receive at least a portion of the polymer flow from a first opening, the polymer flow chamber of the elongated die tip in fluid communication with the polymer flow tip at a second opening. The polymer flow tip is configured to receive at least a portion of the polymer flow from the polymer flow chamber at the second opening. The polymer flow tip, which may be considered the second opening in certain implementations, has a tip opening configured to dispense at least a portion of the polymer flow. The first airflow regulation channel is configured to receive the first airflow from the first air passageway of the mounting structure, regulate the first airflow using at least the first impingement surface, and dispense the first airflow adjacent the first angled side of the elongated die tip. The second airflow regulation channel is configured to receive the second airflow from the second air passageway of the mounting structure, regulate the second airflow using at least the second impingement surface, and dispense the second airflow adjacent the second angled side.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The meltblown die tip assembly further includes a first air plate positioned at least partially adjacent the first angled side of the elongated die tip and configured to form a first air exit passageway that is configured to receive the first airflow dispensed from the first airflow regulation channel of the elongated die tip and to dispense the first airflow adjacent the tip opening of the polymer flow tip and the at least a portion of the polymer flow to at least partially entrain such first airflow with the polymer flow. The assembly also includes a second air plate positioned at least partially adjacent the second angled side of the elongated die tip and configured to form a second air exit passageway that is configured to receive the second airflow dispensed from the second airflow regulation channel of the elongated die tip and to dispense the second airflow adjacent the tip opening of the polymer flow tip and the at least a portion of the polymer flow to at least partially entrain such second airflow with the polymer flow.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the elongated die tip includes an impingement portion housing the first airflow regulation channel and the second airflow regulation channel. The first air regulation channel has a first impingement surface. The second airflow regulation channel has a second impingement surface. The first impingement surface and the second impingement surface assist with regulating the first airflow and the second airflow respectively. For example, the first impingement surface impinges or disrupts the first airflow in its initial traveling direction and thus forces the airflow to turn and reorganize or reassemble. In addition, the impact between the first airflow and the first impingement surface aids a transfer of energy from the first airflow to the impingement portion and thus the die tip. For example, the first and the second airflows may enter the meltblown system at a high temperature for maintaining the liquidity state of the polymer flow. The impingement portion, such as the first and the second impingement surfaces, provides a mechanism for efficient heat transfer and regulation of the uniformity of the first and the second airflows. In other embodiments, there may be multiple impingement surfaces in the airflow regulation channels.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some other embodiments, the elongated die tip includes a neck portion narrower than the impingement portion and obstructing airflows exiting the first airflow regulation channel and the second airflow regulation channel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet some other embodiments, the impingement portion includes a plurality of fastenable holes for receiving fasteners affixing the first air plate and the second air plate to the impingement portion of the elongated die tip. This may be achieved, using horizontally, vertically, or diagonally oriented fasteners, or combinations of the same.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the elongated die tip and the first and the second air plates form a replaceable cartridge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some other embodiments, the meltblown die tip assembly further includes at least one breaker plate governing polymer flow from the polymer flow passageway of the mounting structure into the polymer flow chamber. The at least one breaker plate includes a plurality of holes for filtering and regulating the polymer flow. The at least one breaker plate can, in some embodiments, include two stacked breaker plates having one or more screen filter positioned between the two stacked breaker plates.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In yet some other embodiments, the first air plate and the second air plate are mounted onto the mounting structure using one or more fasteners that may be parallel to the polymer flow chamber.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the first airflow regulation channel is configured to receive the first airflow from the first air passageway of the mounting structure, regulate the first airflow, transfer heat from the first airflow to the elongated die tip, and dispense the first airflow adjacent the first angled side of the elongated die tip; and wherein the second airflow regulation channel is configured to receive the second airflow from the second air passageway of the mounting structure, regulate the second airflow, transfer heat from the second airflow to the elongated die tip, and dispense the second airflow adjacent the second angled side of the elongated die tip.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some other embodiments, the first and the second airflows cause the die tip assembly to maintain a temperature that maintains the polymer flow in a liquid state.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In yet some other embodiments, the polymer flow tip has an external angle of about 50 to about 90 degrees.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the mounting structure and the elongated die tip are a unified piece. For example, the mounting structure and the elongated die tip may be considered a unified piece when bolted together, welded together, or otherwise combined or mounted (e.g., by adhesive). In other instances, the mounting structure and the elongated die tip are manufactured as one piece, which would also be considered a unified piece.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some other embodiments, the elongated die tip further comprises an angled tip, the first air plate further comprises a first tip, and the second air plate further comprises a second tip, such that a vertical distance between the angled tip and a midpoint of the first tip and the second tip defines a setback dimension being about 0.5 mm to about 4.0 mm. A distance between the first tip and the second tip defines a tip-to-tip distance, such that a ratio of the setback dimension and the tip-to-tip distance is about 0.25 to about 2.5.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet some other embodiments, the at least one polymer flow passageway of the mounting structure includes an opening width near the first opening of the polymer flow chamber such that cleaning tools can access internal surfaces of the at least one polymer flow passageway of the mounting structure.

The meltblown system, in one or more embodiments, provides advanced operation in handling polymer materials that usually pose limitations to conventional meltblown machines and methods, such as, for example, in terms of fiber size, porosity, among others. The disclosed meltblown system, in certain embodiments for a given certain throughput (as measured by volume or mass per length per unit time), can produce uniform or more uniform polymer products having reduced fiber sizes, which is important to a desired product quality. The meltblown system may also provide several operational benefits, such as easy cleaning, rapid tool changing, uniform heating or cooling, uniform polymer flowing, and others. Details of one or more implementations of a meltblown system are described below.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective exploded view of an embodiment of a meltblown system <b>100</b>. The meltblown system <b>100</b> includes a die tip assembly <b>110</b>, a meltblown beam <b>120</b>, and one or more end plates <b>130</b>. The meltblown beam <b>120</b> receives air from an external source from one or more conduits <b>122</b> and receives polymers in a liquid state from an external source via one or more conduits <b>124</b>. Sources providing the air and polymers are well known in the art. The air, such as pressurized and/or heated air, is used to create a spray of liquid fibers of the liquid polymers. In the spray, long strings of fibers will land on a receiving surface or substrate and form a non-woven fabric sheet. This meltblowing process is achieved using the mechanisms inside the die tip assembly (also known as spinneret assembly) <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The die tip assembly <b>110</b> may include, in the example embodiment as shown, a mounting structure <b>112</b>, a die tip <b>114</b>, a first air plate <b>116</b>, and a second air plate <b>118</b>. The end plate <b>130</b> may assist with fastening these components of the die tip assembly <b>110</b> on an end. In some embodiments, another end plate (not shown) fastens certain components of the die tip assembly <b>110</b> on the other end. Specifically, the end plate <b>130</b> (as well as another end plate not shown) is fastenable to a frontal end of the elongated die tip <b>114</b>, frontal ends of the two air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, and a frontal end of the mounting structure <b>112</b> to have the assembly form a replacement cartridge such that the complete assembly can be quickly and conveniently replaced or exchanged while in hot standby mode without time-consuming dissembling of each component from the meltblown beam <b>120</b>. The mounting structure <b>112</b> may include a polymer receiving conduit or hole <b>117</b> for receiving polymer from the beam <b>120</b>. The mounting structure <b>112</b> also includes a slot or a number of holes <b>119</b> for receiving air. In some embodiments, the mounting structure includes two slots <b>119</b> and <b>126</b> positioned, in one implementation, symmetrically about the polymer receiving hole <b>117</b>. Each of the slot <b>119</b> and <b>126</b> may include holes or conduits for providing air into the die tip assembly <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As further discussed below, the die tip <b>114</b> is assembled with the first air plate <b>116</b> and the second air plate <b>118</b> to create passages for airflow to accelerate to high speeds to perform the meltblowing process. The mounting structure <b>112</b> receives the polymer materials and air flow from the meltblown beam <b>120</b> and orderly feeds or directs them to the die tip <b>114</b> underneath. In some embodiments, the mounting structure <b>112</b> may be part of or integrated with the meltblown beam <b>120</b>, and the die tip <b>114</b> and the first and the second air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are mounted below the mounting structure <b>112</b> of the meltblown beam <b>120</b>. In some other embodiments, the mounting structure <b>112</b> may be part of the die tip <b>114</b> and receives the first and the second air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>. After assembly, the first air plate <b>116</b> and the second air plate <b>118</b> have a relatively large tip-to-tip distance. In some embodiments, the distance can be about 1.27 mm (or 0.05&#x2033;), or in a range that includes such distance.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a perspective exploded view of a first embodiment of a replacement cartridge of the die tip assembly <b>110</b> used in the meltblown system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> does not show the one or more end plates <b>130</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The replacement cartridge may or may not include the separate one or more end plates <b>130</b> because an equivalent end sealing structure may be integrated with either one of the die tip <b>114</b>, the first air plate <b>116</b>, the second air plate <b>118</b>, and the mounting structure <b>112</b>. In the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the replacement cartridge may be used as a whole unit, such that a new and heated replacement unit can be provided standby to swap with the mounted and used unit. Utilizing the exchangeability, the replacement cartridge increases the operational efficiency. In some other embodiments, the interchangeable portion may or may not include the mounting structure <b>112</b>. For example, as shown in the second embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the replacement cartridge needs not include the mounting structure <b>112</b>, for example, when the mounting structure <b>112</b> is integrated with the meltblown beam <b>120</b> or with the die tip <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the exploded view illustrates the assembly relationship of the components. The die tip <b>114</b>, the first air plate <b>116</b>, and the second air plate <b>118</b> may be affixed together. For example, the die tip <b>114</b> may have a plurality of fastener holes on both sides for fastenably receiving the air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, such as by screws, bolts, or jigs. In other embodiments, the air plates may be affixed onto the die tip <b>114</b> using other known or available fastening methods, such as welding, woodwork joints, adhesives, or other temporary or permanent means. The die tip <b>114</b>, the air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> may then be assembled with the mounting structure <b>112</b>. For example, vertical fasteners can be used to hold the air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> toward the mounting structure <b>112</b>. In other instances, vertical or diagonal fasteners can be used to hold the die tip <b>114</b> to the mounting structure <b>112</b>. To ensure the precision of the assembly, in some embodiments, the die tip <b>114</b> with the first and the second air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> may be aligned to the mounting structure <b>112</b> using at least one dowel pin.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, breaker plates <b>210</b> may be used in the cartridge assembly for regulating and/or filtering the polymer flow before the polymer flow reaches the die tip <b>114</b>. In some instances, one breaker plate <b>210</b> may be used together with a filter or a screen <b>220</b>. In other instances, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, two or more breaker plates <b>210</b> are used with one or more filter or screen <b>220</b> positioned in between the two or more breaker plates <b>210</b> for filtering away unwanted substances, such as articles greater than certain sizes.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The breaker plates <b>210</b> and the filter <b>220</b> (if used) may be positioned anywhere along the polymer flow path, such as, for example, in an opening in the mounting structure <b>112</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> or in an opening in the die tip <b>114</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.

In this embodiment, the mounting structure <b>112</b> is not replaced or included in the replacement cartridge and the breaker plates <b>210</b> and filter <b>220</b> (if used) are installed inside the die tip <b>114</b>. In the second embodiment, the mounting structure <b>112</b> may be part of the meltblown beam <b>120</b> or may not require replacement due to operation conditions. For example, in this embodiment, when the breaker plates <b>210</b> were clogged or having reduced flow efficiency, or when the die tip <b>114</b> required cleaning, only the die tip <b>114</b> and the first and the second air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are replaced, along, as needed, with the one or more breaker plate <b>210</b> and one or more filter or screen <b>220</b> if so applied.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>E</figref>, these figures show a front view of the die tip assembly <b>110</b> in different embodiments, showing the relationship of the components when they are assembled.

A method of improving the uniformity of the airflows <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> is discussed here. As the pressurized air is fed into one or more air passageways (e.g., <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>) in the mounting structure <b>112</b>, the air travels at a high velocity. The moving air is impinged by the impingement surface <b>353</b> near the exit of the first air passageway <b>340</b>. The obstruction provided by the impingement surface <b>353</b> forces the first airflow <b>301</b> to redistribute and reassemble within a first plenum <b>341</b> above the impingement surface <b>353</b>.

Similarly, the second airflow <b>303</b> enters the second air passageway <b>342</b> and is reassembled in a first plenum <b>343</b> to become a reassembled airflow <b>304</b>, which enters the second air regulation channel <b>354</b> and then reassembled again in a second plenum <b>346</b> created between the neck portion <b>365</b> and the second air plate <b>118</b>. The second plenums <b>345</b> and <b>346</b> have a lower bound provided by the transition (second impingement) surface <b>363</b>, which further disrupts and causing the airflows <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> to reassemble once more. As such, the uniformity of the airflows <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> is improved. The airflows <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> then enters and passes through a set of exit holes <b>369</b> and enters the air exit passage ways <b>382</b> and <b>383</b> respectively. The airflows <b>301</b> and <b>303</b> are accelerated in the air exit passage ways <b>382</b> and <b>383</b> to draw the polymer provided in the polymer flow tip <b>372</b> for melt blowing.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, the exit holes <b>369</b> below the transition surfaces <b>363</b> may be replaced with an equivelant structure, such as a gap (not illustrated) between the wide portion <b>375</b> that is under the neck portion <b>365</b> and either of the air plates <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>.
