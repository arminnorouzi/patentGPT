LPD is a term used when surface smoothness (presence or absence of a step) of an epitaxial film is evaluated by irradiating a surface of the epitaxial film with light, and means that more steps exist on the surface of the epitaxial film as the number of LPDs increases. For example, the step is derived from a stacking fault generated when the epitaxial film is grown on the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate. Because the stacking fault depends on the smoothness of the surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate, the number of LPDs is required to be reduced by implementing the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having the high surface smoothness. Even for the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate disclosed in PTL 1, sometimes the number of LPDs is required to be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">In view of the above points, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a gallium arsenide single crystal substrate capable of forming the epitaxial film in which the number of LPDs is reduced, and a method for producing the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Description of Embodiments of the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0026">First, embodiments of the present disclosure will be listed and described.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">[1] A gallium arsenide single crystal substrate according to one aspect of the present disclosure is a gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having a main surface, and a ratio of a number of As atoms existing as diarsenic trioxide to a number of As atoms existing as diarsenic pentoxide is greater than or equal to 2 when the main surface is measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in which an X-ray having an energy of 150 eV is used and a take-off angle of a photoelectron is set to 5&#xb0;. Arithmetic average roughness Ra of the main surface is less than or equal to 0.3 nm. Although the detailed mechanism is unknown, the smoothness of the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having such characteristics is enhanced. Furthermore, the diarsenic trioxide is more easily decomposed by heat treatment than the diarsenic pentoxide. Therefore, in the heating treatment when the epitaxial film is formed, the As oxide existing on the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate is uniformly removed, and the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate is further smoothed. As a result, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">[2] When the main surface is measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the ratio of the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide is preferably greater than or equal to 5. Thus, the smoothness of the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate can be further enhanced, so that the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be further reduced when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">[3] The main surface is preferably a surface having an off angle greater than or equal to 0.01&#xb0; and less than or equal to 15&#xb0; from a (100) plane. Thus, the main surface becomes a surface having excellent electrical characteristic and optical characteristic. Thus, in the present disclosure, the epitaxial film can be formed on the surface having the excellent electrical characteristic and optical characteristic of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate, and in this case, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">[4] The gallium arsenide single crystal substrate preferably has a disk shape having a diameter greater than or equal to 75 mm and less than or equal to 300 mm. As described later, in the present disclosure, a large substrate having the diameter greater than or equal to 75 mm can be applied as a shape of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate. Thus, the epitaxial film can be formed on the surface of the main surface of the large gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having the diameter greater than or equal to 75 mm, and in this case, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">[5] In the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate, when nine measurement points on the main surface are measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the standard deviation of the ratio of the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide is preferably less than or equal to 1. When the diameter is D mm, and when two axes that pass through the center of the main surface and are orthogonal to each other on the main surface are the X-axis and the Y-axis, the coordinates (X, Y) of the X-axis and the Y-axis of the nine measurement points are (0,0), (D/4,0), (0, D/4), (&#x2212;D/4,0), (0, &#x2212;D/4), ((D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, (D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>), (&#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, (D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>), (&#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, &#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>), and ((D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, &#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>). Thus, even in the large gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having the diameter greater than or equal to 75 mm, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film formed on the surface of the main surface can be uniformly reduced.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">[6] The diameter of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate is preferably greater than or equal to 150 mm and less than or equal to 200 mm. As illustrated in Examples (Samples 1 to 3 and 8) described later, the epitaxial film can also be formed on the main surface of the large GaAs single crystal substrate having the diameter greater than or equal to 150 mm and less than or equal to 200 mm, and in this case, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">[7] A gallium arsenide single crystal substrate according to an aspect of the present disclosure is a gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having a main surface. The gallium arsenide single crystal substrate has a disk shape having the diameter greater than or equal to 75 mm and less than or equal to 300 mm. When nine measurement points on the main surface are measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using the X-ray having the energy of 150 eV and setting the take-off angle of the photoelectrons to 5&#xb0;, the average value of the ratios of the number of As atoms existing as diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as diarsenic pentoxide is greater than or equal to 2, and a standard deviation of the ratios is less than or equal to 1. When the diameter is D mm, and when two axes that pass through the center of the main surface and are orthogonal to each other on the main surface are the X-axis and the Y-axis, the coordinates (X, Y) of the X-axis and the Y-axis of the nine measurement points are (0,0), (D/4,0), (0, D/4), (&#x2212;D/4,0), (0, &#x2212;D/4), ((D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, (D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>), (&#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, (D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>), (&#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, &#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>), and ((D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>, &#x2212;(D&#x2212;40)/8<sup>1/2</sup>). The average value of arithmetic average roughness Ra at the nine measurement points is less than or equal to 0.3 nm. Even in this configuration, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced. Furthermore, even in the large gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having the diameter greater than or equal to 75 mm, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film formed on the surface of the main surface can be uniformly reduced.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">[8] A method for producing a gallium arsenide single crystal substrate according to another aspect of the present disclosure includes: forming an oxide film on a main surface of a gallium arsenide single crystal substrate precursor using at least one of an ozone gas and an ultraviolet ray while the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate precursor is heated under a heating condition greater than or equal to 100&#xb0; C. and less than or equal to 200&#xb0; C.; and bringing the main surface into contact with an acidic aqueous solution to etch the oxide film. In the method for producing the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate having such the characteristic, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate in which the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film is reduced can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">[9] The heating condition is preferably greater than or equal to 150&#xb0; C. and less than or equal to 200&#xb0; C. Thus, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate in which the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film is further reduced can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">[10] The acidic aqueous solution is preferably a solution containing hydrofluoric acid. Thus, the oxide film formed on the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate precursor can be easily removed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">[11] The method for producing the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate preferably further includes, after the etching process, measuring the main surface by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using an X-ray having the energy of 150 eV and setting a take-off angle of the photoelectrons to 5&#xb0;, and analyzing a ratio of a number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide. Thus, an extreme surface of the main surface can be accurately analyze, and so, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate in which the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film is reduced can be easily obtained.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Detailed Embodiment of the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0038">With reference to the drawings, an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail below. In the present specification, the notation of the form &#x201c;A to B&#x201d; means an upper limit and a lower limit of the range (that is, greater than or equal to A and less than or equal to B), and when the unit is not described in A while the unit is described only in B, the unit of A and the unit of B are the same. Furthermore, when an atomic ratio is not particularly limited while a compound or the like is represented by a chemical formula in the present specification, all the conventionally known atomic ratios are included, and the atomic ratio is not necessarily limited only to a stoichiometric range. For example, when it is described as &#x201c;AlGaAs&#x201d;, the atomic ratio constituting AlGaAs is not limited to Al:Ga:As=0.5:0.5:1, but any conventionally known atomic ratio is included. The same applies to the description of compounds other than &#x201c;AlGaAs&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">[Gallium Arsenide Single Crystal Substrate]</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">The gallium arsenide single crystal substrate (hereinafter, also referred to as a &#x201c;GaAs single crystal substrate&#x201d;) of the embodiment is a GaAs single crystal substrate having a main surface. At this point, the main surface is a surface on which an epitaxial film is formed. The ratio of the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide is greater than or equal to 2 when the main surface is measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using the X-ray having the energy of 150 eV and setting the take-off angle of the photoelectrons to 5&#xb0;. Arithmetic average roughness Ra of the main surface is less than or equal to 0.3 nm. In the GaAs single crystal substrate having such the characteristic, smoothness of the main surface is enhanced. Furthermore, the diarsenic trioxide is more easily decomposed by heat treatment than the diarsenic pentoxide. Therefore, in the heating treatment when the epitaxial film is formed, the As oxide existing on the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate is uniformly removed, and the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate is further smoothed. As a result, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">While developing the GaAs single crystal substrate capable of forming the epitaxial film in which the number of LPDs is reduced, the present inventors have paid attention to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using the synchrotron radiation capable of more accurately analyzing the state of the main surface in the GaAs single crystal substrate as compared with the related art. Specifically, the cause of degradation of the main surface smoothness of the GaAs single crystal substrate was specified by performing the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and attainment of the GaAs single crystal substrate capable of forming the epitaxial film in which the number of LPDs was reduced by eliminating the above cause was attempted. At this point, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy refers to an analysis method in which a sample is irradiated with the X-ray and a distribution of kinetic energy of photoelectrons emitted from the sample is measured to obtain knowledge about a kind, an abundance, a chemical bonding state, and the like of elements existing on the surface of the sample.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">Conventionally, when the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate was measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed using the X-ray (hard X-ray) in which the energy was fixed at around 1.5 keV. For example, &#x201c;Yukihiro Hirota et al., &#x201c;Clean and Damage-Free GaAs Surface Prepared by Using the Ultrasonic Running Deionized Water Treatment&#x201d;, Surface Science, 1991, Vol. 12, No. 6, pp. 380 to 392&#x2033; (NPL 2) and &#x201c;Teruo Tsunoda, &#x201c;Cleaning Technology of Electronic Materials&#x201d;, Journal of Japan Oil Chemists' Society, 1986, Vol. 35, No. 10, pp. 867 to 872&#x2033; (NPL 3) disclose the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using an X-ray source of 1253.6 eV. In the case of using the X-ray fixed in the vicinity of 1.5 keV, the knowledge on the state of the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate was obtained as the state in which the region from the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate to the depth of 5 nm was averaged. The region corresponds to about 20 atomic layers in terms of atomic layers. For this reason, in the conventional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is difficult to accurately analyze the state of the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">On the other hand, in the present disclosure, the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate is measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under the condition that the X-ray (soft X-ray) having the energy of 150 eV is used and the photoelectron take-off angle is set to 5&#xb0; (hereinafter, also referred to as a &#x201c;specific condition&#x201d;). The extreme surface of the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate can be analyzed using the low-energy soft X-ray and detecting the photoelectrons having the low take-off angle. Specifically, the region having the depth of 0.15 nm of the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate can be analyzed under the above specific condition. The region corresponds to about one atomic layer in terms of an atomic layer, and thus the state of the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate can be analyzed with higher accuracy as compared with the related art.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">As illustrated in Examples (Samples 1 to 3) described later, when the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate of the embodiment is measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under the above specific condition, the ratio of the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide is greater than or equal to 2. Arithmetic average roughness Ra of the main surface is less than or equal to 0.3 nm. The number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide and the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide are calculated from an As3d spectrum obtained by the measurement using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as described later. In the case where the epitaxial film is grown on the main surface of such the GaAs single crystal substrate, the number of LPDs having the diameter greater than or equal to 18 &#x3bc;m when converted into a circular shape with an equal area is less than 4 per 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>of the film surface of the epitaxial film. In the present specification, the &#x201c;film surface&#x201d; of the epitaxial film refers to a surface on a side opposite to a side of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate in the epitaxial film.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">On the other hand, as illustrated in comparative examples (Samples 4 to 7) described later, when the main surface of the conventional GaAs single crystal substrate is measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under the above specific condition, the ratio of the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide is less than 2. In the case where the epitaxial film is grown on the main surface of such the GaAs single crystal substrate, the number of LPDs having the diameter greater than or equal to 18 &#x3bc;m when converted into a circular shape with an equal area exceeds 4 per 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>of the film surface of the epitaxial film.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">As described above, the present inventors have found for the first time that the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film formed on the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate depends on the ratio of the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide on the extreme surface of the main surface. Hereinafter, the ratio of the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic trioxide to the number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide is also referred to as &#x201c;ratio As(3+)/As(5+)&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">In the gallium arsenide single crystal, arsenic can be deposited at the crystal grain boundary. The size of the deposited arsenic is usually on the order of submicron. In the gallium arsenide single crystal, oxidation easily proceeds at a position where arsenic is deposited, and the gallium arsenide single crystal is oxidized deeper. In such the position, the amount of diarsenic pentoxide increases. In the case where the GaAs single crystal substrate is prepared from the gallium arsenide single crystal containing the deposited arsenic, even when the etching treatment removing the oxide film is performed on the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate, a part of the oxide film remains. For this reason, it is presumed that in the GaAs single crystal substrate having a large number of As atoms existing as the diarsenic pentoxide on the extreme surface of the main surface, that many oxide films remain on the extreme surface of the main surface, and that the smoothness of the main surface is low.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">On the other hand, on the extreme surface of the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate of to the embodiment, the ratio As(3+)/As(5+) is greater than or equal to 2. Thus, in the GaAs single crystal substrate of the embodiment, the oxide film caused by the arsenic deposited between the crystal grains is less likely to remain, and the smoothness of the main surface is improved. Thus, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">Furthermore, the diarsenic trioxide is more easily decomposed by the heat treatment than the diarsenic pentoxide. Accordingly, in the GaAs single crystal substrate in which the ratio As(3+)/As(5+) on the extreme surface of the main surface is greater than or equal to 2, the arsenic oxide existing on the main surface is uniformly removed by the heating treatment when the epitaxial film is formed, and the main surface of the gallium arsenide single crystal substrate is further smoothed. As a result, when the epitaxial film is formed on the main surface, the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">The ratio As(3+)/As(5+) does not need to be greater than or equal to 2 at all points of the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate. The average value of the ratios As(3+)/As(5+) at a plurality of points on the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate may be greater than or equal to 2.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">The upper limit of the ratio As(3+)/As(5+) when the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate is measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under the above specific conditions should not be particularly limited, but may be ideally infinite.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">For example, the GaAs single crystal substrate of the embodiment can be obtained by executing a method for producing a GaAs single crystal substrate described later.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">When the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate of the embodiment is measured by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under the above specific conditions, the ratio As(3+)/As(5+) is preferably greater than or equal to 5. Thus, the GaAs single crystal substrate can further reduce the number of LPDs on the film surface of the epitaxial film.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">&#x3c;Analysis of Main Surface of GaAs Single Crystal Substrate Using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">(Analysis System)</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view schematically illustrating a configuration of an analysis system using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Gallium is forcibly oxidized by heating. The gallium is below aluminum in the periodic table and has properties similar to aluminum. The aluminum adsorbs moisture and oxygen in the atmosphere on the surface, and the surface becomes a passive film. Internal oxidation is prevented by forming the passive film. When the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate precursor is oxidized at room temperature, such the passive film is not sufficiently formed, and the oxidation of the position where the arsenic is deposited further proceeds.

On the other hand, the main surface of the GaAs single crystal substrate precursor is oxidized while heated at 100&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., the gallium is forcibly oxidized, and the passivation film is uniformly formed.
