From the perspective of the development trend, the researches on 4G and 5G systems have the characteristics which support enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable and low latency transmission and massive connectivity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To support the characteristics of ultra-reliable and low latency transmission, transmission needs to be carried out with a short transmission time interval and a low bit rate, where the short transmission time interval may be a single orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol or multiple symbols. For a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), transmission opportunities may be provided at multiple occasion positions in a slot to reduce a waiting time after data arrives, thereby ensuring the low-latency transmission and ensuring the high reliable transmission through a high aggregation level. In a cell aggregation system, the maximum number of PDCCH detection candidate sets that the terminal needs to support and the maximum number of non-overlapping control channel elements (CCEs) that the terminal needs to support are defined in each slot for each type of subcarrier spacing. However, when the enhanced PDCCH monitoring capability of the terminal is introduced, in a cell aggregation scenario, no efficient way to determine a second threshold of each type of subcarrier spacing in each span is proposed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present application provide an information determination method and device, an information adjustment method, a threshold usage method, a terminal, and a storage medium.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The embodiments of the present application provide an information determination method.

However, the manner of using the R15 capability and the R16 capability is not given in the related art.
