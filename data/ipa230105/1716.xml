Before printing on a printable medium, the printing device is to determine a size of the printable medium to ensure print quality. For example, consider a case where the printable medium is of B5 size and the printing device performs the print operation as if the printable medium is of A4 size, which is larger than B5 size. In such a case, the printing device may spray printing fluid outside the printable medium and may smear on the printable medium.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To determine the size of the printable medium, printing devices may utilize various techniques. In some cases, the techniques utilized for the determination of size are inaccurate. For instance; printable medium of one size, such as B5 size, may be determined as having another size, such as A4 size. Techniques that provide an accurate determination of size of the printable medium may be complex and expensive.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present subject matter relates to determination of size of printable medium. With the implementations of the present subject matter, accurate and inexpensive determination of size of printable media can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with an example implementation of the present subject matter, a printing device may include an adjuster that can be moved based on a size of a printable medium. For instance, the adjuster may be moved, depending on the size of the printable medium, to be placed alongside the printable medium. Accordingly, the distance of the adjuster from a fixed reference point may be used to determine the size of the printable medium, in an example, the adjuster may be disposed on a media tray and moved in a lateral direction of the media tray to be disposed adjacent to a side of the printable medium. In such a case, the fixed reference point may be at an end of the media tray.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The printing device may include a position sensing system having a first element and a second element. The first element may be coupled to the adjuster and the second element may be movable relative to the adjuster, To allow the second element to move relative to the adjuster, in an example, the second element may be coupled to a print carriage, which is used for supporting print cartridges.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The position sensing system may generate a position signal based on a position of the second element relative to the first element. The position signal may be generated, for example, by the first element or the second element. In an example, the first element may be a position indicator and the second element may be a sensing element that can sense the presence of the position indicator and can generate a position signal accordingly. Further, a magnitude of the position signal may depend on a distance between the first element and the second element. In an example, the position indicator may be a magnet and the sensing element may be a magnet sensing element, such as a Hall sensor, a magneto-resistive (MR) sensor, magneto-diode, or the like. Accordingly, a magnitude of a voltage signal output by the magnet sensing element depends on the distance of the magnet sensing element from the magnet.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The position signal can be used to determine the size of the printable medium. For instance, when a distance between the magnet sensing element and the magnet is less than a threshold distance, the magnitude of the position signal may be of a first value. The distance between the magnet sensing element and the magnet may be less than the threshold distance if, for example, the magnetic sensing element is vertically aligned with, such as vertically above or below, the magnet. Accordingly, a position of the magnet sensing element at which it outputs the position signal of the first value may be used to determine a position of the adjuster, and therefore, the size of the printable medium. A controller may receive the position signal and determine the size of the printable medium.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present subject matter provides for an accurate determination of sizes of printable media. Further, the present subject matter can be used to determine several sizes of printable media. The present subject matter utilizes simple and cost-effective components for the size determination. Since the determination of the size is performed based on the magnitude of the position signal that varies during movement of the second element relative to the adjuster, an accurate size determination is achieved without the use of multiple stationary sensors. Further, since the second element is coupled to the print carriage, which is already utilized in printers, a separate component to move the sensing element may not be provided. Accordingly, the present subject matter can be implemented in printers in a simple manner, without a substantial change in their design or increase in cost of manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The techniques of the present subject matter can be utilized in printers in scenarios where the printers are to automatically determine the size of the printable medium. In an example, upon determination of the size, the printing device may send the size information to a computing device that is to send a print command to the printing device. Accordingly, when the computing device sends the print command, the size information may be included in the print command.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present subject matter is further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>. It should be noted that the description and figures merely illustrate principles of the present subject matter. Various arrangements may be devised that, although not explicitly described or shown herein, encompass the principles of the present subject matter. Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and examples of the present subject matter, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, in the description provided below, the present subject matter is explained with reference to printing devices in which printable media are conveyed in a substantially C-shaped or L-shaped path. However, the present subject matter can be utilized in printing devices in which the printable media are conveyed in other types of paths as well.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also, in the below description, the determination of the size of the printable media are explained with the help of magnets and magnet sensing elements. However, it is to be understood that the present subject matter can be implemented using other types of signal transmitters and signal sensors. For instance, a light emitting device can be used to emit a light signal, which can be sensed by an optical sensor for determining size of the printable media.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a printing device <b>100</b> that can print on printable media of a plurality of sizes, according to an example implementation of the present subject matter. The printing device <b>100</b> can be fed with printable media of various sizes for being printed on. An example printable medium is a printable medium <b>102</b>, which may be for example, a sheet material, such as a piece of paper, card stock, fabric, photo paper (on which photographs are printed), or the like. A size of a printable medium may refer to a length of the printable medium, a width of the printable medium, or a combination of both, and may include standard sizes referenced by nomenclature, such as A4 size, B5 size, and A3 size.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The printing device <b>100</b> may include an adjuster <b>104</b> that can be moved based on a size of the printable medium <b>102</b>. For instance, the adjuster <b>104</b> can be moved towards the printable medium <b>102</b> to be positioned adjacent to a side of the printable medium <b>102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the adjuster <b>104</b> is shown slightly displaced from the printable medium <b>102</b> to clearly illustrate the printable medium <b>102</b> and the adjuster <b>104</b>. In an example, the position of the adjuster <b>104</b> may be used to determine the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The printing device <b>100</b> may also include a position sensing system <b>108</b> for determining the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>. The determination of the size may include determination of the length, the width, or both, of the printable medium <b>102</b>. The position sensing system <b>108</b> includes a first element <b>110</b> and a second element <b>112</b>. The first element <b>110</b> may be coupled to the adjuster <b>104</b> and may move along with the adjuster <b>104</b> to indicate a position of the adjuster <b>104</b>. The second element <b>112</b> can move relative to the adjuster <b>104</b>. For instance, the second element <b>112</b> can move in the directions indicated by arrows <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>, To facilitate movement of the second element <b>112</b> relative to the adjuster <b>104</b>, the second element <b>112</b> may be coupled to a movable element (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), The movable element may be, for example, a print carriage of the printing device <b>100</b>, as will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example, the second element <b>112</b> may be disposed above the adjuster <b>104</b> in a height-wise direction of the printing device <b>100</b>. Accordingly, when the second element <b>112</b> moves relative to the adjuster <b>104</b>, a portion of the adjuster <b>104</b> and the first element <b>110</b> may be below the second element <b>112</b> at some point during the movement of the second element <b>112</b>, as illustrated in FIG.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The position sensing system <b>108</b> may generate a signal indicative of a distance between the first element <b>110</b> and the second element <b>112</b>, Since the distance between the first element <b>110</b> and the second element <b>112</b> may change during movement of the second element <b>112</b> relative to the adjuster <b>104</b>, in an example, a magnitude of the signal may vary during movement of the second element <b>112</b> relative to the first element <b>110</b>. The signal may be generated, for example, by the first element <b>110</b> or the second element <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The signal can be used to determine a size of the printable medium <b>102</b>. For instance, when a distance between the first element <b>110</b> and the second element <b>112</b> is less than a threshold distance, the magnitude of the signal may be of a first value. In an example, the threshold distance may be slightly more than the least possible distance between the first element <b>110</b> and the second element <b>112</b>. Further, the distance between the first element <b>110</b> and the second element <b>112</b> may be less than the threshold distance if, for example, the second element <b>112</b> is vertically above the first element <b>110</b>. Accordingly, a position of the second element <b>112</b> at which the signal has a magnitude equal to the first value may correspond to a position of the adjuster <b>104</b>, and therefore, may indicate the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>, Since the signal corresponds to the position of the adjuster <b>104</b>, the signal may also be referred to as a position signal. The determination of the size of the printable medium <b>102</b> based on the position signal will be explained in greater detail in the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the printing device <b>100</b> that can determine the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>, according to an example implementation of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The printing device <b>100</b> may include a media tray <b>202</b> to hold the printable medium <b>102</b> to be fed to the printing device <b>100</b> for printing. For instance, a user of the printing device <b>100</b> may place the printable medium <b>102</b> on the media tray <b>202</b>. From the media tray <b>202</b>, the printable medium <b>102</b> may be received inside a body of the printing device <b>100</b>, where the printing operation may be performed. The media tray <b>202</b> may be a substantially planar structure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An adjuster leg <b>204</b> may be disposed on the media tray <b>202</b>, The adjuster leg <b>204</b> may correspond to, for example, the adjuster <b>104</b>. The adjuster leg <b>204</b> may be moved along the media tray <b>202</b>, such as in a direction indicated by an arrow <b>206</b> and be disposed alongside the printable medium <b>102</b>. In an example, the position of the adjuster leg <b>204</b> on the media tray <b>202</b> indicates the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>. For instance, once the adjuster leg <b>204</b> is positioned alongside the printable medium <b>102</b>, a distance <b>208</b> between an end of the media tray <b>202</b> in the direction <b>206</b> and the adjuster leg <b>204</b> indicates the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>, For example, a smaller distance <b>208</b> indicates a greater width of the printable medium <b>102</b>, The adjuster leg <b>204</b> may be referred to as a width adjuster, as the adjuster leg <b>204</b> may be adjusted based on a width of the printable medium <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to the adjuster leg <b>204</b>, in an example, another adjuster leg (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may be disposed on the media tray <b>202</b>. Accordingly, the adjuster leg <b>204</b> may be referred to as a first adjuster leg <b>204</b> and the other adjuster leg may be referred to as a second adjuster leg. The second adjuster leg may be displaced from the adjuster leg in the direction <b>206</b> and the printable medium <b>102</b> may be received between the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> and the second adjuster leg.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A position indicator <b>210</b> may be fixedly coupled to the adjuster leg <b>204</b>. The position indicator <b>210</b> may indicate a position of the adjuster leg <b>204</b>. In an example, the position indicator <b>210</b> may be a magnet, also referred to as the magnet <b>210</b>. Accordingly, using a magnetic field of the magnet <b>210</b>, the position of the adjuster leg <b>204</b> can be found. In an example, the position indicator <b>210</b> may correspond to the first element <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The printing device <b>100</b> may also include a sensing element <b>212</b> that can move relative to the adjuster leg <b>204</b>. The sensing element <b>212</b> may be, for example, the second element <b>112</b>. The sensing element <b>212</b> may sense a position of the position indicator <b>210</b> and may generate the position signal <b>214</b> based on the sensing. In an example, if the position indicator <b>210</b> is a magnet, the sensing element <b>212</b> may be a magnet sensing element and may be referred to as the magnet sensing element <b>212</b>. A magnet sensing element may refer to an element that senses a magnetic field of a magnet and generates a signal based on a strength of the sensed magnetic field. Examples of the magnetic sensing element include a Hall-effect sensor, a magneto-resistive (MR) sensor, a magneto-diode, a magneto-transistor, and an eddy current sensor. In the below description, the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> will be explained with reference to a Hall-effect sensor as an example, also referred to as a Hall sensor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The magnet sensing element <b>212</b> can generate the position signal <b>214</b> based on the magnetic field sensed.

For instance, the carriage rod <b>304</b> may be displaced from the adjuster leg <b>204</b> in a height-wise direction of the printing device <b>100</b>. Further, the print carriage <b>302</b> may face the adjuster leg <b>204</b> during its movement on the carriage rod <b>304</b>.

Such a movement of the sensing element <b>212</b> facilitates the sensing element <b>212</b> to move relative to the adjuster leg <b>204</b>.

The printing device <b>400</b> may correspond to the printing device <b>100</b>. Accordingly, components of the printing device <b>400</b> that are similar to that of the printing device <b>100</b> are represented by the same reference numerals. For instance, the media tray of the printing device <b>400</b> is represented by the reference numeral <b>202</b>. Here, various components of the printing device <b>400</b>, such as outer cover, chassis, and feed roller, have been obscured to clearly illustrate the adjuster leg <b>204</b>, the print carriage <b>302</b>, and other components coupled to them.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated, in addition to the adjuster leg <b>204</b>, an additional adjuster leg <b>402</b> may be provided in the printing device <b>400</b>. Accordingly, the adjuster leg <b>204</b> may be referred to as the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> and the additional adjuster leg <b>402</b> may be referred to as the second adjuster leg <b>402</b>. The first adjuster leg <b>204</b> and the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> may be interlocked with each other. To interlock the adjuster legs, the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> may be coupled to a first arm <b>404</b> and the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> may be coupled to a second arm <b>406</b>. Both the first arm <b>404</b> and the second arm <b>406</b> may be toothed and may be coupled to each other by a gear <b>408</b>. The gear <b>408</b> meshes with the teeth of both the first arm <b>404</b> and the second arm <b>406</b>. Accordingly, a movement of one of the adjuster legs causes the other adjuster leg to move. For instance, a movement of the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> towards the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> causes the first arm <b>404</b> to move along with the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>. The movement of the first arm <b>404</b> causes rotation of the gear <b>408</b> due to the meshing between the teeth of the first arm <b>404</b> and the teeth of the gear <b>408</b>. The rotation of the gear <b>408</b>, in turn, causes the second arm <b>406</b> to move in a direction opposite the direction of movement of the first arm <b>404</b>, i.e., towards the first arm <b>404</b>. Accordingly, the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> moves towards the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>. Conversely, the movement of the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> away from the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> causes the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> to, move in a direction away from the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>. Accordingly, the interlocking of the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> and the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> causes them to move relative to each other, i.e., towards and away from each other.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an example, the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> and the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> may be disposed on the media tray <b>202</b> and may be displaced from each other in a lateral direction <b>410</b> of the media tray <b>202</b>. Further, the movement of the adjuster legs relative to each other, as explained above, may be in the lateral direction <b>410</b> of the media tray <b>202</b>. The lateral direction <b>410</b> may also be referred to as a widthwise direction <b>410</b> of the media tray <b>202</b>, which may be the same as a widthwise direction &#x2018;W&#x2019; of the printing device <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The media tray <b>202</b> may receive the printable medium <b>102</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) for printing During the course of operation of the printing device <b>400</b>, a user may first remove the media tray <b>202</b> from the printing device <b>400</b> and place the printable medium <b>102</b> on the media tray <b>202</b>. The printable medium <b>102</b> may be placed such that it is positioned at the center of the media tray <b>202</b>. Subsequently, the position of one of the adjuster legs may be adjusted based on the size, such as width, of the printable medium <b>102</b>. The adjustment of the position may be such that the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> is adjacent to one side of the printable medium <b>102</b> and the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> is adjacent to another side of the printable medium <b>102</b>. For instance, if, upon placing the printable medium <b>102</b> on the media tray <b>202</b>, it is found that the two adjuster legs are not adjacent to the printable medium <b>102</b>, the user may move one of the adjuster legs, such as the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>, in the lateral direction <b>410</b> towards the printable medium <b>102</b>. Since the other adjuster leg, such as the second adjuster leg <b>402</b>, is interlocked with the adjuster leg, the other adjuster leg also moves in the lateral direction <b>410</b> towards the printable medium <b>102</b>. Thereafter, the media tray <b>202</b> may be inserted into the printing device <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, upon completion of the adjustment of the positions of the adjuster legs and insertion of the media tray <b>202</b>, the printable medium <b>102</b> is enclosed by the two adjuster legs on its two opposite sides. Further, a position of the adjuster legs may indicate the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>. For instance, once the adjuster legs are positioned adjacent to the sides of the printable medium <b>102</b>, a distance of an adjuster leg from a fixed reference point on the media tray <b>202</b> may indicate the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>. The fixed reference point may be, for example, at an end of the media tray <b>202</b> in the lateral direction <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once the printable medium <b>102</b> is placed on the media tray <b>202</b> and the positions of the adjuster legs are adjusted, upon receiving a print command, for example, from a computing device (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), the printable medium <b>102</b> may be conveyed inside the body of the printing device <b>400</b> in a direction <b>411</b>. The direction <b>411</b> may be referred to as a conveyance direction. The conveyance direction <b>411</b> may be perpendicular to the lateral direction <b>410</b>. Subsequently, the printable medium <b>102</b> may move upwards by moving around a roller (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Accordingly, the printable medium <b>102</b> is conveyed in a substantially C-shaped path in the printing device <b>400</b> for printing. Thus, the printing device <b>400</b> may be referred to as a C-path printing device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The printing device <b>400</b> may also include the print carriage <b>302</b>. In an example, the print carriage <b>302</b> may be a frame-like structure and may have stalls in which print cartridges may be received and supported. For instance, the print carriage <b>302</b> may include a first stall in which a first print cartridge <b>412</b> and a second stall in which a second print cartridge <b>414</b> may be supported. A print cartridge may be a fluid-jet precision-dispensing device or fluid ejector structure that precisely dispenses fluid, such as ink and liquid toner, on a printable medium, such as the printable medium <b>102</b>. In an example, the print cartridge may be single-color ink cartridge. The print cartridge may include a fluid ejection die (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) that ejects drops of fluid, such as ink and liquid toner, through a plurality of orifices or nozzles (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) toward the printable medium to print onto the printable medium. The fluid ejection die may be, for example, a print head, such as a thermal inkjet (TIJ) print head or a piezoelectric inkjet print head.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The print carriage <b>302</b> may be mounted on the carriage rod <b>304</b> and may slide along the length of the carriage rod <b>304</b>.

The magnet sensing element may be housed in a sensor cover <b>419</b>. In an example, the magnet <b>210</b> may be disposed on the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>. Further, the sensor cover <b>419</b> may be coupled to the print carriage <b>302</b>. The coupling of the sensor cover <b>419</b>, housing the magnet sensing element <b>212</b>, to the print carriage <b>302</b> causes a coupling between the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> and the print carriage <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The magnet <b>210</b> may be disposed on the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> such that the magnet <b>210</b> faces upwards.

Accordingly, when the print carriage <b>302</b> travels on the carriage rod <b>304</b>, the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> may be vertically above the magnet <b>210</b>, and the magnet <b>210</b> may face the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> at a position of the print carriage <b>302</b> on the carriage rod <b>304</b>. For other positions of the print carriage <b>302</b> on the carriage rod <b>304</b>, the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> may not be vertically aligned with the magnet <b>210</b>, For instance, for the other positions of the print carriage <b>302</b>, the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> may be separated from the magnet <b>210</b> in the widthwise direction W, in addition to being separated in the height-wise direction &#x2018;H&#x2019;. Accordingly, a distance between the magnet <b>210</b> and the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> is the least when the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> is vertically above the magnet <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The magnet sensing element <b>212</b> may generate the position signal <b>214</b> (not numbered in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) based on its distance from the magnet <b>210</b>. The distance between the magnet <b>210</b> and the magnet sensing element <b>212</b>, or more generally, the distance between the position indicator <b>210</b> and the sensing element <b>212</b>, may also be referred to as a sensing distance. The position signal <b>214</b> may be, for example, an electrical signal, such as a voltage signal.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> varies with the change in sensing distance. In an example, the magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> may be inversely proportional to the sensing distance. Accordingly, the magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> output by the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> may be highest when the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> is vertically above the magnet <b>210</b>.

The magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> when the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> is vertically above the magnet <b>210</b> may be referred to as being of a first value.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Since the magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> varies with the change in the sensing distance and since the sensing distance changes during the movement of the print carriage <b>302</b> along the carriage rod <b>304</b>; the magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> varies during the movement of the print carriage <b>302</b> along the carriage rod <b>304</b>. Accordingly, the position of the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>, on which the magnet <b>210</b> is disposed, may be determined based on the magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> during the movement of the print carriage <b>302</b> along the carriage rod <b>304</b>, as will be explained below:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Consider that the print carriage <b>302</b> is at a first point, such as the first end <b>416</b>, of the carriage rod <b>304</b>.

During such a movement of the print carriage <b>302</b>, the magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> generated by the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> changes as the sensing distance changes. While the magnitude of the position signal <b>214</b> changes, for one position of the print carriage <b>302</b> on the carriage rod <b>304</b>, the sensing distance becomes less than the threshold distance, and the magnitude becomes equal to the first value. The sensing distance becomes less than the threshold distance when the distance between the magnet <b>210</b> and the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> is the minimum possible value of the sensing distance. Subsequently, as the print carriage <b>302</b> moves away from that position, the sensing distance increases, and the magnitude changes. The distance of the position at which the magnitude equaled the first value corresponds to the position of the magnet <b>210</b>.

Beyond the distance of 70 mm, the output voltage decreases from the peak value for further increase in the distance. The peak value may be the first value of position signal <b>214</b> explained above. Such a pattern of output voltage may be obtained because the analog Hall sensor may be closest to the magnet <b>210</b>, i.e., the sensing distance may be less than the threshold distance, when the print carriage <b>302</b> is 70 mm away from the first end <b>416</b>. For instance, the analog Hall sensor may be vertically above the magnet <b>210</b> when the print carriage <b>302</b> is 70 mm away from the first end <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Since the media tray <b>202</b> extends in width parallel to the carriage rod <b>304</b>, the distance of the print carriage <b>302</b> from the first end <b>416</b> may correspond to another distance from a lateral end <b>420</b> of the media tray <b>202</b>.

Therefore, the magnet <b>210</b> may be determined to be near the point that is 70 mm away from the lateral end <b>420</b>. Since the magnet <b>210</b> is disposed on the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>, the position of the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> on the media tray <b>202</b> may also be deduced. Further, since the position of the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> on the media tray <b>202</b> indicates the size of the printable medium <b>102</b>, the size of the printable medium <b>102</b> can be determined.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">As will be understood from the above, the distance from the first end <b>416</b> at which the peak output of the position signal <b>214</b> is obtained (70 mm in the above example) corresponds to a size of the printable medium. Such a distance, at which the peak output is obtained, may be referred to as a peak distance. Accordingly, in an example, the controller <b>218</b> may utilize a first look-up table (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) having a mapping between various peak positions and their corresponding sizes of printable media. Accordingly, upon determining the peak position during the travel of the print carriage <b>302</b> between the first point and the second point, the controller <b>218</b> can determine the size of the printable medium <b>102</b> using the first look-up table.

For example, a position signal of magnitude between 0.60 V and 0.68 V may be specified as indicating a sensing distance less than the threshold distance. Therefore, even if the magnitude of the position signal does not reach the value of 0.68 V, for example, due to ageing of components or other reasons, the position of the magnet <b>210</b> can be determined. In a further example, even if the magnitude of the position signal does not reach a peak value, the peak value may be deduced from discrete values (0.22 V, 0.46 V, . . . in the above table) using a curve fitting technique, According to the curve fitting technique, a best fit curve is fitted on the discrete values. On the best fit curve, the peak value may be determined. Further, the peak distance corresponding to the peak value may also, be determined. Based on the peak distance, the size of the printable medium may be determined.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">In an example, instead of the analog Hall sensor, a digital Hall sensor may be used as the magnet sensing element <b>212</b>. The digital Hall sensor may output the position signal <b>214</b> as a binary value. For instance, if the sensing distance is less than the threshold distance, the position signal <b>214</b> may be &#x2018;high&#x2019; or &#x2018;1&#x2019; and if the sensing distance is greater than the threshold distance, the position signal <b>214</b> may be &#x2018;low&#x2019; or &#x2018;0&#x2019;.

For this, the magnet <b>210</b> and the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> are to face each other. However, in the present example, the first adjuster leg <b>204</b>, to which the magnet <b>210</b> is coupled, and the print carriage <b>302</b>, to which the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> is coupled do not face each other. Accordingly, to facilitate the magnet <b>210</b> and the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> to face each other, the printing device <b>700</b> includes an extension element <b>712</b>, to which the magnet <b>210</b> may be coupled.

Even in such cases, the least value of the sensing distance is obtained when the magnet <b>210</b> is vertically above the magnet sensing element <b>212</b>. Accordingly, the sensing distance is less than the threshold distance for the aligned position.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">In an example, the extension element <b>712</b> may be an L-shaped bracket. Further, the dimensions of the L-shaped bracket may be such that the magnet <b>210</b> faces the magnet sensing element <b>212</b> when the print carriage <b>302</b> slides along the carriage rod <b>304</b>. This causes generation of the position signal <b>214</b> having the first value. Thus, by determining the distance of the print carriage <b>302</b> from the first end <b>416</b> at which the first value of position signal <b>214</b> is received, the size of the printable medium <b>102</b> can be determined, as explained earlier.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">To determine the distance of the print carriage <b>302</b> from the first end <b>416</b>, in an example, the printing device <b>700</b> includes the encoder strip <b>422</b>, The encoder strip <b>422</b> may run parallel to the carriage rod <b>304</b> and a portion of the print carriage <b>302</b> may extend rearwardly and over the encoder strip <b>422</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0089">In an example, to cause the print carriage <b>302</b> to slide along the carriage rod <b>304</b>, in an example, the controller <b>218</b> may instruct the motor <b>704</b> to rotate. During the sliding of the print carriage <b>302</b>, the controller <b>218</b> may continue to determine position of the print carriage <b>302</b> based on signals received from the encoder strip <b>422</b>. Based on the position, the controller <b>218</b> may control movement of the print carriage <b>302</b>. Thus, a closed-loop control of the movement of the print carriage <b>304</b> is achieved.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0090">Although the carriage motor and endless belt are explained with reference to the L-path printing device alone, it will be understood that these components can be used in the C-path printing device as well. Also, although the present subject matter has been explained with the help of examples in which the sensing element is movable relative to the adjuster leg, in some cases, the sensing element may be disposed on the adjuster leg and the position indicator, such as the magnet, may be movable relative to the adjuster leg. In such cases, the first element <b>110</b> may be the sensing element and the second element <b>112</b> may be the position indicator. Further, although the extension element <b>712</b> is explained with reference to the L-path printing device alone, in some cases, the extension element <b>712</b> may be used in C-path printing devices facilitate the position indicator and the sensing element to face each other.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">Now, the control of the movement of the print carriage <b>302</b> by the controller <b>218</b> for the determination of the size of the printable medium <b>102</b> will be explained.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the printing device <b>100</b> that is to control movement of the print carriage <b>302</b>, according to an example implementation of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0093">In an example, the controller <b>218</b> causes the print carriage <b>302</b> to slide along the carriage rod <b>304</b> once the printable medium <b>102</b> is placed on the media tray <b>202</b> and the first adjuster leg <b>204</b> and/or the second adjuster leg <b>402</b> are adjusted to be disposed adjacent to the printable medium. To determine that the printable medium <b>102</b> is placed and that the adjuster legs are adjusted, the controller <b>218</b> utilizes a signal from a sensor. In an example, the sensor may be a media tray sensor <b>802</b> that senses or detects insertion of the media tray <b>202</b> into the body of the printing device <b>100</b>. The media tray sensor <b>802</b> may be disposed in the body of the printing device <b>100</b> and may face the media tray <b>202</b> when the media tray <b>202</b> is inserted. The media tray sensor <b>802</b> may be, for example, an optical sensor. Upon sensing the insertion, the media tray sensor <b>802</b> may generate a tray insertion signal. The tray insertion signal may be received by the controller <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0094">As explained earlier, the media tray <b>202</b> may be inserted into the body of the printing device <b>100</b> after placement of the printable medium <b>102</b> and adjustment of the adjuster legs.

The printable media sensor <b>804</b> may also be disposed in the body of the printing device <b>100</b> and may face the media tray <b>202</b>. The printable media sensor <b>804</b> may sense the placement of the printable medium <b>102</b> after the media tray <b>202</b> with the printable medium <b>102</b> is inserted. Upon sensing the printable medium <b>102</b>, the printable media sensor <b>804</b> may generate a media placement signal. The media placement signal may be received by the controller <b>218</b>. Upon receiving the media placement signal, the controller <b>218</b> may cause the print carriage <b>302</b> to slide along the carriage rod <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0096">In a further example, the controller <b>218</b> may cause the print carriage <b>302</b> to slide along the carriage rod <b>304</b> if any of the tray insertion signal and media placement signal is received. The controller <b>218</b> may cause the print carriage <b>302</b> to slide along the carriage rod <b>304</b> for size determination once after the printing device <b>100</b> is powered up.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0097">The receiving of the tray insertion signal, receiving of the media placement signal, and instruction of the print carriage <b>302</b> may be performed by, execution of machine-readable instructions (interchangeably referred to as &#x201c;the instructions&#x201d;) <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, and <b>810</b> respectively. The instructions <b>806</b>-<b>810</b> may be, stored in a memory <b>812</b> of the printing device <b>100</b>, The memory <b>812</b> may include any non-transitory computer-readable medium including, for example, volatile memory such as RAM, or non-volatile memory such as EPROM, flash memory, and the like.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0098">The sliding of the print carriage <b>302</b> along the carriage rod <b>304</b> facilitates determination of size of the printable medium, as explained earlier. Upon determining the size of the printable medium, when a print command is received from a computing device, the printing device <b>100</b> can print on the printable medium print based on the determined size.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0099">The present subject matter provides for an accurate determination of sizes of printable media. The present subject matter utilizes simple and cost-effective components for the size determination. Since the second element, such as the magnet sensing element, can move relative to the adjuster, a magnitude of the position signal varies during movement of the second element relative to the adjuster. This allows for an accurate size determination without the use of multiple stationary sensors. Further, since the second element is coupled to the print carriage, which is already utilized in printers, a separate component to move the sensing element is not to be provided.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0100">The techniques of the present subject matter can be utilized by printers in scenarios where the printers are to automatically determine the size of the printable medium.
