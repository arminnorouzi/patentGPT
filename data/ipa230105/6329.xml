id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0001">The invention relates to the field of secure key control and concerns a locking mechanism operating with a NFC system and configured to switch between a locked state and an unlocked state.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Electromechanical lock and key with identification code are widespread. They enable authorized key holders to have access to locked rooms if the identification code of the key corresponds to a predetermined code in relation with the electromechanical lock. The key may be an ordinary looking key to insert into the lock.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">The electromechanical lock comprises a processor configured to compare the identification code of the key with the predetermined code. If the identification code corresponds to the predetermined code, the electromechanical lock switches from its locked state to its unlocked state.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Commonly locks, also called locking mechanisms, are formed with a body that can be easily unscrewed by a locksmith to facilitate rekeying. The body has the function to lock and unlock the lock. A lock body may be found under the form of a European cylinder (defined by the DIN18251). A European cylinder is a type of lock cylinder. There exist other profiles of lock bodies like the oval cylinder that is used in the Nordic countries. A body may not be in the form of a cylinder. A lock body may be inserted into a lock or a mortise lock or a slot-in lock. This function offers the advantage of allowing its change without altering the boltwork hardware. Removing the body typically requires only loosening a set screw, then sliding the body from the boltwork.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The smart locking mechanism comprises an interface configured to receive an identification code from an identification key. The identification key communicates with the locking mechanism using a NFC system or another RF technology that uses a passive device. NFC stands for Near Field Communication. It is a wireless technology for near field applications. In general NFC is used to communicate within a 5 centimeters distance using the 13.56 MHz frequency. The NFC system comprises an active part, called the reader, and a passive part, called the tag. When operating, the reader generates an initial 13.56 MHz signal. If powerful enough, this signal powers up the tag and a communication link is activated between the reader and the tag.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">NFC systems are used in a large variety of applications such as pay by phone, contactless payment with the credit card, building access badge, etc. In these applications, the tag and its antenna are flat, and the antennas used with the reader are also flat. When provided with energy, the chip of the tag sends data to the reader. The tag may also receive data from the reader. And more generally the tag may communicate any kind of information. There is a communication between the active and the passive part.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">When used within a locking mechanism, the tag is positioned within the identification key and the reader is positioned within the locking mechanism. If the communication between the tag and the reader, i.e. between the key and the lock mechanism, is successful, the locking mechanism is unlocked, thus enabling the user to open/close the door.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">More precisely the tag comprises an antenna and a chip and operates as follows: the magnetic radiations from the reader antenna provides the tag with energy via the tag antenna. Being fed with energy, the chip of the tag sends data to the reader. If the data sent from the tag to the reader are in agreement with the data expected from the reader, the identification key is recognized as an authorized one and the reader sends an authorization signal to the processor of the locking mechanism to unlock the door. It is to be noticed that the tag may also receive data from the reader, and/or may communicate any kind of information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">In order to ensure a high level of security of the locking mechanism, the tag is equipped with a hardware cryptographic engine. It results that the tag requires a lot of energy to run its cryptographic hardware.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Additionally, the tag must fit in the identification key, which is very similar to an ordinary looking key. It means that the tag diameter should not exceed 5 millimeters and the tag length should be less than 12 millimeters. Last but not least, the locking mechanism into which the reader and its antenna are installed may comprise a metallic body and metallic parts, typically the key hole into which the identification key is to be inserted. The metallic parts prevent the radio waves from radiating properly. The radiation lines going through these zones are attenuated and scattered, thereby leading to a decrease of the energy at the disposal of the tag to operate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">There is consequently a need for establishing a connection between the active part and the passive part of a NFC system to transmit information, identification, software updates, etc. In the field of locking mechanism, there is a need for a smart locking mechanism configured to switch from a locked state to an unlocked state, based on the communication of an identification code between the locking mechanism and an authorized identification key using the NFC system, which ensures a high level of security with a complex cryptography with a low power consumption while solving the integration problems related to the small dimensions of the lock mechanism. The identification key enables the authentication with the lock. Therefore, the user can unlock the door, or lock it. It enables also all type of communication between the tag and the door.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The proposed solution to overcome this drawback is a locking mechanism with the establishment of NFC communication between the locking mechanism and the identification key, with a particular cooperation of the NFC passive part of the

level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0050">Although many of the features of this invention are described in relation to a door, it is understood that they are generally applicable to any opening unit, such as a window. Moreover, these features are also applicable to many other devices, for example a padlock, having a locked state and an unlocked state.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0051">In order to illustrate the invention, the explanations are related to a door. Note that these explanations may be applied similarly to any opening unit. A door is an opening unit enabling the access to a room (or from a room to the outside) through an aperture. The door is connected to a door frame that frames the aperture and is fixed to the walls around the aperture. In an unlocked state of the door, the door is mobile in relation to the door frame, typically mobile in rotation around doors hinges (or in translation in the case the door and the door frame are configured to let the door slide through a part of the door frame and into the wall). The door may be in an open configuration or a closed configuration. In the closed configuration, the door covers the aperture (i.e. no one can go through the aperture). Typically the door is equipped with a lock mechanism. The lock mechanism has a latch that is either inserted into a slot of the door frame (the door is closed) or retracted inside the door (the door is no longer attached to the door frame and may be open). In the closed configuration, the latch is inserted into the slot of the door frame. In existing lock mechanisms, a lock clutch is connected to the latch. The lock clutch is usually engaged with both the indoor and outdoor door knobs. This enables a user to activate the lock clutch to make the latch move by moving one of the door knobs. Therefore a user has to move a door knob of the door to switch from the closed configuration of the door to the open configuration of the door. Indeed, the lock clutch being engaged with the knob, the movement of the knob leads to the movement of the latch. Moving the door knob makes the latch retract into the door. The user can pull or push the door to open it.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0052">In the closed configuration of the door, the lock mechanism can be either in a locked state or an unlocked state. The unlocked state corresponds to the case discussed above. The door may be open by a user when activating a door knob and pushing or pulling the door. More precisely, the lock mechanism has a deadbolt entirely positioned inside the locking mechanism in the unlocked state. In the locked state, this deadbolt projects beyond the lock mechanism and is inserted into a slot of the door frame, thus locking the door to the frame. The movement of the deadbolt can be mechanically obtained, for example by a rotation of a key inserted into the locking mechanism. The rotation of the key clockwise, respectively anticlockwise, causes the deadbolt to translate either outside the lock mechanism to be inserted into the slot of the door frame, or inside the lock mechanism. To switch from the locked state of the door to the unlocked state of the door, a user has to rotate the key with the corresponding rotation of the key inside the lock mechanism. As an alternative to a rotation of the key, the lock mechanism may be unlocked by an authorized identification key. It is for example possible to authenticate with a smartphone (with BLE-Bluetooth Low Energy-) in addition to the key. But the user will have to rotate with his/her hand the outside handle of the lock and rotate with the corresponding rotation exactly the same way as if the user was using a key. Indeed, once authenticate the motor moves and enables the user to move the deadlock. Then the user can move the deadlock in the way he/she wants. When it is identified in the vicinity of the lock mechanism, the authorized identification key may activate a motor in the lock mechanism that causes the deadbolt to translate. More precisely the motor can only enable the user to move the deadbolt using the key or the outside handle. Then, to open the door, the user turns a door knob or pushes a door handle of the door, as explained before. In other words, the locked state corresponds to the fact that the user cannot action the door (i.e. open it or close it).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0053">These explanations are intended to understand the meaning of the wording of locked state and unlocked state of the locking mechanism used in the description.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically represents a locking mechanism <b>10</b> and an identification key <b>13</b> adapted to implement the invention.
