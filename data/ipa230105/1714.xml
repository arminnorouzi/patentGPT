The drive cam <b>91</b> is located in the &#x2212;Z direction with respect to the drive pin <b>77</b>. The guide groove <b>93</b> is formed on a side surface, that is, an outer circumferential surface, of the drive cam <b>91</b>. The drive pin <b>77</b> is engaged with the guide groove <b>93</b>. The guide groove <b>93</b> has an annular shape in a circumferential direction of the drive cam <b>91</b>, that is, a substantially elliptical circumferential shape inclined in the Y direction and includes an orthogonal section <b>95</b>, a first guide groove <b>97</b>, and a second guide groove <b>99</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The orthogonal section <b>95</b> is provided in the +Y direction end of the outer circumferential surface of the drive cam <b>91</b> and extends in a direction orthogonal to the Y direction serving as the movement direction of the first blade <b>19</b>, that is, the X direction.

At this time, the orthogonal section <b>95</b> suppresses movement of the drive pin <b>77</b> in the Y direction. Thus, movement of the first blade <b>19</b> in the Y direction is suppressed. Accordingly, even in an instance in which the printing apparatus <b>1</b> is subjected to an impact, for example, when a user drops the printing apparatus <b>1</b> onto the floor or knocks the printing apparatus <b>1</b> against an object while carrying the printing apparatus <b>1</b>, it is possible to suppress movement of the first blade <b>19</b> in the Y direction. As a result, it is possible to suppress a failure of the cutter <b>15</b>, such as a failure in which the first blade <b>19</b> overlaps the second blade <b>21</b> on the side opposite to the typical side, that is, in the &#x2212;X direction, when the first blade <b>19</b> moves in response to such an impact.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the drive cam <b>91</b> rotates in a first rotational direction, that is, counterclockwise when viewed from the &#x2212;Y direction side, in a state in which the drive pin <b>77</b> is engaged with the orthogonal section <b>95</b>, the drive pin <b>77</b> moves relatively from the orthogonal section <b>95</b> to the first guide groove <b>97</b>. When the drive cam <b>91</b> rotates in the first rotational direction in a state in which the drive pin <b>77</b> is engaged with the first guide groove <b>97</b>, the first guide groove <b>97</b> guides the drive pin <b>77</b> in the &#x2212;Y direction to guide the first blade <b>19</b> in the &#x2212;Y direction from the standby position to the cutting position.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the drive cam <b>91</b> further rotates in the first rotational direction in the state in which the drive pin <b>77</b> is engaged with the first guide groove <b>97</b>, the drive pin <b>77</b> moves relatively from the first guide groove <b>97</b> to the second guide groove <b>99</b>. When the drive cam <b>91</b> rotates in the first rotational direction in a state in which the drive pin <b>77</b> is engaged with the second guide groove <b>99</b>, the second guide groove <b>99</b> guides the drive pin <b>77</b> in the +Y direction to guide the first blade <b>19</b> in the +Y direction from the cutting position to the standby position.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the drive cam <b>91</b> further rotates in the first rotational direction in the state in which the drive pin <b>77</b> is engaged with the second guide groove <b>99</b>, the drive pin <b>77</b> moves relatively from the second guide groove <b>99</b> to the orthogonal section <b>95</b>. When the drive pin <b>77</b> returns to the orthogonal section <b>95</b>, the first blade <b>19</b> also returns to the standby position.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this manner, when the drive cam <b>91</b> makes a substantially half rotation in the first rotational direction in the state in which the drive pin <b>77</b> is engaged with the orthogonal section <b>95</b>, the drive pin <b>77</b> moves in the &#x2212;Y direction, and the first blade <b>19</b> moves from the standby position to the cutting position. When the drive cam <b>91</b> further makes a substantially half rotation in the first rotational direction, the drive pin <b>77</b> moves in the +Y direction, and the first blade <b>19</b> returns from the cutting position to the standby position. In this manner, since the rotational direction of the drive cam <b>91</b> is the same between when the first blade <b>19</b> is caused to move in the &#x2212;Y direction from the standby position to the cutting position and when the first blade <b>19</b> is caused to move in the +Y direction from the cutting position to the standby position, it is possible to simplify the structure of the cutter unit <b>17</b> and control of the cutter unit <b>17</b>. Note that movement of the first blade <b>19</b> to the standby position and movement of the first blade <b>19</b> to the cutting position are detected by a sensor (not illustrated).
