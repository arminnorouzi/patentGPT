In addition, a corresponding device, a corresponding computer program and computer-readable storage medium shall be created.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object is achieved by the features of the one or more embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first aspect is characterized by a method for operating a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the first aspect, first personal information is captured. The first personal information is representative of a first occupant of the vehicle. Second personal information is captured. The second personal information is representative of a second occupant of the vehicle. Vehicle information is provided. The vehicle information is representative of a specified set of vehicle functions and dependencies between the vehicle functions that exist when they are executed. If first request information, which is representative of a first request by the first occupant for a first vehicle function from the predefined set of vehicle functions, and second request information, which is representative of a second request by the second occupant for a second vehicle function from the predefined set of vehicle functions, are captured, the vehicle information, the first request information and the second request information are used as a basis for ascertaining whether the first request for the first vehicle function and the second request for the second vehicle function have a correlation, such that prioritization should take place with regard to execution of the first vehicle function and execution of the second vehicle function. If such a correlation exists, the first personal information and the second personal information are used as a basis for ascertaining first proposal information. The first proposal information is representative of the way in which the priority is to be given with regard to the execution of the first vehicle function and the execution of the second vehicle function. Depending on the first proposal information, the first vehicle function and/or the second vehicle function is or are executed for operating the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method according to the first aspect makes it possible to provide a procedure for executing the first vehicle function and executing the second vehicle function in the event of such a correlation. This is particularly advantageous if the first request for the first vehicle function and the second request for the second vehicle function show such a correlation. Such a correlation can also be described in terms of a competition or conflict caused between the first occupant's request and the second occupant's request. The method according to the second aspect can be used to ascertain the first proposal information which is representative of one or more possible solutions to the conflict. For example, this can reduce the potential for conflict between the first occupant and the second occupant and allow for comfortable driving. As a result, this can enable safe operation of the vehicle in traffic.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The vehicle can be any vehicle, such as a vehicle with a battery-powered electric drive and/or a vehicle with an internal combustion engine and/or a so-called hybrid vehicle and/or a vehicle that can be operated partially or fully automatically, or similar.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first personal information and/or the second personal information is captured depending on one or more sensors of the vehicle, which are appropriately designed. The one or more sensors comprise, for example, a microphone and/or a camera, such as a camera for monitoring an interior of the vehicle and/or a camera for monitoring an exterior of the vehicle or similar, and/or a sensor for detecting an access authorization device (so-called &#x201c;ID sensor&#x201d;) of the first occupant and/or the second occupant, for example, a vehicle key that can be assigned to the first occupant and/or the second occupant, or similar.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first personal information can comprise a first item of characteristic information about the first occupant. The first characteristic information item is representative of one or more of the following characteristics or preferences of the first occupant: for example, an age of the first occupant and/or an age group of the first occupant, such as &#x201c;old&#x201d; or &#x201c;young&#x201d;, and/or a personal class of the first occupant, such as &#x201c;adult&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;child&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;chauffeur&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;passenger&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;driver&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;front-seat passenger&#x201d; or similar, and/or a gender of the first occupant, or similar.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second personal information can comprise a second item of characteristic information about the second occupant, wherein the second characteristic information item can have the same features as the first characteristic information.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, part of the first personal information and/or part of the second personal information may already be stored in a data memory of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally or alternatively, another part of the first personal information and/or another part of the second personal information may be stored on a server located externally to the vehicle and made available to the vehicle by this server. For example, the vehicle and the server have corresponding communication interfaces. The server can be part of a backend (server) and/or cloud or similar. This means that the remaining part of the first personal information and/or the remaining part of the second personal information can be provided based on a mobile terminal of the first occupant and/or a mobile terminal of the second occupant. For example, the first occupant's mobile device and/or the second occupant's mobile device is or are each representative of a mobile phone and/or a smartphone and/or tablet computer and/or a computer or similar. The other part of the first personal information and/or the other part of the second personal information is or are ascertained, for example, by the corresponding mobile terminal device based on an application or application software (so-called &#x201c;app&#x201d;) that is installed or available on the corresponding mobile terminal.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The vehicle information can be stored in the data memory of the vehicle. Additionally or alternatively, the vehicle information is acquired based on one or more sensors of the vehicle, which are appropriately designed. For example, the one or more sensors include the microphone and/or the camera. The specified set of vehicle functions is ascertained, for example, depending on the equipment features of the vehicle. The vehicle's equipment features can be any equipment features, such as controls and/or interior and/or exterior elements. For example, the vehicle's equipment features include one or more of the following: a vehicle type, such as a &#x201c;saloon&#x201d; or similar, and/or a vehicle display device and/or a vehicle air conditioning system and/or a vehicle heating system and/or a vehicle seat and/or a vehicle seat heater, and/or a vehicle lighting device and/or a vehicle entertainment system (so-called &#x201c;infotainment system&#x201d;) and/or a loudspeaker in the vehicle and/or an application installed in the vehicle and/or a digital service of the vehicle and/or a menu or menu navigation system that is displayed on the vehicle display device or similar. For example, a digital service may be a service designed to play a music request depending on the loudspeaker and/or to determine a route to a point of interest (PoI) and/or to book appointments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, the vehicle information comprises spatial assignments of the vehicle functions within the vehicle, such as a first seat heater being assigned to a first seat and a second seat heater being assigned to a second seat and/or a first display device being assigned to the first seat and a second display device being assigned to the second seat.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Any particular vehicle function from the set of vehicle functions can be executed in connection with one or more equipment features. For example, the specified set of vehicle functions comprises one or more of the following: a vehicle function for controlling the seat heater and/or a vehicle function for controlling the air conditioning system and/or a vehicle function for controlling the lighting device and/or a vehicle function for controlling the heating system and/or a vehicle function for controlling the entertainment system, or similar.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The dependencies between the vehicle functions that exist during their execution are representative, for example, of which of the vehicle functions can be executed dependent on or independently of each other.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first request information and/or the second request information is or are captured depending on one or more sensors of the vehicle which are appropriately designed. The one or more sensors comprise, for example, the microphone and/or camera and/or an input device of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first request can include activation and/or deactivation and/or adaptation of the first vehicle function.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second request can include activation and/or deactivation and/or adaptation of the second vehicle function.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first request information can also be representative of multiple first requests of the first occupant regarding multiple first vehicle functions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second request information can also be representative of multiple second requests of the second occupant regarding multiple second vehicle functions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, the first request can be representative of the first occupant wanting to set a temperature to a first specified value in a region of the first seat. For example, the second request can be representative of the second occupant wanting to set a temperature to a second specified value in a region of the second seat.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first vehicle function and the second vehicle function can be different vehicle functions or the same vehicle function.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, a dependency is determined between the first vehicle function and the second vehicle function depending on the vehicle function.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the first request for the first vehicle function and the second request for the second vehicle function will have such a correlation whenever the execution of the first vehicle function and the execution of the second vehicle function are not possible, or only to a limited extent, for example due to the dependency between the first vehicle function and the second vehicle function. This can be the case, for example, if it is ascertained based on the first set temperature and the second set temperature that a temperature gradient would be above a specified threshold. For example, the vehicle information includes the specified threshold.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the first request for the first vehicle function and the second request for the second vehicle function will have no such correlation if the execution of the first vehicle function and the execution of the second vehicle function are possible. This can be the case, for example, if it is ascertained based on the first set temperature and the second set temperature that the temperature gradient would not exceed the specified threshold value.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, the first request information is ascertained at a first time point or in a first time interval. For example, the second request information is ascertained at a second time point or in a second time interval. For example, at the second time point, execution of the first vehicle function for the first request is not yet completed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first proposal information may comprise one or more proposals, each of which is representative of a particular way of prioritizing the execution of the first vehicle function relative to the execution of the second vehicle function.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, a particular proposal comprises a weighting figure that is representative of how suitable the particular intended prioritization method is for enabling a traffic-safe and/or comfortable operation of the vehicle with respect to the first occupant and/or the second occupant. For example, the vehicle can automatically execute the first vehicle function and/or the second vehicle function for operating the vehicle, depending on the first proposal information. For example, this is achieved according to a proposal that has the highest weighting figure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The prioritization to be used with regard to the execution of the first vehicle function and the execution of the second vehicle function can be carried out, for example, in such a way that the first vehicle function and the second vehicle function are executed consecutively. Alternatively, only the first vehicle function may be executed. Alternatively, only the second vehicle function may be executed. Alternatively, the execution of the first vehicle function can be started first and the execution of the second vehicle function may in some cases be started during the execution of the first vehicle function, temporally overlapping it.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method according to the first aspect and its optional embodiments can also be extended accordingly to multiple first occupants or multiple second occupants.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with an optional embodiment of the first aspect, the first personal information includes first personal prioritization information. The first personal prioritization information is representative of a prioritization of the first occupant. Additionally or alternatively, the second personal information includes second personal prioritization information. The second personal prioritization information is representative of a prioritization of the second occupant.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This makes it possible to prioritize the first occupant and/or the second occupant. This is advantageous, for example, if a personal class of the first occupant differs from a personal class of the second occupant. This allows different vehicle occupants to be prioritized differently.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The prioritization of the first occupant and/or the prioritization of the second occupant can take place, for example, in the context of determining the proposal information.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, the other part of the first personal information provided by the external server includes the first personal prioritization information.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the other part of the second personal information provided by the external server includes the second personal prioritization information.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">This means that the first prioritization information and/or the second prioritization information can be provided based on a mobile terminal of the first occupant and/or the mobile terminal of the second occupant.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, the vehicle comprises a digital voice assistant which is designed to interact with the first occupant and/or the second occupant depending on the input device of the vehicle and/or an output device of the vehicle. For example, the output device comprises the display device of the vehicle and/or the loudspeaker of the vehicle, or similar.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, the first prioritization information and/or the second prioritization information can be specified depending on the input device and/or the digital voice assistant and/or the menu navigation system and/or the microphone.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with a further optional embodiment of the first aspect, the first proposal information is provided to the first occupant and/or the second occupant. A first user input of the first occupant and/or the second occupant is captured. Depending on the first user input, the first vehicle function and/or the second vehicle function is or are executed for operating the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">This makes it possible for the first occupant and/or the second occupant to select one of the proposals of the first proposal information.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the first proposal information is provided to the first occupant and/or the second occupant depending on the digital voice assistant and/or the output device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first user input is captured depending on one or more sensors of the vehicle, which are appropriately designed. The one or more sensors comprise, for example, the microphone and/or the camera and/or the input device of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Multiple first user inputs can also be captured. For example, a first user input by the first occupant is captured and a further first user input by the second occupant.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In accordance with a further optional embodiment of the first aspect, the first vehicle function and/or the second vehicle function is or are executed for operating the vehicle depending on the first personal information and/or the second personal information.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">This makes it possible, in particular in case multiple first user inputs are captured, to prioritize one of the corresponding user inputs depending on the first personal information and/or the second personal information.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, it is ascertained that the first occupant should be prioritized over the second occupant depending on the first personal prioritization information and/or the second personal prioritization information. In this case, the first vehicle function and/or the second vehicle function is or are executed for operating the vehicle depending on the first user input of the first occupant.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alternatively, it is ascertained that the second occupant should be prioritized over the first occupant depending on the first personal prioritization information and/or the second personal prioritization information. In this case, the first vehicle function and/or the second vehicle function is or are executed for operating the vehicle depending on the additional first user input of the first occupant, in particular according to the prioritization of the respective occupants.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with a further optional embodiment of the first aspect, the first personal information is representative of a first spatial assignment of the first occupant within the vehicle. Additionally or alternatively, the first personal information includes a first user history of the first occupant. Additionally or alternatively, the second personal information is representative of a second spatial assignment of the second occupant within the vehicle. In addition or alternatively, the second personal information includes the second user history of the second occupant.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first spatial assignment is captured depending on one or more sensors of the vehicle, which are appropriately designed. The one or more sensors comprise, for example, the vehicle's camera. The first spatial assignment is representative of a first position where the first occupant is located in the vehicle. In particular, the first spatial assignment can be representative of whether the first occupant is occupying a driver's seat of the vehicle or a front passenger seat of the vehicle or another passenger seat of the vehicle or a rear seat of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first spatial assignment of the first occupant within the vehicle makes it possible to ascertain the first proposal information efficiently. It can also be used, for example, to ascertain the personal class of the first occupant. The second spatial assignment is captured depending on one or more sensors of the vehicle, which are appropriately designed. The one or more sensors comprise, for example, the vehicle's camera. The second spatial assignment is representative of a second position where the second occupant is located in the vehicle. In particular, the second spatial assignment can be representative of whether the second occupant is occupying a driver's seat of the vehicle or a front passenger seat of the vehicle or another passenger seat of the vehicle or a rear seat of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The second spatial assignment of the second occupant within the vehicle makes it possible to ascertain the first proposal information efficiently. It can also be used, for example, to ascertain the personal class of the second occupant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first user history of the first occupant comprises, for example, a personalized customer profile and/or a collection of information relating to the first occupant, which was provided, in particular, before carrying out the method in accordance with the first aspect. For example, the additional part of the first personal information provided by the external server includes the first user history.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first user history of the first occupant makes it possible to ascertain the first proposal information efficiently.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The second user history of the second occupant comprises, for example, a personalized customer profile and/or a collection of information relating to the second occupant, which was provided, in particular, before carrying out the method in accordance with the first aspect.
