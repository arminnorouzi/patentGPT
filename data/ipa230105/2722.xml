Thrombosis is the formation of the blood clot, which is referred to as a thrombus, inside a blood vessel. The blood vessel may be a vein, an artery, or a capillary. A thrombus typically obstructs, to varying degrees, the flow of blood through the circulatory system. In vivo, antithrombotic and/or anticoagulant agents are used to reduce the clotting response, but these have not proven useful in reducing or eliminating the thrombosis observed during the transplantation of a decellularized organ, tissue, or scaffold.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a method of recellularizing a tissue or organ matrix is provided. Such a method typically includes perfusing a tissue or organ matrix, e.g., a perfusion decellularized tissue or organ matrix, with a physiological buffer under pressure; and reendothelializing the tissue or organ matrix by perfusing the tissue or organ matrix with a physiological composition comprising a population of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells. An exemplary population of differentiated endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells may be detected using immunocytochemical techniques known in the art including, for example, dual-label immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase methods that use antibodies that detect cell proteins to distinguish the cellular characteristics or phenotypic properties of endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells. Cellular markers for endothelial cells include for example, VE-cadherin, CD144, CD141, CD 106, or CD142 whereas cellular markers for smooth muscle cells includes Flk Immunocytochemistry can also be used to identify endothelial cells, by detecting the expression of endothelial cell genes such as CD31 and e-NOS. Mature endothelial cell populations should be relatively absent of hematopoietic cells such at CD45+ populations. In situ hybridization histochemistry may also be performed, using cDNA or RNA probes specific for the endothelial gene mRNAs. These techniques can be combined with immunocytochemical methods to enhance the identification of specific phenotypes. The antibodies and molecular probes discussed above can be applied to Western and Northern blot procedures respectively to aid in cell identification. In one embodiment, the substantially pure population is at least 50%, 60%, 70% or more, such as 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or 100% endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells. Perfusion decellularization is s an ex vivo method of decellularizing a mammalian organ, part (portion) of an organ or vascularized tissue where a decellularization solution is perfused through organ, part of an organ or vascularized tissue to facilitate decellularization while maintaining the vascular conduits. The resulting decellularized organ, matrix, tissue scaffold or graft retains a vascular system comprising of an arterial supply, interstial space where capillary beds reside and venous output such that fluid or cells can be introduced via one or more entry points, e.g., one or more vessels, and exit the organ, matrix, tissue or graft through a different route. Whole organs will a primary artery input will have complete venous return of fluid. Isolated portions of organs or tissues will have a combination of venous return and fluid exiting via the exposed interstial matrix where the tissue or potion of the organ was excised. When present, the organ capsule remains intact, e.g., does not facilitate the movement of aqueous liquid across the capsule which is in contrast to organs subjected to immersion decellularization.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Representative endothelial cells include, without limitation, blood endothelial cells, bone marrow endothelial cells, circulating endothelial cells, human aorta endothelial cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells, human lung microvascular endothelial cells, human microvascular endothelial cells, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, human saphenous vein endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, microvessel endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, retinal capillary endothelial cells, retinal microvascular endothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, umbilical cord blood endothelial cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, colony forming unit-endothelial cells (CFU-ECs), circulating angiogenic cells (CACs), circulating endothelial precursors (CEPs), endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC), low proliferative potential ECFC (LPP-ECFC), high proliferative ECFC (HPP-ECFC), or combinations thereof.

Representative biological tissues and organ matrices include, for example, heart, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, spleen, uterus, bladder, esophagus, trachea, spinal cord, joints (e.g., knees, shoulders, or hips), skin, breast, muscle, intestine, omentum, and adipose tissue. A biological matrix also can include, for example, a collagen matrix that has been secreted or remodeled by cells. Recellularizing a biological matrix as described herein typically requires that the matrix be devoid, or at least substantially devoid, of viable cells.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Biological tissues and organs can be decellularized using any number of known methods. For example, a biological tissue or organ can be decellularized using perfusion methods. See, for example, WO 2007/025233 and Ott et al. (2008, Nat. Med., 14:213-21) for descriptions of perfusion-based decellularization methods. Perfusion methods of decellularization have been shown to produce a very good matrix for recellularization. See, for example, WO 2007/025233; Ott et al. (2008, Nat. Med., 14:213-21); Uygun et al., 2010, Nat. Med., 16(7):814-20; Petersen et al., 2010, Science, e-pub June; and Ott et al., 2010, Nat. Med., e-pub July.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As an alternative to perfusion-based decellularization, biological tissues or organs can be decellularized by immersed in a decellularization solution that removes the cells. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,376,244 and 6,753,181. In addition, as an alternative to utilizing biological tissues and organ matrices, the methods of recellularization described herein can utilize synthetic tissue or organ matrices, provided that such synthetic matrices possess a vascular bed-type structure. Representative synthetic tissues and organ matrices include, for example, hydrogels, polymers (e.g., biodegradable PLGA, PLA or durable polymers such as polyurethane), collagen scaffolds, ECM matrix scaffolds including collagen fibronectin, laminin, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The methods of recellularizing a tissue or organ matrix as described herein include perfusing a tissue or organ matrix with a physiological buffer under pressure. This perfusion of the tissue or organ matrix under pressure is performed prior to introducing any cells into the matrix and, similar to the perfusion used in the decellularization process described in WO 2007/025233, is via the vasculature or other lumen or conduit structure (e.g., the trachea in lungs, the bile duct in liver, the urethra in kidney, etc.) of the organ or tissue matrix, and generally begins with cannulation of the vasculature (e.g., arteries, veins, arterioles, venules and capillaries) and/or other lumens and/or conduits (referred to hereinafter as &#x201c;vasculature-type&#x201d; structures) of an organ or tissue matrix (about 1 to about 300 Hg). Cannulation thus includes the insertion of a cannula into a body duct, cavity or vessel, as into the trachea, bladder, or a blood vessel to introduce or remove a fluid, substance or waste. As used herein, perfusion of an organ or tissue matrix under pressure refers to delivering a fluid composition (e.g., a physiological buffer) under enough pressure such that the vasculature and vasculature-type structures in the tissue or organ matrix remains open and expanded, but not so high as to cause damage or distension to the vasculature or vasculature-type structures of the tissue or organ matrix. A physiological buffer suitable for pre-cellular perfusion of a tissue or organ matrix under pressure can be any buffer that is compatible with the tissue or organ matrix. For example, physiological buffers can include nutrients such as sugars and carbohydrates, and also can include pro-endothelial factors (e.g., compounds that have a positive effect on endothelial cells or endothelium) such as, for example, compounds that induce angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF, FGF-1 and/or bFGF). A physiological buffer is generally at physiological pH.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the physiological buffer suitable for pre-cellular perfusion or cellular perfusion includes but is not limited to phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or culture media solutions suitable for endothelial cell culture including but not limited to EGM-2, EGM-2MV, DMEM, PromoCell Endothelial Cell Medium, Medium 200, DMEMF/12, buffers along with nutritional supplements, e.g., glucose, that may be employed for organ perfusion and/or preservation including transplantation. Those include, for example for heart tissues, Modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer of the following composition was prepared (in mM): 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 glucose, 1.75 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2.0 pyruvate and 5 U/L insulin or Krebs buffer containing (in mM) 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 <sub>KH2PO4</sub>, 2 CaCl2 gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2; or glucose (e.g., 11 mM) or glucose in combination with 1 or 1.2 mM palmitate. For kidney tissues, an exemplary medium is KPS-1 Kidney Perfusion Solution. For liver tissues, an exemplary medium is Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 8 mM glucose, and 1.25 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>supplemented with 2% BSA.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although not bound by any particular mechanism, it is thought that this pre-cellular perfusion under pressure opens and flushes out the matrix and, particularly, the vascular bed of the tissue or organ matrix, thereby exposing more of the matrix to the cells during re-endothelialization and allowing the establishment of a viable endothelium throughout the vasculature of the tissue or organ matrix. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that different tissues and organ matrices (e.g., from different sources, e.g., a heart, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, etc.) can withstand different amounts of pressure. The amount of pressure a particular tissue or organ matrix can withstand is related, at least in part, to the vascular bed of that particular tissue or organ matrix.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The methods of recellularizing a tissue or organ matrix as described herein also include re-endothelialization of the tissue or organ matrix with endothelial cells, endothelial derived, immature endothelial cells, or endothelial progenitor cells. Sources of endothelial cells include those obtained from an autologous harvest, e.g., a biopsy. Autologous endothelial cells may be harvested from a patient via a biopsy of an artery, vein or a specific tissue and placed into cell culture for normal outgrowth of the population. Selection of endothelial cells is achieved either through culture conditions where VEGF or bFGF suppresses contaminating cells populations including smooth muscle cells or through direct FACS sorting or other available ex vivo selection methods such as magnetic beads, microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip, affinity column or associated device for the population to select for a pure endothelial cell population based on any of the following accepted endothelial cell surface markers including but not limited to CD31, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, CD105, CD144, TEM7, CD146 and/or D2-40.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are immature endothelial cells, which have the capacity to proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into endothelial cells but have not yet acquired characteristics of mature endothelial cells. EPCs may be mobilized from bone marrow into peripheral blood (circulating EPCs) in response to certain physiological stimuli, such as, for example, tissue injury. Circulating EPCs were identified in adult human blood (Asahara et al. (1997) Science 275:964-967) and subsequent studies have suggested a role for EPCs in the maintenance of endothelial integrity and function, as well as in postnatal neovascularization. EPCs can be isolated from blood, bone marrow, or cord blood and are identified in the CD34+ cell fraction in adult human peripheral mononuclear cells. These can be isolated using CD34+ cells or CD133+ cells alone or in combination with KDR+ as an EPC-rich cell fraction in peripheral blood via direct FACS sorting or other available ex-vivo selection method such as magnetic beads, microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip, affinity column or associated device. EPCs can then either be directly perfused onto the matrix and cultured under appropriate conditions to assist with proliferation and differentiation, or cultured in-vitro to increase overall cell numbers in an EPC maintaining culture medium such as culturing for seven days in serum free StemSpan&#xae; medium (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) during the initial expansion period and supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and recombinant human (rh) Flt-3 ligand (100 ng/mL), rh stem cell factor (100 ng/mL), rh IL-3 (20 ng/mL), rh IL-6 (20 ng/mL). These cells and then be perfused into the matrix as EPCs or predifferentiated into ECs and perfused into the matrix. Differentiation of EPCs can be achieved through methods such as culturing about 3&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/1.5 mL/9.6 cm<sup>2 </sup>in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2) containing FBS (2%), hydrocortisone, hFGF, VEGF, R<sup>3</sup>-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, hEGF, gentamycin, amphotericin-B and heparin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). After three days of culture, the cells can be collected and transferred to plates coated with fibronectin (10 &#x3bc;g/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) at a density of about 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/1.5 mL/9.6 cm<sup>2 </sup>and cultured for an additional three days in fresh EGM-2 medium.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A population of allogeneic endothelial or endothelial cell precursors may be used and prepared from tissue that is allogeneic to that of the recipient and is tested for use by the well-known methods of tissue typing, to closely match the histocompatibility type of the recipient. These include but are not limited to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), genetically modified endothelial cells to reduce immunogenicity, HLA matched endothelial cells, cord blood derived endothelial cells, ECs derived from EPCs, progenitor, iPS or embryonic stem cells. Most allogeneic approaches will require the use of immunosuppression agents post transplantation. Recent studies have demonstrated the immune privileged nature of ECs derived from EPCs (Cardiovasc Res. 2010 Oct. 1; 88(1):121-9. Epub 2010 Apr. 13) where immune suppression would not be required post transplantation. Examples of EPC differentiation methods include: isolating EPC from the blood by density gradient centrifugation with Pancoll rat (PAN-Biotech), and performing a CD45&#x2212; depletion using an CD45 monoclonal antibody. The CD45 (&#x2212;) fraction is cultured in endothelial differentiation medium [EBM supplemented with 5% FCS, 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 10 ng/mL rat VEGF, 1 ng/mL bovine bFGF, 10 ng/mL murine IGF-1 (both R&#x26;D Systems), 10 ng/mL murine EGF, and 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone] in 20 mg/mL fibronectin coated dishes. Non-adherent cells were removed by medium change every 4 days. Outgrowing cell clusters appeared after about 15 to about 22 days of culture, and are picked by trypsinization inside cloning rings. PECAM-1(+) cells are selected with MACS separation using a PECAM-1 antibody and IgG1 MicroBeads. The PECAM-1(+) fraction can be further cultured up to passage 25 and can be perfused in multiple matrices.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, an alternative to employing immunosuppression techniques, methods of gene replacement or knockout using homologous recombination in stem cells, taught by Smithies et al., 317 Nature 230-234 (1985), and extended to gene replacement or knockout in cell lines (Zheng et al., 88 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 8067-8071 (1991)), can be applied to endothelial and endothelial deriving cells for the ablation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. Cells lacking MHC expression allows for the grafting of enriched endothelial cell populations across allogeneic, and perhaps even xenogeneic, histocompatibility barriers without the need to immunosuppress the recipient. General reviews and citations for the use of recombinant methods to reduce antigenicity of donor cells are also disclosed by Gruber, 54 Transplantation 1-11 (1992). Exemplary approaches to the reduction of immunogenicity of transplants by surface modification are disclosed by PCT International patent application WO 92/04033 and PCT/US99/24630. Alternatively the immunogenicity of the graft may be reduced by preparing cells from a transgenic animal that has altered or deleted MHC antigens.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Endothelial cell precursors include but are not limited to colony forming unit-endothelial cells (CFU-ECs), circulating angiogenic cells (CACs), circulating endothelial precursors (CEPs), endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC), low proliferative potential ECFC (LPP-ECFC), and high proliferative ECFC (HPP-ECFC).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells are obtained by culturing embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) under appropriate conditions to direct the stem cells down an endothelial lineage. Endothelial progenitor cells are cells that have begun to differentiate into endothelial cells (e.g., e.g., lineage-restricted; e.g., cells that are destined to become endothelial cells) but are not considered fully differentiated endothelial cells. For example, endothelial progenitor cells can express a progenitor marker such as CD133 and also can express endothelial cell marker such as, without limitation, platelet endothelial cell-adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1; aka CD31), VEGFR-1 (aka Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (aka Flk-1), guanylate-binding protein-1 (GBP-1), thrombomodulin (aka CD141), VE-cadherin (aka CD144), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2). Generally, endothelial progenitor cells also are able to take up acetylated LDL, and, further, may migrate toward VEGF and/or form tubes on Matrigel.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">ESCs or iPSCs, such as human ESCs and human iPSCs, can be further cultured under conditions that result in fully differentiated endothelial cells, e.g., VEGF and bFGF. Additionally or alternatively, endothelial cells can be obtained from any number of sources such as bone marrow, blood, skin, liver, heart, lung, retina, and any other tissue or organ that harbors endothelial cells. For example, representative endothelial cells include, without limitation, blood endothelial cells, bone marrow endothelial cells, circulating endothelial cells, human aorta endothelial cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells, human lung microvascular endothelial cells, human microvascular endothelial cells, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, human saphenous vein endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, microvessel endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, retinal capillary endothelial cells, retinal microvascular endothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, umbilical cord blood endothelial cells, and combinations thereof. As those of skill in the art would understand, this is not intended to be an exhaustive list of endothelial cells.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">EPCs may be obtained from peripheral blood by isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by density gradient centrifugation. Cell suspensions are seeded in any receptacle capable of sustaining cells, particularly culture flasks, culture plates or roller bottles, and more particularly in small culture flasks such as 25 cm<sup>2 </sup>culture flasks. Cells cultured in suspension may be resuspended at approximately 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>to about 2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL (for example, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL). Cells plated on a fixed substrate may be plated at approximately 2 to about 3&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Optionally, the culture plates are coated with a matrix protein such as collagen. The cells may be placed into any known culture medium capable of supporting cell growth, including HEM, DMEM, RPMI, F-12, and the like, containing supplements which are required for cellular metabolism such as glutamine and other amino acids, vitamins, minerals and proteins such as transferrin and the like. The culture medium may also contain antibiotics to prevent contamination with yeast, bacteria and fungi such as penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin and the like. The culture medium may contain serum derived from bovine, equine, chicken and the like. Conditions for culturing generally should be close to physiological conditions. The pH of the culture medium should be close to physiological pH. (for example, between pH 6-8, between about pH 7 to 7.8, or at pH 7.4). Physiological temperatures range between about 30&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C. EPCs may be cultured at temperatures between about 32&#xb0; C. to about 38&#xb0; C. (for example, between about 35&#xb0; C. to about 37&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Optionally, the culture medium is supplemented with at least one proliferation-inducing (&#x201c;mitogenic&#x201d;) growth factor. A &#x201c;growth factor&#x201d; is protein, peptide or other molecule having a growth, proliferation-inducing, differentiation inducing, or trophic effect on EPCs. &#x201c;Proliferation-inducing growth factors&#x201d; are trophic factor that allows EPCs to proliferate, including any molecule that binds to a receptor on the surface of the cell to exert a trophic, or growth-inducing effect on the cell. Proliferation-inducing growth factors include EGF, amphiregulin, acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF or FGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF&#x3b1;), VEGF and combinations thereof. Growth factors are usually added to the culture medium at concentrations ranging between about 1 fg/mL to 1 mg/mL. Concentrations between about 1 to 100 ng/mL are usually sufficient. Simple titration assays can easily be performed to determine the optimal concentration of a particular growth factor. The biological effects of growth and trophic factors are generally mediated through binding to cell surface receptors. The receptors for a number of these factors have been identified and antibodies and molecular probes for specific receptors are available. EPCs can be analyzed for the presence of growth factor receptors at all stages of differentiation. In many cases, the identification of a particular receptor provides guidance for the strategy to use in further differentiating the cells along specific developmental pathways with the addition of exogenous growth or trophic factors.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Generally, after about 3-10 days in vitro, the culture medium of EPCs is replenished by aspirating the medium, and adding fresh medium to the culture flask. Optionally, the aspirated medium is collected, filtered and used as a condition medium to subsequently passage EPCs. For example the 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or more condition medium is used. The EPC cell culture can be easily passaged to reinitiate proliferation. For example, after about 3 to about 7 days in vitro, the culture flasks are shaken well and EPCs are then transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at low speed. The medium is aspirated, the EPCs are resuspended in a small amount of culture medium, the cells are then counted and replated at the desired density to reinitiate proliferation. This procedure can be repeated weekly to result in a logarithmic increase in the number of viable cells at each passage. The procedure is continued until the desired number of EPCs is obtained.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">EPCs and EPC progeny can be cryopreserved by any method known in the art until they are needed. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,741, PCT International patent applications WO93/14191, WO95/07611, WO96/27287, WO96/29862, and WO98/14058, Karlsson et al., 65 Biophysical J. 2524-2536 (1993)). The EPCs may be suspended in an isotonic solution, preferably a cell culture medium, containing a particular cryopreservant. Such cryopreservants include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol and the like. These cryopreservants may be used at a concentration of 5-15% (for example, 8-10%). Cells are frozen gradually to a temperature of &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;150&#xb0; C. (for example, &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;100&#xb0; C., or &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Depending on the culture conditions, EPCs may be differentiated into endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells. EPCs can be differentiated into endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells EPCs on a fixed substrate in a culture medium with a differentiation-inducing growth factor. Differentiation of the EPCs can also be induced by any method known in the art which activates the cascade of biological events which lead to growth, which include the liberation of inositol triphosphate and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, liberation of diacyl glycerol and the activation of protein kinase C and other cellular kinases, and the like. Treatment with phorbol esters, differentiation-inducing growth factors and other chemical signals can induce differentiation. Instead of proliferation-inducing growth factors for the proliferation of EPCs (see above), differentiation-inducing growth factors can be added to the culture medium to influence differentiation of the EPCs. Other differentiation inducing growth factors include platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), transforming growth factor betas (TGF,s), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Differentiated endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells may be detected using immunocytochemical techniques know in the art Immunocytochemistry (e.g. dual-label immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase methods) uses antibodies that detect cell proteins to distinguish the cellular characteristics or phenotypic properties of endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells Cellular markers for endothelial cells include for example, VE-cadherin, CD144, CD141, CD 106, or CD142 whereas cellular markers for smooth muscle cells includes Flk Immunocytochemistry can also be used to identify endothelial cells, by detecting the expression of endothelial cell genes such as CD31 and e-NOS.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In situ hybridization histochemistry may also be performed, using cDNA or RNA probes specific for the endothelial gene mRNAs. These techniques can be combined with immunocytochemical methods to enhance the identification of specific phenotypes. If necessary, the antibodies and molecular probes discussed above can be applied to Western and Northern blot procedures respectively to aid in cell identification.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Endothelial cells can be obtained, for example, from one of the many depositories of biological material around the world. See, for example, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC.org on the World Wide Web) or the International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC; nml-1 nm.gc.ca on the World Wide Web). Endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells also can be obtained from the individual that will be the recipient of the transplanted tissue or organ matrix. These cells would be considered to be autologous to the recipient. Additionally, under certain circumstances, the relationship between the tissue or organ matrix and the endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells can be allogeneic (i.e., different individuals from the same species); in other instances, the relationship between the tissue or organ matrix and the endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells can be xenogeneic (i.e., individuals from different species). In certain instances, the tissue or organ matrix is xenogeneic to the recipient and the endothelial or endothelial-progenitor cells are allogeneic to the recipient.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A composition that includes endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells typically is delivered to a tissue or organ matrix in a solution that is compatible with the cells (e.g., in a physiological composition) under physiological conditions (e.g., 37&#xb0; C.). A physiological composition, as referred to herein, can include, without limitation, buffers, nutrients (e.g., sugars, carbohydrates), enzymes, expansion and/or differentiation medium, cytokines, antibodies, repressors, growth factors, salt solutions, or serum-derived proteins. As used herein, a composition that &#x201c;consists essentially of&#x201d; endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells is a composition that is substantially free of cells other than endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells but may still include any of the components that might be found in a physiological composition (e.g., buffers, nutrients, etc.).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To optimize re-endothelialization, endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells generally are introduced into an organ or tissue matrix by perfusion. As with the pre-cellular perfusion, and as described in WO 2007/025233, perfusion occurs via the vasculature or vasculature-type structure (e.g., other lumens or conduits) of the organ or tissue matrix. Perfusion to re-endothelialize an organ or tissue matrix should be at a flow rate that is sufficient to circulate the physiological composition of cells through the vasculature and vasculature-type structures; however, perfusion to re-endothelialize a tissue or organ matrix typically is performed under little to no pressure (e.g., less pressure than is used in the pre-cellular perfusion step to expand and flush the vascular bed). Perfusion with the endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells can be multi-directional (e.g., antegrade and retrograde) to even further optimize re-endothelialization.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The number of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells that is introduced into a tissue or organ matrix for re-endothelialization is dependent on both the organ or tissue (e.g., which organ or tissue, the size and weight of the organ or tissue, the developmental stage of the organ or tissue, and/or the extent of vascularization of the organ or tissue) and the type and developmental stage of the endothelial cells, endothelial derived, immature endothelial cells, or endothelial progenitor cells. In addition, more than one type of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells (e.g., a cocktail of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells) can be perfused into an organ or tissue matrix. Different types of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells may have different tendencies as to the population density those cells will reach, and, similarly, different organ or tissue matrices may be re-endothelialized at different densities. Simply by way of example, at least about 100 (e.g., at least about 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>9 </sup>or 10<sup>10</sup>) endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells can be introduced into an organ or tissue matrix.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Prior to implantation the matrix or graft should contain a majority of mature endothelial cells as defined by the expression of cellular markers for endothelial cells include for example, VE-cadherin, CD144, CD141, CD 106, or CD142 Immunocytochemistry may also be used to identify endothelial cells, by detecting the expression of endothelial cell genes such as CD31 and e-NOS. A non-destructive method of endothelial isolation would be the brief perfusion of trypsin (0.25% or less) or other cell detachment method to enable the removal of a small fraction &#x3c;0.01% of the endothelial cells which then can be assayed for the expression of endothelial cell markers including but not limited to CD105, CD31 and functional expression of e-NOS. In additional function of the endothelial cells may be assessed through endothelial tube formation in Matrigel assays.

As used herein, cells &#x201c;other than endothelial, endothelial derived or endothelial progenitor cells&#x201d; refer to all the other types of cells that populate a particular tissue or organ. In the methods described herein, stem cells or progenitor cells (e.g., embryonic stem cells (ESC), adult stem cells, or induced pluropotent stem (iPS)) can be used to recellularize the parenchyma of a tissue or organ, or tissue- or organ-specific cells (i.e., differentiated or partially-differentiated cells) can be used to recellularize the parenchyma of a tissue or organ. With tissue- or organ-specific cells, the particular type of cell delivered typically depends on the type of tissue or organ that is ultimately being produced. For example, when recellularizing a heart, cardiocytes, smooth muscle cells, cardiac fibroblasts and/or cardiac stem cells can be introduced into or onto the tissue or organ matrix; when recellularizing a liver, hepatocytes, bile duct cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and/or hepatocyte progenitor cells can be introduced into or onto the tissue or organ matrix; when recellularizing a kidney, podocytes, glomerular cells, and/or epithelial cells can be introduced into or onto the tissue or organ matrix; when recellularizing a lung, epithelial cells, clara cells, goblet cells, alveolar type I, and/or alveolar type II cells can be introduced into or onto the tissue or organ matrix; when recellularizing a pancreas, beta-cells and/or islet cells can be introduced into or onto the tissue or organ matrix.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">As with the endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells, cells other than the endothelial or endothelial progenitor cells can be delivered to a tissue or organ matrix in a physiological composition (e.g., with buffers, nutrients, enzymes, growth or differentiation medium), and can be delivered or introduced using any number of routes (e.g., injection (e.g., at multiple locations), perfusion, infusion, and/or topical application).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In embodiments in which the cells other than the endothelial or endothelial progenitor cells are introduced following the re-endothelialization of the tissue or organ matrix, it may be beneficial to allow the endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells some time to adhere to and become established within the vasculature of the tissue or organ matrix before any other cells are delivered. A sufficient time for endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells to adhere to the tissue or organ matrix is, for example, 30 to 180 minutes.

After delivery, constructs were cultured under retrograde aortic perfusion of media for one week before being analyzed.

A statistically significant difference was not seen in the number of endothelial cells in the matrix when 20 million cells were delivered via the aorta or the BA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). However, cells delivered via the aorta did not achieve a uniform distribution throughout the heart, but instead, localized to the apex while the base of the heart remained acellular.

Similarly, after IVC RAEC perfusion (DiO positive) cells could be observed throughout the heart from the apex to the base.

A statistically significant 6- to 8-fold increase in thrombomodulin and thrombin-mediated protein C activity was seen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>). Protein C is a negative regulator of the coagulation cascade; thus, these results indicate that the recellularized constructs can potentially inhibit the coagulation cascade since they retain the capacity for activating protein C.
