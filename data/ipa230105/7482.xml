The alternative is thus to use an available database system. In order to anticipate the future implementation of [RED] Article 5, embodiments include specific definitions of categories, classes, types, and kinds of RE and how to link those to specific devices; mechanisms for performing the registration on an individual basis (e.g., for SW reconfigurable devices or Radio Reconfigurable Systems (RRS) or on a per-mass basis (e.g., for a given type of a smartphone); and mechanisms for accessing the registration database and how to manage access rights. Finally, the embodiments herein may be adopted by the European Commission as the officially mandated solution for implementation of [RED] Article 5 for any wireless equipment (e.g., cellular, RLAN, medical, professional, industrial, etc.).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">The embodiments herein define suitable categories, classes, types and kinds of REs, which can be employed for regulatory purposes. This structuring leads to specific signaling and a specific mechanism for combining different capability classes. Such embodiments include suitable signaling means for conveying this information.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">The embodiments also include includes mechanisms for performing RE registration. These embodiments allow REs to register with a central system, either on a mass RE basis or on individual RE basis. For example, individual registration may be performed by a specific manufacturing assembly of an automaker, OEM, etc. Individual registration may be required for SW based modification of radio capabilities. An example of the mass registration may be registration for a specific type of a smartphone. The RE registration mechanisms may also be used for fix configured devices (e.g., simple citizens band (CB) radio), and for modifiable devices (e.g., SW RE, RRS, etc.). These embodiments also include mechanisms for accessing a registration database (as mandated by [RED] Article 5) and how to manage access rights.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">1.1.

Procedure <b>200</b><i>b </i>begins at operation <b>202</b><i>b </i>where the MFG <b>110</b> sends a category request to the central system <b>120</b>. The category request includes the device categories for one or more devices. At operation <b>204</b><i>b</i>, the central system <b>120</b> sends a category response to the MFG <b>110</b>.

The centralized database/system may have access to the latest reconfiguration configuration of equipment. The data exchange mechanisms discussed herein will be the basis for the registration mechanisms, which are expected to be defined in a mandatory way by regulation administrations and/or through work in ETSI standardization.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0185">One example implementation involves Internet-of-Things (IoT) equipment.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0186">Typically, a single (or small number) of chipset solutions must meet the requirements of a broad market with potentially thousands or even millions of different applications and usage types. In this example, an RE manufacturer uses the chipsets and implements tailoring to its target application through software, which may be radio software or other software. For example, to make such chipsets suitable for Smart Watches, Smart Metering, Sensor applications, Industrial Automation applications (including sensors, control mechanisms for example for controlling machinery, robots, etc.), Sports equipment (e.g., Swing analysis tools for Golf, Tennis or similar), etc., corresponding software updates are registered wherein the request message is a registration query message querying the registration system for registered REs, and the response message is a registration response message indicating one or more REs registered with the registration system based on the device category.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">2.

Embodiments herein are capable of transforming PCE into a MMkE and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0188">Currently, PCE is in a regulatory &#x2018;grey zone&#x2019; since it is unclear who takes the responsibility if interference is generated by the RE. It is also unclear whether reconfigurable radio platforms (or RRS) can be operated without specific licenses (such as a radio amateur license). The European Commission is preparing a clarification of the situation by issuing a &#x201c;Delegated Act&#x201d; and &#x201c;Implementing Act&#x201d; on [RED] Article 3(3)(i).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0189">Embodiments herein provide a clear differentiation between PCE and MMkE. The present disclosure also provides embodiments to transform PCE into MMkE, and vice versa. The embodiments herein provide a regulatory framework, for example, for implementation of [RED] Article 3 and to be applied for all REs including, for example, smartphones, tablets, wearable devices, access points (e.g., WiFi routers), smallcell and/or macrocell RAN nodes, and the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0190">The embodiments introduce two high-level RE types, which is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

Each TPM chip contains an RSA public-private key pair called the Endorsement Key (EK). The EK is maintained inside the TPM and cannot be accessed by software. The private key never leaves the chip, while the public key is used for attestation and for encryption of sensitive data sent to the chip. In other embodiments, secure enclaves (e.g., provided using Intel&#xae; Software Guard Extensions (SGX), Oasis&#x2122; Keystone Enclaves, etc.) may be used to store the same or similar information. In these embodiments, the DoC and CE marking can be buffered in a memory block within the TEE/TPP <b>400</b>, an example of which is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0199">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the DoC Resource is a memory structure storing a resource (e.g., web address, URL, URI, etc.) of the DoC.

This is to prevent concurrent requests coming from heterogeneous applications as being treated equally. Safety-related requests sent by authorized entities may be treated with a different policy from other less critical requests from other entities (e.g., a service asking info for service improvement data). Privacy in the UE regulation is also associated with a different motivation to use that data, in addition to access/request frequency.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0210">In embodiments, any access to data and information related to personal data is cross checked with the statistical model and with a category indicator, describing the reason for accessing this information.

Access to the requested data will be granted only if the request is compatible with a typical or authorized access to the information. Otherwise, the access will be rejected.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0212">These embodiments allow a reasonable level of access to data and information related to personal data without requiring a complex authentication and authorization scheme, which tends to increase computational and signaling overhead. For example, a reasonable level of access to vehicular users in the proximity of the concerned source is allowed while preventing malicious users from extracting data and information related to personal data.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0213">As mentioned previously, a statistical analysis is established for each IE related to personal data. In some embodiments, a Probability Density Function (PDF) is derived based on the behavior of the in-field equipment. A PDF is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in a sample space (e.g., the set of possible values taken by a random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample. The PDF may specify a probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values as opposed to taking on any one value. In embodiments, the PDFs can be derived by observing the behavior of a relatively large number (or a representative sample) of target devices, such as UEs, in-vehicle communication equipment, Edge servers/hosts, etc.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0214">As examples, such PDFs can be derived for the following contexts:<ul id="ul0030" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0215">PDF p(time since last access to any information related to personal data requested by any entity)</li>        <li id="ul0031-0002" num="0216">PDF p(number of accesses to My information related to personal data within a given time interval requested by any entity)</li>        <li id="ul0031-0003" num="0217">PDF p(time since last access to specific information related to personal data requested by a certain authorized entity (e.g., with a specific category indicator))</li>        <li id="ul0031-0004" num="0218">PDF p(number of accesses to specific information related to personal data within a given time interval requested by a certain authorized entity (e.g., with a specific category indicator))</li>        <li id="ul0031-0005" num="0219">PDF p(time since last access to M information related to personal data requested by a certain authorized entity (e.g., with a specific category indicator))</li>        <li id="ul0031-0006" num="0220">PDF p(number of accesses to any information related to personal data within a given time interval, requested by a certain authorized entity, e.g., with a specific category indicator)</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0091" num="0221">Furthermore, the access PDFs may be derived depending on requested access to other information.

Generally, an ML algorithm is a computer program that learns from experience with respect to some task(s) and some performance measure(s), and an ML model is any object or data structure created after an ML algorithm is trained with one or more training datasets. After training, the ML model may be used to make predictions on new datasets.

Procedure <b>1100</b> begins at operation <b>1102</b> where an interference observing RE/UE <b>1105</b> sends an Alert message to an interference generating UE <b>1115</b> over the Alert channel. In some embodiments, the Alert message may be sent during an Alert occasion (or at an Alert position). An Alert occasion may be a set of physical channel monitoring occasions and can include one or more time slots during which Alert messages can be sent. In some embodiments, the interference observing RE <b>1105</b> may monitor for interference or other like behaviors during Alert occasions, and may transmit the Alert message during that Alert occasion or during a next Alert occasion. In some embodiments, the interference generating RE <b>1115</b> may monitor the Alert channel during Alert occasions to obtain Alert messages.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0254">At operation <b>1104</b>, the interference generating RE <b>1115</b> detects transmission interruption due to the Alert. At operation <b>1106</b>, the interference generating RE <b>1115</b> sends a request for Alert mitigation solutions to the network (NW) <b>1120</b>. At operation <b>1108</b>, the NW <b>1120</b> provides one or more candidate configurations for Alert mitigation solutions. At operation <b>1110</b>, the interference generating RE <b>1115</b> selects one of the one or more candidate configurations for Alert mitigation solutions, and at operation <b>1112</b>, the interference generating RE <b>1115</b> sends a confirmation (e.g., ACK) message indicating the selected Alert mitigation solution configuration. At operation <b>1114</b>, the interference generating RE <b>1115</b> implements the selected Alert mitigation solution configuration and operates accordingly. At operation <b>1116</b>, the interference generating RE <b>1115</b> sends a request to terminate the Alert to interference observing RE <b>1105</b>. The request to terminate the Alert may include some indication of the Alert mitigation configuration or some other indication that the interference generating behavior has or will cease. At operation <b>1118</b>, the interference observing RE <b>1105</b> determines whether to terminate the Alert, and if terminated, the interference observing RE <b>1105</b> sends a confirmation of the Alert termination to the interference generating RE <b>1115</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0255">In some embodiments, if there is no response from the interference generating UE <b>1115</b>, the NW <b>1120</b> deems the interference generating UE <b>1115</b> to be a harmful device and takes appropriate steps to stop service to the harmful device. In one example, a warning is sent with a given time to response and if no response is received, the NW <b>1120</b> has the option to completely terminate the service to the device or limit the service (e.g., emergency calls only). These steps may be network specific and may vary depending on network operator policy, RAT type, and/or other like parameters/criteria.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0256">4.2. Alert Messages/Alert Signaling</p><p id="p-0121" num="0257">An Alert message is a minimum set of parameters carried by the Alert channel. For this, an &#x201c;Alert Signal&#x201d; is introduced, which applies a physical layer design such that it can be understood by all relevant UEs.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0258"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows an Alert message signaling example <b>1200</b> according to various embodiments. In the example <b>1200</b>, RE<b>2</b> is an Alert signal receiver (Rx), which corresponds to the interference observing UE <b>1105</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>; and RE<b>1</b> is an Alert signal transmitter (Tx), which corresponds to the interference generating UE <b>1115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Section <b>1201</b> shows RE<b>1</b> creating interference to RE<b>2</b>. Section <b>1202</b> shows RE<b>2</b> sending a decodable Alert signal to RE<b>1</b>, and then the RE<b>1</b> terminating the interference generating activity.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0259">The generally available and decodable Alert signal may be designed such that the Alert signal Rx UE, applying the same or a different radio standard than the Alert signal Tx UE, can decode the Alert Signal. In one example, a narrowband PHY/MAC layer design is applied, which may be based on a Bluetooth PHY or similar which is typically understood by all devices.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0260">The Alert signal is designed to be easily detectable by Alert signal Rx UEs. In one example, the Alert signal is designed to be detected without decoding a symbol that carries the Alert signal. In one embodiment, a simple header sequence may be used. In one example, a high power Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) sequence with relatively good autocorrelation properties may be used. In this example, the CAZAC sequence may be a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence. This allows multiple receivers to easily understand the sequence. The of the Alert signal position (or Alert occasion) is predefined and known to all equipment. OEMs or equipment vendors may configure the REs with the Alert signal position in the equipment specification.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0261">In some embodiments, the Alert signal is sent on the same band where the interference occurs (or is detected). In some embodiments, the Alert signal is sent during time slots when the band is not occupied, which may be detected using a suitable channel sensing operation. If the band is constantly occupied then a higher output power level is applied to transmit the Alert signal.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0262">The interference observing UE <b>1105</b> may repeat transmission of the Alert signal when the interfering UE does not react to the Alert signal. In these embodiments, the interference observing UE <b>1105</b> may implement a suitable timer for this purpose. For example, after the interference observing UE <b>1105</b> transmits the Alert signal, the interference observing UE <b>1105</b> may start an Alert retransmission timer, which may be set to a duration until a response to the Alert signal can be expected. The duration of the Alert retransmission timer may be predefined or configured by the network. In some embodiments, a suitable counter may be used to track the number of retransmissions. Moreover, the output power level is increased over time until the interfering device has received the Alert Signal and terminated its transmission causing interference. The transmission power may be increased after a certain number of retransmissions in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0263">In various embodiments, the Alert signal may contain some data elements that are used to identify the source the interfering transmission. As examples, the Alert signal may include some or all of the following data elements:<ul id="ul0034" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0034-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0035" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0264">ID of the interferer (if known);</li>        <li id="ul0035-0002" num="0265">AoA of the interfering signal (if known);</li>        <li id="ul0035-0003" num="0266">Power level of the interfering signal at receiver (if known);</li>        <li id="ul0035-0004" num="0267">Duration of the interfering signal at receiver (if known); and/or</li>        <li id="ul0035-0005" num="0268">Modulation (or MCS) type of the interfering signal at receiver (if known).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0128" num="0269">This information should help an interfering device to determine that it is indeed the source of the interference.

Resource Management Through Software Component(s)</p><p id="p-0130" num="0271">Depending on locally applicable network configurations, some resource management strategies may be unsuitable and create high levels of interference. In various embodiments, resource management in a UE is done through a replaceable SW components that are provided by the NW for locally applicable requirements and optimized for the local NW configuration. In these embodiments, a UE requests a list of such suitable SW components for resource management, the network provides a list of options (typically optimized for different applications such as FTP, VoIP, etc.) and the UE selects and operates one of the options. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows an example procedure <b>1300</b> for such embodiments.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0272">In procedure <b>1300</b>, after a UE <b>1301</b> enters a new coverage area or region (<b>1302</b>), such as a visiting network (e.g., VPLMN), the UE <b>1301</b> requests a list of locally authorized SW components for resource management (RM) by the UE (<b>1304</b>). In response, the NW <b>1320</b> provides a list of locally authorized SW components for RM by the UE <b>1301</b> (<b>1306</b>) (e.g., a SW component optimized for FTP, another SW component optimized for VoIP, etc.). Next, the UE <b>1301</b> selects at least one of the RM SW components (<b>1308</b>), sends a confirmation message to the NW <b>1320</b> indicating the selection of the at least one locally authorized RM SW component (<b>1310</b>), and then operates the selected RM SW component(s) (<b>1312</b>).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0273">The difference between the existing case and new SW driven case is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.

Interworking with Other Radio Equipment (Ab6169)</p><p id="p-0136" num="0276">[RED] Article 3(3) states that &#x201c;Radio equipment within certain categories or classes shall be so constructed that it complies with the following essential requirements: [ . . . ] (b) radio equipment interworks via networks with other radio equipment.&#x201d; Embodiments herein enable interworking between REs.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0277">Currently, interworking is only possible if specific interworking features have been implemented. This may be the case for some types of equipment (e.g., 3GPP LTE and WiFi), but definitely not for all. Thus, such features are only available for a small subsets of available systems (REs) and not for others. All remaining systems (REs) are not interoperable and only function as stand-alone devices.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0278">In various embodiments, if interworking between two concerned communication standards, protocols, and/or RATs (hereinafter simply &#x201c;RAT&#x201d;), has been specifically designed and implemented, OEMs or service providers use the tailored solution. If no specific interworking feature is present, OEMs/service providers use a new &#x201c;minimum service&#x201d; intermediate protocol. In these embodiments, all wireless services without interoperability features are translated or transformed to a minimum service protocol (MSP), which is understood by every RE. Then, the MSP representation is used to convert the service to any other radio system/RAT different from the original/source radio system/RAT.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0279">In order to support any applicable RAT, in some embodiments, REs provide SW components characterizing their respective Tx/Rx chains (or RATs) to an intermediary or translator entity, and the intermediary uses these SW components in order to translate (transcode) signals from one RAT to another RAT. In some embodiments, the intermediary may be a UE, aNAN, a network element, or some other entity. Since the MSP is understood by all RATs, the MSP provides a minimum level of interoperability between REs.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0280">Interworking refers a state or an instance of two or more elements working with, or being made to work with, each other. As an example, interworking between two devices allows a first device that implements a first RAT to communicate with a second device that implements a second RAT. When both devices implement the same RAT, or common parts of the same RAT, then their interaction is denoted as &#x201c;intra-working.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0141" num="0281">The RE interworking embodiments may include network access node (NAN) (e.g., NANs <b>4331</b>-<b>4333</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>) mediated intra-UE interworking, inter-NAN mediated interworking, direct inter-UE interworking, broker mediated inter-UE interworking, and broker mediated inter-NAN interworking. NAN mediated intra-UE interworking involves a NAN enabling the transcoding between RATs and allowing the two UEs to communicate, in addition to providing all the network support within each device standard. Inter-NAN mediated interworking involves two NANs, although not implementing the same radio standard, have a interworking interface (wired and/or wireless (radio)). Direct inter-UE interworking involves each UE having an interworking radio interface protocol. Broker mediated inter-UE involves a broker (or an IWF) providing interworking support between two UEs, for example, by providing translation and/or transcoding between RATs. Broker mediated inter-NAN interworking involves a broker providing interworking support between NANs from different RATs. A broker is a standalone entity other than a NAN or a functional entity of another network element other than a NAN, which implements both devices' RATs and/or performs RAT translation, if necessary, and forwards relevant communications/data towards any relevant network entity/entities.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0282">In various embodiments, interworking is achieved through the transcoding of the distinct communication RATs of concerned equipment, for example, signaling of a first RAT is transcoded such that the signaling can be understood by an equipment of the second RAT. In embodiments, a specific channel is defined for the coordination on transcoding between UEs and the NW. This channel can be either a proprietary channel (e.g., applicable to systems which are supported by a (proprietary) transcoding system) or a standardized channel. An example of such a channel is shown by FIG. E-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0283">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the control channel carries various control information (e.g., ACK/NACK, etc.), and the data channel carries SW component(s) containing Tx/Rx chains of respective systems as well as other data. The synchronization (sync) sequence contains a specific sequence indicating the nature/purpose of the frame, which in this example is a frame for the coordination of transcoding services. In one example, the sync sequence is a specific CAZAC sequence with good autocorrelation properties.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0284">Furthermore, interworking can be achieved on various layers, such as a Radio Layer (e.g., two devices applying distinct/different wireless interfaces/RATs need to communicate with one another) and/or a Networking Layer (e.g., two devices accessing the internet need to communicate with each other but have different upper layers).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a first scenario <b>1600</b> where two or more devices (e.g., RE<b>1</b> and RE<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>) have distinct but yet similar PHY/MAC layers (e.g., both based on OFDM, etc.). A relatively simple configuration may be decodable by receivers of both systems (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), Rate 1/2 convolutional coding, direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), etc.).

In the OFG mode, the UE (or FEM-DE) calculates the UE position and/or time relative to the last known position and/or time values, and broadcasts the calculated position/time values at regular intervals to other equipment via dedicated localization and synchronization sequences. In various embodiments, the location may be calculated using nearby devices as the reference as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0328"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows a location estimation example <b>2300</b> according to various embodiments. The D2D communication example <b>2300</b> includes D2D communication based location estimation through Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) determination and exchange of device location estimates. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, an approximate location of neighboring devices <b>2302</b> (e.g., devices <b>2302</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>2302</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>2302</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>) is requested by ego device <b>2301</b>, along with information on estimated error margin, typically through a D2D communication link (e.g., PC5 for LTE/NR, Bluetooth&#xae;/BLE, or some other suitable RAT such as those discussed herein). These estimates may rely on current and/or previous, historical and/or stored GNSS data, sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.), cellular system based location estimation (e.g., based on AoA estimates from known RAN nodes, or using LTE/NR location services), estimates based on D2D interactions with neighboring devices <b>2302</b>, etc., and/or any combination thereof. Once the location from neighboring devices <b>2302</b> is known or determined, several of such devices <b>2302</b> are considered for AoA estimations <b>2320</b> (including AoA estimations <b>2320</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>2320</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>2320</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>). The location is then estimated to be within the area <b>2310</b> based on the AoA estimations <b>2320</b>. In some embodiments, two devices <b>2302</b>, <b>2301</b> are sufficient to have an intersection of such estimated AoAs <b>2320</b>. In some embodiments, more than two devices <b>2302</b>, <b>2301</b> are considered in order to derive an area of expected location <b>2310</b> instead of just a single point (or using only two devices <b>2302</b>, <b>2301</b>).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0329">To ensure that the best available localization source is used, the FEM-DE <b>2210</b> will search for mandated service in regular intervals and switch back to a normal mode a mandates service becomes available.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0330">6.2. Emergency Fallback Communications</p><p id="p-0178" num="0331">Two embodiments are provided in order to ensure high priority access for emergency messages even if the primary system infrastructure for the mandated services is/are unavailable.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0332"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates a first embodiment where ultra-high priority is given to emergency messages in case of contention based access (e.g., in the context of the CSMA protocol of D2D WiFi connections, which should still be available even if the infrastructure, such as WiFi Access Points, are no longer available). In many scenarios, devices typically have to respect a waiting time between transmissions, which may be based on, for example, the so-called Arbitration Inter-Frame Spacing (AIFS)). In this embodiment, the AIFS is set to 0 for high priority emergency messages in order to achieve the highest possible access probability to the medium. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates an example <b>2400</b> of high priority access through zero-level AIFS according to various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0333">In other implementations, the waiting time between transmissions may be based on a CSMA/CA backoff timer, a contention resolution timer, or some other like timer. Similar to the AIFS, in this embodiment such a timer is set to 0 for high priority emergency messages.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0334">In other embodiments, the AIFS or retransmission timer(s) may be set according to a device category/type and/or priority associated with the device. For example, the AIFS or timer(s) may be set to 0 as discussed above if the device is registered as being owned or operated by emergency responder (e.g., paramedics, police, firefighters, etc.), whereas the AIFS or timer(s) may be set to some other value if the device is registered as being owned or operated by non-emergency personnel. Various priorities or categories may be used for different personnel, roles, or based on some other criteria. Additionally, beacon timers may be implemented to change or alter these device priorities/categories. For example, the AIFS or retransmission timer(s) may be set to 0 as discussed above for a specified period of time, such as X number of hours after the device is placed in the OTG mode (which may correspond to some period of time related to the emergency scenario), and then set to a different value according to the device priority/category upon expiration of the beacon timer. Additionally or alternatively, signaling from authorized equipment may be used to change the AIFS/retransmission timer values (e.g., an NFC signal obtained from the authorized device, or signaling received from some central (e.g., regulatory) authority)).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0335">In case that WiFi is not available, the FEM-DE <b>2210</b> is also responsible for establishing a communication link with one or more peer devices. When OTF mode is enabled, and a localization and time reference is established, the UE (or FEM-DE <b>2210</b>) uses a fallback connection protocol (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>) to remain connected with one or more peer devices. In various embodiments, the fallback communication protocol is only used for emergency message broadcasting and reception, and other communications are not performed via the fallback communication protocol. The fallback communication protocol includes basic procedures for peer-to-peer or D2D discovery, authorization, and emergency message exchange. The fallback communication protocol includes Emergency Symbols which contain emergency messages.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0336"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> illustrates an example <b>2500</b> in which an emergency symbol enforces the reservation of the medium for a predetermined period of time (e.g., Is) for high priority emergency messages. Emergency symbol indicates to other devices that the medium is reserved for the predetermined period of time for the high-priority emergency messages only. This is represented in FIG. F.II-<b>2</b> by the arrows pointing from the emergency symbol towards the time lines for Devices A and B.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0337">The emergency message may be introduced or indicated in serval ways. In a first embodiment, the emergency indicator can be sent as a standard WiFi data packet using a standard WiFi frame structure. Other packet types may also be used such as a packet structure used for a Personal Area Network (PAN) protocol such as any of those discussed herein, or using any of the channel or packet structures discussed elsewhere herein. Such a data packet may include the following information: a start of the emergency period, which may be given by a predefined message type, optionally including an indication when the emergency period is actually starting (e.g., immediately or a number of milliseconds (ms) in the future (or from a current time or from an indicated timestamp); (optionally) a duration of the emergency period (e.g., in milliseconds); and (optionally) the type(s) of devices and/or traffic allowed to access resource(s) during the emergency period. In a second embodiment, a symbol with good autocorrelation properties may be used, for example, a ZC sequence, a CAZAC sequence, or the like, which can be easily detected by devices of most access technologies through simple autocorrelation.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0338">6.3. Emergency Service Frequency Band Prioritization</p><p id="p-0186" num="0339">For emergency situations, it is possible that cellular bands and/or unlicensed bands (e.g., WiFi bands) are saturated, for example, when there is a high volume of traffic or is experiencing overload or low signal/channel quality conditions, such as when a disaster type event takes place. For such emergency situations, embodiments include fallback emergency bands. The fallback emergency bands are intended to be sparsely used. In these embodiments, the FEM-DE <b>2210</b> manages available locally used frequency bands and repurposes these bands for emergency services. In one example, the FEM-DE <b>2210</b> repurposes the 3.7-3.8 GHz band, which is mainly used for industrial applications/services. In Germany and Sweden, this band is located at 3.4-3.7 GHz, which is just above the 5G bands. This band is allocated in Germany and Sweden to &#x201c;local usage&#x201d; such as Industrial 4.0 (e.g., Industrial Automation) and related services. Only when locally unused, it may complement classical cellular bands [BNetzA]. Accordingly, emergency service fallback channels may be allocated to the 3.7-3.8 GHz band. The process for accessing these bands is as follows:<ul id="ul0042" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0042-0001" num="0340">1. An RE (e.g., a mobile device or any other wireless equipment) detects an emergency situation is taking place. This may be based on receipt of a PWS, ETWS, CMAS, etc., message or using some other mechanism.</li>    <li id="ul0042-0002" num="0341">2. In response to detecting an emergency, the RE attempts to communicate using default techniques, for example, by attempting to access bands in an unlicensed spectrum (e.g., WiFi bands) and/or bands in a licensed spectrum (e.g., cellular bands).</li>    <li id="ul0042-0003" num="0342">3. When no communication is possible in the default bands, for example, due to saturation (congestion or overload scenarios), network breakdown, or similar, the RE accesses (or attempts to access) an emergency fallback channel in a repurposed band (e.g., in the 3.7-3.8 GHz band or any other suitable band). The specific channel to be accessed may be communicated/made available a-priori, for example, through a channel map indicating where parts of the repurposed band are locally unused (e.g., by stakeholders such as industrial automation).</li>    <li id="ul0042-0004" num="0343">4. When the RE accesses the emergency fallback channel in the repurposed band, the RE communicates (transmits and/or receives) emergency message(s) in the emergency fallback channel as discussed previously.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0187" num="0344">One example implementation includes vehicular communications where a vehicle may or may not be in the coverage area of a network or infrastructure equipment (e.g., RSU, edge compute node, etc.). If the vehicle is not in the coverage area of the network, the standalone mode is activated, otherwise the mode is deactivated. In another example, a level of hierarchy is defined for standalone equipment. Equipment of higher hierarchy is controller equipment of lower hierarchy in this example.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">7. Protection Mechanisms for User Privacy and Personal/Sensitive Data (AB7960)</heading><p id="p-0188" num="0345">Protecting personal and confidential data stored in mobile equipment and privacy of the users against security threats is a multidimensional problem involving human and technological aspects. Mobile devices are an attractive target for threat actors such as attackers or hackers. Some threat actors attempt to access mobile devices using malware. Malware is any type of software element(s) that are intentionally designed to cause damage to a computing system, network, creates a vulnerability in the target system, and/or exhibits deceptive behaviors or practices that may potentially harm systems, networks, users and/or consumers. A vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor to perform unauthorized actions within a computing system, such as a mobile device. To exploit a vulnerability, the threat attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to the target system through its weakness, which in some cases is created by installed or executable malware.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0346">Malware causes damage or creates vulnerabilities after it is provisioned, installed, or otherwise introduced into a target's computer system. A lure is often used to trick users into accessing malicious resources, downloading and installing the malware onto their systems, and/or lure users into submitting their personal or financial information by posing as legitimate platforms. The aforementioned lures may be referred to as phishing messages, which involves the fraudulent attempt to obtain personal, confidential, and/or sensitive information by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. In some cases, the malware may automatically execute malicious program code or scripts, or display a content item that carriers a malware payload that executes when the user opens or interacts with the content. Through installing the malware on victim devices, unauthorized users (e.g., threat actors) can gain access to private, confidential, and/or sensitive data. Downloading malicious applications (&#x201c;malware&#x201d;) and/or receiving phishing messages coming from short messages (e.g., SMS messages), email messages, social network messaging and/or posts, and phone calls increase the vulnerability of users to many security or privacy-related threats. Specific examples include banking/financial applications, medical applications and any other application or service where personal, private, confidential, and/or sensitive data is being conveyed.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0347">[RED] Article 3(3) states that &#x201c;Radio equipment within certain categories or classes shall be so constructed that it complies with the following essential requirements: [ . . . ] (e) radio equipment incorporates safeguards to ensure that the personal data and privacy of the user and of the subscriber are protected.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0191" num="0348">Currently, there are many different ways of protecting the privacy of data. However, the conventional data privacy protection mechanisms (e.g., information security or &#x201c;InfoSec&#x201d;) require full user reliance and/or are system/platform specific, which makes these conventional solutions available to a relatively small set of users. Additionally, conventional solutions usually require user awareness to implement specific security policies.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0349">Embodiments herein provide several mechanism to ensure that a device protects the personal, confidential, and/or sensitive information and privacy of users. In an example, security through diversity is applied by providing data across different wireless and/or wired/cabled channels, each of a same or different access technology. If one of the channels is corrupted, the others may still be operational and support the safe delivery of information.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0350">Embodiments introduce a &#x201c;privacy hierarchy&#x201d; and related data tags for privacy data.

In some implementations, the terms personal data and/or sensitive data may be defined by the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 Apr. 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter the &#x201c;General Data Protection Regulation&#x201d; or &#x201c;GDPR&#x201d;).<sup>1 </sup></p><p id="p-0194" num="0351">Depending on the privacy hierarchy level (or classification), the processing of the data is limited. Embodiments also include a new physical channel (referred to as a &#x201c;Security Channel&#x201d;) between the mobile devices for authorized privacy data and message exchange flows. Additionally or alternatively, a hierarchical approach is also introduced for the channels/links wherein channels/links of higher priority/rank in the hierarchy are considered more secure/trustworthy than channels/links of lower priority/rank in the hierarchy. Embodiments include a protocol mechanism that does not leak information about identification of a given device unless that recipient device is trusted to know this information. Embodiments include a Security Preamble that is decodable by trusted devices, and Security Pointers that point to trusted locations (trusted resources) where trusted information can be found without disclosing any other information.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0352">7.1.

In one example implementation, communications may take place over a network (e.g., the Internet) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) between one or more devices (e.g., RE <b>2901</b>-<b>1</b> and RE <b>2901</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>), one or more RAN nodes (e.g., RAN node <b>2910</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>), and/or nodes/storage elements provided by a cloud computing service (e.g., secure resource <b>2915</b>, which may be provided by cloud <b>4344</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>). Additionally or alternatively, a suitable point-to-point encryption (P2PE) or end-to-end encryption (E2EE) mechanism may be used, which involves endpoint applications handling the encryption and decryptio of messages on their own. In this implementation, the endpoints can encrypt data using a pre-shared secret (e.g., as in Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)) or a one-time secret derived from such a pre-shared secret (e.g., using a derived unique key per transaction (DUKPT)). In another example implementation, end-to-end encrypted tunnels (EETs) may be established using any suitable tunneling protocol that uses an encryption algorithm to (re)package data traffic for communication between computer systems/devices. EETs may generally refer to communications traveling over a virtual private network (VPN) or communications using Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). Any suitable cryptographic protocol may be used for the secure channel including SSL, TLS, IPsec, PGP and/or OpenPGP, SSH, Kerberos, and/or the like. For purposes of the present disclosure, the terms &#x201c;end-to-end encrypted tunnel,&#x201d; &#x201c;secure channel,&#x201d; &#x201c;encrypted channel,&#x201d; &#x201c;point-to-point encryption,&#x201d; &#x201c;end-to-end encryption,&#x201d; and the like may be used interchangeably throughout the present disclosure even though these terms may refer to different concepts.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0382">In these embodiments, any malicious interceptor of the wireless exchange will only get access to the pointer information (see e.g., <b>2920</b><i>a </i>and <b>2920</b><i>b</i>). Since the malicious interceptor typically does not have access to the secure location (e.g., secure resource <b>2915</b> with specific security mechanisms), the secure pointer is worthless information. In this way, an increased level of protection of sensitive information is achieved.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0383">7.4. Examples for Security Through Diversity</p><p id="p-0219" num="0384">[RED] Article 3(3)(e) and Article 3(3)(<i>f</i>) relate to privacy and protection against fraud respectively. Both Articles are expected to be in focus for upcoming discussions in the European Commission Expert Group. It is expected that Article 3(3)(<i>e</i>) will be considered in relation to the EU GDPR and Article 3(3)(<i>f</i>) in relation to the EU Cybersecurity Act. These articles may be seen as a rupture with the classical linkage of the R&#x26;TTE Directive (1999/5/EC) and [RED] to mainly RF parameters, such as output power levels, emission masks, etc. Compliance to RF parameters can indeed be straightforwardly determined through appropriate measurements. It is currently unclear how &#x201c;soft&#x201d; requirements related to Privacy and Cybersecurity may be verified and which test cases will be defined. Ideally, corresponding solutions will not to require full compliance to GDPR and the Cybersecurity Act, since corresponding compliance tests would impose a substantial burden to manufacturers in terms of certification cost and longer time to market. Rather, simplified models should be identified limiting certification tests to the most relevant and essential requirements.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0385">In the following description, a typical example is given assuming that a user is requiring secure access to a target service through a Mobile Device/RE, such as a banking service, for example. Indeed, mobile devices are an attractive target for hackers. Through installing malicious code on the victim devices, unauthorized persons can gain access to private and sensitive user data. Downloading malicious applications and receiving phishing messages coming from short messages, email messages, social networks, and phone calls increase the vulnerability of users to many security or Privacy-related threats.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0386">Among multiple possibilities to address corresponding security threats, various embodiments utilize Security through Diversity. While state of the art solutions address corresponding concepts in generic terms, specific implementation solutions meeting essential requirements and related testing scenarios need to be developed in order to make the concepts applicable to related [RED] Articles. Below, we will outline how related concepts can be implemented supporting Article 3(3)(e) and 3(3)(f) requirements through the reconfiguration architecture designs currently developed by ETSI.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0387">In some embodiments, first, various privacy requirements are identified and differentiated. As an example, the privacy requirements may be as follows:</p><p id="p-0223" num="0000">a. public data that can be freely shared;<br/>b. data indirectly related to a user, which is data with no direct relationship to a user, but some limited data related to the user may be extracted through inference;<br/>c. historical data related to the context of a user;<br/>d. current data related to the context of a user; and<br/>e. intimate user Privacy Data.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0388">Hierarchy levels of privacy can also be introduced, and each data element might be assigned to a different hierarchy level. The processing of data may depend to the related privacy hierarchy level.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0389">Next, stakeholders and/or threat scenarios are defined. As examples, the stakeholders and threat scenarios may include the threat scenarios illustrated by Figure G.IV-<b>2</b> and FIG.

Scenario <b>3000</b><i>b </i>shows a compromised operation where a malicious actor <b>3002</b> alters the interaction with target system. Here, the malicious actor <b>3002</b> gains control of the user device <b>3001</b> through the use of malware. In this example, malicious code or a malicious resource (e.g., a &#x201c;virus&#x201d;, &#x201c;malware&#x201d;, etc.) is present on the host, and the malicious 3rd party is able to gain access to the RE through a corresponding back door provided by the malicious resource.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0391"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> shows an example of a malicious 3rd party intercepting a radio link.

This can be realized by using distinct execution environments or systems assuming that they are sufficiently separated from each other. For example, two different radio computers controlled through independent radio operating systems can be used as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0393"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> shows an example <b>3200</b> of communication and task splitting between various sources to combat malicious attacks at the host and/or at the communication link according to various embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, a user request <b>3205</b> is allocated on one radio computer <b>3201</b>-<b>1</b> and the confirmation process <b>3206</b> on another radio computer <b>3201</b>-<b>2</b>. The radio computers <b>3201</b> may be implemented by an individual RE and/or may be the same or similar as the radio computers <b>3820</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> (discussed infra).</p><p id="p-0230" num="0394">Different and/or redundant RATs can be also used to distribute tasks over multiple air links, where a task will be only executed if one of the links is still under control of the users. Assuming that one of the REs <b>3201</b> and/or one of the communication links <b>3205</b>, <b>3206</b> is compromised by an attacker, part of the system is still fully functional. This entity may indeed be used to identify the attack and initiate appropriate countermeasures. Vulnerabilities may, for example, be addressed through new Radio Application Packages and/or Radio Applications that are uploaded and installed in accordance to [RED] Article 3(3)(i) and [RED] Article 4, and/or as discussed in [EN302969], ETSI TR 103 087 v1.2.1 (2017-11) (&#x201c;[TR103087]&#x201d;), ETSI TR 103 585 V1.1.1 (2018-02) (&#x201c;[TR103585]&#x201d;), ETSI EN 303 095 V1.3.1 (2018-05) (&#x201c;[EN303095]&#x201d;) and/or the like.

Modular Software Reconfiguration for Radio Equipment Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0261" num="0423">The software reconfiguration approaches discussed herein enable reconfiguration of REs through software as specified in ETSI EN 303 641 V1.1.2 (2020-03) (&#x201c;[EN303641]&#x201d;), ETSI EN 303 648 V1.1.2 (2020-03) (&#x201c;[EN303648]&#x201d;), ETSI EN 303 681-1 V1.1.2 (2020-06) (&#x201c;[EN303681-1]&#x201d;), ETSI EN 303 681-2 V1.1.2 (2020-06) (&#x201c;[EN303681-2]&#x201d;), and ETSI EN 303 681-4 V1.1.2 (2020-06) (&#x201c;[EN303681-4]&#x201d;), and the use cases discussed in [TR103585]; the overall framework is complemented by security solutions such as those discussed in ETSI TS 103 436 V1.2.1 (2018-02) (&#x201c;[TS103436]&#x201d;). The specific case of Mobile Device reconfiguration is addressed in [EN303095], ETSI EN 303 146-1 V1.3.1 (2018-06) (&#x201c;[EN303146-1]&#x201d;), ETSI EN 303 146-2 V1.1.5 (2016-03) (&#x201c;[EN303146-2]&#x201d;), ETSI EN 303 146-4 V1.1.1 (2017-01) (&#x201c;[EN303146-4]&#x201d;), [TR103087], and [TS103436]. The software reconfiguration approaches have been designed from a holistic perspective with an emphasis on the needs of commercial equipment, addressing: technical requirements (e.g., code portability and efficiency), security requirements (e.g., security delivery and installation of software components), and regulatory requirements (e.g., technical solutions for re-certification of platforms when radio characteristics are modified).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0424">In various implementations, reconfiguration can be performed on an individual level (e.g., users choosing among new features for their respective component) or en-mass (e.g., automatic upgrade of all platforms). Reconfigurable REs may also be tailored to the needs of the [RED], which includes articles on software reconfiguration. Specific attention is given to security requirements, addressing in particular: proof of conformance of the radio platform and radio applications to the regulatory Declaration of Conformity, considering that the set of installed radio applications can change over time; proof of the integrity of radio applications; proof of the identity of the developer of radio applications; built-in support for security updates; and prevention of code theft.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0425">Moving from today's hardware design principles to software reconfiguration solutions will likely require a paradigm change, which can take place in a gradual step-wise approach. For example, in a first-generation implementation, the functionality may be limited to a replacement of specific (hardwired) components by executable software, designed specifically for a given target platform. Features such as secure delivery of software components and installation will be sufficient to address this need. Hardware resources (e.g., FPGA resources) are typically added to the original design to enable the replacement. Second-generation implementations may build on the first-generation implementations to design portable and yet highly (power) efficient code thanks to the Radio Virtual Machine (RVM). The RVM is a representation of a radio algorithm and may be somewhat different from other virtual machine concepts as generally applied in the computer science and IT arts. Furthermore, the level of autonomy of the platform may evolve over time, including distributed selection of the most relevant features and dynamic replacement of corresponding software components.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0426">With the above features, the software reconfiguration solution is suited to meet the requirements of 5G and beyond applications. For example, it will enable automotive communication platforms to remain relevant over the lifetime of a vehicle and to address platform vulnerabilities which may arise over the lifetime of a vehicle, enable product adaptation to specific market needs for Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, etc.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0427">9.1.

In today's world, the usage of smartphone apps is ubiquitous. These applications, however, typically provide new tools or games to the end-user without altering any radio parameters. The ETSI software reconfiguration solution provides a framework for introducing RadioApps, i.e. applications which extend or modify existing radio features and define solutions for technical, certification and security needs.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0429">Such RadioApps will be used to optimize the operation of a smartphone in general or for usage in a specific market with special needs. In a typical example of case i) RadioApps will be used to optimize the operation of a smartphone in response to the introduction of new features on the network side as they evolve in future releases of the 3GPP standard. In addition, the optimum configuration is identified (e.g., new power-efficient modulation and coding schemes, etc.) to meet power efficiency (see e.g., Siaud et al., &#x201c;Green-oriented multi-techno link adaptation metrics for 5G heterogeneous networks&#x201d;, <i>EURASIP J Wireless Com Networking, </i>2016, Art. No. 92, pp. 1-13 (1 Apr. 2016), available at: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13638-016-0588-2), predictable QoS and other requirements. To give an example of specific market usages, in an industrial environment, new mechanisms may be added through software reconfiguration taking the specific characteristics of the usage environment into account. Beyond the provisioning of additional modules, the ETSI framework also allows for the replacement of entire RATs in cases where sufficient computational resources are available.<ul id="ul0051" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0051-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0052" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0052-0001" num="0430">9.2.

Solutions for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, including Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), etc., are currently being developed with the objective to guarantee a safe(r) driving environment for the future. The challenge is to ensure that a radio communications component remains relevant over the entire lifetime of a vehicle, i.e. ten years and beyond. It is almost certain that a V2X framework feature-set will evolve within this period. Software reconfiguration will enable manufacturers to replace specific software and thus maintain related feature-sets up to date without requiring changes to the hardware. This approach reduces the overall cost for change since a vehicle does not need to be upgraded by an authorized dealer (as it would be required for hardware changes), but the process is handled through over-the-air remote control.<ul id="ul0053" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0053-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0054" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0054-0001" num="0432">9.3.

On the host device, only a device driver is necessary to operate the external component and integrate it into the networking stack.

The RVM is a controlled execution environment that allows RAs to access low-level radio parameters. The RVM may be an abstract machine independent of the hardware, which is capable of executing configcodes. In some implementations, the RVM may be an abstract machine that can be configured by configcodes into an RA. The implementation of the RVM is radio computer-specific and may include a compiler (e.g., a front-end compiler or back-end compiler), which may provide Just-in-Time (JIT) or Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation of configcodes into executable codes.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0463">The RAs may have different forms of representation including, for example, source codes (also referred to as &#x201c;RA codes&#x201d;), intermediate representations (IRs), and executable codes for a particular radio platform.

An Edge Cloud architecture is used to decentralize computing resources and power to the edges of one or more networks (e.g., end point devices and/or intermediate nodes such as client devices/UEs).

However, the closer that the edge location is to the endpoint (e.g., user equipment (UE)), the more that space and power is often constrained. Thus, edge computing attempts to reduce the amount of resources needed for network services, through the distribution of more resources which are located closer both geographically and in network access time. In this manner, edge computing attempts to bring the compute resources to the workload data where appropriate, or, bring the workload data to the compute resources.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0578">The following describes aspects of an edge cloud architecture that covers multiple potential deployments and addresses restrictions that some network operators or service providers may have in their own infrastructures. These include, variation of configurations based on the edge location (because edges at a base station level, for instance, may have more constrained performance and capabilities in a multi-tenant scenario); configurations based on the type of compute, memory, storage, fabric, acceleration, or like resources available to edge locations, tiers of locations, or groups of locations; the service, security, and management and orchestration capabilities; and related objectives to achieve usability and performance of end services. These deployments may accomplish processing in network layers that may be considered as &#x201c;near edge&#x201d;, &#x201c;close edge&#x201d;, &#x201c;local edge&#x201d;, &#x201c;middle edge&#x201d;, or &#x201c;far edge&#x201d; layers, depending on latency, distance, and timing characteristics.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0579">Edge computing is a developing paradigm where computing is performed at or closer to the &#x201c;edge&#x201d; of a network, typically through the use of a compute platform (e.g., x86 or ARM compute hardware architecture) implemented at base stations, gateways, network routers, or other devices which are much closer to endpoint devices producing and consuming the data. For example, edge gateway servers may be equipped with pools of memory and storage resources to perform computation in real-time for low latency use-cases (e.g., autonomous driving or video surveillance) for connected client devices. Or as an example, base stations may be augmented with compute and acceleration resources to directly process service workloads for connected user equipment, without further communicating data via backhaul networks. Or as another example, central office network management hardware may be replaced with standardized compute hardware that performs virtualized network functions and offers compute resources for the execution of services and consumer functions for connected devices. Within edge computing networks, there may be scenarios in services which the compute resource will be &#x201c;moved&#x201d; to the data, as well as scenarios in which the data will be &#x201c;moved&#x201d; to the compute resource. Or as an example, base station compute, acceleration and network resources can provide services in order to scale to workload demands on an as needed basis by activating dormant capacity (subscription, capacity on demand) in order to manage corner cases, emergencies or to provide longevity for deployed resources over a significantly longer implemented lifecycle.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0580"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> illustrates operational layers among endpoints, an edge cloud, and cloud computing environments. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> depicts examples of computational use cases <b>4505</b>, utilizing the edge cloud <b>4410</b> among multiple illustrative layers of network computing. The layers begin at an endpoint (devices and things) layer <b>4500</b>, which accesses the edge cloud <b>4410</b> to conduct data creation, analysis, and data consumption activities. The edge cloud <b>4410</b> may span multiple network layers, such as an edge devices layer <b>4510</b> having gateways, on-premise servers, or network equipment (nodes <b>4515</b>) located in physically proximate edge systems; a network access layer <b>4520</b>, encompassing base stations, radio processing units, network hubs, regional data centers (DC), or local network equipment (equipment <b>4525</b>); and any equipment, devices, or nodes located therebetween (in layer <b>4512</b>, not illustrated in detail). The network communications within the edge cloud <b>4410</b> and among the various layers may occur via any number of wired or wireless mediums, including via connectivity architectures and technologies not depicted.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0581">Examples of latency, resulting from network communication distance and processing time constraints, may range from less than a millisecond (ms) when among the endpoint layer <b>4500</b>, under 5 ms at the edge devices layer <b>4510</b>, to even between 10 to 40 ms when communicating with nodes at the network access layer <b>4520</b>. Beyond the edge cloud <b>4410</b> are core network <b>4530</b> and cloud data center <b>4540</b> layers, each with increasing latency (e.g., between 50-60 ms at the core network layer <b>4530</b>, to 100 or more ms at the cloud data center layer). As a result, operations at a core network data center <b>4535</b> or a cloud data center <b>4545</b>, with latencies of at least 50 to 100 ms or more, will not be able to accomplish many time-critical functions of the use cases <b>4505</b>. Each of these latency values are provided for purposes of illustration and contrast; it will be understood that the use of other access network mediums and technologies may further reduce the latencies. In some examples, respective portions of the network may be categorized as &#x201c;close edge&#x201d;, &#x201c;local edge&#x201d;, &#x201c;near edge&#x201d;, &#x201c;middle edge&#x201d;, or &#x201c;far edge&#x201d; layers, relative to a network source and destination. For instance, from the perspective of the core network data center <b>4535</b> or a cloud data center <b>4545</b>, a central office or content data network may be considered as being located within a &#x201c;near edge&#x201d; layer (&#x201c;near&#x201d; to the cloud, having high latency values when communicating with the devices and endpoints of the use cases <b>4505</b>), whereas an access point, base station, on-premise server, or network gateway may be considered as located within a &#x201c;far edge&#x201d; layer (&#x201c;far&#x201d; from the cloud, having low latency values when communicating with the devices and endpoints of the use cases <b>4505</b>). It will be understood that other categorizations of a particular network layer as constituting a &#x201c;close&#x201d;, &#x201c;local&#x201d;, &#x201c;near&#x201d;, &#x201c;middle&#x201d;, or &#x201c;far&#x201d; edge may be based on latency, distance, number of network hops, or other measurable characteristics, as measured from a source in any of the network layers <b>4500</b>-<b>4540</b>.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0582">The various use cases <b>4505</b> may access resources under usage pressure from incoming streams, due to multiple services utilizing the edge cloud. To achieve results with low latency, the services executed within the edge cloud <b>4410</b> balance varying requirements in terms of: (a) Priority (throughput or latency) and Quality of Service (QoS) (e.g., traffic for an autonomous car may have higher priority than a temperature sensor in terms of response time requirement; or, a performance sensitivity/bottleneck may exist at a compute/accelerator, memory, storage, or network resource, depending on the application); (b) Reliability and Resiliency (e.g., some input streams need to be acted upon and the traffic routed with mission-critical reliability, where as some other input streams may be tolerate an occasional failure, depending on the application); and (c) Physical constraints (e.g., power, cooling and form-factor).</p><p id="p-0419" num="0583">The end-to-end service view for these use cases involves the concept of a service-flow and is associated with a transaction. The transaction details the overall service requirement for the entity consuming the service, as well as the associated services for the resources, workloads, workflows, and business functional and business level requirements. The services executed with the &#x201c;terms&#x201d; described may be managed at each layer in a way to assure real time, and runtime contractual compliance for the transaction during the lifecycle of the service. When a component in the transaction is missing its agreed to SLA, the system as a whole (components in the transaction) may provide the ability to (1) understand the impact of the SLA violation, and (2) augment other components in the system to resume overall transaction SLA, and (3) implement steps to remediate.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0584">Thus, with these variations and service features in mind, edge computing within the edge cloud <b>4410</b> may provide the ability to serve and respond to multiple applications of the use cases <b>4505</b> (e.g., object tracking, video surveillance, connected cars, etc.) in real-time or near real-time, and meet ultra-low latency requirements for these multiple applications. These advantages enable a whole new class of applications (Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), Function as a Service (FaaS), Edge as a Service (EaaS), standard processes, etc.), which cannot leverage conventional cloud computing due to latency or other limitations.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0585">However, with the advantages of edge computing comes the following caveats. The devices located at the edge are often resource constrained and therefore there is pressure on usage of edge resources. Typically, this is addressed through the pooling of memory and storage resources for use by multiple users (tenants) and devices. The edge may be power and cooling constrained and therefore the power usage needs to be accounted for by the applications that are consuming the most power. There may be inherent power-performance tradeoffs in these pooled memory resources, as many of them are likely to use emerging memory technologies, where more power requires greater memory bandwidth. Likewise, improved security of hardware and root of trust trusted functions are also required, because edge locations may be unmanned and may even need permissioned access (e.g., when housed in a third-party location). Such issues are magnified in the edge cloud <b>4410</b> in a multi-tenant, multi-owner, or multi-access setting, where services and applications are requested by many users, especially as network usage dynamically fluctuates and the composition of the multiple stakeholders, use cases, and services changes.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0586">At a more generic level, an edge computing system may be described to encompass any number of deployments at the previously discussed layers operating in the edge cloud <b>4410</b> (network layers <b>4500</b>-<b>4540</b>), which provide coordination from client and distributed computing devices. One or more edge gateway nodes, one or more edge aggregation nodes, and one or more core data centers may be distributed across layers of the network to provide an implementation of the edge computing system by or on behalf of a telecommunication service provider (&#x201c;telco&#x201d;, or &#x201c;TSP&#x201d;), internet-of-things service provider, cloud service provider (CSP), enterprise entity, or any other number of entities. Various implementations and configurations of the edge computing system may be provided dynamically, such as when orchestrated to meet service objectives.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0587">Consistent with the examples provided herein, a client compute node may be embodied as any type of endpoint component, device, appliance, or other thing capable of communicating as a producer or consumer of data. Further, the label &#x201c;node&#x201d; or &#x201c;device&#x201d; as used in the edge computing system does not necessarily mean that such node or device operates in a client or agent/minion/follower role; rather, any of the nodes or devices in the edge computing system refer to individual entities, nodes, or subsystems which include discrete or connected hardware or software configurations to facilitate or use the edge cloud <b>4410</b>.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0588">As such, the edge cloud <b>4410</b> is formed from network components and functional features operated by and within edge gateway nodes, edge aggregation nodes, or other edge compute nodes among network layers <b>4510</b>-<b>4530</b>. The edge cloud <b>4410</b> thus may be embodied as any type of network that provides edge computing and/or storage resources which are proximately located to radio access network (RAN) capable endpoint devices (e.g., mobile computing devices, IoT devices, smart devices, etc.), which are discussed herein. In other words, the edge cloud <b>4410</b> may be envisioned as an &#x201c;edge&#x201d; which connects the endpoint devices and traditional network access points that serve as an ingress point into service provider core networks, including mobile carrier networks (e.g., Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks, 5G/6G networks, etc.), while also providing storage and/or compute capabilities. Other types and forms of network access (e.g., Wi-Fi, long-range wireless, wired networks including optical networks) may also be utilized in place of or in combination with such 3GPP carrier networks.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0589">The network components of the edge cloud <b>4410</b> may be servers, multi-tenant servers, appliance computing devices, and/or any other type of computing devices. For example, the edge cloud <b>4410</b> may include an appliance computing device that is a self-contained electronic device including a housing, a chassis, a case or a shell. In some circumstances, the housing may be dimensioned for portability such that it can be carried by a human and/or shipped. Example housings may include materials that form one or more exterior surfaces that partially or fully protect contents of the appliance, in which protection may include weather protection, hazardous environment protection (e.g., EMI, vibration, extreme temperatures), and/or enable submergibility. Example housings may include power circuitry to provide power for stationary and/or portable implementations, such as AC power inputs, DC power inputs, AC/DC or DC/AC converter(s), power regulators, transformers, charging circuitry, batteries, wired inputs and/or wireless power inputs. Example housings and/or surfaces thereof may include or connect to mounting hardware to enable attachment to structures such as buildings, telecommunication structures (e.g., poles, antenna structures, etc.) and/or racks (e.g., server racks, blade mounts, etc.). Example housings and/or surfaces thereof may support one or more sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, vibration sensors, light sensors, acoustic sensors, capacitive sensors, proximity sensors, etc.). One or more such sensors may be contained in, carried by, or otherwise embedded in the surface and/or mounted to the surface of the appliance. Example housings and/or surfaces thereof may support mechanical connectivity, such as propulsion hardware (e.g., wheels, propellers, etc.) and/or articulating hardware (e.g., robot arms, pivotable appendages, etc.). In some circumstances, the sensors may include any type of input devices such as user interface hardware (e.g., buttons, switches, dials, sliders, etc.). In some circumstances, example housings include output devices contained in, carried by, embedded therein and/or attached thereto. Output devices may include displays, touchscreens, lights, LEDs, speakers, I/O ports (e.g., USB), etc. In some circumstances, edge devices are devices presented in the network for a specific purpose (e.g., a traffic light), but may have processing and/or other capacities that may be utilized for other purposes. Such edge devices may be independent from other networked devices and may be provided with a housing having a form factor suitable for its primary purpose; yet be available for other compute tasks that do not interfere with its primary task. Edge devices include Internet of Things devices. The appliance computing device may include hardware and software components to manage local issues such as device temperature, vibration, resource utilization, updates, power issues, physical and network security, etc. Example hardware for implementing an appliance computing device is described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b>-<b>42</b></figref>. The edge cloud <b>4410</b> may also include one or more servers and/or one or more multi-tenant servers. Such a server may include an operating system and a virtual computing environment. A virtual computing environment may include a hypervisor managing (spawning, deploying, destroying, etc.) one or more virtual machines, one or more containers, etc. Such virtual computing environments provide an execution environment in which one or more applications and/or other software, code or scripts may execute while being isolated from one or more other applications, software, code or scripts.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0590">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>, various client endpoints <b>4610</b> (in the form of mobile devices, computers, autonomous vehicles, business computing equipment, industrial processing equipment) exchange requests and responses that are specific to the type of endpoint network aggregation.

Some client endpoints <b>4610</b>, such as autonomous vehicles may obtain network access for requests and responses <b>4626</b> via a wireless vehicular network through a street-located network system <b>4636</b>. However, regardless of the type of network access, the TSP may deploy aggregation points <b>4642</b>, <b>4644</b> within the edge cloud <b>4410</b> to aggregate traffic and requests.
