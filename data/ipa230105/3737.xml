level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for collecting data for predicting the possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis in an infant or a child having allergy by using, as a criterion, a cutoff value determined by ROC analysis based on the degree of affinity (avidity) of an IgE antibody for an allergen, etc. in a sample collected from the infant or the child.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Food allergy is defined as a &#x201c;phenomenon in which symptoms unfavorable to organisms are induced via antigen-specific immunological mechanisms caused by food&#x201d; (see, for example, non-patent document 1). It is reported that oral immunological tolerance (immune tolerance) typically works on food to be digested or absorbed for the maintenance of humans' life so as not to cause the body's protective response to undigested foreign matter. However, babies of 5 to 10% of the birth population reportedly develop some food allergy by 1 year after birth. Neither the mechanism of occurrence thereof nor a method for predicting occurrence thereof has yet been elucidated completely.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Anaphylaxis is defined as &#x201c;serious (not mild) life-threatening hypersensitive reaction that induces allergic symptoms throughout the body including a plurality of organs by the invasion of an allergen&#x201d; (see, for example, non-patent document 2). Thus, the presence or absence of a risk of anaphylaxis becomes a considerable concern to patients having allergy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various methods for measuring antibody titers of antigen-specific IgE antibodies, including ImmunoCAP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), are currently used for the diagnosis of allergy. However, it has been reported for ImmunoCAP that, for example, in the case of creating a probability curve which indicates the possibility of occurrence of allergy in test subjects, the possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis exhibits a lower value than the actual incidence in infants of classes 2 and 3 with relatively low IgE antibody titers (see, for example, non-patent documents 3 and 4).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method for collecting data for predicting a risk of occurrence of allergy to an allergen in a baby before occurrence of food allergy by respectively quantitatively measuring IgG1 and IgE antibody titers against the allergen in a plasma sample of the baby up to 6 months after birth, and referring to a criterion created on the basis of the degree of immunoglobulin class switching from IgG1 to IgE statistically processed in advance (see, for example, patent document 1) has been proposed and however, has the difficulty in predicting the occurrence of anaphylaxis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">&#x201c;Oral food challenge (OFC)&#x201d;, which has been reported as the most reliable diagnosis method as to the occurrence of anaphylaxis in babies or children having food allergy, is practiced under the attendance of a doctor. Since there is a possibility that a test subject develops anaphylaxis, there is a strong demand for the development of a method for predicting the possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis without OFC. However, there is no previous report on an effective diagnosis method or an effective biomarker, etc. for predicting the possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Object to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an approach of predicting a risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis in an infant or a child having allergy.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means to Solve the Object</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present inventors have thought that in a situation where the occurrence of anaphylaxis cannot be effectively predicted by merely using an antibody titer of an IgE antibody as a parameter, another parameter may be necessary for predicting the occurrence of anaphylaxis. Specifically, the present inventors have thought that the following needs to be taken into consideration: blood contains an IgE antibody as well as an IgG1 antibody, an IgG2 antibody, an IgG3 antibody, an IgG4 antibody, an IgM antibody, an IgA antibody, an IgD antibody, and the like which react with the same allergen and each of these antibodies is a polyclonal antibody that recognizes a plurality of epitopes in an antigen.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present inventors have conceived the idea that in the case of evaluating the binding of the IgE antibody to an allergen, not only the measurement of an IgE antibody titer obtained by measuring only a previously measured constant region of the IgE antibody with a secondary antibody, i.e., the &#x201c;quantity of IgE&#x201d; at the constant region (Fc region) of the IgE antibody shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, but the &#x201c;total affinity between an antigen and the antibody&#x201d; (so-called avidity) as the &#x201c;quality of IgE&#x201d; which is exhibited by a variable region of the IgE antibody against an allergen needs to be taken into consideration. The present inventors selected a value of 1/IC50 as a parameter that indicates avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen, analyzed the presence or absence of occurrence of anaphylaxis using a numerical value obtained by multiplying an IgE antibody titer of each allergen sensitization-positive infant or child by a 1/IC50 value, as the avidity value, and conducted a significant difference test of the parameter. As a result, the present inventors have found that this approach exhibits marked statistically significant difference between a subject with anaphylaxis and a subject without anaphylaxis, as compared with use of the existing parameter. In ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis which is used in the performance evaluation of examination, the numerical value obtained by multiplying an IgE antibody titer by a 1/IC50 value has also been found to have significant increase in area under curve (AUC) as a usefulness index value calculated from sensitivity and specificity thereof, as compared with conventional examination based on only the quantity of an IgE antibody. The present inventors have confirmed that the occurrence of anaphylaxis can be effectively predicted as to allergy patients for which there has been no effective diagnosis method for the possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis so far, leading to the completion of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Specifically, the present invention is defined by the following items.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0000">[1] A method for collecting data for predicting a risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis in an infant or a child having food allergy by using, as a criterion, a cutoff value determined by ROC analysis based on avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen in a sample collected from the infant or the child.<br/>[2] The method for collecting data according to [1], wherein the cutoff value determined by ROC analysis based on avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen is a cutoff value determined by ROC analysis based on a numerical value obtained by multiplying the avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen by an antibody titer of the IgE antibody against the allergen.<br/>[3] The method for collecting data according to [2], wherein the avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen is numerically converted as 1/IC50.<br/>[4] The method for collecting data according to [3], wherein the IC50 is a competitive binding inhibitory activity value.<br/>[5] The method for collecting data according to [1], wherein the cutoff value determined by ROC analysis based on avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen is a cutoff value determined by ROC analysis based on IC50 of the IgE antibody.<br/>[6] The method for collecting data according to [5], wherein the IC50 is a competitive binding inhibitory activity value.<br/>[7] The method for collecting data according to any one of [2] to<br/>[6], wherein the antibody titer of the IgE antibody against the allergen is measured using a DCP chip.<br/>[8] The method for collecting data according to any one of [1] to<br/>[7], wherein the sample is plasma or serum.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0011">According to the present invention, the possibility of occurrence of anaphylaxis can be significantly predicted as to an infant or a child for which the occurrence of anaphylaxis has heretofore been difficult to diagnose.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows structural features that dictate the &#x201c;quantity&#x201d;

Examples of the cutoff value determined by ROC analysis based on avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen can include a cutoff value determined by ROC analysis by using, as a parameter, a numerical value obtained by multiplying the avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen by an antibody titer of the IgE antibody against the allergen, and a cutoff value determined by ROC analysis by using IC50 of the IgE antibody as a parameter. These two cutoff values may be used in combination as a criterion. The method of the present invention may be nonmedically performed, i.e., also includes a method for nonmedically collecting data, and also includes a method for collecting data for predicting a risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis in an infant or a child having food allergy, which excludes the practice of a doctor. Examples of the food allergy can include allergic reaction caused by a specific food product capable of serving as an allergen. Examples of the anaphylaxis can particularly include serious life-threatening hypersensitive reaction among allergic reactions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">The allergen means an antigen that establishes allergen sensitization or triggers allergic reaction and further anaphylaxis. Specifically, the allergen is not particularly limited as long as the allergen is an arbitrary antigenic protein or peptide as well as a sugar chain, a nucleic acid, or the like capable of inducing the production of an IgE antibody in a human. Examples thereof can include an ingredient serving as a food allergen such as eggs, milks, meats such as beef, fishes such as salmon and tuna, crustaceans and mollusks such as shrimps and crabs, cereals, beans and nuts, fruits, vegetables, beer yeast, and gelatin. Among others, examples of the major allergen can include a milk allergen such as &#x3b1;s1-casein, &#x3b1;s2-casein, &#x3b2;-casein, &#x3ba;-casein, &#x3b1;-lactalbumin, and &#x3b2;-lactoglobulin (BLG) which is a major component of a whey allergen, an egg white allergen (EW) which is ovomucoid (OVM), ovalbumin (OVA), conalbumin, or a mixture thereof, an egg yolk allergen, and an egg allergen as a mixture thereof, a wheat allergen such as gliadin and gluten, a buckwheat allergen, a peanut allergen such as Ara h1, a sesame allergen such as <b>11</b>S globulin, and a crustacean allergen such as tropomyosin protein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">The allergen sensitization refers to a state where an allergen that has entered the body is recognized as foreign matter to be eliminated by immune function, which produces an IgE antibody that recognizes and binds to the allergen. Such a state is referred to as being sensitized to the allergen or as established allergen sensitization, etc. Mere allergen sensitization does not always cause allergic reaction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">Examples of the allergic reaction can include reaction in which when an allergen reinvades the body in a situation having the established allergen sensitization, an IgE antibody on a mast cell binds to the allergen so that a chemical mediator such as histamine is released from the mast cell. Symptoms caused by such allergic reaction are referred to as allergic symptoms.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">Examples of the allergic symptom can include: a cutaneous symptom such as itching sensation, hives, angioedema, red flare, and eczema; an eye symptom such as conjunctival injection or edema, itching sensation, lacrimation, and lid edema; a nasal symptom such as sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal congestion; an oropharyngeal symptom such as unpleasant feeling or swelling in the oral cavity, the lip, or the tongue, and itchy throat or irritating feeling in the throat; a digestive symptom such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hematochezia; a respiratory symptom such as throat tightness, pharyngeal edema, hoarseness, coughing, stridor, dyspnea, and asthma; and a systemic symptom such as anaphylactic shock with tachycardia, collapsed state, disturbance of consciousness, and blood pressure reduction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">The sample according to the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the sample is collected from an infant or a child having allergy. Examples thereof can include a body fluid such as blood, serum, plasma, saliva, lacrimal fluid, nasal discharge, and urine collected from a patient. Serum or plasma is preferred. In the case of using serum as the sample, for example, blood is collected from the brachial vein of a patient, and the obtained blood is left standing overnight at 4&#xb0; C. and then centrifuged. The supernatant can be used as the serum. Alternatively, 50 to 100 &#x3bc;L of micro-volume blood obtained by the low-invasive needling of the earlobe or the fingertip with a micro blood collection needle or the like may be collected into a microcapillary tube and used as it is.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">The infant or the child having food allergy is an infant or a child aged 1 year and 0 months (1-year-old) to 12 years, preferably a 1- to 6-year-old infant or child, more preferably a 1- to 3-year-old infant. Examples thereof can include an infant or a child who evidently manifests allergic symptoms by the ingestion of a food allergen, and an infant or a child determined as being allergy-positive and having food allergy by a method known in the art. Such an infant or a child includes an infant or a child who has been evidently sensitized to an allergen and has the possibility of occurrence of allergy and however, has not yet manifested allergic symptoms, and may include an infant or a child definitively diagnosed as being not an allergy-positive subject by OFC, a conventional definitive diagnosis method for food allergy.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Specific examples of the method for determining the presence of food allergy in the infant or the child can include a method of definitively diagnosing the presence or absence of allergy on the basis of a reference in each method in a skin prick test, a basophil activation test, IgE assay known in the art, or OFC.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">[Measurement of IgE Antibody Titer]</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The method for quantitatively measuring the antibody titer of the IgE antibody is not particularly limited as long as the method, including the IgE assay known in the art, can detect the IgE antibody against an allergen in a sample and quantitatively measure the IgE antibody titer. Preferred examples thereof can include ELISA using a labeled secondary antibody which is performed on a carrier. Examples of the carrier in ELISA can include a commercially available chip for ELISA, a chip with a carbon layer formed on the surface of a carrier because of being advantageous in that nonspecific adsorption is low, and a chip containing a chemical modifying group and an activated chip because of being advantageous for peptide immobilization. Among others, a DCP chip can be preferred. Examples of the IgE assay known in the art can include a DCP method using the DCP chip, ImmunoCAP, Allastat 3g, IMM-FAST CHECK, and Oriton IgE. For calculating the antibody titer of IgE, it is also preferred that a blood sample such as serum should be diluted 1-fold to tens of folds, preferably 1.1- to 10-fold, more preferably 1.5- to 5-fold, and then subjected to the quantification of the IgE antibody titer, from the viewpoint of more accurate measurement within the range of accuracy of a calibration curve. In this case, the IgE antibody titer is measured by the DCP method using the DCP chip, etc. and then needs to be multiplied by the dilution ratio of the blood sample to finally determine the IgE antibody titer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">[Dcp Method]</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">In the DCP method, examples of the method for determining the presence or absence of allergy in the targeted infant or child can include a method that can determine the presence of allergy on the basis of the degree of production of an IgE antibody, i.e., an IgE antibody titer, in a blood sample of the targeted infant or child and specifically determines the presence of allergy when the antibody titer against, for example, ovomucoid (OVM), is 800 BUe/mL or more, preferably 1000 BUe/mL or more, though the value differs depending on an allergen.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">Examples of the DCP method can include a method of measuring an IgE antibody by ELISA using a DCP chip.

The total amount of the food product to be ingested in a single portion or divided portions is referred to as a total load. As examples of an ingestion interval and a dividing method, the ingestion interval is 20 to 60 minutes, and gradually increased ingestion of one to five portions in 1 to 2 hours is proposed.

The value of IC50 is a value also called competitive binding inhibitory activity value and can be obtained, for example, by calculating a value that indicates the concentration of an allergen at which antigen-antibody binding reaction is inhibited by 50% as competitive binding inhibitory activity between an immobilized allergen and a soluble allergen. This calculation method is preferred because the value of IC50 can be evaluated even in the presence of an IgG, IgA, IgD, and/or IgM antibody that recognizes the same antigen as that of IgE.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0053">The method for calculating the IC50 value of the IgE antibody is not particularly limited as long as the method can conduct competitive binding assay of the IgE antibody. Examples thereof can include a measurement method by biochemical assay such as ELISA. Examples thereof for a monoclonal antibody or a purified IgE antibody can include Biacore which can measure the degree of interaction by use of surface plasmon resonance technology, and an affinity measurement method by isothermal titration calorimetry.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0054">Examples of the method for calculating the IC50 value by the ELISA can include a method of measuring the affinity of the IgE antibody for an allergen by using a protein denaturant as a chaotropic agent which reduces the intermolecular attraction between an antigen and an antibody, and a measurement method by competitive ELISA. The chaotropic agent does not have high reproducibility because the chaotropic agent might induce reduction in intermolecular attraction not only between an antigen and an antibody but between an antigen and another antigen and an antigen-antibody binding inhibitory effect varies depending on the dilution ratio of serum for use as a specimen even if the concentration of the chaotropic agent is the same. On the other hand, the measurement of the IC50 value by competitive ELISA using a competitive binding inhibition reaction method which is performed by the addition of an allergen at varying concentrations is preferred because this approach is highly reproducible because the IC50 value does not vary depending on the dilution ratio of a sample, permits mutual comparison of IC50 values among different allergens, and can quantitatively compare the total binding activity of antibodies against allergens. Hence, it has been confirmed that for calculating the IC50 value, multiplication by the dilution ratio of a sample is not necessary even if a blood sample such as plasma or serum is diluted. Exemplary specific procedures of the ELISA using a competitive binding inhibition reaction method will be given below.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0055">(Preliminary Reaction)</p><p id="p-0062" num="0056">An allergen with known concentrations prepared in stages from a concentration of 0 (a sample has no antigen as a competitive binding inhibitor) to a concentration sufficient for the binding of the allergen to all IgE antibodies within a given time is added as a competitive binding inhibitor to a sample containing an IgE antibody that binds to an antigen-specific allergen, and reacted for a given time.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0057">Examples of the given time for the preliminary reaction can include 15 minutes to 2 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 1 hour. Concentrations appropriately determined by those skilled in the art on the basis of the amount of the antibody present in the sample, etc. can be used as the known concentrations prepared in stages. Examples of the staged allergen concentrations (final concentrations) that are used in competitive inhibition and added into serum or plasma can include, but are not limited to, a combination of 0 nM, 0.1 nM, 1.0 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1000 nM, and a combination of 0 nM, 0.1 nM, 1.0 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 200 nM. The ELISA using the competitive binding inhibition reaction method is preferably performed as to an allergen having a definitive molecular weight. As for an allergen having an unknown molecular weight whose allergen concentration cannot be adjusted by a molar concentration, the staged allergen concentrations can be adjusted by a unit such as mg/mL or &#x3bc;g/mL.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0058">(Competitive Binding Inhibition Reaction)</p><p id="p-0065" num="0059">A solution after the preliminary reaction is reacted by a method of, for example, applying the solution to an allergen-immobilized carrier so that a free IgE antibody (primary antibody) in the solution after the preliminary reaction binds to the immobilized allergen. Then, the removal of the primary antibody and a washing process are performed, and the resulting solution is then further reacted with a labeled secondary antibody. The amount of the IgE antibody bound is calculated.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0060">The concentration of an allergen at which antigen-antibody binding reaction is inhibited by 50%, i.e., &#x201c;IC50&#x201d;, is expressed as an antigen concentration at which the amount of the label on the labeled secondary antibody to be detected becomes 50% (half maximal inhibitory concentration) when the amount of the label is defined as 100% as to a solution having no competitor allergen (concentration: 0) in the preliminary reaction.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0061">The avidity of the IgE antibody against an allergen can be expressed, as mentioned above, as &#x201c;1/IC50&#x201d;, the reciprocal of the IC50 value, on the basis of the IC50 value. In the ELISA using the competitive binding inhibition reaction method, lower affinity of the IgE antibody in the sample results in a larger amount of a free primary IgE antibody present in the solution after the preliminary reaction. Therefore, a larger amount of the antibody binds to the immobilized allergen, leading to a larger IC50 value. On the other hand, higher affinity of the IgE antibody in the sample results in a smaller amount of a free primary IgE antibody present in the solution after the preliminary reaction. Therefore, a smaller amount of the IgE antibody binds to the immobilized allergen, leading to a smaller IC50 value. Thus, for the sake of convenience, the reciprocal of the IC50 value may be used because the avidity is regarded as a lower numerical value in the case of lower affinity of the IgE antibody and regarded as a higher numerical value in the case of higher affinity of the IgE antibody. Particularly, in the case of multiplying the antigen affinity (avidity) of IgE by an IgE antibody titer for evaluation, the reciprocal of the IC50 value is used.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0062">Examples of the labeled secondary antibody for avidity calculation can include a secondary antibody fluorescently labeled with HiLyte Fluor 555, Atto532, Cy3, Alexa Fluor 555, Cy5, FITC, or rhodamine, a secondary antibody enzymatically labeled with peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase, a magnetic bead-labeled secondary antibody, and an infrared labeled secondary antibody. For example, a Fab fragment or a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment of an antibody can also be used as the secondary antibody.

It thus became clear that the 1- to 3-year-old infants were susceptible to anaphylaxis. The parameter (quantity&#xd7;quality) obtained by multiplying the DCP OVM sIgE value by the OVM avidity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and Table 8, exhibited the highest AUC value of 0.77 on the ROC curve among the 5 groups studied. In this respect, its sensitivity exhibited the highest value of 1.00, showing that this parameter is useful in the diagnosis of a risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis. In these results, (C) DCP OVM sIgE/DCP OVM sIgE IC50 [(BUe/mL)/(nM)] shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and Table 7 exhibited a P value of P=0.0077 with significant difference (P&#x3c;0.008) between the EA(+) (AN&#x2212;) group and the EA(+) (AN+) group.

Thus, it was expected that when DCP OVM sIgE/DCP OVM sIgE IC50 [(BUe/mL)/(nM)] is equal to or higher than this cutoff value of 1225.80 in the diagnosis of a risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis in 1- to 3-year-old subjects, a high risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis to chicken eggs can be determined.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0151">(Conclusion)</p><p id="p-0171" num="0152">The previous diagnosis of allergy involves measuring only the (quantity) of allergen-specific IgE in blood as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and antigen affinity as the quality of allergen-specific IgE is not taken into consideration. Since the reaction of an antibody consists of the &#x201c;quantity&#x201d; and &#x201c;quality&#x201d; of the antibody, the bioreaction of allergen-specific IgE should be evaluated according to its &#x201c;quantity&#x201d; and &#x201c;quality&#x201d;.

This method has the advantages that not only can evaluation be made even in the presence of an IgG, IgA, IgD, and/or IgM antibody that recognizes the same antigen as that of IgE but difference in affinity among allergens or difference in mutual affinity between different allergens can be evaluated with the same parameter. In the present invention, it was confirmed that a risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis which is difficult to diagnose by a conventional method for quantifying allergen-specific IgE, can be predictively diagnosed by measuring avidity (1/IC50 value) of a polyclonal IgE antibody against an allergen in human serum, and using the parameter DCP OVM sIgE/DCP OVM sIgE IC50 [(BUe/mL)/(nM)] obtained by multiplying the antibody titer of DCP OVM sIgE (BUe/mL) by the avidity. Further, it was newly revealed that in the diagnosis of a risk of occurrence of anaphylaxis in 1 to 6-year-old and 1- to 3-year-old chicken egg allergy-positive patients, the values of DCP OVM sIgE IC50 (nM) and 1/DCP OVM sIgE IC50 (nM) serving as single parameters for avidity against an allergen can also discriminate the presence or absence of occurrence of anaphylaxis with significant difference, though the degree of the significant difference is decreased as compared with DCP OVM sIgE/DCP OVM sIgE IC50 [(BUe/mL)/(nM)] obtained by multiplying the antibody titer of DCP OVM sIgE(BUe/mL) by the avidity.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 6</heading><p id="p-0173" num="0154">In order to examine the implementability (effectiveness) of the cutoff values of the IC50 values of chicken egg allergy and chicken egg anaphylaxis calculated from previous ROC analysis and the criterion [(BUe/mL)/IC50] created on the basis of an IgE antibody titer and avidity of an IgE antibody against an allergen, Takatsuki General Hospital (Osaka, Japan), a hospital located in a region different from that of the hospital at which the preceding data (Tables 1 to 8, etc.) was obtained, was requested to recruit allergy patients as OFC participants from Feb. 20, 2020 under the approval of the ethical review board of Takatsuki General Hospital (ethical review board approval No: 2019-92).
