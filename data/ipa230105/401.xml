id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A continuous glucose monitoring system may utilize externally sourced information regarding the physiological state and ambient environment of its user for externally calibrating sensor glucose measurements. Externally sourced factory calibration information may be utilized, where the information is generated by comparing metrics obtained from the data used to generate the sensor's glucose sensing algorithm to similar data obtained from each batch of sensors to be used with the algorithm in the future. The output sensor glucose value of a glucose sensor may also be estimated by analytically optimizing input sensor signals to accurately correct for changes in sensitivity, run-in time, glucose current dips, and other variable sensor wear effects. Correction actors, fusion algorithms, EIS, and advanced ASICs may be used to implement the foregoing, thereby achieving the goal of improved accuracy and reliability without the need for blood-glucose calibration, and providing a calibration-free, or near calibration-free, sensor.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="55.96mm"

No. 62/558,248, filed Sep. 13, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present technology is generally related to sensor technology, including sensors used for sensing a variety of physiological parameters, e.g., glucose concentration, and to enabling elimination of the need for blood glucose (BG) calibration in calibration-free or near-calibration-free glucose sensing systems, devices, and methods.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over the years, a variety of sensors have been developed for detecting and/or quantifying specific agents or compositions in a patient's blood, which enable patients and medical personnel to monitor physiological conditions within the patient's body. Illustratively, subjects may wish to monitor blood glucose levels in a subject's body on a continuing basis. Thus, glucose sensors have been developed for use in obtaining an indication of blood glucose levels in a diabetic patient. Such readings are useful in monitoring and/or adjusting a treatment regimen which typically includes the regular administration of insulin to the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Presently, a patient can measure his/her blood glucose (BG) using a BG measurement device (i.e., glucose meter), such as a test strip meter, a continuous glucose measurement system (or a continuous glucose monitor), or a hospital hemacue. BG measurement devices use various methods to measure the BG level of a patient, such as a sample of the patient's blood, a sensor in contact with a bodily fluid, an optical sensor, an enzymatic sensor, or a fluorescent sensor. When the BG measurement device has generated a BG measurement, the measurement is displayed on the BG measurement device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current continuous glucose measurement systems include subcutaneous (or short-term) sensors and implantable (or long-term) sensors. Sensors have been applied in a telemetered characteristic monitor system. As described, e.g., in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,809,653, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, a telemetered system using an electrochemical sensor includes a remotely located data receiving device, a sensor for producing signals indicative of a characteristic of a user, and a transmitter device for processing signals received from the sensor and for wirelessly transmitting the processed signals to the remotely located data receiving device. The data receiving device may be a characteristic monitor, a data receiver that provides data to another device, an RF programmer, a medication delivery device (such as an infusion pump), or the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regardless of whether the data receiving device (e.g., a glucose monitor), the transmitter device, and the sensor (e.g., a glucose sensor) communicate wirelessly or via an electrical wire connection, a characteristic monitoring system of the type described above is of practical use only after it has been calibrated based on the unique characteristics of the individual user. According to the current state of the art, the user is required to externally calibrate the sensor. More specifically, and in connection with the illustrative example of a diabetic patient, the latter is required to utilize a finger-stick blood glucose meter reading an average of two-four times per day for the duration that the characteristic monitor system is used. Each time, blood is drawn from the user's finger and analyzed by the blood glucose meter to provide a real-time blood sugar level for the user. The user then inputs this data into the glucose monitor as the user's current blood sugar level which is used to calibrate the glucose monitoring system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such external calibrations, however, are disadvantageous for various reasons. For example, blood glucose meters are not perfectly accurate and include inherent margins of error. Moreover, even if completely accurate, blood glucose meters are susceptible to improper use; for example, if the user has handled candy or other sugar-containing substance immediately prior to performing the finger stick, with some of the sugar sticking to the user's fingers, the blood sugar analysis will result in an inaccurate blood sugar level indication. Furthermore, there is a cost, not to mention pain and discomfort, associated with each application of the finger stick.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The current state of the art in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is largely adjunctive, meaning that the readings provided by a CGM device (including, e.g., an implantable or subcutaneous sensor) cannot be used without a reference value in order to make a clinical decision. The reference value, in turn, must be obtained from a finger stick using, e.g., a BG meter. The reference value is needed because there is a limited amount of information that is available from the sensor/sensing component. Specifically, the only pieces of information that are currently provided by the sensing component for processing are the raw sensor value (i.e., the sensor current or Isig) and the counter voltage. Therefore, during analysis, if it appears that the raw sensor signal is abnormal (e.g., if the signal is decreasing), the only way one can distinguish between a sensor failure and a physiological change within the user/patient (i.e., glucose level changing in the body) is by acquiring a reference glucose value via a finger stick. As is known, the reference finger stick is also used for calibrating the sensor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The art has searched for ways to eliminate or, at the very least, minimize, the number of finger sticks that are necessary for calibration and for assessing sensor health. However, given the number and level of complexity of the multitude of sensor failure modes, no satisfactory solution has been found. At most, diagnostics have been developed that are based on either direct assessment of the Isig, or on comparison of multiple Isigs, e.g., from redundant and/or orthogonally redundant, sensors and/or electrodes. In either case, because the Isig tracks the level of glucose in the body, by definition, it is not analyte independent. As such, by itself, the Isig is not a reliable source of information for sensor diagnostics, nor is it a reliable predictor for continued sensor performance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another limitation that has existed in the art thus far has been the lack of sensor electronics that can not only run the sensor, but also perform real-time sensor and electrode diagnostics, and do so for redundant electrodes, all while managing the sensor's power supply. To be sure, the concept of electrode redundancy has been around for quite some time. However, up until now, there has been little to no success in using electrode redundancy not only for obtaining more than one reading at a time, but also for assessing the relative health of the redundant electrodes, the overall reliability of the sensor, and the frequency of the need, if at all, for calibration reference values.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The art has also searched for more accurate and reliable means for providing self-calibrating sensors, and for performing sensor diagnostics by developing a variety of circuit models. In such models, an attempt is generally made to correlate circuit elements to parameters that may be used in intelligent diagnostics, gross failure analysis, and real-time self-calibrations. However, most such models have had limited success thus far.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for external calibration of a glucose sensor used for measuring the level of glucose in the body of a user, the sensor including physical sensor electronics, a microcontroller, and a working electrode, the method comprising periodically measuring, by the physical sensor electronics, electrode current (Isig) signals for the working electrode;

In order to decrease the stabilization period or timeframe and increase the timeliness of accuracy of the sensor, a sensor (or electrodes of a sensor) may be subjected to a number of pulses rather than the application of one pulse followed by the application of another voltage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a method of applying pulses during a stabilization timeframe in order to reduce the stabilization timeframe according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment of the invention, a voltage application device applies <b>600</b> a first voltage to an electrode for a first time or time period. In an embodiment of the invention, the first voltage may be a DC constant voltage. This results in an anodic current being generated. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a digital-to-analog converter or another voltage source may supply the voltage to the electrode for a first time period. The anodic current means that electrons are being driven towards the electrode to which the voltage is applied. In an embodiment of the invention, an application device may apply a current instead of a voltage. In an embodiment of the invention where a voltage is applied to a sensor, after the application of the first voltage to the electrode, the voltage regulator may wait (i.e., not apply a voltage) for a second time, timeframe, or time period <b>605</b>. In other words, the voltage application device waits until a second time period elapses. The non-application of voltage results in a cathodic current, which results in the gaining of electrons by the electrode to which the voltage is not applied. The application of the first voltage to the electrode for a first time period followed by the non-application of voltage for a second time period is repeated <b>610</b> for a number of iterations. This may be referred to as an anodic and cathodic cycle.

In an embodiment of the invention, an electrical detecting mechanism for detecting connection of a sensor may be utilized. In this embodiment of the invention, the hydration detection electronics <b>1250</b> may include an AC source <b>1255</b> and a detection circuit <b>1260</b>. The hydration detection electronics <b>1250</b> may be located in the sensor electronics device <b>1225</b>. The sensor <b>1220</b> may include a counter electrode <b>1221</b>, a reference electrode <b>1222</b>, and a working electrode <b>1223</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the AC source <b>1255</b> is coupled to a voltage setting device <b>1275</b>, the reference electrode <b>1222</b>, and the detection circuit <b>1260</b>. In this embodiment of the invention, an AC signal from the AC source is applied to the reference electrode connection, as illustrated by dotted line <b>1291</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. In an embodiment of the invention, the AC signal is coupled to the sensor <b>1220</b> through an impedance and the coupled signal is attenuated significantly if the sensor <b>1220</b> is connected to the sensor electronics device <b>1225</b>. Thus, a low-level AC signal is present at an input to the detection circuit <b>1260</b>. This may also be referred to as a highly attenuated signal or a signal with a high level of attenuation. Under certain operating conditions, the voltage level of the AC signal may be Vapplied *(Ccoupling)/(Ccoupling+Csensor). If the detection circuit <b>1260</b> detects that a high-level AC signal (lowly attenuated signal) is present at an input terminal of the detection circuit <b>1260</b>, no interrupt is sent to the microcontroller <b>410</b> because the sensor <b>1220</b> has not been sufficiently hydrated or activated. For example, the input of the detection circuit <b>1260</b> may be a comparator. If the sensor <b>1220</b> is sufficiently hydrated (or wetted), an effective capacitance forms between the counter electrode and the reference electrode (e.g., capacitance C<sub>r-c </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), and an effective capacitance forms between the reference electrode and the working electrode (e.g., capacitance C<sub>w-r </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). In other words, an effective capacitance relates to capacitance being formed between two nodes and does not represent that an actual capacitor is placed in a circuit between the two electrodes. In an embodiment of the invention, the AC signal from the AC source <b>1255</b> is sufficiently attenuated by capacitances C<sub>r-c </sub>and C<sub>w-r </sub>and the detection circuit <b>1260</b> detects the presence of a low level or highly attenuated AC signal from the AC source <b>1255</b> at the input terminal of the detection circuit <b>1260</b>. This embodiment of the invention is significant because the utilization of the existing connections between the sensor <b>1120</b> and the sensor electronics device <b>1125</b> reduces the number of connections to the sensor. In other words, the mechanical switch, disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, requires a switch and associated connections between the sensor <b>1120</b> and the sensor electronics device <b>1125</b>. It is advantageous to eliminate the mechanical switch because the sensor <b>1120</b> is continuously shrinking in size and the elimination of components helps achieve this size reduction. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the AC signal may be applied to different electrodes (e.g., the counter electrode or the working electrode) and the invention may operate in a similar fashion.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">As noted above, after the detection circuit <b>1260</b> has detected that a low-level AC signal is present at the input terminal of the detection circuit <b>1260</b>, the detection circuit <b>1260</b> may later detect that a high-level AC signal, with low attenuation, is present at the input terminal. This represents that the sensor <b>1220</b> has been disconnected from the sensor electronics device <b>1225</b> or that the sensor is not operating properly. If the sensor has been disconnected from the sensor electronics device <b>1225</b>, the AC source may be coupled with little or low attenuation to the input of the detection circuit <b>1260</b>. As noted above, the detection circuit <b>1260</b> may generate an interrupt to the microcontroller. This interrupt may be received by the microcontroller and the microcontroller may reduce or eliminate power to one or a number of components or circuits in the sensor electronics device <b>1225</b>. This may be referred to as the second interrupt. Again, this helps reduce power consumption of the sensor electronics device <b>1225</b>, specifically when the sensor <b>1220</b> is not connected to the sensor electronics device <b>1225</b>.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">In an alternative embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the AC signal may be applied to the reference electrode <b>1222</b>, as is illustrated by reference numeral <b>1291</b>, and an impedance measuring device <b>1277</b> may measure the impedance of an area in the sensor <b>1220</b>.

In this embodiment of the invention, in response to the interrupt, the microcontroller <b>410</b> generates a signal that is transferred to a digital-to-analog converter <b>420</b> to instruct or cause the digital-to-analog converter <b>420</b> to apply a voltage or current to the sensor <b>1220</b>.

This results in a sensor signal being generated by the sensor, e.g., the working electrode <b>1223</b> of the sensor. Because the sensor is sufficiently hydrated, as identified by the interrupt, the sensor signal created at the working electrode <b>1223</b> is accurately measuring glucose. The sensor signal is measured by a sensor signal measuring device <b>431</b> and the sensor signal measuring device <b>431</b> transmits the sensor signal to the microcontroller <b>410</b> where a parameter of a subject's physiological condition is measured. The generation of the interrupt represents that a sensor is sufficiently hydrated and that the sensor <b>1220</b> is now supplying accurate glucose measurements. In this embodiment of the invention, the hydration period may depend on the type and/or the manufacturer of the sensor and on the sensor's reaction to insertion or implantation in the subject. Illustratively, one sensor <b>1220</b> may have a hydration time of five minutes and one sensor <b>1220</b> may have a hydration time of one minute, two minutes, three minutes, six minutes, or 20 minutes. Again, any amount of time may be an acceptable amount of hydration time for the sensor, but smaller amounts of time are preferable.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">If the sensor <b>1220</b> has been connected, but is not sufficiently hydrated or wetted, the effective capacitances C<sub>r-c </sub>and C<sub>w-r </sub>may not attenuate the AC signal from the AC source <b>1255</b>. The electrodes in the sensor <b>1120</b> are dry before insertion and because the electrodes are dry, a good electrical path (or conductive path) does not exist between the two electrodes. Accordingly, a high-level AC signal or lowly attenuated AC signal may still be detected by the detection circuit <b>1260</b> and no interrupt may be generated. Once the sensor has been inserted, the electrodes become immersed in the conductive body fluid. This results in a leakage path with lower DC resistance. Also, boundary layer capacitors form at the metal/fluid interface. In other words, a rather large capacitance forms between the metal/fluid interface and this large capacitance looks like two capacitors in series between the electrodes of the sensor. This may be referred to as an effective capacitance. In practice, a conductivity of an electrolyte above the electrode is being measured. In some embodiments of the invention, the glucose limiting membrane (GLM) also illustrates impedance blocking electrical efficiency.

If the impedance (or resistance) is below the impedance (or resistance) value or other set criteria, (which may be a threshold value), an interrupt is transmitted <b>1431</b> to the microcontroller. After receiving the interrupt, the microcontroller transmits <b>1440</b> a signal to the DAC instructing the DAC to apply a stabilization sequence of voltages (or currents) to the sensor. After the stabilization sequence has been applied to the sensor, a sensor signal is created in the sensor (e.g., at the working electrode), is measured by a sensor signal measuring device, is transmitted by the sensor signal measuring device, and is received <b>1450</b> by the microcontroller. Because the sensor is hydrated, and the stabilization sequence of voltages has been applied to the sensor, the sensor signal is accurately measuring a physiological parameter (i.e., blood glucose).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref> illustrates a third embodiment of the invention where a stabilization method and hydration method are combined. In this embodiment of the invention, the sensor is connected <b>1500</b> to the sensor electronics device. After the sensor is physically connected to the sensor electronics device, an AC signal (or DC signal) is applied <b>1510</b> to an electrode (e.g., reference electrode) of the sensor. At the same time, or around the same time, the microcontroller transmits a signal to cause the DAC to apply <b>1520</b> a stabilization voltage sequence to the sensor. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a stabilization current sequence may be applied to the sensor instead of a stabilization voltage sequence. The detection circuit determines <b>1530</b> what level of an AC signal (or DC signal) is present at an input terminal of the detection circuit. If there is a low-level AC signal (or DC signal), representing a highly attenuated AC signal (or DC signal), present at the input terminal of the detection circuit, an interrupt is transmitted <b>1540</b> to the microcontroller. Because the microcontroller has already initiated the stabilization sequence, the microcontroller receives the interrupt and sets <b>1550</b> a first indicator that the sensor is sufficiently hydrated. After the stabilization sequence is complete, the microcontroller sets <b>1555</b> a second indicator indicating the completion of the stabilization sequence. The application of the stabilization sequence voltages results in the sensor, e.g., the working electrode, creating <b>1560</b> a sensor signal, which is measured by a sensor signal measuring circuit, and sent to the microcontroller. If the second indicator that the stabilization sequence is complete is set and the first indicator that the hydration is complete is set, the microcontroller is able to utilize <b>1570</b> the sensor signal. If one or both of the indicators are not set, the microcontroller may not utilize the sensor signal because the sensor signal may not represent accurate measurements of the physiological measurements of the subject.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">The above-described hydration and stabilization processes may be used, in general, as part of a larger continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) methodology. The current state of the art in continuous glucose monitoring is largely adjunctive, meaning that the readings provided by a CGM device (including, e.g., an implantable or subcutaneous sensor) cannot be used without a reference value in order to make a clinical decision. The reference value, in turn, must be obtained from a finger stick using, e.g., a BG meter. The reference value is needed because there is a limited amount of information that is available from the sensor/sensing component. Specifically, the only pieces of information that are currently provided by the sensing component for processing are the raw sensor value (i.e., the sensor current or Isig) and the counter voltage, which is the voltage between the counter electrode and the reference electrode (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Therefore, during analysis, if it appears that the raw sensor signal is abnormal (e.g., if the signal is decreasing), the only way one can distinguish between a sensor failure and a physiological change within the user/patient (i.e., glucose level changing in the body) is by acquiring a reference glucose value via a finger stick. As is known, the reference finger stick is also used for calibrating the sensor.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">Embodiments of the inventions described herein are directed to advancements and improvements in continuous glucose monitoring resulting in a more autonomous system, as well as related devices and methodologies, wherein the requirement of reference finger sticks may be minimized, or eliminated, and whereby clinical decisions may be made based on information derived from the sensor signal alone, with a high level of reliability. From a sensor-design standpoint, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, such autonomy may be achieved through electrode redundancy, sensor diagnostics, and Isig and/or sensor glucose (SG) fusion.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">As will be explored further hereinbelow, redundancy may be achieved through the use of multiple working electrodes (e.g., in addition to a counter electrode and a reference electrode) to produce multiple signals indicative of the patient's blood glucose (BG) level. The multiple signals, in turn, may be used to assess the relative health of the (working) electrodes, the overall reliability of the sensor, and the frequency of the need, if at all, for calibration reference values.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">Sensor diagnostics includes the use of additional (diagnostic) information which can provide a real-time insight into the health of the sensor. In this regard, it has been discovered that Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) provides such additional information in the form of sensor impedance and impedance-related parameters at different frequencies. Moreover, advantageously, it has been further discovered that, for certain ranges of frequencies, impedance and/or impedance-related data are substantially glucose independent. Such glucose independence enables the use of a variety of EIS-based markers or indicators for not only producing a robust, highly-reliable sensor glucose value (through fusion methodologies), but also assessing the condition, health, age, and efficiency of individual electrode(s) and of the overall sensor substantially independently of the glucose-dependent Isig.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">For example, analysis of the glucose-independent impedance data provides information on the efficiency of the sensor with respect to how quickly it hydrates and is ready for data acquisition using, e.g., values for 1 kHz real-impedance, 1 kHz imaginary impedance, and Nyquist Slope (to be described in more detail hereinbelow). Moreover, glucose-independent impedance data provides information on potential occlusion(s) that may exist on the sensor membrane surface, which occlusion(s) may temporarily block passage of glucose into the sensor and thus cause the signal to dip (using, e.g., values for 1 kHz real impedance). In addition, glucose-independent impedance data provides information on loss of sensor sensitivity during extended wear&#x2014;potentially due to local oxygen deficit at the insertion site&#x2014;using, e.g., values for phase angle and/or imaginary impedance at 1 kHz and higher frequencies.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">Within the context of electrode redundancy and EIS, as well as other contexts, as will be described in further detail hereinbelow, a fusion algorithm may be used to take the diagnostic information provided by EIS for each redundant electrode and assess the reliability of each electrode independently. Weights, which are a measure of reliability, may then be added for each independent signal, and a single fused signal may be calculated that can be used to generate sensor glucose values as seen by the patient/subject.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">As can be seen from the above, the combined use of redundancy, sensor diagnostics using EIS, and EIS-based fusion algorithms allows for an overall CGM system that is more reliable than what is currently available. Redundancy is advantageous in at least two respects. First, redundancy removes the risk of a single point of failure by providing multiple signals. Second, providing multiple (working) electrodes where a single electrode may be sufficient allows the output of the redundant electrode to be used as a check against the primary electrode, thereby reducing, and perhaps eliminating, the need for frequent calibrations. In addition, EIS diagnostics scrutinize the health of each electrode autonomously without the need for a reference glucose value (finger stick), thereby reducing the number of reference values required. However, the use of EIS technology and EIS diagnostic methods is not limited to redundant systems, i.e., those having more than one working electrode. Rather, as is discussed below in connection with embodiments of the invention, EIS may be advantageously used in connection with single- and/or multiple-electrode sensors.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">EIS, or AC impedance methods, study the system response to the application of a periodic small amplitude AC signal.

However, although impedance, per se, may be mathematically simply defined as &#x394;E/&#x394;I, heretofore, there has been no commercialization success in application of EIS technology to continuous glucose monitoring. This has been due, in part, to the fact that glucose sensors are very complicated systems and, so far, no mathematical models have been developed which can completely explain the complexity of the EIS output for a glucose sensor.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">One simplified electrical circuit model that has been used to describe electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>.

In this regard, EIS is an improvement over previous methodologies that may have limited the application to a simple DC current or an AC voltage of single frequency. Although, generally, EIS may be performed at frequencies in the &#x3bc;Hz to MHz range, in embodiments of the invention, a narrower range of frequencies (e.g., between about 0.1 Hz and about 8 kHz) may be sufficient. Thus, in embodiments of the invention, AC potentials may be applied that fall within a frequency range of between about 0.1 Hz and about 8 kHz, with a programmable amplitude of up to at least 100 mV, and preferably at about 50 mV.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0276">Within the above-mentioned frequency range, the relatively-higher frequencies&#x2014;i.e., those that fall generally between about 1 kHz and about 8 kHz&#x2014;are used to scrutinize the capacitive nature of the sensor.

The relatively-lower frequencies&#x2014;i.e., those that fall generally between about 0.1 Hz and about 100 Hz&#x2014;on the other hand, are used to scrutinize the resistive nature of the sensor. Here, depending on electrode design and the extent of metallization, a typical functioning range for output real impedance may be, e.g., between about 50 kOhms and 300 kOhms, and atypical range for the phase may be between about &#x2212;50 degrees to about &#x2212;90 degrees. The above illustrative ranges are shown, e.g., in the Bode plots of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>E and <b>16</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0277">As noted previously, the phrases &#x201c;higher frequencies&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower frequencies&#x201d; are meant to be used relative to one another, rather than in an absolute sense, and they, as well as the typical impedance and phase ranges mentioned above, are meant to be illustrative, and not limiting. Nevertheless, the underlying principle remains the same: the capacitive and resistive behavior of a sensor can be scrutinized by analyzing the impedance data across a frequency spectrum, wherein, typically, the lower frequencies provide information about the more resistive components (e.g., the electrode, etc.), while the higher frequencies provide information about the capacitive components (e.g., membranes). However, the actual frequency range in each case is dependent on the overall design, including, e.g., the type(s) of electrode(s), the surface area of the electrode(s), membrane thickness, the permeability of the membrane, and the like. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref> regarding general correspondence between high-frequency circuit components and the sensor membrane, as well as between low-frequency circuit components and the Faradaic process, including, e.g., the electrode(s).</p><p id="p-0286" num="0278">EIS may be used in sensor systems where the sensor includes a single working electrode, as well those in which the sensor includes multiple (redundant) working electrodes. In one embodiment, EIS provides valuable information regarding the age (or aging) of the sensor. Specifically, at different frequencies, the magnitude and the phase angle of the impedance vary. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the sensor impedance&#x2014;in particular, the sum of Rp and Rs&#x2014;reflects the sensor age as well as the sensor's operating conditions. Thus, a new sensor normally has higher impedance than a used sensor as seen from the different plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. In this way, by considering the X-value of the sum of Rp and Rs, a threshold can be used to determine when the sensor's age has exceeded the specified operating life of the sensor. It is noted that, although for the illustrative examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>21</b></figref> and discussed below, the value of real impedance at the inflection point (i.e., Rp+Rs) is used to determine the aging, status, stabilization, and hydration of the sensor, alternative embodiments may use other EIS-based parameters, such as, e.g., imaginary impedance, phase angle, Nyquist slope, etc. in addition to, or in place of, real impedance.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0279"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> illustrates an example of a Nyquist plot over the life time of a sensor. The points indicated by arrows are the respective inflection points for each of the sweeps across the frequency spectrum. For example, before initialization (at time t=0), Rs+Rp is higher than 8.5 kOhms, and after initialization (at time t=0.5 hr), the value of Rs+Rp dropped to below 8 kOhms. Over the next six days, Rs+Rp continues to decrease, such that, at the end of the specified sensor life, Rs+Rp dropped to below 6.5 kOhms. Based on such examples, a threshold value can be set to specify when the Rs+Rp value would indicate the end of the specified operating life of the sensor. Therefore, the EIS technique allows closure of the loophole of allowing a sensor to be re-used beyond the specified operating time. In other words, if the patient attempts to re-use a sensor after the sensor has reached its specified operating time by disconnecting and then re-connecting the sensor again, the EIS will measure abnormally-low impedance, thereby enabling the system to reject the sensor and prompt the patient for a new sensor.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0280">Additionally, EIS may enable detection of sensor failure by detecting when the sensor's impedance drops below a low impedance threshold level indicating that the sensor may be too worn to operate normally. The system may then terminate the sensor before the specified operating life. As will be explored in more detail below, sensor impedance can also be used to detect other sensor failure (modes). For example, when a sensor goes into a low-current state (i.e., sensor failure) due to any variety of reasons, the sensor impedance may also increase beyond a certain high impedance threshold. If the impedance becomes abnormally high during sensor operation, due, e.g., to protein or polypeptide fouling, macrophage attachment or any other factor, the system may also terminate the sensor before the specified sensor operating life.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0281"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates how the EIS technique can be applied during sensor stabilization and in detecting the age of the sensor in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The logic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> begins at <b>1800</b> after the hydration procedure and sensor initialization procedure described previously has been completed. In other words, the sensor has been deemed to be sufficiently hydrated, and the first initialization procedure has been applied to initialize the sensor. The initialization procedure may preferably be in the form of voltage pulses as described previously in the detailed description. However, in alternative embodiments, different waveforms can be used for the initialization procedure. For example, a sine wave can be used, instead of the pulses, to accelerate the wetting or conditioning of the sensor. In addition, it may be necessary for some portion of the waveform to be greater than the normal operating voltage of the sensor, i.e., 0.535 volt.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0282">At block <b>1810</b>, an EIS procedure is applied and the impedance is compared to both a first high and a first low threshold. An example of a first high and first low threshold value would be 7 kOhms and 8.5 kOhms, respectively, although the values can be set higher or lower as needed. If the impedance, for example, Rp+Rs, is higher than the first high threshold, the sensor undergoes an additional initialization procedure (e.g., the application of one or more additional pulses) at block <b>1820</b>. Ideally, the number of total initialization procedures applied to initialize the sensor would be optimized to limit the impact on both the battery life of the sensor and the overall amount of time needed to stabilize a sensor. Thus, by applying EIS, fewer initializations can be initially performed, and the number of initializations can be incrementally added to give just the right amount of initializations to ready the sensor for use. Similarly, in an alternative embodiment, EIS can be applied to the hydration procedure to minimize the number of initializations needed to aid the hydration process as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0283">On the other hand, if the impedance, for example, Rp+Rs, is below the first low threshold, the sensor will be determined to be faulty and would be terminated immediately at block <b>1860</b>. A message will be given to the user to replace the sensor and to begin the hydration process again. If the impedance is within the high and low thresholds, the sensor will begin to operate normally at block <b>1830</b>. The logic then proceeds to block <b>1840</b> where an additional EIS is performed to check the age of the sensor. The first time the logic reaches block <b>1840</b>, the microcontroller will perform an EIS to gauge the age of the sensor to close the loophole of the user being able to plug in and plug out the same sensor. In future iterations of the EIS procedure as the logic returns to block <b>1840</b>, the microprocessor will perform an EIS at fixed intervals during the specified life of the sensor. In one preferred embodiment, the fixed interval is set for every 2 hours, however, longer or shorter periods of time can easily be used.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0284">At block <b>1850</b>, the impedance is compared to a second set of high and low thresholds. An example of such second high and low threshold values may be 5.5 kOhms and 8.5 kOhms, respectively, although the values can be set higher or lower as needed. As long as the impedance values stay within a second high and low threshold, the logic proceeds to block <b>1830</b>, where the sensor operates normally until the specified sensor life, for example, 5 days, is reached. Of course, as described with respect to block <b>1840</b>, EIS will be performed at the regularly scheduled intervals throughout the specified sensor life. However, if, after the EIS is performed, the impedance is determined to have dropped below a second lower threshold or risen above a second higher threshold at block <b>1850</b>, the sensor is terminated at block <b>1860</b>. In further alternative embodiments, a secondary check can be implemented of a faulty sensor reading. For example, if the EIS indicates that the impedance is out of the range of the second high and low thresholds, the logic can perform a second EIS to confirm that the second set of thresholds is indeed not met (and confirm that the first EIS was correctly performed) before determining the end of sensor at block <b>1860</b>.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> builds upon the above description and details a possible schedule for performing diagnostic EIS procedures in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention. Each diagnostic EIS procedure is optional and it is possible to not schedule any diagnostic EIS procedure or to have any combination of one or more diagnostic EIS procedures, as deemed needed. The schedule of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> begins at sensor insertion at point <b>1900</b>. Following sensor insertion, the sensor undergoes a hydration period <b>1910</b>. This hydration period is important because a sensor that is not sufficiently hydrated may give the user inaccurate readings, as described previously. The first optional diagnostic EIS procedure at point <b>1920</b> is scheduled during this hydration period <b>1910</b> to ensure that the sensor is sufficiently hydrated. The first diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1920</b> measures the sensor impedance value to determine if the sensor has been sufficiently hydrated. If the first diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1920</b> determines impedance is within a set high and low threshold, indicating sufficient hydration, the sensor controller will allow the sensor power-up at point <b>1930</b>. Conversely, if the first diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1920</b> determines impedance is outside a set high and low threshold, indicating insufficient hydration, the sensor hydration period <b>1910</b> may be prolonged. After prolonged hydration, once a certain capacitance has been reached between the sensor's electrodes, meaning the sensor is sufficiently hydrated, power-up at point <b>1930</b> can occur.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0286">A second optional diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1940</b> is scheduled after sensor power-up at point <b>1930</b>, but before sensor initialization starts at point <b>1950</b>. Scheduled here, the second diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1940</b> can detect if a sensor is being re-used prior to the start of initialization at <b>1950</b>. The test to determine if the sensor is being reused was detailed in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. However, unlike the previous description with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, where the aging test is performed after initialization is completed, the aging test is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> as being performed before initialization. It is important to appreciate that the timeline of EIS procedures described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> can be rearranged without affecting the overall teaching of the application, and that the order of some of the steps can be interchanged. As explained previously, the second diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1940</b> detects a re-used sensor by determining the sensor's impedance value and then comparing it to a set high and low threshold. If impedance falls outside of the set threshold, indicating the sensor is being re-used, the sensor may then be rejected, and the user prompted to replace it with a new sensor. This prevents the complications that may arise out of re-use of an old sensor. Conversely, if impedance falls within a set threshold, sensor initialization <b>1950</b> can start with the confidence that a new sensor is being used.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0287">A third optional diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1960</b> is scheduled after initialization starts at point <b>1950</b>. The third diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1960</b> tests the sensor's impedance value to determine if the sensor is fully initialized. The third diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1960</b> should be performed at the minimum amount of time needed for any sensor to be fully initialized. When performed at this time, sensor life is maximized by limiting the time a fully initialized sensor goes unused, and over-initialization is averted by confirming full initialization of the sensor before too much initialization occurs. Preventing over-initialization is important because over-initialization results in a suppressed current which can cause inaccurate readings. However, under-initialization is also a problem, so if the third diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1960</b> indicates the sensor is under-initialized, an optional initialization at point <b>1970</b> may be performed in order to fully initialize the sensor. Under-initialization is disadvantageous because it results in an excessive current that does not relate to the actual glucose concentration. Because of the danger of under- and over-initialization, the third diagnostic EIS procedure plays an important role in ensuring the sensor functions properly when used.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0288">In addition, optional periodic diagnostic EIS procedures <b>1980</b> can be scheduled for the time after the sensor is fully initialized. The EIS procedures <b>1980</b> can be scheduled at any set interval. As will be discussed in more detail below, EIS procedures <b>1980</b> may also be triggered by other sensor signals, such as an abnormal current or an abnormal counter electrode voltage. Additionally, as few or as many EIS procedures <b>1980</b> can be scheduled as desired. In preferred embodiments, the EIS procedure used during the hydration process, sensor life check, initialization process, or the periodic diagnostic tests is the same procedure. In alternative embodiments, the EIS procedure can be shortened or lengthened (i.e., fewer or more ranges of frequencies checked) for the various EIS procedures depending on the need to focus on specific impedance ranges. The periodic diagnostic EIS procedures <b>1980</b> monitor impedance values to ensure that the sensor is continuing to operate at an optimal level.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0289">The sensor may not be operating at an optimal level if the sensor current has dropped due to polluting species, sensor age, or a combination of polluting species and sensor age. A sensor that has aged beyond a certain length is no longer useful, but a sensor that has been hampered by polluting species can possibly be repaired. Polluting species can reduce the surface area of the electrode or the diffusion pathways of analytes and reaction byproducts, thereby causing the sensor current to drop. These polluting species are charged and gradually gather on the electrode or membrane surface under a certain voltage. Previously, polluting species would destroy the usefulness of a sensor. Now, if periodic diagnostic EIS procedures <b>1980</b> detect impedance values which indicate the presence of polluting species, remedial action can be taken. When remedial action is to be taken is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. Periodic diagnostic EIS procedures <b>1980</b> therefore become extremely useful because they can trigger sensor remedial action which can possibly restore the sensor current to a normal level and prolong the life of the sensor. Two possible embodiments of sensor remedial actions are described below in the descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0290">Additionally, any scheduled diagnostic EIS procedure <b>1980</b> may be suspended or rescheduled when certain events are determined imminent. Such events may include any circumstance requiring the patient to check the sensor reading, including for example when a patient measures his or her BG level using a test strip meter in order to calibrate the sensor, when a patient is alerted to a calibration error and the need to measure his or her BG level using a test strip meter a second time, or when a hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic alert has been issued but not acknowledged.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0291"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> illustrates a method of combining diagnostic EIS procedures with sensor remedial action in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The block <b>2000</b> diagnostic procedure may be any of the periodic diagnostic EIS procedures <b>1980</b> as detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. The logic of this method begins when a diagnostic EIS procedure is performed at block <b>2000</b> in order to detect the sensor's impedance value. As noted, in specific embodiments, the EIS procedure applies a combination of a DC bias and an AC voltage of varying frequencies wherein the impedance detected by performing the EIS procedure is mapped on a Nyquist plot, and an inflection point in the Nyquist plot approximates a sum of polarization resistance and solution resistance (i.e., the real impedance value). After the block <b>2000</b> diagnostic EIS procedure detects the sensor's impedance value, the logic moves to block <b>2010</b>.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0292">At block <b>2010</b>, the impedance value is compared to a set high and low threshold to determine if it is normal. If impedance is within the set boundaries of the high and low thresholds at block <b>2010</b>, normal sensor operation is resumed at block <b>2020</b> and the logic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> will end until a time when another diagnostic EIS procedure is scheduled. Conversely, if impedance is determined to be abnormal (i.e., outside the set boundaries of the high and low thresholds) at block <b>2010</b>, remedial action at block <b>2030</b> is triggered. An example of a high and low threshold value that would be acceptable during a sensor life would be 5.5 kOhms and 8.5 kOhms, respectively, although the values can be set higher or lower as needed.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0293">The block <b>2030</b> remedial action is performed to remove any of the polluting species, which may have caused the abnormal impedance value. In preferred embodiments, the remedial action is performed by applying a reverse current, or a reverse voltage between the working electrode and the reference electrode. The specifics of the remedial action will be described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. After the remedial action is performed at block <b>2030</b>, impedance value is again tested by a diagnostic EIS procedure at block <b>2040</b>. The success of the remedial action is then determined at block <b>2050</b> when the impedance value from the block <b>2040</b> diagnostic EIS procedure is compared to the set high or low threshold. As in block <b>2010</b>, if impedance is within the set thresholds, it is deemed normal, and if impedance is outside the set thresholds, it is deemed abnormal.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0294">If the sensor's impedance value is determined to have been restored to normal at block <b>2050</b>, normal sensor operation at block <b>2020</b> will occur. If impedance is still not normal, indicating that either sensor age is the cause of the abnormal impedance or the remedial action was unsuccessful in removing the polluting species, the sensor is then terminated at block <b>2060</b>. In alternative embodiments, instead of immediately terminating the sensor, the sensor may generate a sensor message initially requesting the user to wait and then perform further remedial action after a set period of time has elapsed. This alternative step may be coupled with a separate logic to determine if the impedance values are getting closer to being within the boundary of the high and low threshold after the initial remedial action is performed. For example, if no change is found in the sensor impedance values, the sensor may then decide to terminate. However, if the sensor impedance values are getting closer to the preset boundary, yet still outside the boundary after the initial remedial action, an additional remedial action could be performed. In yet another alternative embodiment, the sensor may generate a message requesting the user to calibrate the sensor by taking a finger stick meter measurement to further confirm whether the sensor is truly failing. All of the above embodiments work to prevent a user from using a faulty sensor that produces inaccurate readings.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0295"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the sensor remedial action previously mentioned. In this embodiment, blockage created by polluting species is removed by reversing the voltage being applied to the sensor between the working electrode and the reference electrode. The reversed DC voltage lifts the charged, polluting species from the electrode or membrane surface, clearing diffusion pathways. With cleared pathways, the sensor's current returns to a normal level and the sensor can give accurate readings. Thus, the remedial action saves the user the time and money associated with replacing an otherwise effective sensor.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0296"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the sensor remedial action previously mentioned. In this embodiment, the reversed DC voltage applied between the working electrode and the reference electrode is coupled with an AC voltage. By adding the AC voltage, certain tightly absorbed species or species on the superficial layer can be removed since the AC voltage can extend its force further from the electrode and penetrate all layers of the sensor. The AC voltage can come in any number of different waveforms. Some examples of waveforms that could be used include square waves, triangular waves, sine waves, or pulses. As with the previous embodiment, once polluting species are cleared, the sensor can return to normal operation, and both sensor life and accuracy are improved.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0297">While the above examples illustrate the use, primarily, of real impedance data in sensor diagnostics, embodiments of the invention are also directed to the use of other EIS-based, and substantially analyte-independent, parameters (in addition to real impedance) in sensor diagnostic procedures. For example, as mentioned previously, analysis of (substantially) glucose-independent impedance data, such as, e.g., values for 1 kHz real impedance and 1 kHz imaginary impedance, as well as Nyquist slope, provide information on the efficiency of the sensor with respect to how quickly it hydrates and is ready for data acquisition. Moreover, (substantially) glucose-independent impedance data, such as, e.g., values for 1 kHz real impedance, provides information on potential occlusion(s) that may exist on the sensor membrane surface, which occlusion(s) may temporarily block passage of glucose into the sensor and thus cause the signal to dip.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0298">In addition, (substantially) glucose-independent impedance data, such as, e.g., values for higher-frequency phase angle and/or imaginary impedance at 1 kHz and higher frequencies, provides information on loss of sensor sensitivity during extended wear, which sensitivity loss may potentially be due to local oxygen deficit at the insertion site. In this regard, the underlying mechanism for oxygen deficiency-led sensitivity loss may be described as follows: when local oxygen is deficient, sensor output (i.e., Isig and SG) will be dependent on oxygen rather than glucose and, as such, the sensor will lose sensitivity to glucose. Other markers, including 0.1 Hz real impedance, the counter electrode voltage (Vcntr), and EIS-induced spikes in the Isig may also be used for the detection of oxygen deficiency-led sensitivity loss. Moreover, in a redundant sensor system, the relative differences in 1 kHz real impedance, 1 kHz imaginary impedance, and 0.1 Hz real impedance between two or more working electrodes may be used for the detection of sensitivity loss due to biofouling.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0299">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, EIS-based sensor diagnostics entails consideration and analysis of EIS data relating to one or more of at least three primary factors, i.e., potential sensor failure modes: (1) signal start-up; (2) signal dip; and (3) sensitivity loss. Significantly, the discovery herein that a majority of the impedance-related parameters that are used in such diagnostic analyses and procedures can be studied at a frequency, or within a range of frequencies, where the parameter is substantially analyte-independent allows for implementation of sensor-diagnostic procedures independently of the level of the analyte in a patient's body. Thus, while EIS-based sensor diagnostics may be triggered by, e.g., large fluctuations in Isig, which is analyte-dependent, the impedance-related parameters that are used in such sensor diagnostic procedures are themselves substantially independent of the level of the analyte. As will be explored in more detail below, it has also been found that, in a majority of situations where glucose may be seen to have an effect on the magnitude (or other characteristic) of an EIS-based parameter, such effect is usually small enough&#x2014;e.g., at least an order of magnitude difference between the EIS-based measurement and the glucose effect thereon&#x2014;such that it can be filtered out of the measurement, e.g., via software in the IC.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0300">By definition, &#x201c;start-up&#x201d; refers to the integrity of the sensor signal during the first few hours (e.g., t=0-6 hours) after insertion. For example, in current devices, the signal during the first 2 hours after insertion is deemed to be unreliable and, as such, the sensor glucose values are blinded to the patient/user. In situations where the sensor takes an extended amount of time to hydrate, the sensor signal is low for several hours after insertion. With the use of EIS, additional impedance information is available (by running an EIS procedure) right after the sensor has been inserted. In this regard, the total impedance equation may be used to explain the principle behind low-startup detection using 1 kHz real impedance. At relatively higher frequencies&#x2014;in this case, 1 kHz and above&#x2014;imaginary impedance is very small (as confirmed with in-vivo data), such that total impedance reduces to:</p><p id="p-0309" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>Z</mi>    <mi>t</mi>   </msub>   <mo>(</mo>   <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>R</mi>    <mi>s</mi>   </msub>   <mo>+</mo>   <mfrac>    <msub>     <mi>R</mi>     <mi>p</mi>    </msub>    <mrow>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>+</mo>     <mrow>      <msup>       <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msup>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <msubsup>       <mi>R</mi>       <mi>p</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msubsup>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <msubsup>       <mi>C</mi>       <mi>d</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msubsup>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mfrac>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0310" num="0301">As sensor wetting is gradually completed, the double layer capacitance (Ca) increases. As a result, the total impedance will decrease because, as indicated in the equation above, total impedance is inversely proportional to Ca. This is illustrated in the form of the intercept <b>1600</b> on the real impedance axis shown, e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>. Importantly, the 1 kHz imaginary impedance can also be used for the same purpose, as it also includes, and is inversely proportional to, a capacitance component.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0302">Another marker for low startup detection is Nyquist slope, which relies solely on the relatively lower-frequency impedance which, in turn, corresponds to the Warburg impedance component of total impedance (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a Nyquist plot for a normally-functioning sensor, where Arrow A is indicative of the progression of time, i.e., sensor wear time, starting from t=0. Thus, EIS at the relatively-lower frequencies is performed right after sensor insertion (time t=0), which generates real and imaginary impedance data that is plotted with a first linear fit <b>2200</b> having a first (Nyquist) slope. At a time-interval after t=0, a second (lower) frequency sweep is run that produces a second linear fit <b>2210</b> having a second (Nyquist) slope larger than the first Nyquist slope, and so on. As the sensor becomes more hydrated, the Nyquist slope increases, and the intercept decrease, as reflected by the lines <b>2200</b>, <b>2210</b>, etc. becoming steeper and moving closer to the Y-axis. In connection with low startup detection, clinical data indicates that there is typically a dramatic increase of Nyquist slope after sensor insertion and initialization, which is then stabilized to a certain level. One explanation for this is that, as the sensor is gradually wetted, the species diffusivity as well as concentration undergo dramatic change, which is reflected in Warburg impedance.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0303">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>, the Isig <b>2230</b> for a first working electrode WE<b>1</b> starts off lower than expected (at about 10 nA) and takes some time to catch up with the Isig <b>2240</b> for a second working electrode WE<b>2</b>. Thus, in this particular example, WE<b>1</b> is designated as having a low start-up. The EIS data reflects this low start-up in two ways. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>, the real impedance at 1 kHz (<b>2235</b>) of WE<b>1</b> is much higher than the 1 kHz real impedance <b>2245</b> of WE<b>2</b>. Second, when compared to the Nyquist slope for WE<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>), the Nyquist slope for WE<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>) starts out lower, has a larger intercept <b>2237</b>, and takes more time to stabilize. As will be discussed later, these two signatures&#x2014;the 1 kHz real impedance and the Nyquist slope&#x2014;can be used as diagnostic inputs in a fusion algorithm to decide which of the two electrodes can carry a higher weight when the fused signal is calculated. In addition, one or both of these markers may be used in a diagnostic procedure to determine whether the sensor, as a whole, is acceptable, or whether it should be terminated and replaced.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0304">By definition, signal (or Isig) dips refer to instances of low sensor signal, which are mostly temporary in nature, e.g., on the order of a few hours. Such low signals may be caused, for example, by some form of biological occlusion on the sensor surface, or by pressure applied at the insertion site (e.g., while sleeping on the side). During this period, the sensor data is deemed to be unreliable; however, the signal does recover eventually. In the EIS data, this type of signal dip&#x2014;as opposed to one that is caused by a glycemic change in the patient's body&#x2014;is reflected in the 1 kHz real impedance data, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0305">Specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, both the Isig <b>2250</b> for the first working electrode WE<b>1</b> and the Isig <b>2260</b> for the second working electrode WE<b>2</b> start out at about 25 nA at the far-left end (i.e., at 6 pm). As time progresses, both Isigs fluctuate, which is reflective of glucose fluctuations in the vicinity of the sensor. For about the first 12 hours or so (i.e., until about 6 am), both Isigs are fairly stable, as are their respective 1 kHz real impedances <b>2255</b>, <b>2265</b>. However, between about 12 and 18 hours&#x2014;i.e., between 6 am and noon&#x2014;the Isig <b>2260</b> for WE<b>2</b> starts to dip and continues a downward trend for the next several hours, until about 9 pm. During this period, the Isig <b>2250</b> for WE<b>1</b> also exhibits some dipping, but Isig <b>2250</b> is much more stable, and dips quite a bit less, than Isig <b>2260</b> for WE<b>2</b>. The behavior of the Isigs for WE<b>1</b> and WE<b>2</b> is also reflected in their respective 1 kHz real impedance data. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, during the time period noted above, while the 1 kHz real impedance for WE<b>1</b> (<b>2255</b>) remains fairly stable, there is a marked increase in the 1 kHz real impedance for WE<b>2</b> (<b>2265</b>).</p><p id="p-0315" num="0306">By definition, sensitivity loss refers to instances where the sensor signal (Isig) becomes low and non-responsive for an extended period of time and is usually unrecoverable. Sensitivity loss may occur for a variety of reasons. For example, electrode poisoning drastically reduces the active surface area of the working electrode, thereby severely limiting current amplitude. Sensitivity loss may also occur due to hypoxia, or oxygen deficit, at the insertion site. In addition, sensitivity loss may occur due to certain forms of extreme surface occlusion (i.e., a more permanent form of the signal dip caused by biological or other factors) that limit the passage of both glucose and oxygen through the sensor membrane, thereby lowering the number/frequency of the chemical reactions that generate current in the electrode and, ultimately, the sensor signal (Isig). It is noted that the various causes of sensitivity loss mentioned above apply to both short-term (7 to 10-day wear) and long term (6-month wear) sensors.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0307">In the EIS data, sensitivity loss is often preceded by an increase in the absolute value of phase (|phase|) and of the imaginary impedance (|imaginary impedance|) at the relatively higher frequency ranges (e.g., 128 Hz and above, and 1 kHz and above, respectively). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref> shows an example of a normally-functioning glucose sensor where the sensor current <b>2500</b> is responsive to glucose&#x2014;i.e., Isig <b>2500</b> tracks glucose fluctuations&#x2014;but all relevant impedance outputs, such as, e.g., 1 kHz real impedance <b>2510</b>, 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>2530</b>, and phase for frequencies at or above about 128 Hz (<b>2520</b>), remain steady, as they are substantially glucose-independent.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0308">Specifically, the top graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref> shows that, after the first few hours, the 1 kHz real impedance <b>2510</b> holds fairly steady at about 5 kOhms (and the 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>2530</b> holds fairly steady at about &#x2212;400 Ohms). In other words, at 1 kHz, the real impedance data <b>2510</b> and the imaginary impedance data <b>2530</b> are substantially glucose-independent, such that they can be used as signatures for, or independent indicators of, the health, condition, and ultimately, reliability of the specific sensor under analysis. However, as mentioned previously, different impedance-related parameters may exhibit glucose-independence at different frequency ranges, and the range, in each case, may depend on the overall sensor design, e.g., electrode type, surface area of electrode, thickness of membrane, permeability of membrane, etc.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0309">Thus, in the example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>&#x2014;for a 90% short tubeless electrode design&#x2014;the top graph again shows that sensor current <b>2501</b> is responsive to glucose, and that, after the first few hours, the 1 kHz real impedance <b>2511</b> holds fairly steady at about 7.5 kOhms. The bottom graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref> shows real impedance data for frequencies between 0.1 Hz (<b>2518</b>) and 1 kHz (<b>2511</b>). As can be seen, the real impedance data at 0.1 Hz (<b>2518</b>) is quite glucose-dependent. However, as indicated by reference numerals <b>2516</b>, <b>2514</b>, and <b>2512</b>, real impedance becomes more and more glucose-independent as the frequency increases from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz, i.e., for impedance data measured at frequencies closer to 1 kHz.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0310">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>, the middle graph shows that the phase <b>2520</b> at the relatively-higher frequencies is substantially glucose-independent. It is noted, however, that &#x201c;relatively-higher frequencies&#x201d; in connection with this parameter (phase) for the sensor under analysis means frequencies of 128 Hz and above. In this regard, the graph shows that the phase for all frequencies between 128 Hz and 8 kHz is stable throughout the period shown. On the other hand, as can be seen in the bottom graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>C</figref>, while the phase <b>2522</b> at 128 Hz (and above) is stable, the phase <b>2524</b> fluctuates&#x2014;i.e., it becomes more and more glucose-dependent, and to varying degrees&#x2014;at frequencies that are increasingly smaller than 128 Hz. It is noted that the electrode design for the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>C</figref> is the same as that used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>, and that the top graph in the former is identical to the top graph in the latter.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0311"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows an example of sensitivity loss due to oxygen deficiency at the insertion site. In this case, the insertion site becomes oxygen deprived just after day 4 (designated by dark vertical line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>), causing the sensor current <b>2600</b> to become low and non-responsive. The 1 kHz real impedance <b>2610</b> remains stable, indicating no physical occlusion on the sensor. However, as shown by the respective downward arrows, changes in the relatively higher-frequency phase <b>2622</b> and 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>2632</b> coincide with loss in sensitivity, indicating that this type of loss is due to an oxygen deficit at the insertion site. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows that the phase at higher frequencies (<b>2620</b>) and the 1 kHz imaginary impedance (<b>2630</b>) become more negative prior to the sensor losing sensitivity&#x2014;indicated by the dark vertical line&#x2014;and continue their downward trend as the sensor sensitivity loss continues. Thus, as noted above, this sensitivity loss is preceded, or predicted, by an increase in the absolute value of phase (|phase|) and of the imaginary impedance (|imaginary impedance|) at the relatively higher frequency ranges (e.g., 128 Hz and above, and 1 kHz and above, respectively).</p><p id="p-0321" num="0312">The above-described signatures may be verified by in-vitro testing, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> shows the results of in-vitro testing of a sensor, where oxygen deficit at different glucose concentrations is simulated. In the top graph, the Isig fluctuates with the glucose concentration as the latter is increased from 100 mg/dl (<b>2710</b>) to 200 mg/dl (<b>2720</b>), 300 mg/dl (<b>2730</b>), and 400 mg/dl (<b>2740</b>), and then decreased back down to 200 md/dl (<b>2750</b>). In the bottom graph, the phase at the relatively-higher frequencies is generally stable, indicating that it is glucose-independent. However, at very low oxygen concentrations, such as, e.g., at 0.1% O<sub>2</sub>, the relatively high-frequency phase fluctuates, as indicated by the encircled areas and arrows <b>2760</b>, <b>2770</b>. It is noted that the magnitude and/or direction (i.e., positive or negative) of fluctuation depend on various factors. For example, the higher the ratio of glucose concentration to oxygen concentration, the higher the magnitude of the fluctuation in phase. In addition, the specific sensor design, as well as the age of the sensor (i.e., as measured by time after implant), affect such fluctuations. Thus, e.g., the older a sensor is, the more susceptible it is to perturbations.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0313"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A-<b>28</b>D</figref> show another example of oxygen deficiency-led sensitivity loss with redundant working electrodes WE<b>1</b> and WE<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>A</figref>, the 1 kHz real impedance <b>2810</b> is steady, even as sensor current <b>2800</b> fluctuates and eventually becomes non-responsive. Also, as before, the change in 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>2820</b> coincides with the sensor's loss of sensitivity. In addition, however, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>B</figref> shows real impedance data and imaginary impedance data (<b>2830</b> and <b>2840</b>, respectively) at 0.105 Hz. The latter, which may be more commonly referred to as &#x201c;0.1 Hz data&#x201d;, indicates that, whereas imaginary impedance at 0.1 Hz appears to be fairly steady, 0.1 Hz real impedance <b>2830</b> increases considerably as the sensor loses sensitivity. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>C</figref>, with loss of sensitivity due to oxygen deficiency, V<sub>cntr </sub><b>2850</b> rails to 1.2 Volts.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0314">In short, the diagrams illustrate the discovery that oxygen deficiency-led sensitivity loss is coupled with lower 1 kHz imaginary impedance (i.e., the latter becomes more negative), higher 0.105 Hz real impedance (i.e., the latter becomes more positive), and V<sub>cntr </sub>rail. Moreover, the oxygen-deficiency process and V<sub>cntr</sub>-rail are often coupled with the increase of the capacitive component in the electrochemical circuit. It is noted that, in some of the diagnostic procedures to be described later, the 0.105 Hz real impedance may not be used, as it appears that this relatively lower-frequency real impedance data may be analyte-dependent.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0315">Finally, in connection with the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A-<b>28</b>D</figref>, it is noted that 1 kHz or higher-frequency impedance measurement typically causes EIS-induced spikes in the Isig. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>D</figref>, where the raw Isig for WE<b>2</b> is plotted against time. The drastic increase of Isig when the spike starts is a non-Faradaic process, due to double-layer capacitance charge. Thus, oxygen deficiency-led sensitivity loss may also be coupled with higher EIS-induced spikes, in addition to lower 1 kHz imaginary impedance, higher 0.105 Hz real impedance, and Vcntr rail, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0316"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> illustrates another example of sensitivity loss. This case may be thought of as an extreme version of the Isig dip described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. Here, the sensor current <b>2910</b> is observed to be low from the time of insertion, indicating that there was an issue with an insertion procedure resulting in electrode occlusion. The 1 kHz real-impedance <b>2920</b> is significantly higher, while the relatively higher-frequency phase <b>2930</b> and the 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>2940</b> are both shifted to much more negative values, as compared to the same parameter values for the normally-functioning sensor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>. The shift in the relatively higher-frequency phase <b>2930</b> and 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>2940</b> indicates that the sensitivity loss may be due to an oxygen deficit which, in turn, may have been caused by an occlusion on the sensor surface.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0317"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A-<b>30</b>D</figref> show data for another redundant sensor, where the relative differences in 1 kHz real impedance and 1 kHz imaginary impedance, as well as 0.1 Hz real impedance, between two or more working electrodes may be used for the detection of sensitivity loss due to biofouling. In this example, WE<b>1</b> exhibits more sensitivity loss than WE<b>2</b>, as is evident from the higher 1 kHz real impedance <b>3010</b>, lower 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>3020</b>, and much higher real impedance at 0.105 kHz (<b>3030</b>) for WE<b>2</b>. In addition, however, in this example, V<sub>cntr </sub><b>3050</b> does not rail. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>D</figref>, the height of the spikes in the raw Isig data does not change much as time progresses. This indicates that, for sensitivity loss due to biofouling, V<sub>cntr</sub>-rail and the increase in spike height are correlated. In addition, the fact that the height of the spikes in the raw Isig data does not change much with time indicates that the capacitive component of the circuit does not change significantly with time, such that sensitivity loss due to biofouling is related to the resistance component of the circuit (i.e., diffusion).</p><p id="p-0327" num="0318">Various of the above-described impedance-related parameters may be used, either individually or in combination, as inputs into: (1) EIS-based sensor diagnostic procedures; and/or (2) fusion algorithms for generating more reliable sensor glucose values. With regard to the former, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> illustrates how EIS-based data&#x2014;i.e., impedance-related parameters, or characteristics&#x2014;may be used in a diagnostic procedure to determine, in real time, whether a sensor is behaving normally, or whether it should be replaced.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0319">The diagnostic procedure illustrated in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> is based on the collection of EIS data on a periodic basis, such as, e.g., hourly, every half hour, every 10 minutes, or at any other interval&#x2014;including continuously&#x2014;as may be appropriate for the specific sensor under analysis. At each such interval, EIS may be run for an entire frequency spectrum (i.e., a &#x201c;full sweep&#x201d;), or it may be run for a selected frequency range, or even at a single frequency. Thus, for example, for an hourly data collection scheme, EIS may be performed at frequencies in the &#x3bc;Hz to MHz range, or it may be run for a narrower range of frequencies, such as, e.g., between about 0.1 Hz and about 8 kHz, as discussed hereinabove. In embodiments of the invention, EIS data acquisition may be implemented alternatingly between a full sweep and a narrower-range spectrum, or in accordance with other schemes.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0320">The temporal frequency of EIS implementation and data collection may be dictated by various factors. For example, each implementation of EIS consumes a certain amount of power, which is typically provided by the sensor's battery, i.e., the battery running the sensor electronics, including the ASIC which is described later. As such, battery capacity, as well as the remaining sensor life, may help determine the number of times EIS is run, as well as the breadth of frequencies sampled for each such run. In addition, embodiments of the invention envision situations that may require that an EIS parameter at a specific frequency (e.g., real impedance at 1 kHz) be monitored based on a first schedule (e.g., once every few seconds, or minutes), while other parameters, and/or the same parameter at other frequencies, can be monitored based on a second schedule (e.g., less frequently). In these situations, the diagnostic procedure can be tailored to the specific sensor and requirements, such that battery power may be preserved, and unnecessary and/or redundant EIS data acquisition may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0321">It is noted that, in embodiments of the invention, a diagnostic procedure, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, entails a series of separate &#x201c;tests&#x201d; which are implemented in order to perform real-time monitoring of the sensor. The multiple tests, or markers&#x2014;also referred to as &#x201c;multi markers&#x201d;&#x2014;are implemented because each time EIS is run (i.e., each time an EIS procedure is performed), data may be gathered about a multiplicity of impedance-based parameters, or characteristics, which can be used to detect sensor condition or quality, including, e.g., whether the sensor has failed or is failing. In performing sensor diagnostics, sometimes, there can be a diagnostic test that may indicate a failure, whereas other diagnostic(s) may indicate no failure. Therefore, the availability of multiple impedance-related parameters, and the implementation of a multi-test procedure, are advantageous, as some of the multiplicity of tests may act as validity checks against some of the other tests. Thus, real-time monitoring using a multi-marker procedure may include a certain degree of built-in redundancy.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0322">With the above in mind, the logic of the diagnostic procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> begins at <b>3100</b>, after the sensor has been inserted/implanted, and an EIS run has been made, so as to provide the EIS data as input. At <b>3100</b>, using the EIS data as input, it is first determined whether the sensor is still in place. Thus, if the |Z| slope is found to be constant across the tested frequency band (or range), and/or the phase angle is about &#x2212;90&#xb0;, it is determined that the sensor is no longer in place, and an alert is sent, e.g., to the patient/user, indicating that sensor pullout has occurred. The specific parameters (and their respective values) described herein for detecting sensor pullout are based on the discovery that, once the sensor is out of the body and the membrane is no longer hydrated, the impedance spectrum response appears just like a capacitor.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0323">If it is determined that the sensor is still in place, the logic moves to step <b>3110</b> to determine whether the sensor is properly initialized. As shown, the &#x201c;Init. Check&#x201d; is performed by determining: (i) whether |(Z<sub>n</sub>&#x2212;Z<sub>1</sub>)/Z<sub>1</sub>|&#x3e;30% at 1 kHz, where Z<sub>1 </sub>is the real impedance measured at a first time, and Z<sub>n </sub>is the measured impedance at the next interval, at discussed above; and (2) whether the phase angle change is greater than 100 at 0.1 Hz. If the answer to either one of the questions is &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, then the test is satisfactory, i.e., the Test 1 is not failed. Otherwise, the Test 1 is marked as a failure.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0324">At step <b>3120</b>, Test 2 asks whether, at a phase angle of &#x2212;45&#xb0;, the difference in frequency between two consecutive EIS runs (f<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>1</sub>) is greater than 10 Hz. Again, a &#x201c;No&#x201d; answer is marked as a fail; otherwise, Test 2 is satisfactorily met.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0325">Test 3 at step <b>3130</b> is a hydration test. Here, the inquiry is whether the current impedance Z<sub>n </sub>is less than the post-initialization impedance Z<sub>pi </sub>at 1 kHz. If it is, then this test is satisfied; otherwise, Test 3 is marked as a fail. Test 4 at step <b>3140</b> is also a hydration test, but this time at a lower frequency. Thus, this test asks whether Zn is less than 300 kOhms at 0.1 Hz during post-initialization sensor operation. Again, a &#x201c;No&#x201d; answer indicates that the sensor has failed Test 4.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0326">At step <b>3150</b>, Test 5 inquires whether the low-frequency Nyquist slope is globally increasing from 0.1 Hz to 1 Hz. As discussed previously, for a normally-operating sensor, the relatively lower-frequency Nyquist slope should be increasing overtime. Thus, this testis satisfied if the answer to the inquiry is &#x201c;yes&#x201d;; otherwise, the test is marked as failed.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0327">Step <b>3160</b> is the last test for this embodiment of the diagnostic procedure. Here, the inquiry is whether real impedance is globally decreasing. Again, as was discussed previously, in a normally-operating sensor, it is expected that, as time goes by, the real impedance should be decreasing. Therefore, a &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; answer here would mean that the sensor is operating normally; otherwise, the sensor fails Test 6.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0328">Once all 6 tests have been implemented, a decision is made at <b>3170</b> as to whether the sensor is operating normally, or whether it has failed. In this embodiment, a sensor is determined to be functioning normally (<b>3172</b>) if it passes at least 3 out of the 6 tests. Put another way, in order to be determined to have failed (<b>3174</b>), the sensor must fail at least 4 out of the 6 tests. In alternative embodiments, a different rule may be used to assess normal operation versus sensor failure. In addition, in embodiments of the invention, each of the tests may be weighted, such that the assigned weight reflects, e.g., the importance of that test, or of the specific parameter(s) queried for that test, in determining overall sensor operation (normal vs. failed). For example, one test may be weighted twice as heavily as another, but only half as heavily as a third test, etc.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0329">In other alternative embodiments, a different number of tests and/or a different set of EIS-based parameters for each test may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B</figref> show an example of a diagnostic procedure for real-time monitoring that includes 7 tests. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>, the logic begins at <b>3200</b>, after the sensor has been inserted/implanted, and an EIS procedure has been performed, so as to provide the EIS data as input. At <b>3200</b>, using the EIS data as input, it is first determined whether the sensor is still in place. Thus, if the |Z| slope is found to be constant across the tested frequency band (or range), and/or the phase angle is about &#x2212;90&#xb0;, it is determined that the sensor is no longer in place, and an alert is sent, e.g., to the patient/user, indicating that sensor pullout has occurred. If, on the other hand, the sensor is determined to be in place, the logic moves to initiation of diagnostic checks (<b>3202</b>).</p><p id="p-0339" num="0330">At <b>3205</b>, Test 1 is similar to Test 1 of the diagnostic procedure discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, except that the instant Test 1 specifies that the later measurement Zn is taken 2 hours after the first measurement. As such, in this example, Z<sub>n</sub>=Z<sub>2hr</sub>. More specifically, Test 1 compares the real impedance 2 hours after (sensor implantation and) initialization to the pre-initialization value. Similarly, the second part of Test 1 asks whether the difference between the phase 2 hours after initialization and the pre-initialization phase is greater than 100 at 0.1 Hz. As before, if the answer to either one of the inquiries is affirmative, then it is determined that the sensor is hydrated normally and initialized, and Test 1 is satisfied; otherwise, the sensor fails this test. It should be noted that, even though the instant test inquires about impedance and phase change 2 hours after initialization, the time interval between any two consecutive EIS runs may be shorter or longer, depending on a variety of factors, including, e.g., sensor design, the level of electrode redundancy, the degree to which the diagnostic procedure includes redundant tests, battery power, etc.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0331">Moving to <b>3210</b>, the logic next performs a sensitivity-loss check by inquiring whether, after a 2-hour interval (n+2), the percentage change in impedance magnitude at 1 kHz, as well as that in the Isig, is greater than 30%. If the answer to both inquiries is &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, then it is determined that the sensor is losing sensitivity and, as such, Test 2 is determined to be failed. It is noted that, although Test 2 is illustrated herein based on a preferred percentage difference of 30%, in other embodiments, the percentage differences in the impedance magnitude at 1 kHz and in the Isig may fall within the range 10%-50% for purposes of conducting this test.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0332">Test 3 (at <b>3220</b>) is similar to Test 5 of the algorithm illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>. Here, as before, the question is whether the low-frequency Nyquist slope is globally increasing from 0.1 Hz to 1 Hz. If it is, then this test is passed; otherwise, the test is failed. As shown in <b>3220</b>, this test is also amenable to setting a threshold, or an acceptable range, for the percent change in the low-frequency Nyquist slope, beyond which the sensor may be deemed to be failed or, at the very least, may trigger further diagnostic testing. In embodiments of the invention, such threshold value/acceptable range for the percent change in low-frequency Nyquist slope may fall within a range of about 2% to about 20%. In some preferred embodiments, the threshold value may be about 5%.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0333">The logic next moves to <b>3230</b>, which is another low-frequency test, this time involving the phase and the impedance magnitude. More specifically, the phase test inquires whether the phase at 0.1 Hz is continuously increasing over time. If it is, then the test is failed. As with other tests where the parameter's trending is monitored, the low-frequency phase test of Test 4 is also amenable to setting a threshold, or an acceptable range, for the percent change in the low-frequency phase, beyond which the sensor may be deemed to be failed or, at the very least, raise a concern. In embodiments of the invention, such threshold value/acceptable range for the percent change in low-frequency phase may fall within a range of about 5% to about 30%. In some preferred embodiments, the threshold value may be about 10%.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0334">As noted, Test 4 also includes a low-frequency impedance magnitude test, where the inquiry is whether the impedance magnitude at 0.1 Hz is continuously increasing over time. If it is, then the test is failed. It is noted that Test 4 is considered &#x201c;failed&#x201d; if either the phase test or the impedance magnitude test is failed. The low-frequency impedance magnitude test of Test 4 is also amenable to setting a threshold, or an acceptable range, for the percent change in the low-frequency impedance magnitude, beyond which the sensor may be deemed to be failed or, at the very least, raise a concern. In embodiments of the invention, such threshold value/acceptable range for the percent change in low-frequency impedance magnitude may fall within a range of about 5% to about 30%. In some preferred embodiments, the threshold value may be about 10%, where the range for impedance magnitude in normal sensors is generally between about 100 KOhms and about 200 KOhms.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0335">Test 5 (at <b>3240</b>) is another sensitivity loss check that may be thought of as supplemental to Test 2. Here, if both the percentage change in the Isig and the percentage change in the impedance magnitude at 1 kHz are greater than 30%, then it is determined that the sensor is recovering from sensitivity loss. In other words, it is determined that the sensor had previously undergone some sensitivity loss, even if the sensitivity loss was not, for some reason, detected by Test 2. As with Test 2, although Test 5 is illustrated based on a preferred percentage difference of 30%, in other embodiments, the percentage differences in the Isig and the impedance magnitude at 1 kHz may fall within the range 10%-50% for purposes of conducting this test.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0336">Moving to <b>3250</b>, Test 6 provides a sensor functionality test with specific failure criteria that have been determined based on observed data and the specific sensor design. Specifically, in one embodiment, a sensor may be determined to have failed and, as such, to be unlikely to respond to glucose, if at least two out of the following three criteria are met: (1) Isig is less than 10 nA; and (2) the imaginary impedance at 1 kHz is less than &#x2212;1500 Ohm; and (3) the phase at 1 kHz is less than &#x2212;15&#xb0;. Thus, Test 6 is determined to have been passed if any two of (1)-(3) are not met. It is noted that, in other embodiments, the Isig prong of this test may be failed if the Isig is less than about 5 nA to about 20 nA. Similarly, the second prong may be failed if the imaginary impedance at 1 kHz is less than about &#x2212;1000 Ohm to about &#x2212;2000 Ohms. Lastly, the phase prong may be failed if the phase at 1 kHz is less than about &#x2212;10&#xb0; to about &#x2212;20&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0337">Lastly, step <b>3260</b> provides another sensitivity check, wherein the parameters are evaluated at low frequency. Thus, Test 7 inquires whether, at 0.1 Hz, the magnitude of the difference between the ratio of the imaginary impedance to the Isig (n+2), on the one hand, and the pervious value of the ratio, on the other, is larger than 30% of the magnitude of the previous value of the ratio. If it is, then the test is failed; otherwise, the test is passed. Here, although Test 7 is illustrated based on a preferred percentage difference of 30%, in other embodiments, the percentage difference may fall within the range 10%-50% for purposes of conducting this test.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0338">Once all 7 tests have been implemented, a decision is made at <b>3270</b> as to whether the sensor is operating normally, or whether an alert should be sent out, indicating that the sensor has failed (or may be failing). As shown, in this embodiment, a sensor is determined to be functioning normally (<b>3272</b>) if it passes at least 4 out of the 7 tests. Put another way, in order to be determined to have failed, or to at least raise a concern (<b>3274</b>), the sensor must fail at least 4 out of the 7 tests. If it is determined that the sensor is &#x201c;bad&#x201d; (<b>3274</b>), an alert to that effect may be sent, e.g., to the patient/user. As noted previously, in alternative embodiments, a different rule may be used to assess normal operation versus sensor failure/concern. In addition, in embodiments of the invention, each of the tests may be weighted, such that the assigned weight reflects, e.g., the importance of that test, or of the specific parameter(s) queried for that test, in determining overall sensor operation (normal vs. failed).</p><p id="p-0348" num="0339">As was noted previously, in embodiments of the invention, various of the above-described impedance-related parameters may be used, either individually or in combination, as inputs into one or more fusion algorithms for generating more reliable sensor glucose values. Specifically, it is known that, unlike a single-sensor (i.e., a single-working-electrode) system, multiple sensing electrodes provide higher-reliability glucose readouts, as a plurality of signals, obtained from two or more working electrodes, may be fused to provide a single sensor glucose value. Such signal fusion utilizes quantitative inputs provided by EIS to calculate the most reliable output sensor glucose value from the redundant working electrodes. It is noted that, while the ensuing discussion may describe various fusion algorithms in terms of a first working electrode (WE<b>1</b>) and a second working electrode (WE<b>2</b>) as the redundant electrodes, this is by way of illustration, and not limitation, as the algorithms and their underlying principles described herein are applicable to, and may be used in, redundant sensor systems having more than 2 working electrodes.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0340"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A and <b>33</b>B</figref> show top-level flowcharts for two alternative methodologies, each of which includes a fusion algorithm. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref> is a flowchart involving a current (Isig)-based fusion algorithm, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref> is a flowchart directed to sensor glucose (SG) fusion. As may be seen from the diagrams, the primary difference between the two methodologies is the time of calibration. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref> shows that, for Isig fusion, calibration <b>3590</b> is performed after the fusion <b>3540</b> is completed. That is, redundant Isigs from WE<b>1</b> to WEn are fused into a single Isig <b>3589</b>, which is then calibrated to produce a single sensor glucose value <b>3598</b>. For SG fusion, on the other hand, calibration <b>3435</b> is completed for each individual Isig from WE<b>1</b> to WEn to produce calibrated SG values (e.g., <b>3436</b>, <b>3438</b>) for each of the working electrodes. Thus, SG fusion algorithms provide for independent calibration of each of the plurality of Isigs, which may be preferred in embodiments of the invention. Once calibrated, the plurality of calibrated SG values is fused into a single SG value <b>3498</b>.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0341">It is important to note that each of flowcharts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A and <b>33</b>B</figref> includes a spike filtering process (<b>3520</b>, <b>3420</b>). As was described above in the discussion relating to sensitivity loss, 1 kHz or higher-frequency impedance measurements typically cause EIS-induced spikes in the Isig. Therefore, once an EIS procedure has been performed for each of the electrodes WE<b>1</b> to WEn, for both SG fusion and Isig fusion, it is preferable to first filter the Isigs <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b>, etc. and <b>3510</b>, <b>3512</b>, etc. to obtain respective filtered Isigs <b>3422</b>, <b>3424</b>, etc. and <b>3522</b>, <b>3524</b>, etc. The filtered Isigs are then either used in Isig fusion, or first calibrated and then used in SG fusion, as detailed below. As will become apparent in the ensuing discussion, both fusion algorithms entail calculation and assignment of weights based on various factors.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0342"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> shows the details of the fusion algorithm <b>3440</b> for SG fusion. Essentially, there are four factors that need to be checked before the fusion weights are determined. First, integrity check <b>3450</b> involves determining whether each of the following parameters is within specified ranges for normal sensor operation (e.g., predetermined lower and upper thresholds): (i) Isig; (ii) 1 kHz real and imaginary impedances; (iii) 0.105 Hz real and imaginary impedances; and (iv) Nyquist slope. As shown, integrity check <b>3450</b> includes a Bound Check <b>3452</b> and a Noise Check <b>3456</b>, wherein, for each of the Checks, the above-mentioned parameters are used as input parameters. It is noted that, for brevity, real and/or imaginary impedances, at one or more frequencies, appear on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A-<b>35</b></figref> simply as &#x201c;Imp&#x201d; for impedance. In addition, both real and imaginary impedances may be calculated using impedance magnitude and phase (which is also shown as an input on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A and <b>33</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0352" num="0343">The output from each of the Bound Check <b>3452</b> and the Noise Check <b>3458</b> is a respective reliability index (RI) for each of the redundant working electrodes. Thus, the output from the Bound Check includes, e.g., RI_bound_We<sub>1 </sub>(<b>3543</b>) and RI_bound_We<sub>2 </sub>(<b>3454</b>). Similarly, for the Noise Check, the output includes, e.g., RI_noise_We<sub>1 </sub>(<b>3457</b>) and RI_noise_We<sub>2 </sub>(<b>3458</b>). The bound and noise reliability indices for each working electrode are calculated based on compliance with the above-mentioned ranges for normal sensor operation. Thus, if any of the parameters falls outside the specified ranges for a particular electrode, the reliability index for that particular electrode decreases.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0344">It is noted that the threshold values, or ranges, for the above-mentioned parameters may depend on various factors, including the specific sensor and/or electrode design. Nevertheless, in one preferred embodiment, typical ranges for some of the above-mentioned parameters may be, e.g., as follows: Bound threshold for 1 kHz real impedance=[0.3e+4 2e+4]; Bound threshold for 1 kHz imaginary impedance=[&#x2212;2e+3, 0]; Bound threshold for 0.105 Hz real impedance=[2e+4 7e+4]; Bound threshold for 0.105 Hz imaginary impedance=[&#x2212;2e+5-0.25e+5]; and Bound threshold for Nyquist slope=[2 5]. Noise may be calculated, e.g., using second order central difference method where, if noise is above a certain percentage (e.g., 30%) of median value for each variable buffer, it is considered to be out of noise bound.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0345">Second, sensor dips may be detected using sensor current (Isig) and 1 kHz real impedance. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, Isig and &#x201c;Imp&#x201d; are used as inputs for dips detection <b>3460</b>. Here, the first step is to determine whether there is any divergence between Isigs, and whether any such divergence is reflected in 1 kHz real impedance data. This may be accomplished by using mapping <b>3465</b> between the Isig similarity index (RI_sim_isig<b>12</b>) <b>3463</b> and the 1 kHz real impedance similarity index (RI_sim_imp<b>12</b>) <b>3464</b>. This mapping is critical, as it helps avoid false positives in instances where a dip is not real. Where the Isig divergence is real, the algorithm will select the sensor with the higher Isig.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0346">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the divergence/convergence of two signals (e.g., two Isigs, or two 1 kHz real impedance data points) can be calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0356" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>diff_va1=abs(va1&#x2212;(va1+va2)/2);<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0357" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>diff_va2=abs(va2&#x2212;(va1+va2)/2);<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0358" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RI_sim=1&#x2212;(diff_va1+diff_va2)/(mean(abs(va1+va2))/4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0359" num="0000">where va1 and va2 are two variables, and RI_sim (similarity index) is the index to measure the convergence or divergence of the signals. In this embodiment, RI_sim must be bound between 0 and 1. Therefore, if RI_sim as calculated above is less than 0, it will be set to 0, and if it is higher than 1, it will be set to 1.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0347">The mapping <b>3465</b> is performed by using ordinary linear regression (OLR). However, when OLR does not work well, a robust median slope linear regression (RMSLR) can be used. For Isig similarity index and 1 kHz real impedance index, for example, two mapping procedures are needed: (i) Map Isig similarity index to 1 kHz real impedance similarity index; and (ii) map 1 kHz real impedance similarity index to Isig similarity index. Both mapping procedures will generate two residuals: res12 and res21. Each of the dip reliability indices <b>3467</b>, <b>3468</b> can then be calculated as:</p><p id="p-0361" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RI_dip=1&#x2212;(res12+res21)/(RI_sim_isig+RI_sim_1K_real_impedance).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0362" num="0348">The third factor is sensitivity loss <b>3470</b>, which may be detected using 1 kHz imaginary impedance trending in, e.g., the past 8 hours. If one sensor's trending turns negative, the algorithm will rely on the other sensor. If both sensors lose sensitivity, then a simple average is taken. Trending may be calculated by using a strong low-pass filter to smooth over the 1 kHz imaginary impedance, which tends to be noisy, and by using a correlation coefficient or linear regression with respect to time during, e.g., the past 8 hours to determine whether the correlation coefficient is negative or the slope is negative. Each of the sensitivity loss reliability indices <b>3473</b>, <b>3474</b> is then assigned a binary value of 1 or 0.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0349">The total reliability index (RI) for each of we1, we2,

When the former is used, the filtered reliability indices&#x2014;e.g., RI_We1* and RI_We2* (<b>3482</b>, <b>3484</b>)&#x2014;are used in the calculation of the weight for each electrode and, therefore, in the calculation of the fused SG <b>3498</b>.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0353"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref> shows the details of the fusion algorithm <b>3540</b> for Isig fusion. As can be seen, this algorithm is substantially similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> for SG fusion, with two exceptions. First, as was noted previously, for Isig fusion, calibration constitutes the final step of the process, where the single fused Isig <b>3589</b> is calibrated to generate a single sensor glucose value <b>3598</b>. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref>. Second, whereas SG fusion uses the SG values for the plurality of electrodes to calculate the final SG value <b>3498</b>, the fused Isig value <b>3589</b> is calculated using the filtered Isigs (<b>3522</b>, <b>3524</b>, and so on) for the plurality of electrodes.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0354">In one closed-loop study involving a non-diabetic population, it was found that the above-described fusion algorithms provided considerable improvements in the Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) both on Day 1, when low start-up issues are most significant and, as such, may have a substantial impact on sensor accuracy and reliability, and overall (i.e., over a 7-day life of the sensor). The study evaluated data for an 88% distributed layout design with high current density (nominal) plating using three different methodologies: (1) calculation of one sensor glucose value (SG) via fusion using Medtronic Minimed's Ferrari Algorithm 1.0 (which is a SG fusion algorithm as discussed above); (2) calculation of one SG by identifying the better ISIG value using 1 kHz EIS data (through the Isig fusion algorithm discussed above); and (3) calculation of one SG by using the higher ISIG value (i.e., without using EIS).

Day 1 was 19.52%, with an overall MARD of 12.28%. For the second approach, the Day-1 MARD was 15.96% and the overall MARD was 11.83%. Lastly, for the third approach, the MARD was 17.44% on Day 1, and 12.26% overall. Thus, for this design with redundant electrodes, it appears that calculation of SG based on the better ISIG using 1 kHz EIS (i.e., the second methodology) provides the greatest advantage. Specifically, the lower Day-1 MARD may be attributable, e.g., to better low start-up detection using EIS. In addition, the overall MARD percentages are more than 1% lower than the overall average MARD of 13.5% for WE<b>1</b> and WE<b>2</b> in this study. It is noted that, in the above-mentioned approaches, data transitions may be handled, e.g., by a filtering method to minimize the severity of the transitions, such as by using a low-pass filter <b>3480</b> as discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A-<b>35</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0356">It bears repeating that sensor diagnostics, including, e.g., assessment of low start-up, sensitivity-loss, and signal-dip events depends on various factors, including the sensor design, number of electrodes (i.e., redundancy), electrode distribution/configuration, etc. As such, the actual frequency, or range of frequencies, for which an EIS-based parameter may be substantially glucose-independent, and therefore, an independent marker, or predictor, for one or more of the above-mentioned failure modes may also depend on the specific sensor design. For example, while it has been discovered, as described hereinabove, that sensitivity loss may be predicted using imaginary impedance at the relatively higher frequencies&#x2014;where imaginary impedance is substantially glucose-independent&#x2014;the level of glucose dependence, and, therefore, the specific frequency range for using imaginary impedance as a marker for sensitivity loss, may shift (higher or lower) depending on the actual sensor design.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0357">More specifically, as sensor design moves more and more towards the use of redundant working electrodes, the latter must be of increasingly smaller sizes in order to maintain the overall size of the sensor. The size of the electrodes, in turn, affects the frequencies that may be queried for specific diagnostics. In this regard, it is important to note that the fusion algorithms described herein and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A-<b>35</b></figref> are to be regarded as illustrative, and not limiting, as each algorithm can be modified as necessary to use EIS-based parameters at frequencies that exhibit the least amount of glucose dependence, based on the type of sensor under analysis.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0358">In addition, experimental data indicates that human tissue structure may also affect glucose dependence at different frequencies. For example, in children, real impedance at 0.105 Hz has been found to be a substantially glucose-independent indicator for low start-up detection. It is believed that this comes about as a result of a child's tissue structure changing, e.g., the Warburg impedance, which relates mostly to the resistive component. See also the subsequent discussion relating to interferent detection.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0359">Embodiments of the invention herein are also directed to the use of EIS in optimizing sensor calibration. By way of background, in current methodologies, the slope of a BG vs. Isig plot, which may be used to calibrate subsequent Isig values, is calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0381" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00006" num="00006"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>slope</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mo>&#x2211;</mo>    <mtext> </mtext>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>&#x3b2;</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>isig</mi>       <mo>-</mo>       <mi>offset</mi>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>bg</mi>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mo>&#x2211;</mo>    <mtext> </mtext>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msup>      <mrow>       <mi>&#x3b2;</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>isig</mi>        <mo>-</mo>        <mi>offset</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mn>2</mn>     </msup>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0382" num="0000">where &#x3b1; is an exponential function of a time constant, &#x3b2; is a function of blood glucose variance, and offset is a constant. For a sensor in steady condition, this method provides fairly accurate results. As shown, e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>, BG and Isig follow a fairly linear relationship, and offset can be taken as a constant.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0360">However, there are situations in which the above-mentioned linear relationship does not hold true, such as, e.g., during periods in which the sensor experiences a transition. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>, it is clear that Isig-BG pairs <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are significantly different from pairs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> in terms of Isig and BG relationship. For these types of conditions, use of a constant offset tends to produce inaccurate results.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0361">To address this issue, one embodiment of the invention is directed to the use of an EIS-based dynamic offset, where EIS measurements are used to define a sensor status vector as follows:</p><p id="p-0385" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i>={real_imp_1<i>K</i>,img_imp_1<i>K</i>,Nyquist_slope,Nyquist_<i>R</i>_square}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0386" num="0000">where all of the elements in the vector are substantially BG independent. It is noted that Nyquist_R_square is the R square of linear regression used to calculate the Nyquist slope, i.e., the square of the correlation coefficient between real and imaginary impedances at relatively-lower frequencies, and a low R square indicates abnormality in sensor performance. For each Isig-BG pair, a status vector is assigned. If a significant difference in status vector is detected&#x2014;e.g., |V<b>2</b>&#x2212;V<b>3</b>| for the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>&#x2014;a different offset value is assigned for 3 and 4 when compared to 1 and 2. Thus, by using this dynamic offset approach, it is possible to maintain a linear relationship between Isig and BG.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0362">In a second embodiment, an EIS-based segmentation approach may be used for calibration. Using the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> and the vector V, it can be determined that sensor state during 1 and 2 is significantly different from sensor state during 3 and 4. Therefore, the calibration buffer can be divided into two segments, as follows:</p><p id="p-0388" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Isig_buffer1=[Isig1,Isig2]; BG_buffer1=[BG1,BG2]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0389" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Isig_buffer2=[Isig3,Isig3]; BG_buffer2=[BG3,BG3]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0390" num="0000">Thus, when the sensor operates during 1 and 2, Isig_buffer1 and BG_buffer1 would be used for calibration. However, when the sensor operates during 3 and 4, i.e., during a transition period, Isig_buffer2 and BG_buffer2 would be used for calibration.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0363">In yet another embodiment, an EIS-based dynamic slope approach, where EIS is used to adjust slope, may be used for calibration purposes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref> shows an example of how this method can be used to improve sensor accuracy. In this diagram, the data points <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> are discrete blood glucose values. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref>, there is a sensor dip <b>3810</b> between data points <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>, which dip can be detected using the sensor state vector V described above. During the dip, slope can be adjusted upward to reduce the underreading, as shown by reference numeral <b>3820</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0364">In a further embodiment, EIS diagnostics may be used to determine the timing of sensor calibrations, which is quite useful for, e.g, low-startup events, sensitivity-loss events, and other similar situations. As is known, most current methodologies require regular calibrations based on a pre-set schedule, e.g., 4 times per day. Using EIS diagnostics, however, calibrations become event-driven, such that they may be performed only as often as necessary, and when they would be most productive. Here, again, the status vector V may be used to determine when the sensor state has changed, and to request calibration if it has, indeed, changed.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0365">More specifically, in an illustrative example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>B</figref> shows a flowchart for EIS-assisted sensor calibration involving low start-up detection. Using Nyquist slope, 1 kHz real impedance, and abound check <b>3850</b> (see, e.g., the previously-described bound check and associated threshold values for EIS-based parameters in connection with the fusion algorithms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A-<b>35</b></figref>), a reliability index <b>3853</b> can be developed for start-up, such that, when the 1 kHz real impedance <b>3851</b> and the Nyquist slope <b>3852</b> are lower than their corresponding upper bounds, RI_startup=1, and sensor is ready for calibration. In other words, the reliability index <b>3853</b> is &#x201c;high&#x201d; (<b>3854</b>), and the logic can proceed to calibration at <b>3860</b>.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0366">When, on the other hand, the 1 kHz real impedance and the Nyquist slope are higher than their corresponding upper bounds (or threshold values), RI_startup=0 (i.e., it is &#x201c;low&#x201d;), and the sensor is not ready for calibration (<b>3856</b>), i.e., a low start-up issue may exist. Here, the trend of 1 kHz real impedance and the Nyquist slope can be used to predict when both parameters will be in range (<b>3870</b>). If it is estimated that this will only take a very short amount of time (e.g., less than one hour), then the algorithm waits until the sensor is ready, i.e., until the above-mentioned EIS-based parameters are in-bound (<b>3874</b>), at which point the algorithm proceeds to calibration. If, however, the wait time would be relatively long (<b>3876</b>), then the sensor can be calibrated now, and then the slope or offset can be gradually adjusted according to the 1 kHz real impedance and the Nyquist slope trend (<b>3880</b>). It is noted that by performing the adjustment, serious over- or under-reading caused by low start-up can be avoided. As noted previously, the EIS-based parameters and related information that is used in the instant calibration algorithm is substantially glucose-independent.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0367">It is noted that, while the above description in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>B</figref> shows a single working electrode, as well as the calculation of a reliability index for start-up of that working electrode, this is by way of illustration, and not limitation. Thus, in a redundant sensor including two or more working electrodes, a bound check can be performed, and a start-up reliability index calculated, for each of the plurality of (redundant) working electrodes. Then, based on the respective reliability indices, at least one working electrode can be identified that can proceed to obtain glucose measurements. In other words, in a sensor having a single working electrode, if the latter exhibits low start-up, actual use of the sensor (for measuring glucose) may have to be delayed until the low start-up period is over. This period may typically be on the order of one hour or more, which is clearly disadvantageous. In contrast, in a redundant sensor, utilizing the methodology described herein allows an adaptive, or &#x201c;smart&#x201d;, start-up, wherein an electrode that can proceed to data gathering can be identified in fairly short order, e.g., on the order of a few minutes. This, in turn, reduces MARD, because low start-up generally provides about a &#xbd;% increase in MARD.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0368">In yet another embodiment, EIS can aid in the adjustment of the calibration buffer. For existing calibration algorithms, the buffer size is always 4, i.e., 4 Isig-BG pairs, and the weight is based upon &#x3b1; which, as noted previously, is an exponential function of a time constant, and &#x3b2;, which is a function of blood glucose variance. Here, EIS can help to determine when to flush the buffer, how to adjust buffer weight, and what the appropriate buffer size is.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0369">Embodiments of the invention are also directed to the use of EIS for interferent detection. Specifically, it may be desirable to provide a medication infusion set that includes a combination sensor and medication-infusion catheter, where the sensor is placed within the infusion catheter. In such a system, the physical location of the infusion catheter relative to the sensor may be of some concern, due primarily to the potential impact on (i.e., interference with) sensor signal that may be caused by the medication being infused and/or an inactive component thereof.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0370">For example, the diluent used with insulin contains m-cresol as a preservative. In in-vitro studies, m-cresol has been found to negatively impact a glucose sensor if insulin (and, therefore, m-cresol) is being infused in close proximity to the sensor. Therefore, a system in which a sensor and an infusion catheter are to be combined in a single needle must be able to detect, and adjust for, the effect of m-cresol on the sensor signal. Since m-cresol affects the sensor signal, it would be preferable to have a means of detecting this interferent independently of the sensor signal itself.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0371">Experiments have shown that the effect of m-cresol on the sensor signal is temporary and, thus, reversible. Nevertheless, when insulin infusion occurs too close to the sensor, the m-cresol tends to &#x201c;poison&#x201d; the electrode(s), such that the latter can no longer detect glucose, until the insulin (and m-cresol) have been absorbed into the patient's tissue. In this regard, it has been found that there is typically about a 40-minute time period between initiation of insulin infusion and when the sensor has re-gained the ability to detect glucose again. However, advantageously, it has also been discovered that, during the same time period, there is a large increase in 1 kHz impedance magnitude quite independently of the glucose concentration.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0372">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> shows Isig and impedance data for an in-vitro experiment, wherein the sensor was placed in a 100 mg/dL glucose solution, and 1 kHz impedance was measured every 10 minutes, as shown by encircled data points <b>3920</b>. m-cresol was then added to bring the solution to 0.35% m-cresol (<b>3930</b>). As can be seen, once m-cresol has been added, the Isig <b>3940</b> initially increases dramatically, and then begins to drift down. The concentration of glucose in the solution was then doubled, by adding an addition 100 mg/dL glucose. This, however, had no effect on the Isig <b>3940</b>, as the electrode was unable to detect the glucose.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0373">On the other hand, the m-cresol had a dramatic effect on both impedance magnitude and phase. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b>A</figref> shows a Bode plot for the phase, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b>B</figref> shows a Bode plot for impedance magnitude, for both before and after the addition of m-cresol. As can be seen, after the m-cresol was added, the impedance magnitude <b>4010</b> increased from its post-initialization value <b>4020</b> by at least an order of magnitude across the frequency spectrum. At the same time, the phase <b>4030</b> changed completely as compared to its post-initialization value <b>4040</b>. On the Nyquist plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b>C</figref>. Here, the pre-initialization curve <b>4050</b> and the post-initialization curve <b>4060</b> appear as expected for a normally-functioning sensor. However, after the addition of m-cresol, the curve <b>4070</b> becomes drastically different.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0374">The above experiment identifies an important practical pitfall of continuing to rely on the Isig after m-cresol has been added. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, a patient/user monitoring the sensor signal may be put under the mistaken impression that his glucose level has just spiked, and that he should administer a bolus. The user then administers the bolus, at which the Isig has already started to drift back down. In other words, to the patient/user, everything may look normal. In reality, however, what has really happened is that the patient just administered an unneeded dose of insulin which, depending on the patient's glucose level prior to administration of the bolus, may put the patient at risk of experiencing a hypoglycemic event. This scenario reinforces the desirability of a means of detecting interferents that is as glucose-independent as possible.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0375"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> shows another experiment, where a sensor was initialized a 100 mg/dL glucose solution, after which glucose was raised to 400 mg/dL for one hour, and then returned to 100 mg/dL. m-cresol was then added to raise the concentration to 0.35%, with the sensor remaining in this solution for 20 minutes. Finally, the sensor was placed in a 100 mg/dL glucose solution to allow Isig to recover after exposure to m-cresol. As can be seen, after initialization, the 1 kHz impedance magnitude <b>4110</b> was at about 2 kOhms. When m-cresol was added, the Isig <b>4120</b> spiked, as did impedance magnitude <b>4110</b>. Moreover, when the sensor was returned to a 100 md/dL glucose solution, the impedance magnitude <b>4110</b> also returned to near normal level.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0376">As can be seen from the above experiments, EIS can be used to detect the presence of an interfering agent&#x2014;in this case, m-cresol. Specifically, since the interferent affects the sensor in such a way as to increase the impedance magnitude across the entire frequency spectrum, the impedance magnitude may be used to detect the interference. Once the interference has been detected, either the sensor operating voltage can be changed to a point where the interferent is not measured, or data reporting can be temporarily suspended, with the sensor indicating to the patient/user that, due to the administration of medication, the sensor is unable to report data (until the measured impedance returns to the pre-infusion level). It is noted that, since the impact of the interferent is due to the preservative that is contained in insulin, the impedance magnitude will exhibit the same behavior as described above regardless of whether the insulin being infused is fast-acting or slow.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0377">Importantly, as mentioned above, the impedance magnitude, and certainly the magnitude at 1 kHz, is substantially glucose-independent. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, it can be seen that, as the concentration of glucose is raised from 100 mg/dL to 400 mg/dL&#x2014;a four-fold increase&#x2014;the 1 kHz impedance magnitude increase from about 2000 Ohms to about 2200 Ohms, or about a 10% increase. In other words, the effect of glucose on the impedance magnitude measurement appears to be about an order of magnitude smaller compared to the measured impedance. This level of &#x201c;signal-to-noise&#x201d; ratio is typically small enough to allow the noise (i.e., the glucose effect) to be filtered out, such that the resultant impedance magnitude is substantially glucose-independent. In addition, it should be emphasized that the impedance magnitude exhibits an even higher degree of glucose-independence in actual human tissue, as compared to the buffer solution that was used for the in-vitro experiments described above.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0378">Embodiments of the invention are also directed to an Analog Front End Integrated Circuit (AE IC), which is a custom Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that provides the necessary analog electronics to: (i) support multiple potentiostats and interface with multi-terminal glucose sensors based on either Oxygen or Peroxide; (ii) interface with a microcontroller so as to form a micropower sensor system; and (iii) implement EIS diagnostics, fusion algorithms, and other EIS-based processes based on measurement of EIS-based parameters. More specifically, the ASIC incorporates diagnostic capability to measure the real and imaginary impedance parameters of the sensor over a wide range of frequencies, as well as digital interface circuitry to enable bidirectional communication with a microprocessor chip.

This power plane has a regulator to lower the voltage for some circuits in this plane. The supply is called VDDBU (<b>4212</b>) and has an output pad for test and bypassing. The circuits on the VBAT supply include an RC oscillator, real time clock (RC osc) <b>4214</b>, battery protection circuit, regulator control, power on reset circuit (POR), and various inputs/outputs. The pads on the VBAT power plane are configured to draw less than 75 nA at 40&#xb0; C. and VBAT=3.50V.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0383">The ASIC also has a VDD supply to supply logic. The VDD supply voltage range is programmable from at least 1.6 volts to 2.4 volts. The circuits on the VDD power plane include most of the digital logic, timer (32 khz), and real time clock (32 khz). The VDD supply plane includes level shifters interfacing to the other voltage planes as necessary. The level shifters, in turn, have interfaces conditioned so that any powered power plane does not have an increase in current greater than 10 nA if another power plane is unpowered.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0384">The ASIC includes an onboard regulator (with shutdown control) and an option for an external VDD source. The regulator input is a separate pad, REG_VDD_IN (<b>4216</b>), which has electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection in common with other I/Os on VBAT. The onboard regulator has an output pad, REG_VDD_OUT (<b>4217</b>). The ASIC also has an input pad for the VDD, which is separate from the REG_VDD_OUT pad.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0385">The ASIC includes an analog power plane, called VDDA (<b>4218</b>), which is powered by either the VDD onboard regulator or an external source, and is normally supplied by a filtered VDD. The VDDA supplied circuits are configured to operate within 0.1 volt of VDD, thereby obviating the need for level shifting between the VDDA and VDD power planes. The VDDA supply powers the sensor analog circuits, the analog measurement circuits, as well as any other noise-sensitive circuitry.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0386">The ASIC includes a pad supply, VPAD, for designated digital interface signals. The pad supply has an operating voltage range from at least 1.8 V to 3.3 V. These pads have separate supply pad(s) and are powered from an external source. The pads also incorporate level shifters to other onboard circuits to allow the flexible pad power supply range independently of the VDD logic supply voltage. The ASIC can condition the VPAD pad ring signals such that, when the VPAD supply is not enabled, other supply currents will not increase by more than 10 nA.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0387">Bias Generator</p><p id="p-0417" num="0388">The ASIC has a bias generator circuit, BIAS_GEN (<b>4220</b>), which is supplied from the VBAT power, and which generates bias currents that are stable with supply voltage for the system.

The voltage reference has an enable input which can accept a signal from logic powered by VBAT or VDDBU. The ASIC is designed such that the enable signal does not cause any increase in current in excess of 10 nA from any supply from this signal interface when VBAT is powered.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0392">The reference voltage has the following specifications: (i) Output voltage: 1.220&#xb1;3 mV after trimming; (ii) Supply sensitivity: &#x3c;&#xb1;6 mV from 1.6 V to 4.5V input; (iii) Temperature sensitivity: &#x3c;+5 mV from 0&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C.; and (iv) Output voltage default accuracy (without trim): 1.220 V&#xb1;50 mV. In addition, the supply current is to be less than 800 nA at 4.5V, 40&#xb0; C. In this embodiment, the reference output will be forced to VSSA when the reference is disabled so as to keep the VDD voltage regulator from overshooting to levels beyond the breakdown voltage of the logic.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0393">32 kHz Oscillator</p><p id="p-0423" num="0394">The ASIC includes a low power 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator <b>4222</b> which is powered with power derived from the VDDA supply and can trim the capacitance of the crystal oscillator pads (XTALI, XTALO) with software. Specifically, the frequency trim range is at least &#x2212;50 ppm to +100 ppm with a step size of 2 ppm max throughout the trim range. Here, a crystal may be assumed with a load capacitance of 7 pF, Ls=6.9512 kH, Cs=3.3952 fF, R<sub>s</sub>=70 k, shunt capacitance=1 pF, and a PC Board parasitic capacitance of 2 pF on each crystal terminal.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0395">The ASIC has a VPAD level output available on a pad, CLK_32 kHZ, where the output can be disabled under software and logic control. The default is driving the 32 kHz oscillator out. An input pin, OSC32K_BYPASS (<b>4224</b>), can disable the 32 kHz oscillator (no power drain) and allows for digital input to the XTALI pad. The circuits associated with this function are configured so as not add any ASIC current in excess of 10 nA in either state of the OSC32K_BYPASS signal other than the oscillator current when OSC32K_BYPASS is low.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0396">The 32 kHZ oscillator is required to always be operational when the VDDA plane is powered, except for the bypass condition. If the OSC32K_BYPASS is true, the 32 KHZ oscillator analog circuitry is put into a low power state, and the XTALI pad is configured to accept a digital input whose level is from 0 to VDDA. It is noted that the 32 kHz oscillator output has a duty cycle between 40% and 60%.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0397">Timer</p><p id="p-0427" num="0398">The ASIC includes a Timer <b>4226</b> that is clocked from the 32 kHz oscillator divided by 2. It is pre-settable and has two programmable timeouts. It has 24 programmable bits giving a total time count to 17 minutes, 4 seconds. The Timer also has a programmable delay to disable the clock to the CLK_32 KHz pad and set the microprocessor (uP) interface signals on the VPAD plane to a predetermined state (See section below on Microprocessor Wakeup Control Signals). This will allow the microprocessor to go into suspend mode without an external clock. However, this function may be disabled by software with a programmable bit.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0399">The Timer also includes a programmable delay to wakeup the microprocessor by enabling the CLK_32 KHZ clock output and setting UP_WAKEUP high. A transition of the POR2 (VDD POR) from supply low state to supply OK state will enable the 32 kHz oscillator, the CLK_32 KHZ clock output and set UP_WAKEUP high.

The following events may cause the UP_INT signal to be asserted high if the Battery Protection signal indicates a good battery (see Event Handler for more details): SW/Timer (programmable); WAKEUP transition; low to high, and/or high to low, (programmable); Sensor Connect transition; low to high and/or high to low, (programmable); UART Break; RTC Time Event (programmable); Detection of low battery by Battery Protection Circuit; and any of the ASIC interrupts when unmasked.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0516" num="0527">The ASIC has GPIO1 and GPIO0 pads able to act as boot mode control for a microprocessor. A POR2 event will reset a 2 bit counter whose bits map to GPIO1 &#x26; GPIO0 (MSB, LSB respectively). A rising edge of UART break increments the counter by one, wherein the counter counts by modulo 4, and goes to zero if it is incremented in state 11. The boot mode counter is pre-settable via SPI.</p><p id="p-0517" num="0528">Event Handler/Watchdog</p><p id="p-0518" num="0529">The ASIC incorporates an event handler to define the responses to events, including changes in system states and input signals. Events include all sources of interrupts (e.g. UART_BRK, WAKE_UP, Sensor Connect, etc. . . . ). The event handler responses to stimuli are programmable by the software through the SPI interface. Some responses, however, may be hardwired (non-programmable).</p><p id="p-0519" num="0530">The event handler actions include enable/disable VPAD_EN, enable/disable CLK 32 KHZ, assert nRESET_OD, assert UP_WAKEUP, and assert UP_INT. The Event Watchdog Timer 1 through Timer 5 are individually programmable in 250 msec increments from 250 msec to 16,384 seconds. The timeouts for Event Watchdog timers 6 through 8 are hardcoded. The timeout for Timer6 and Timer7 are 1 minute; timeout for Timer8 is 5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0520" num="0531">The ASIC also has a watchdog function to monitor the microprocessor's responses when triggered by an event. The event watchdog is activated when the microprocessor fails to acknowledge the event induced activities. The event watchdog, once activated, performs a programmable sequence of actions, Event Watchdog Timer 1-5, and followed by a hard-wired sequence of actions, Event Watchdog Timer 6-8, to re-gain the response of the microprocessor. The sequence of actions includes interrupt, reset, wake up, assert 32 KHz clock, power down and power up to the microprocessor.</p><p id="p-0521" num="0532">During the sequences of actions, if the microprocessor regains its ability to acknowledge the activities that had been recorded, the event watchdog is reset. If the ASIC fails to obtain an acknowledgement from the microprocessor, the event watchdog powers down the microprocessor in a condition that will allow UART_BRK to reboot the microprocessor and it will activate the alarm. When activated, the alarm condition generates a square wave with a frequency of approximately 1 kHz on the pad ALARM with a programmable repeating pattern. The programmable pattern has two programmable sequences with programmable burst on and off times. The alarm has another programmable pattern that may be programmed via the SPI port. It will have two programmable sequences with programmable burst on and off times.</p><p id="p-0522" num="0533">Digital to Analog (D/A)</p><p id="p-0523" num="0534">In a preferred embodiment, the ASIC has two 8 bit D/A converters <b>4276</b>, <b>4278</b> with the following characteristics:<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0535">(i) The D/A settles in less than 1 msec with less than 50 pF load.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0536">(ii) The D/A has at least 8 bits of accuracy.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0537">(iii) The output range is programmable to either 0 to 1.22V or 0 to VDDA.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0004" num="0538">(iv) Temperature sensitivity of the D/A voltage reference is less than 1 mV/&#xb0; C.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0005" num="0539">(v) The DNL is less than 1 LSB.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0006" num="0540">(vi) Current consumed by the D/A is less than 2 uA from the VDDA supply.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0007" num="0541">(vii) Each D/A has an output 1 to a pad.</li>        <li id="ul0018-0008" num="0542">(viii) The D/A outputs are high impedance.

A programmable bit will be available to block the UART break detection and force the RX_UP high. In normal operation, this bit will be set high before enabling the current sourcing to nRX_EXT and then set low after the current sourcing is disabled to ensure that no glitches are generated on RX_UP or that a UART break event is generated. Note to implement a wet connector detector, while the current source into nRX_EXT is active, an RX comparator output indicating a low input voltage would indicate leakage current.

The chip select input (SPI_nCS) is an active low input, asserted by an off-chip SPI master to initiate and qualify an SPI transaction. When SPI_nCS is asserted low, the SPI slave port configures itself as a SPI slave and performs data transactions based on the clock input (SPICK). When SPI_nCS is inactive, the SPI slave port resets itself and remains in reset mode.

It is then buffered by an amplifier that drives a selected sensor electrode.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0623">The current driving the electrode contains the resultant AC current component from the forcing sine wave and is converted to a voltage. This voltage is then processed by multiplying it by a square wave that has a fixed phase relative to the synthesized sine wave. This multiplied voltage is then integrated. After the end of a programmable number of integration intervals&#x2014;an interval being an integral number of 1 periods of the driving sine wave&#x2014;the voltage is measured by the ADC. By calculations involving the values of the integrated voltages, the real and imaginary parts of the impedance can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0573" num="0624">The advantage of using integrators for the impedance measurement is that the noise bandwidth of the measurement is reduced significantly with respect to merely sampling the waveforms. Also, the sampling time requirements are significantly reduced which relaxes the speed requirement of the ADC.</p><p id="p-0574" num="0625"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> shows the main blocks of the EIS circuitry in the AFE IC (designated by reference numeral <b>4255</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>B</figref>). The IDAC <b>4510</b> generates a stepwise sine wave in synchrony with a system clock. A high frequency of this system clock steps the IDAC through the lookup table that contains digital code. This code drives the IDAC, which generates an output current approximating a sine wave. This sine wave current is forced across a resistor to give the AC component, Vin_ac, with the DC offset, VSET<b>8</b> (<b>4520</b>). When the IDAC circuit is disabled, the DC output voltage reverts to VSET<b>8</b>, so the disturbance to the electrode equilibrium is minimized. This voltage is then buffered by an amplifier <b>4530</b> that drives the electrode through a resistor in series, Rsense. The differential voltage across Rsense is proportional to the current. This voltage is presented to a multiplier <b>4540</b> that multiplies the voltage by either +1 or &#x2212;1. This is done with switches and a differential amplifier (instrumentation amplifier). The system clock is divided to generate the phase clock <b>4550</b> which controls the multiply function and can be set to 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees relative to the sine wave.</p><p id="p-0575" num="0626">The plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b>A-<b>46</b>F and <b>47</b>A-<b>47</b>F</figref> show a simulation of the signals of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> to a current that has 0-degree phase shift, which represents a real resistance. For these example simulations, the simulation input values were selected to give the current sense voltage equal to 0.150V. To obtain enough information to derive the impedance and phase, two integrations are required: one with a 0-degree phase multiply (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b>A-<b>46</b>F</figref>) and one with a 90-degree phase multiply (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>47</b>A-<b>47</b>F</figref>).</p><p id="p-0576" num="0627">Calculation of Impedance</p><p id="p-0577" num="0628">The equations describing the integrator output are provided below. For simplicity, only 12 of a sine wave period is considered. As can be seen from the plots of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b>A-<b>46</b>F and <b>47</b>A-<b>47</b>F</figref>, total integrator output will be approximately the integrated value of a 12 sine wave cycle multiplied by the number of 12 cycles integrated. It is noted that the multiplying switches in relation with the integrate time perform a &#x201c;gating&#x201d; function of the signal to the integrator; this can be viewed as setting the limits of integration. The multiplying signal has a fixed phase to the generated sine wave. This can be set to 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees with software. If the sine wave is in phase (0-degree shift) with respect to the multiply square wave, the limits of integration will be &#x3c0; (180&#xb0;) and 0 (0&#xb0;). If the sine wave is shifted by 90 degrees, the limits of integration can be viewed as &#xbe;&#x3c0; (270&#xb0;) and &#xbc;&#x3c0; (90&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-0578" num="0629">The formulas with the multiplying square wave in-phase (0&#xb0;) with respect to the driving sine wave are shown below. This will yield a voltage that is proportional to the real component of the current. It is noted that &#x3a6; is the phase shift of the sine wave relative to the multiplying square wave; Vout is the integrator output, and Aampl is the current sine wave amplitude. Also, the period of the sine wave is 1/f, and RC is the time constant of the integrator.</p><p id="p-0579" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00007" num="00007"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>

The forcing voltage is generated in a fixed phase (0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees) with respect to the multiplying signal&#x2014;this is done digitally so that it is precisely controlled. But there is at least one amplifier in the path before the forcing sine wave is applied to the electrode; this will introduce unwanted phase shift and amplitude error. This can be compensated for by integrating the forcing sine wave signal obtained electrically near the electrode. Thus, the amplitude and any phase shift of the forcing voltage can be determined. Since the path for both the current and voltage waveform will be processed by the same circuit, any analog circuit gain and phase errors will cancel.</p><p id="p-0597" num="0638">Since the variable of interest is the impedance, it may not be necessary to actually calculate the A<sub>ampl</sub>.

frequencies, e.g., those above about 256 Hz. The high frequencies require four measurement cycles: (i) one for the in-phase sensor current; (ii) one for the 90 degree out of phase sensor current; (iii) one for the in-phase forcing voltage; and (iv) one for the 90 degree out of phase forcing voltage.</p><p id="p-0604" num="0642">Two integrators may be used for the relatively-lower frequencies, e.g., those lower than about 256 Hz, with the integration value consisting of combining integrator results numerically in the system microprocessor. Knowing how many integrations there are per cycle allows the microprocessor to calculate the 0 and 90 degree components appropriately.</p><p id="p-0605" num="0643">Synchronizing the integrations with the forcing AC waveform and breaking the integration into at least four parts at the lower frequencies will eliminate the need for the hardware multiplier as the combining of the integrated parts in the microprocessor can accomplish the multiplying function. Thus, only one integration pass is necessary for obtaining the real and imaginary current information. For the lower frequencies, the amplifier phase errors will become smaller, so below a frequency, e.g., between 1 Hz and 50 Hz, and preferably below about 1 Hz, the forcing voltage phase will not need to be determined. Also, the amplitude could be assumed to be constant for the lower frequencies, such that only one measurement cycle after stabilization may be necessary to determine the impedance.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0644">As noted above, whereas one hardware integrator is used for the relatively-higher frequencies, for the relatively-lower frequencies, two integrators may be used. In this regard, the schematic in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref> shows the EIS circuitry in the AFE IC as used for the relatively-higher EIS frequencies. At these frequencies, the integrator does not saturate while integrating over a cycle. In fact, multiple cycles are integrated for the highest frequencies as this will provide a larger output signal which results in a larger signal to noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0607" num="0645">For the relatively-lower frequencies, such as, e.g., those below about 500 Hz, the integrator output can saturate with common parameters. Therefore, for these frequencies, two integrators are used that are alternately switched. That is, while a first integrator is integrating, the second integrator is being read by the ADC and then is reset (zeroed) to make it ready to integrate when the integration time for first integrator is over. In this way, the signal can be integrated without having gaps in the integration. This would add a second integrator and associated timing controls to the EIS circuitry shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0646">Stabilization Cycle Considerations</p><p id="p-0609" num="0647">The above analysis is for steady state conditions in which the current waveform does not vary from cycle to cycle. This condition is not met immediately upon application of a sine wave to a resistor-capacitor (RC) network because of the initial state of the capacitor. The current phase starts out at 0 degrees and progresses to the steady state value. However, it would be desirable for the measurement to consume a minimum amount of time in order to reduce current drain and also to allow adequate time to make DC sensor measurements (Isigs). Thus, there is a need to determine the number of cycles necessary to obtain sufficiently accurate measurements.</p><p id="p-0610" num="0648">The equation for a simple RC circuit&#x2014;with a resistor and capacitor in series&#x2014;is</p><p id="p-0611" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00016" num="00016"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>v</mi>   <mi>ac</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>R</mi>    <mo>*</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>I</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mi>t</mi>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <mo>+</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mn>1</mn>     <mi>C</mi>    </mfrac>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>&#x222b;</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>I</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mi>t</mi>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mrow>       <mo>&#x2202;</mo>       <mtext> </mtext>       <mi>t</mi>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0612" num="0649">Solving the above for I(t) gives:</p><p id="p-0613" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00017" num="00017"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>I</mi>   <mo>&#x2061;</mo>   <mo>(</mo>   <mi>t</mi>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mn>1</mn>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>R</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>C</mi>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>[</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>V</mi>        <mrow>         <mi>c</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mn>0</mn>        </mrow>       </msub>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>C</mi>      </mrow>      <mo>+</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <msub>         <mi>V</mi>         <mi>m</mi>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>R</mi>        <mo>[</mo>        <mrow>         <msup>          <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>          <mn>2</mn>         </msup>         <mo>+</mo>         <mfrac>          <mn>1</mn>          <mrow>           <msup>            <mi>R</mi>            <mn>2</mn>           </msup>           <mo>&#x2062;</mo>           <msup>            <mi>C</mi>            <mn>2</mn>           </msup>          </mrow>         </mfrac>        </mrow>        <mo>]</mo>       </mrow>      </mfrac>     </mrow>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <msup>     <mi>e</mi>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mi>t</mi>      </mrow>      <mi>RC</mi>     </mfrac>    </msup>   </mrow>   <mo>+</mo>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mfrac>      <msub>       <mi>V</mi>       <mi>m</mi>      </msub>      <mi>R</mi>     </mfrac>     <mo>[</mo>     <mfrac>      <mn>1</mn>      <mrow>       <mo>[</mo>       <mrow>        <msup>         <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>         <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>+</mo>        <mfrac>         <mn>1</mn>         <mrow>          <msup>           <mi>R</mi>           <mn>2</mn>          </msup>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <msup>           <mi>C</mi>           <mn>2</mn>          </msup>         </mrow>        </mfrac>       </mrow>       <mo>]</mo>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>[</mo>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <msup>       <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msup>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>sin</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>t</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>+</mo>     <mrow>      <mfrac>       <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>       <mrow>        <mi>R</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>C</mi>       </mrow>      </mfrac>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>cos</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>&#x3c9;t</mi>     </mrow>    </mrow>    <mo>]</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0614" num="0000">where V<sub>c0 </sub>is the initial value of the capacitor voltage, V<sub>m </sub>is the magnitude of the driving sine wave, and &#x3c9; is the radian frequency (2&#x3c0;f).</p><p id="p-0615" num="0650">The first term contains the terms defining the non-steady state condition.

For settling to less than 1%, this would mean approximately 3.4 sec settling time.</p><p id="p-0623" num="0654">Thus, in embodiments of the invention as detailed hereinabove, the ASIC includes (at least) 7 electrode pads, 5 of which are assigned as WORK electrodes (i.e., sensing electrodes, or working electrodes, or WEs), one of which is labeled COUNTER (i.e., counter electrode, or CE), and one that is labeled REFERENCE (i.e., reference electrode, or RE). The counter amplifier <b>4321</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>B</figref>) may be programmably connected to the COUNTER, the REFERENCE, and/or any of the WORK assigned pads, and in any combination thereof. As has been mentioned, embodiments of the invention may include, e.g., more than five WEs. In this regard, embodiments of the invention may also be directed to an ASIC that interfaces with more than 5 working electrodes.</p><p id="p-0624" num="0655">It is important to note that, with the ASIC as described herein, each of the above-mentioned five working electrodes, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode is individually and independently addressable. As such, any one of the 5 working electrodes may be turned on and measure Isig (electrode current), and any one may be turned off. Moreover, any one of the 5 working electrodes may be operably connected/coupled to the EIS circuitry for measurement of EIS-related parameters, e.g., impedance and phase. In other words, EIS may be selectively run on any one or more of the working electrodes. In addition, the respective voltage level of each of the 5 working electrodes may be independently programmed in amplitude and sign with respect to the reference electrode. This has many applications, such as, e.g., changing the voltage on one or more electrodes in order to make the electrode(s) less sensitive to interference.</p><p id="p-0625" num="0656">In embodiments where two or more working electrodes are employed as redundant electrodes, the EIS techniques described herein may be used, e.g., to determine which of the multiplicity of redundant electrodes is functioning optimally (e.g., in terms of faster start-up, minimal or no dips, minimal or no sensitivity loss, etc.), so that only the optimal working electrode(s) can be addressed for obtaining glucose measurements. The latter, in turn, may drastically reduce, if not eliminate, the need for continual calibrations. At the same time, the other (redundant) working electrode(s) may be: (i) turned off, which would facilitate power management, as EIS may not be run for the &#x201c;off&#x201d; electrodes; (ii) powered down; and/or (iii) periodically monitored via EIS to determine whether they have recovered, such that they may be brought back on line. On the other hand, the non-optimal electrode(s) may trigger a request for calibration. The ASIC is also capable of making any of the electrodes&#x2014;including, e.g., a failed or off-line working electrode&#x2014;the counter electrode. Thus, in embodiments of the invention, the ASIC may have more than one counter electrode.</p><p id="p-0626" num="0657">While the above generally addresses simple redundancy, wherein the redundant electrodes are of the same size, have the same chemistry, the same design, etc., the above-described diagnostic algorithms, fusion methodologies, and the associated ASIC may also be used in conjunction with spatially distributed, similarly sized or dissimilarly sized, working electrodes as a way of assessing sensor implant integrity as a function of implant time. Thus, in embodiments of the invention, sensors may be used that contain electrodes on the same flex that may have different shapes, sizes, and/or configurations, or contain the same or different chemistries, used to target specific environments.</p><p id="p-0627" num="0658">For example, in one embodiment, one or two working electrodes may be designed to have, e.g., considerably better hydration, but may not last past 2 or 3 days. Other working electrode(s), on the other hand, may have long-lasting durability, but slow initial hydration. In such a case, an algorithm may be designed whereby the first group of working electrode(s) is used to generate glucose data during early wear, after which, during mid-wear, a switch-over may be made (e.g., via the ASIC) to the second group of electrode(s). In such a case, the fusion algorithm, e.g., may not necessarily &#x201c;fuse&#x201d; data for all of the WEs, and the user/patient is unaware that the sensing component was switched during mid-wear.</p><p id="p-0628" num="0659">In yet other embodiments, the overall sensor design may include WEs of different sizes. Such smaller WEs generally output a lower Isig (smaller geometric area) and may be used specifically for hypoglycemia detection/accuracy, while larger WEs&#x2014;which output a larger Isig&#x2014;may be used specifically for euglycemia and hyperglycemia accuracy. Given the size differences, different EIS thresholds and/or frequencies must be used for diagnostics as among these electrodes. The ASIC, as described hereinabove, accommodates such requirements by enabling programmable, electrode-specific, EIS criteria. As with the previous example, signals may not necessarily be fused to generate an SG output (i.e., different WEs may be tapped at different times).</p><p id="p-0629" num="0660">As was noted previously, the ASIC includes a programmable sequencer <b>4266</b> that commands the start and stop of the stimulus and coordinates the measurements of the EIS-based parameters for frequencies above about 100 Hz. At the end of the sequence, the data is in a buffer memory, and is available for a microprocessor to quickly obtain (values of) the needed parameters. This saves time, and also reduces system power requirements by requiring less microprocessor intervention.</p><p id="p-0630" num="0661">For frequencies lower than about 100 Hz, the programmable sequencer <b>4266</b> coordinates the starting and stopping of the stimulus for EIS, and buffers data. Either upon the end of the measurement cycle, or if the buffer becomes close to full, the ASIC may interrupt the microprocessor to indicate that it needs to gather the available data. The depth of the buffer will determine how long the microprocessor can do other tasks, or sleep, as the EIS-based parameters are being gathered. For example, in one preferred embodiment, the buffer is 64 measurements deep. Again, this saves energy as the microprocessor will not need to gather the data piecemeal. It is also noted that the sequencer <b>4266</b> also has the capability of starting the stimulus at a phase different from 0, which has the potential of settling faster.</p><p id="p-0631" num="0662">The ASIC, as described above, can control the power to a microprocessor. Thus, for example, it can turn off the power completely, and power up the microprocessor, based on detection of sensor connection/disconnection using, e.g., a mechanical switch, or capacitive or resistive sensing. Moreover, the ASIC can control the wakeup of a microprocessor. For example, the microprocessor can put itself into a low-power mode. The ASIC can then send a signal to the microprocessor if, e.g., a sensor connect/disconnect detection is made by the ASIC, which signal wakes up the processor. This includes responding to signals generated by the ASIC using techniques such as, e.g., a mechanical switch or a capacitive-based sensing scheme. This allows the microprocessor to sleep for long periods of time, thereby significantly reducing power drain.</p><p id="p-0632" num="0663">It is important to reiterate that, with the ASIC as described hereinabove, both oxygen sensing and peroxide sensing can be performed simultaneously, because the five (or more) working electrodes are all independent, and independently addressable, and, as such, can be configured in any way desired. In addition, the ASIC allows multiple thresholds for multiple markers, such that EIS can be triggered by various factors&#x2014;e.g., level of V<sub>cntr</sub>, capacitance change, signal noise, large change in Isig, drift detection, etc.&#x2014;each having its own threshold(s). In addition, for each such factor, the ASIC enables multiple levels of thresholds.</p><p id="p-0633" num="0664">In yet another embodiment of the invention, EIS may be used as an alternative plating measurement tool, wherein the impedance of both the working and counter electrodes of the sensor substrate may be tested, post-electroplating, with respect to the reference electrode. More specifically, existing systems for performing measurements of the sensor substrate which provide an average roughness of the electrode surface sample a small area from each electrode to determine the average roughness (Ra) of that small area. For example, currently, the Zygo Non-contact Interferometer is used to quantify and evaluate electrode surface area. The Zygo interferometer measures a small area of the counter and working electrodes and provides an average roughness value. This measurement correlates the roughness of each sensor electrode to their actual electrochemical surface area. Due to the limitations of systems that are currently used, it is not possible, from a manufacturing throughput point of view, to measure the entire electrode surface, as this would be an extremely time-consuming endeavor.</p><p id="p-0634" num="0665">In order to measure the entire electrode in a meaningful and quantitative manner, an EIS-based methodology for measuring surface area has been developed herein that is faster than current, e.g., Zygo-based, testing, and more meaningful from a sensor performance perspective. Specifically, the use of EIS in electrode surface characterization is advantageous in several respects. First, by allowing multiple plates to be tested simultaneously, EIS provides a faster method to test electrodes, thereby providing for higher efficiency and throughput, while being cost-effective and maintaining quality.</p><p id="p-0635" num="0666">Second, EIS is a direct electrochemical measurement on the electrode under test, i.e., it allows measurement of EIS-based parameter(s) for the electrode and correlates the measured value to the true electrochemical surface area of the electrode. Thus, instead of taking an average height difference over a small section of the electrode, the EIS technique measures the double layer capacitance (which is directly related to surface area) over the whole electrode surface area and, as such, is more representative of the properties of the electrode, including the actual surface area. Third, EIS testing is non-destructive and, as such, does not affect future sensor performance. Fourth, EIS is particularly useful where the surface area to be measured is either fragile or difficult to easily manipulate.</p><p id="p-0636" num="0667">For purposes of this embodiment of the invention, the EIS-based parameter of interest is the Imaginary impedance (Zim), which may be obtained, as discussed previously, based on measurements of the impedance magnitude (|Z|) in ohms and the phase angle (&#x3a6;) in degrees of the electrode immersed in an electrolyte. It has been found that, in addition to being a high-speed process, testing using the electrochemical impedance of both the Counter Electrode (CE) and the WE is an accurate method of measuring the surface area of each electrode. This is also important because, although the role of electrode size in glucose sensor performance is dictated, at least in part, by the oxidation of the hydrogen peroxide produced by the enzymatic reaction of glucose with GOX, experiments have shown that an increased WE surface area reduces the number of low start-up events and improves sensor responsiveness&#x2014;both of which are among the potential failure modes that were previously discussed at some length.</p><p id="p-0637" num="0668">Returning to the imaginary impedance as the EIS-based parameter of interest, it has been found that the key parameters that drive the electrode surface area, and consequently, its imaginary impedance values are: (i) Electroplating conditions (time in seconds and current in micro Amperes); (ii) EIS frequency that best correlates to surface area; (iii) the number of measurements conducted on a single electrode associated to the electrolyte used in the EIS system; and (iv) DC Voltage Bias.</p><p id="p-0638" num="0669">In connection with the above parameters, experiments have shown that using Platinum plating solution as the electrolyte presents a poor correlation between the imaginary impedance and surface area across the entire spectrum. However, using Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) as the electrolyte presents very good correlation data, and using Phosphate Buffered saline Solution with zero mg/ml of Glucose (PBS-0) presents even better correlation data, between imaginary impedance and Surface Area Ratio (SAR), especially between the relatively-lower frequencies of 100 Hz and 5 Hz. Moreover, fitted regression analysis using a cubic regression model indicates that, in embodiments of the invention, the best correlation may occur at a frequency of 10 Hz. In addition, it has been found that reducing the Bias voltage from 535 mV to zero dramatically reduces the day-to-day variability in the imaginary impedance measurement.</p><p id="p-0639" num="0670">Using the above parameters, the limits of acceptability of values of imaginary impedance can be defined for a given sensor design. Thus, for example, for the Comfort Sensor manufactured by Medtronic Minimed, the imaginary impedance measured between the WE and the RE (Platinum mesh) must be greater than, or equal to, &#x2212;100 Ohms. In other words, sensors with an imaginary impedance value (for the WE) of less than &#x2212;100 Ohms will be rejected. For the WE, an impedance value of greater than, or equal to, &#x2212;100 Ohms corresponds to a surface area that is equal to, or greater than, that specified by an equivalent Ra measurement of greater than 0.55 um.</p><p id="p-0640" num="0671">Similarly, the imaginary impedance measured between the CE and the RE (Platinum mesh) must be greater than, or equal to, &#x2212;60 Ohms, such that sensors with an imaginary impedance value (for the CE) of less than &#x2212;60 Ohms will be rejected. For the CE, an impedance value of greater than, or equal to, &#x2212;60 Ohms corresponds to a surface area that is equal to, or greater than, that specified by an equivalent Ra measurement greater than 0.50 um.</p><p id="p-0641" num="0672">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, an equivalent circuit model as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> may be used to model the measured EIS between the working and reference electrodes, WE and RE, respectively.

The higher the R<sub>p</sub>, the higher the amount of resistance to the chemical reaction and, therefore, the slower the rate of electron and ion exchange. Thus, phenomenologically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref> shows that the length and the slope of the lower-frequency Nyquist plot increase as the electron-ion exchange rate decreases&#x2014;i.e., as the resistance to the chemical reaction increases, which, in turn, means a lower current (Isig) output.

More specifically, the lower-frequency Nyquist slope/Zimag primarily depends on Cdl, &#x3b1;, Rp, and &#x3bb;, and the lower-frequency length/Zmagnitude primarily depends on Cdl, Rp, and Warburg Admittance. Second, Rmem and Cmem control the higher-frequency response. In particular, Rmem determines the high frequency semi-circle diameter, and Cmem determines the turning point frequency, having minimal overall effect on the Nyquist plot.

Lastly, the experiments included an Oxygen stress test, where the supply of Oxygen dissolved in the solution was varied (i.e., limited) between 0.1% and 5% (<b>5075</b>). For purposes of these experiments, a full EIS sweep (i.e., from 0.1 Hz-8 kHz) was run, and the output data was recorded (and plotted) about once every 30 minutes. However, shorter or longer intervals may also be used.</p><p id="p-0656" num="0683">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b>C</figref>, the sum of Rsol and Rmem&#x2014;which, again, may be estimated by the magnitude of real impedance at the inflection point of the Nyquist plot&#x2014;displays a general downwards trend as a function of time. This is due primarily to the fact that the membrane takes time to hydrate, such that, as time passes by, it will become less resistant to the electrical charges. A slight correlation can also be seen between the plot for Isig (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b>A</figref>) and that for Rsol+Rmem (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0657" num="0684"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>B</figref> shows the EIS output for Cdl.

Thereafter, however, Cdl remains fairly constant, exhibiting a strong correlation with Isig (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>A</figref>). Given the latter correlation, Cdl data, as an EIS parameter, may be less useful in applications where glucose independence is desired. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b>C</figref>, the trend for Rp may be generally described as a mirror image of the plot for Cdl.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b></figref>, the Oxygen (or Vcntr) response is shown in Day 2, where Vcntr becomes more negative as the Oxygen content is decreased. Here, the Nyquist plot becomes shorter in length, and its slope decreases (<b>5094</b>), indicating a large decrease in imaginary impedance. The plot length depends primarily on Cdl and Rp, and is strongly correlated to Vcntr which, in turn, responds to changes in glucose and Oxygen. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b></figref>, the Isig changes negligibly from Day 2 to Day 3. Nevertheless, the Nyquist plot shifts horizontally (from the plot at 37&#xb0; C.) for data taken at 32&#xb0; C. (<b>5095</b>) and at 42&#xb0; C. (5097). However, there is no significant impact on Nyquist plot length, slope, or Isig.</p><p id="p-0659" num="0686">Putting the above-described EIS output and signature information together, it has been discovered that, during sensor start-up, the magnitude of Rmem+Rsol decreases over time, corresponding to a shift from right to left in the Nyquist plot. During this period, Cdl decreases, and Rp increases, with a corresponding increase in Nyquist slope. Finally, Warburg admittance also increases. As noted previously, the foregoing is consistent with the hydration process, with EIS plots and parameter values taking on the order of 1-2 days (e.g., 24-36 hours) to stabilize.</p><p id="p-0660" num="0687">Embodiments of the invention are directed to real-time self-calibration, and more particularly, to in-vivo self-calibration of glucose sensors based on EIS data. Any calibration algorithm, including self-calibration algorithms, must address sensitivity loss. As discussed previously, two types of sensitivity loss may occur: (1) Isig dip, which is a temporary loss of sensitivity, typically occurring during the first few days of sensor operation; and (2) permanent sensitivity loss, occurring generally at the end of sensor life, and sometimes correlated with the presence of a Vcntr rail.</p><p id="p-0661" num="0688">It has been discovered that sensitivity loss can manifest itself as an increase in Rsol or Rmem (or both), which can be observed in the Nyquist plot as a parallel shift to the right, or, if Rmem changes, a more visible start to a semicircle at the higher frequencies (resulting in an increase in high-frequency imaginary impedance). In addition to, or instead of, Rsol and Rmem, there could be an increase in Cmem only. This can be observed as changes in the high-frequency semicircle. Sensitivity loss will be accompanied by a change in Cdl (by way of a longer tail in the lower-frequency segment of the Nyquist plot). The foregoing signatures provide a means for determining how different changes in EIS output can be used to compensate for changes in sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0662" num="0689">For a normally operating glucose sensor, there is a linear relationship between blood glucose (BG) and the sensor's current output (Isig).

However, when there is an increase in Rmem and/or a decrease in Cmem, then c will be affected. Thus, line <b>6009</b> depicts a situation in which Rmem increases and Cmem decreases&#x2014;which signifies changes in the membrane properties&#x2014;thereby causing the offset &#x201c;c&#x201d; to move to <b>6011</b>, i.e., a downward shift of the calibration curve. Similarly, when there are (non-glucose related) changes in Cdl and increases in Rp&#x2014;with a resultant increase in the length of the (lower-frequency) Nyquist plot&#x2014;then the slope will be affected, where the slope=1/CF. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b></figref>, line <b>6013</b> has a different (smaller) slope that line <b>6005</b>.

It has been discovered, through model fitting, that the only parameter that changes during glucose changes is the double layer capacitance Cdl, and specifically the double layer admittance. Therefore, the only Isig-dependent&#x2014;and, by extension, glucose-dependent&#x2014;parameter in the equivalent circuit model of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> is Cdl, with all other parameters being substantially Isig-independent.</p><p id="p-0666" num="0691">In view of the above, in one embodiment of the invention, changes in Rmem and Cmem may be tracked to arrive at a readjustment of the Cal Factor (BG/Isig) and, thereby, enable real-time self-calibration of sensors without the need for continual finger-stick testing. This is possible, in part, because changes in Rmem and Cmem result in a change in the offset (c), but not in the slope, of the calibration curve. In other words, such changes in the membrane-related parameters of the model generally indicate that the sensor is still capable of functioning properly.</p><p id="p-0667" num="0692">Graphically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b>A</figref> shows actual blood glucose (BG) data <b>6055</b> that is being recorded, overlaid by the Isig output <b>6060</b> from the working electrode.

Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref> shows that the calibration curve <b>6073</b> for the second time period <b>6053</b> is parallel to, but shifted down from, the calibration curve <b>6071</b> for the first time period <b>6051</b>. Also, as discussed hereinabove in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>, as the membrane resistance (Rmem) increases, overall Nyquist plot shifts from left to right, and more of the high-frequency region semi-circle becomes visible.

Still, changes in Cdl and Rp may also be tracked, e.g., as a diagnostic tool, to determine, based on the direction/trend of the change in these parameters, whether, the drift or sensitivity loss has in fact reached a point where proper sensor operation is no longer recoverable or achievable. In this regard, in embodiments of the invention, respective lower and/or upper thresholds, or ranges of thresholds, may be calculated for each of Cdl and Rp, or for the change in slope, such that EIS output values for these parameters that fall outside of the respective threshold (range) may trigger, e.g., termination and/or replacement of the sensor due to unrecoverable sensitivity loss. In specific embodiments, sensor-design and/or patient-specific ranges or thresholds may be calculated, wherein the ranges/thresholds may be, e.g., relative to the change in Cdl, Rp, and/or slope.</p><p id="p-0670" num="0695">Graphically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>A</figref> shows actual blood glucose (BG) data <b>6155</b> that is being recorded, overlaid by the Isig output from two working electrodes, WE<b>1</b> <b>6160</b> and WE<b>2</b> <b>6162</b>.

Starting on Day 3, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>B</figref> shows that Vcntr rails at 1.2 volts. However, the decrease in sensitivity occurs from about Day 5 or so (<b>6180</b>). Once the Vcntr rails, the Cdl increases significantly, with a corresponding decrease in Rp, signifying a higher resistance to the overall electrochemical reaction. As expected, the slope of the calibration curve also changes (decreases), and L<sub>nyquist </sub>becomes shorter (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>73</b>-<b>75</b></figref>).

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>A</figref>, actual blood glucose (BG) data <b>6210</b> is overlaid by the Isig output from two working electrodes, WE<b>1</b> <b>6203</b> and WE<b>2</b> <b>6205</b>.

The Isig from WE<b>2</b>, on the other hand, appears to start at a lower point, and continues a downwards trend all the way from the beginning to Day 10, thus signifying a gradual loss of sensitivity. This is consistent with the Cdl for WE<b>2</b> (<b>6215</b>) being lower than that for WE<b>1</b> (<b>6213</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>77</b></figref>, even though the Cdl for both working electrodes generally exhibits a downward trend.</p><p id="p-0672" num="0697"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b></figref> shows the combined effect on the calibration curve, where both the offset and the slope of the linear fit for the period of sensitivity loss (<b>6235</b>) change relative to the calibration curve <b>6231</b> for the normally-functioning time windows. In addition, the Nyquist plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref> shows that, in the lower-frequency region, the length of the Nyquist plot is longer where there is sensitivity loss (<b>6245</b>), as compared to where the sensor is functioning normally (<b>6241</b>). Moreover, near the inflection point, the semicircles (<b>6255</b>) become more and more visible where there is loss of sensitivity. Importantly, where there is sensitivity loss, the Nyquist plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref> shifts horizontally from left to right as a function of time. In embodiments of the invention, the latter shift may be used as a measure for compensation or self-correction in the sensor.</p><p id="p-0673" num="0698">Thus, it has been discovered that, as an EIS signature, a temporary dip may be caused by increased membrane resistance (Rmem) and/or local Rsol increase. An increase in Rmem, in turn, is reflected by increased higher-frequency imaginary impedance. This increase may be characterized by the slope at high frequencies, (S<sub>nyquist</sub>)&#x2014;which, for simplicity, may be illustratively estimated as the slope between 8 kHz and 128 Hz. In addition, Vcntr railing increases Cdl and decrease Rp, such that the length and slope decrease; this may be followed by gradual Cdl decrease and Rp increase associated with sensitivity loss. In general, a decrease in Cdl, combined with an increase in Rp (length increase) and in Rmem may be sufficient to cause sensitivity loss.</p><p id="p-0674" num="0699">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, an algorithm for sensor self-calibration based on the detection of sensitivity change and/or loss is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>. At blocks <b>6305</b> and <b>6315</b>, a baseline Nyquist plot length (L<sub>nyquist</sub>) and a baseline higher frequency slope, respectively, are set, so as to be reflective of the EIS state at the beginning of sensor life. As noted, the Nyquist plot length is correlated to the Cdl, and the higher frequency Nyquist slope is correlated to the membrane resistance. The process then continues by monitoring the Nyquist plot length (<b>6335</b>) and the higher frequency slope (<b>6345</b>), as well as the Vcntr value (<b>6325</b>). When the Vcntr rails, the baseline L<sub>nyquist </sub>is adjusted, or reset <b>6355</b>, as the railing of the Vcntr changes the Cdl significantly. There is therefore a feedback loop <b>6358</b> to accommodate real-time changes in the monitored EIS parameters.</p><p id="p-0675" num="0700">As shown in block <b>6375</b>, as the length of the Nyquist plot is monitored, a significant increase in that length would indicate reduced sensitivity. In specific embodiments, sensor-design and/or patient-specific ranges or thresholds may be calculated, wherein the ranges/thresholds may be, e.g., relative to the change in the length of the Nyquist plot. Similarly, a more negative higher-frequency slope S<sub>nyquist </sub>corresponds to an increased appearance of the high-frequency semicircle and would be indicative of a possible dip <b>6365</b>. Any such changes in L<sub>nyquist </sub>and S<sub>nyquist </sub>are monitored, e.g., either continuously or periodically and, based on the duration and trend of the reduction in sensitivity, a determination is made as to whether total (i.e., severe) sensitivity loss has occurred, such that specific sensor glucose (SG) value(s) should be discarded (<b>6385</b>). In block <b>6395</b>, the Cal Factor may be adjusted based on the monitored parameters, so as to provide a &#x201c;calibration-free&#x201d; CGM sensor. It is noted that, within the context of the invention, the term &#x201c;calibration-free&#x201d; does not mean that a particular sensor needs no calibration at all. Rather, it means that the sensor can self-calibrate based on the EIS output data, in real time, and without the need for additional finger-stick or meter data. In this sense, the self-calibration may also be referred to as &#x201c;intelligent&#x201d; calibration, as the calibration is not performed based on a predetermined temporal schedule, but on an as-needed basis, in real-time.</p><p id="p-0676" num="0701">In embodiments of the invention, algorithms for adjustment of the Cal Factor (CF) and/or offset may be based on the membrane resistance which, in turn, may be estimated by the sum of Rmem and Rsol. As membrane resistance is representative of a physical property of the sensor, it generally cannot be estimated from EIS data run for a single frequency. Put another way, it has been observed that no single frequency will consistently represent membrane resistance, since frequencies shift depending on sensor state. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b></figref>, e.g., shows that, when there is some sensitivity loss, there is a horizontal shift in the Nyquist plot, and therefore, a shift in the inflection point that estimates the value of Rmem+Rsol. In this case, the shift in the real component of impedance is actually quite large. However, if only the high-frequency (e.g., at 8 kHz) real impedance is monitored, there is little to no shift at all, as indicated by the encircled region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0677" num="0702">There is therefore a need to track membrane resistance in a physically meaningful way. Ideally, this may be done through model fitting, where Rmem and Rsol are derived from model fitting, and Rm is calculated as Rm=Rmem+Rsol. However, in practice, this approach is not only computationally expensive, as it may take an unpredictably long amount of time, but also susceptible to not converging at all in some situations. Heuristic metrics may therefore be developed to approximate, or estimate, the value of Rm=Rmem+Rsol. In one such metric, Rmem+Rsol is approximated by the value of the real-impedance intercept at a fairly stable imaginary impedance value. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref>, for example, a region of general stability for the imaginary impedance (on the Y axis) may be identified at about 2000&#x3a9;. Taking this as a reference value and traveling across, parallel to the X axis, a value proportional to Rm may then be approximated as the real-impedance value of where the reference line crosses the Nyquist plot. An interpolation between frequencies may be performed to estimate &#x394;Rm&#x221d;&#x394; (Rmem+Rsol).</p><p id="p-0678" num="0703">Having estimated the value of Rm as discussed above, the relationship between Rm and the Cal Factor (CF) and/or Isig may then be explored. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref> shows the relationship between the estimated Rm and CF, wherein the former is directly proportional to the latter. The data points for purposes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref> were derived for steady state sensor operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>85</b></figref> shows a plot of normalized Isig vs. 1/Rm, where Isig has been normalized by the BG range (of the Isig). As can be seen from the figure, Isig can be adjusted based on changes in Rm. Specifically, an increase in 1/Rm (i.e., reduced membrane resistance) will lead to a proportional increase in Isig, as there is a linear relationship between Isig and 1/Rm.</p><p id="p-0679" num="0704">Thus, in one embodiment, an algorithm for adjustment of the Cal Factor would entail monitoring the change in membrane resistance based on a reference Cal Factor, and then modifying the Cal Factor proportionally based on the correlation between Rm and CF.

This can help with small differences once R<sub>m </sub>is smaller than &#x2dc;7000&#x3a9;, as may happen due to noise. The limited R<sub>m </sub>range can also help when R<sub>m </sub>is very large, as may happen due to very slow sensor hydration/stabilization.

A single (first) calibration is performed with the first BG at either 1 hour, 1.5 hours, or 2 hours after startup. As can be seen, without any Cal Factor adjustment, the MARD for calibration at 1 hour is much higher than that for calibration performed at 2 hours (22.23 vs. 19.34). However, with adjustment, or modified adjustment, as described above, the difference between the respective MARD numbers becomes smaller. Thus, for example, with adjustment, the MARD for calibration at 1 hour is 16.98, as compared to 15.42 for calibration performed at 2 hours. In addition, the MARD with adjustment for calibration at 1 hour is much less than the MARD without adjustment for calibration performed at 2 hours (16.98 vs. 19.34). As such, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, Cal Factor adjustments (and modified adjustments) may be used to elongate the useable life of a sensor&#x2014;e.g., by starting the sensor one hour earlier, in this example&#x2014;while maintaining, or improving, the MARD.

In one such method, generally referred to as &#x201c;First Day Compensation&#x201d; (or FDC), a first Cal Factor is measured. If the measured Cal Factor falls outside of a predetermined range, a constant linear decay function is applied to bring the Cal Factor back to within normal range at a projected time determined by the rate of the decay. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>92</b>A-<b>94</b>C</figref>, the Cal Factor adjustment algorithms of the invention (referred to in the diagrams as &#x201c;Compensation&#x201d;) <b>6701</b>, <b>6711</b>, <b>6721</b> produce results that are closer to the actual blood glucose (BG) measurements <b>6707</b>, <b>6717</b>, <b>6727</b> than results obtained by the FDC method <b>6703</b>, <b>6713</b>, <b>6723</b>.</p><p id="p-0693" num="0714">Given the complexities of estimating the value of EIS-related parameters, some of the current methods, including FDC, may be computationally less complex than the EIS Cal Factor adjustment algorithms described herein. However, the two approaches may also be implemented in a complementary fashion. Specifically, there may be situations in which FDC may be augmented by the instant Cal Factor adjustment algorithms. For example, the latter may be used to define the rate of change of the FDC, or to identify the range for which FDC should be applied (i.e., other than using CF alone), or to reverse the direction of FDC in special cases.</p><p id="p-0694" num="0715">In yet other embodiments, the offset, rather than the Cal Factor, may be adjusted.

In practice, when double layer capacitance decreases, e.g., during the first day of sensor life, i<sub>non-Faradaic </sub>is negative and decreases as a function of time. Therefore, in accordance with this embodiment of the invention, a larger offset&#x2014;i.e., the usual offset as calculated with current methods, plus i<sub>non-Faradaic</sub>&#x2014;would be added to the Isig at the very beginning of sensor life and allowed to decay following the 5<sup>th</sup>-order polynomial curve. That is, the additional offset i<sub>non-Faradaic </sub>follows a 5<sup>th</sup>-order polynomial, the coefficient for which must be determined. Depending on how dramatic the change in double layer capacitance is, the algorithm in accordance with this embodiment of the invention may apply to the first few hours, e.g., the first 6-12 hours, of sensor life.</p><p id="p-0735" num="0729">The polynomial fit may be calculated in various ways. For example, in an embodiment of the invention, coefficient P may be pre-determined based upon existing data. Then, the dynamic offset discussed above is applied, but only when the first Cal Factor is above normal range, e.g., &#x2dc;7. Experiments have shown that, generally, this method works best when the real-time double layer capacitance measurement is less reliable than desired.</p><p id="p-0736" num="0730">In an alternative embodiment, an in-line fitting algorithm is used. Specifically, an in-line double layer capacitance buffer is created at time T. P is then calculated based on the buffer, using a polynomial fit at time T. Lastly, the non-Faradaic current (dynamic offset) at time T+&#x394;T is calculated using P at time T. It is noted that this algorithm requires double layer capacitance measurements to be more frequent than their current level (every 30 mins), and that the measurements be reliable (i.e., no artifacts). For example, EIS measurements could be taken once every 5 minutes, or once every 10 minutes, for the first 2-3 hours of sensor life.</p><p id="p-0737" num="0731">In developing a real-time, self-calibrating sensor, the ultimate goal is to minimize, or eliminate altogether, the reliance on a BG meter. This, however, requires understanding of the relationships between EIS-related parameters and Isig, Cal Factor (CF), and offset, among others. For example, in-vivo experiments have shown that there is a correlation between Isig and each of Cdl and Warburg Admittance, such that each of the latter may be Isig-dependent (at least to some degree). In addition, it has been found that, in terms of factory calibration of sensors, Isig and Rm (=Rmem+Rsol) are the most important parameters (i.e., contributing factors) for the Cal Factor, while Warburg Admittance, Cdl, and Vcntr are the most important parameters for the offset.</p><p id="p-0738" num="0732">In in-vitro studies, metrics extracted from EIS (e.g., Rmem) tend to exhibit a strong correlation with Cal Factor. However, in-vivo, the same correlation can be weak. This is due, in part, to the fact that patient-specific, or (sensor) insertion-site-specific, properties mask the aspects of the sensor that would allow use of EIS for self-calibration or factory calibration. In this regard, in an embodiment of the invention, redundant sensors may be used to provide a reference point that can be utilized to estimate the patient-specific response. This, in turn, would allow a more robust factory calibration, as well as help identify the source of sensor failure mode(s) as either internal, or external, to the sensor.</p><p id="p-0739" num="0733">In general, EIS is a function of electric fields that form between the sensor electrodes. The electric field can extend beyond the sensor membrane and can probe into the properties of the (patient's) body at the sensor insertion site. Therefore, if the environment in which the sensor is inserted/disposed is uniform across all tests, i.e., if the tissue composition is always the same in-vivo (or if the buffer is always the same in-vitro), then EIS can be correlated to sensor-only properties. In other words, it may be assumed that changes in the sensor lead directly to changes in the EIS, which can be correlated with, e.g., the Cal Factor.</p><p id="p-0740" num="0734">However, it is well known that the in-vivo environment is highly variable, as patient-specific tissue properties depend on the composition of the insertion site. For example, the conductivity of the tissue around the sensor depends on the amount of fat around it. It is known that the conductivity of fat is much lower than that of pure interstitial fluid (ISF), and the ratio of local fat to ISF can vary significantly. The composition of the insertion site depends on the site of insertion, depth of insertion, patient-specific body composition, etc. Thus, even though the sensor is the same, the Rmem that is observed from EIS studies varies much more significantly because the reference environment is rarely, if ever, the same. That is, the conductivity of the insertion site affects the Rmem of the sensor/system. As such, it may not be possible to use the Rmem uniformly and consistently as a reliable calibration tool.</p><p id="p-0741" num="0735">As described previously, EIS can also be used as a diagnostic tool. Thus, in embodiments of the invention, EIS may be used for gross failure analysis. For example, EIS can be used to detect severe sensitivity loss which, in turn, is useful for determining whether, and when, to block sensor data, deciding on optimal calibration times, and determining whether, and when, to terminate a sensor. In this regard, it bears repeating that, in continuous glucose monitoring and analysis, two major types of severe sensitivity loss are typically considered: (1) Temporary sensitivity loss (i.e., an Isig dip), which typically occurs early in sensor life, and is generally believed to be a consequence of external sensor blockage; and (2) Permanent sensitivity loss, which typically occurs at the end of sensor life, and never recovers, thus necessitating sensor termination.</p><p id="p-0742" num="0736">Both in-vivo and in-vitro data show that, during sensitivity loss and Isig dips, the EIS parameters that change may be any one or more of Rmem, Rsol, and Cmem. The latter changes, in turn, manifest themselves as a parallel shift in the higher-frequency region of the Nyquist plot, and/or an increased appearance of the high-frequency semicircle. In general, the more severe the sensitivity loss, the more pronounced these symptoms are. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>100</b></figref> shows the higher-frequency region of the Nyquist plot for data at 2.6 days (<b>7050</b>), 3.5 days (<b>7055</b>), 6 days (<b>7060</b>), and 6.5 days (<b>7065</b>). As can be seen, there may be a horizontal shift, i.e., Rmem+Rsol shifts, from left to right, during sensitivity loss (<b>7070</b>), indicating an increase in membrane resistance. In addition, the plot for 6 days, and especially that for 6.5 days (<b>7065</b>), clearly show the appearance of the higher frequency semicircle during sensitivity loss (<b>7075</b>), which is indicative of a change in membrane capacitance. Depending on the circumstances and the severity of the sensitivity loss, either or both of the above-mentioned manifestations may appear on the Nyquist plot.</p><p id="p-0743" num="0737">With specific regard to the detection of Isig dips, as opposed to permanent sensitivity loss, some current methodologies use the Isig only to detect Isig dips by, e.g., monitoring the rate at which Isig may be dropping, or the degree/lack of incremental change in Isig over time, thereby indicating that perhaps the sensor is not responsive to glucose. This, however, may not be very reliable, as there are instances when Isig remains in the normal BG range, even when there is an actual dip. In such a situation, sensitivity loss (i.e., the Isig dip) is not distinguishable from hypoglycemia. Thus, in embodiments of the invention, EIS may be used to complement the information that is derived from the Isig, thereby increasing the specificity and sensitivity of the detection method.</p><p id="p-0744" num="0738">Permanent sensitivity loss may generally be associated with Vcntr rails. Here, some current sensor-termination methodologies rely solely on the Vcntr rail data, such that, e.g., when Vcntr rails for one day, the sensor may be terminated. However, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, one method of determining when to terminate a sensor due to sensitivity loss entails using EIS data to confirm whether, and when, sensitivity loss happens after Vcntr rails. Specifically, the parallel shift in the higher-frequency region of the Nyquist plot may be used to determine whether permanent sensitivity loss has actually occurred once a Vcntr rail is observed. In this regard, there are situations in which Vcntr may rail at, e.g., 5 days into sensor life, but the EIS data shows little to shift at all in the Nyquist plot. In this case, normally, the sensor would have been terminated at 5-6 days. However, with EIS data indicating that there was, in fact, no permanent sensitivity loss, the sensor would not be terminated, thereby saving (i.e., using) the remainder of the sensor's useful life.</p><p id="p-0745" num="0739">As mentioned previously, detection of sensitivity loss may be based on change(s) in one or more EIS parameters. Thus, changes in membrane resistance (Rm=Rmem+Rsol), for example, may manifest themselves in the mid-frequency (&#x2dc;1 kHz) real impedance region. For membrane capacitance (Cmem), changes may be manifested in the higher-frequency (&#x2dc;8 kHz) imaginary impedance because of increased semicircle. The double layer capacitance (Cdl) is proportional to average Isig. As such, it may be approximated as the length of lower-frequency Nyquist slope L<sub>nyquist</sub>. Because Vcntr is correlated to oxygen levels, normal sensor behavior typically entails a decrease in Vcntr with decreasing Isig. Therefore, an increase in Vcntr (i.e., more negative), in combination with a decrease in Isig may also be indicative of sensitivity loss. In addition, average Isig levels, rates of change, or variability of signal that are low or physiologically unlikely may be monitored.</p><p id="p-0746" num="0740">The EIS parameters must, nevertheless, be first determined. As described previously in connection with Cal Factor adjustments and related disclosure, the most robust way of estimating the EIS parameters is to perform model fitting, where the parameters in model equations are varied until the error between the measured EIS and the model output are minimized. Many methods of performing this estimate exist. However, for a real time application, model fitting may not be optimal because of computational load, variability in estimation time, and situations where convergence is poor. Usually, the feasibility will depend on the hardware.</p><p id="p-0747" num="0741">When the complete model fitting noted above is not possible, in one embodiment of the invention, one method for real-time application is through use of heuristic methodologies. The aim is to approximate the true parameter values (or a corresponding metric that is proportional to trends shown by each parameter) with simple heuristic methods applied to the measured EIS. In this regard, the following are implementations for estimating changes in each parameter.</p><p id="p-0748" num="0742">Double Layer Capacitance (Cdl)</p><p id="p-0749" num="0743">Generally speaking, a rough estimate of Cdl can be obtained from any statistic that measures the length of the lower-frequency Nyquist slope (e.g., frequencies lower than &#x2dc;128 Hz). This can be done, for example, by measuring L<sub>nyquist </sub>(the Cartesian distance between EIS at 128 Hz and 0.1 Hz in the Nyquist plot). Other frequency ranges may also be used. In another embodiment, Cdl may be estimated by using the amplitude of the lower-frequency impedance (e.g., at 0.1 Hz).</p><p id="p-0750" num="0744">Membrane Resistance (Rmem) and Solution Resistance (Rsol)</p><p id="p-0751" num="0745">As has been discussed hereinabove, on the Nyquist plot, Rmem+Rsol corresponds to the inflection point between the lower-frequency and the higher-frequency semicircles. Thus, in one embodiment, Rmem+Rsol may be estimated by localizing the inflection point by detecting changes in directionality of the Nyquist slope (e.g., by using derivatives and/or differences). Alternatively, a relative change in Rmem+Rsol can be estimated by measuring the shift in the Nyquist slope. To do this, a reference point in the imaginary axis can be chosen (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref>) and interpolation can be used to determine the corresponding point on the real axis. This interpolated value can be used to track changes in Rmem+Rsol over time. The chosen reference should lie within a range of values that, for a given sensor configuration, are not overly affected by large changes in the lower-frequency part of the Nyquist slope (for example, because of Vcntr Rail). Typical values may be between 1 k&#x3a9; and 3 k&#x3a9;. In another embodiment, it may be possible to use the real component of a single high frequency EIS (e.g., 1 kHz, 8 kHz). In certain sensor configurations, this may simulate Rmem the majority of the time, though it is noted that a single frequency may not be able to represent Rmem exactly in all situations.</p><p id="p-0752" num="0746">Membrane capacitance (Cmem)</p><p id="p-0753" num="0747">Increases in Cmem manifest as a more pronounced (or the more obvious appearance of) a higher-frequency semicircle. Changes in Cmem can therefore be detected by estimating the presence of this semicircle. Thus, in one embodiment, Cmem may be estimated by tracking the higher-frequency imaginary component of impedance. In this regard, a more negative value corresponds to the increased presence of a semicircle.</p><p id="p-0754" num="0748">Alternatively, Cmem may be estimated by tracking the highest point in the semicircle within a frequency range (e.g., 1 kHz-8 kHz). This frequency range can also be determined by identifying the frequency at which the inflection point occurs and obtaining the largest imaginary impedance for all frequencies higher than the identified frequency. In this regard, a more negative value corresponds to an increased presence of the semicircle.</p><p id="p-0755" num="0749">In a third embodiment, Cmem may be estimated by measuring the Cartesian distance between two higher-frequency points in the Nyquist plot, such as, e.g., 8 kHz and 1 kHz. This is the high frequency slope (S<sub>nyquist</sub>) defined previously in the instant application. Here, a larger absolute value corresponds to an increased semicircle, and a negative slope (with negative imaginary impedance on the y axis, and positive real impedance on the x) corresponds to the absence of a semicircle. It is noted that, in the above-described methodologies, there may be instances in which some of the detected changes in the semicircle may also be attributed to changes in Rmem. However, because changes in either are indicative of sensitivity loss, the overlap is considered to be acceptable.</p><p id="p-0756" num="0750">Non-EIS Related Metrics</p><p id="p-0757" num="0751">For context, it is noted that, prior to the availability of EIS metrics, sensitivity loss was by and large detected according to several non-EIS criteria. By themselves, these metrics are not typically reliable enough to achieve perfect sensitivity and specificity in the detection. They can, however, be combined with EIS-related metrics to provide supporting evidence for the existence of sensitivity loss. Some of these metrics include: (1) the amount of time that Isig is below a certain threshold (in nA), i.e., periods of &#x201c;low Isig&#x201d;; (2) the first order or second order derivatives of Isig leading to a state of &#x201c;low Isig&#x201d;, used as an indication of whether the changes in Isig are physiologically possible or induced by sensitivity loss; and (3) the variability/variance of Isig over a &#x201c;low Isig&#x201d; period, which can be indicative of whether the sensor is responsive to glucose or is flat lining.</p><p id="p-0758" num="0752">Sensitivity-Loss Detection Algorithms</p><p id="p-0759" num="0753">Embodiments of the invention are directed to algorithms for detection of sensitivity loss. The algorithms generally have access to a vector of parameters estimated from EIS measurements (e.g., as described hereinabove) and from non-EIS related metrics. Thus, e.g., the vector may contain Rmem and or shift in horizontal axis (of the Nyquist plot), changes in Cmem, and changes in Cdl. Similarly, the vector may contain data on the period of time Isig is in a &#x201c;low&#x201d; state, variability in Isig, rates of change in Isig. This vector of parameters can be tracked over time, wherein the aim of the algorithm is to gather robust evidence of sensitivity loss. In this context, &#x201c;robust evidence&#x201d; can be defined by, e.g., a voting system, a combined weighted metric, clustering, and/or machine learning.</p><p id="p-0760" num="0754">Specifically, a voting system may entail monitoring of one or more of the EIS parameters. For example, in one embodiment, this involves determining when more than a predetermined, or calculated, number of the elements in the parameter vector cross an absolute threshold. In alternative embodiments, the threshold may be a relative (%) threshold. Similarly, the vector elements may be monitored to determine when a particular combination of parameters in the vector crosses an absolute or a relative threshold. In another embodiment, when any of a subset of elements in the vector crosses an absolute or a relative threshold, a check on the remainder of the parameters may be triggered to determine if enough evidence of sensitivity loss can be obtained. This is useful when at least one of a subset of parameters is a necessary (but perhaps insufficient) condition for sensitivity loss to be reliably detected.</p><p id="p-0761" num="0755">A combined weighted metric entails weighing the elements in the vector according to, for example, how much they cross a predetermined threshold by. Sensitivity loss can then be detected (i.e., determined as occurring) when the aggregate weighted metric crosses an absolute or a relative threshold.</p><p id="p-0762" num="0756">Machine learning can be used as more sophisticated &#x201c;black box&#x201d; classifiers. For example, the parameter vector extracted from realistic in-vivo experimentation can be used to train artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), or genetic algorithms to detect sensitivity loss. A trained network can then be applied in real time in a very time-efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0763" num="0757"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B</figref> show two illustrative examples of flow diagrams for sensitivity-loss detection using combinatory logic. As shown, in both methodologies, one or more metrics <b>1</b>-N may be monitored. In the methodology of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>101</b>A</figref>, each of the metrics is tracked to determine if and when it crosses a threshold and described hereinabove. The output of the threshold-determination step is then aggregated via a combinatory logic, and a decision regarding sensitivity loss is made based on the output of the combinatory logic. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>101</b>B</figref>, values of the monitored metrics <b>1</b>-N are first processed through a combinatory logic, and the aggregate output of the latter is then compared to a threshold value(s) to determine whether sensitivity loss has occurred.</p><p id="p-0764" num="0758">Additional embodiments of the invention are also directed to using EIS in intelligent diagnostic algorithms. Thus, in one embodiment, EIS data may be used to determine whether the sensor is new, or whether it is being re-used (in addition to methodologies presented previously in connection with re-use of sensors by patients). With regard to the latter, it is important to know whether a sensor is new or is being re-used, as this information helps in the determination of what type of initialization sequence, if any, should be used. In addition, the information allows prevention of off-label use of a sensor, as well as prevention of sensor damage due to multiple reinitializations (i.e., each time a sensor is disconnected and then re-connected, it &#x201c;thinks&#x201d; that it is a new sensor, and therefore tries to reinitialize upon re-connection). The information also helps in post-processing of collected sensor data.</p><p id="p-0765" num="0759">In connection with sensor re-use and/or re-connection, it has been discovered that the lower-frequency Nyquist slope for a new sensor before initialization is different from (i.e., lower than) the lower-frequency Nyquist slope for a sensor that has been disconnected, and then reconnected again. Specifically, in-vitro experiments have shown that the Nyquist slope is higher for a re-used sensor as opposed to a newly-inserted one. The Nyquist slope, therefore, can be used as a marker to differentiate between new and used (or re-used) sensors. In one embodiment, a threshold may be used to determine, based on the Nyquist slope, whether a specific sensor is being re-used. In embodiments of the invention, the threshold may be a Nyquist slope=3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>102</b></figref> shows the low-frequency Nyquist plot with a reference slope=3 (<b>8030</b>), as well as the plots for a new sensor (pre-initialization) <b>8010</b>, a new sensor (post-initialization) <b>8015</b>, a reconnected sensor (pre-initialization) <b>8020</b>, and a reconnected sensor (post-initialization) <b>8020</b>. As noted, the slope for a new sensor (pre-initialization) <b>8010</b> is lower than the reference, or threshold (<b>8030</b>), while that for a reconnected sensor (pre-initialization) <b>8020</b> is higher than the threshold (<b>8030</b>).</p><p id="p-0766" num="0760">Equivalently, lower-frequency phase measurements may be used to detect sensors that have been previously initialized. Here, the pre-initialization phase angle at 0.105 Hz, e.g., may be used to differentiate between new and used (or re-used) sensors. Specifically, a threshold may be set at a phase angle of about &#x2212;70&#xb0;. Thus, if the pre-initialization phase angle at 0.105 Hz is less than the threshold, then the sensor is considered to be an old (i.e., previously-initialized) sensor. As such, no further initialization pulses will be applied to the sensor.</p><p id="p-0767" num="0761">In another embodiment, EIS data may be used to determine the type of sensor being used. Here, it has been discovered that, if the sensor designs are significantly different, the respective EIS outputs should also be significantly different, on average. Different sensor configurations have different model parameters. It is therefore possible to use identification of these parameters at any point during the sensor life to determine the sensor type currently inserted. The parameters can be estimated, e.g., based on methods described hereinabove in connection with gross failure/sensitivity-loss analysis. Identification can be based on common methods to separate values, for example, setting thresholds on specific (single or multiple) parameters, machine learning (ANN, SVM), or a combination of both methods.</p><p id="p-0768" num="0762">This information may be used, e.g., to change algorithm parameters and initialization sequences. Thus, at the beginning of the sensor life, this can be used to have a single processing unit (GST, GSR) to set optimal parameters for the calibration algorithm. Offline (non real-time), the identification of sensor type can be used to aid analysis/evaluation of on-the-field sensor performance.</p><p id="p-0769" num="0763">It has also been discovered that the length of the lower-frequency Nyquist slope may be used to differentiate between different sensor types. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>C</figref> show Nyquist plots for three different sensors (i.e., different sensor configurations), identified as Enlite (<b>8050</b>), Enlite <b>2</b> (i.e., &#x201c;Enlite Enhanced&#x201d;) (<b>8060</b>), and Enlite <b>3</b> (<b>8070</b>), all of which are manufactured by Medtronic Minimed (Northridge, Calif.). As can be seen, for various stages, including pre-initialization, post-initialization, and second post-initialization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>C</figref>, respectively), the Enlite sensor has the shortest lower-frequency Nyquist slope length (<b>8050</b>), followed by the Enlite <b>2</b> (<b>8060</b>), and the Enlite <b>3</b> (<b>8070</b>), which has the longest length. The latter are also shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>104</b></figref>, where Nyquist (slope) length, computed as the Cartesian distance between EIS at 0.105 Hz and 1 Hz, is plotted against time.</p><p id="p-0770" num="0764">Embodiments of the invention are also directed to using diagnostic EIS measurements as a guide in determining the type of initialization that should be performed. As noted previously, initialization sequences can be varied based on detected sensor type (EIS-based or other), and/or detection of whether a new or old sensor is inserted (EIS-based). In addition, however, EIS-based diagnostics may also be used in determining a minimal hydration state prior to initialization (e.g., by tracking Warburg impedance), or in determining when to terminate initialization (e.g., by tracking reaction-dependent parameter, such as, e.g., Rp, Cdl, Alpha, etc.), so as to properly minimize sensor initialization time.</p><p id="p-0771" num="0765">More specifically, to minimize initialization response time, additional diagnostics are required to control the processes that occur during initialization. In this regard, EIS may provide for the required additional diagnostics. Thus, for example, EIS may be measured between each initialization pulse to determine if further pulsing is required. Alternatively, or in addition, EIS may be measured during high pulses, and compared to the EIS of optimal initialization state to determine when the sensor is sufficiently initialized. Lastly, as noted above, EIS may be used in estimating a particular model parameter&#x2014;most likely one or more reaction-dependent parameters, such as Rp, Cdl, Alpha, etc.</p><p id="p-0772" num="0766">As has been noted, sensor calibration in general, and real-time sensor calibration in particular, is central to a robust continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. In this regard, calibration algorithms are generally designed such that, once a BG is received by taking a fingerstick, the new BG value is used to either generate an error message, or update the calibration factor which, in turn, is used to calculate sensor glucose. In some previous algorithms, however, a delay of 10-20 minutes may exist between the time when a fingerstick is entered, and the time when the user is notified of either the fingerstick being accepted or a new fingerstick being required for calibration. This is burdensome, as the user is left not knowing whether he/she will need his/her BG meter again in a few minutes.</p><p id="p-0773" num="0767">In addition, in some situations, the presence of older BG values in the calibration buffer causes either perceived system delay, due to the newest BG value carrying less than 100% weight, or inaccuracy in the calculated SG (due to the older BG values no longer being representative of the current state of the system). Moreover, erroneous BG values are sometimes entered, but not caught by the system, which may lead to large inaccuracies until the next calibration.</p><p id="p-0774" num="0768">In view of the above, embodiments of the invention seek to address potential shortcomings in prior methodologies, especially with regard to sensor performance for use with closed-loop systems. For example, in order to make the system more predictable, calibration errors may be notified only when the fingerstick (BG value) is received by the transmitter (i.e., entered), rather than, e.g., 10-15 minutes later. Additionally, in contrast to some existing systems, where a constant calibration error (CE) threshold is used, embodiments of the invention may utilize variable calibration error thresholds when higher errors are expected (e.g., either due to lower reliability of the sensor, or high rates of change), thereby preventing unnecessary calibration error alarms and fingerstick requests. Thus, in one aspect, when the sensor is in FDC mode, Isig dip calibration mode, or undergoing a high rate of change (e.g., when 2-packet rate of change x CF&#x3e;1.5 mg/dL/min.), a limit corresponding to 50% or 50 mg/dL may be used.</p><p id="p-0775" num="0769">On the other hand, when low error is expected, the system may use a tighter calibration error limit, such as, e.g., 40% or 40 mg/dL. This reduces the likelihood that erroneous BG values may be used for calibration, while also allowing the status of the calibration attempt to be issued immediately (i.e., accepted for calibration, or a calibration error). Moreover, in order to handle situations where newer Isig values would cause a calibration error, a check at calibration time (e.g., 5-10 minutes after fingerstick) may select the most appropriate filtered Isig (fIsig) value to use for calibration.</p><p id="p-0776" num="0770">In connection with the aforementioned issues involving BG values and the BG buffer, embodiments of the invention aim to reduce the delay, and the perceptions of delay, by assigning higher weighting to the newer BG value than was assigned in previous algorithms, and by ensuring that the early calibration update occurs more frequently. In addition, in situations where there is a confirmed sensitivity change (as confirmed, e.g., by the Smart Calibration logic mentioned previously and to be explored hereinbelow, and by recent calibration BG/Isig ratios), the calibration buffer may undergo partial clearing. Lastly, whereas prior algorithms may have employed an expected calibration factor (CF) weight which was a constant, embodiments of the invention provide for a variable CF value based on sensor age.</p><p id="p-0777" num="0771">In short, embodiments of the invention provide for variable calibration error thresholds based on expectation of error during calibration attempt, as well as issuance of calibration error message(s) without waiting for additional sensor data, less delay in calibrating (e.g., 5-10 minutes), updated expected calibration factor value based on sensor age, and partial clearing of the calibration buffer as appropriate. Specifically, in connection with First Day Compensation (FDC), embodiments of the invention provide for requesting additional calibrations when higher Cal Factor thresholds are triggered in order to more expeditiously correct sensor performance. Such higher CF thresholds may be set at, e.g., between 7 and 16 mg/dL/nA, with the latter serving as the threshold for indication of calibration error in embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0778" num="0772">Thus, in one aspect, if a high CF threshold is triggered after the first calibration, the system requires that the next calibration be performed in 3 hours. However, if a high CF threshold is triggered after the second, or subsequent, calibration, the system requires that the next calibration be performed in 6 hours. The foregoing procedure may be implemented for a period of 12 hours from sensor connection.</p><p id="p-0779" num="0773">In another aspect, the expected Cal Factor, which is used during calibration to calculate the Cal Factor, is increased over time so as to reduce the likelihood of under-reading. By way of background, existing methodologies may use a fixed expected Cal Factor throughout the sensor life, without accounting for possible shifts in sensor sensitivity. In such methodologies, the expected Cal Factor may be weighted in calculating the final Cal Factor, and used to reduce noise.</p><p id="p-0780" num="0774">In embodiments of the present invention, however, the expected CF is calculated as a function of time, expressed in terms of the age of the sensor. Specifically,</p><p id="p-0781" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00036" num="00036"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>Expected</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mi>CF</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>SensorAge</mi>    <mo>&#xd7;</mo>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <mn>0.209</mn>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>mg</mi>      <mo>/</mo>      <mi>dL</mi>      <mo>/</mo>      <mi>nA</mi>     </mrow>     <mi>day</mi>    </mfrac>   </mrow>   <mo>+</mo>   <mrow>    <mn>4.73</mn>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>mg</mi>    <mo>/</mo>    <mi>dL</mi>    <mo>/</mo>    <mi>nA</mi>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0782" num="0000">where Sensor Age is expressed in units of days. In further embodiments, the expected Cal Factor may be calculated as a function of the existing CF and impedance, such that any changes in sensitivity may be reflected in the expected CF. In addition, in aspects of the invention, expected CF may be calculated on every Isig packet, rather than doing so only at a BG entry, so as to gradually adjust the Cal Factor between calibrations.</p><p id="p-0783" num="0775">In connection with calibration buffer and calibration error calculations, embodiments of the invention provide for modification of calibration buffer weights and/or clearing of the calibration buffer. Specifically, when impedance measurements (e.g., through EIS) indicate that the Cal Factor might have changed, and a calibration attempt indicates that a change might have occurred, the change in Cal Ratio (CR) is checked by comparing the CR of the current BG to the most recent CR in the calibration buffer. Here, such a change may be verified by, e.g., values of the 1 kHz impedance, as detailed previously in connection with related EIS procedures. In addition, weights may be added in the calibration buffer calculation based on reliability indices, the direction in which the Cal Factor is expected to change, and/or the rate of change of calibration. In the latter situation, e.g., a lower weight may be assigned, or CF only temporarily updated, if calibration is on a high rate of change.</p><p id="p-0784" num="0776">In embodiments of the invention, selection of filtered Isig (fIsig) values for the calibration buffer may be initiated on the second Isig packet after BG entry. Specifically, the most recent of the past three (3) fIsig values that would not cause a calibration error may be selected. Then, once accepted for calibration, the calibration process will proceed without a calibration error being issued. Such calibration error may be caused, e.g., by an invalid Isig value, a Cal Ratio range check, a percentage error check, etc.</p><p id="p-0785" num="0777">In other embodiments, values of fIsig may be interpolated to derive a one-minute resolution. Alternatively, fIsig values may be selected from recent values based on the rate of change in the values (and accounting for delays). In yet another alternative embodiment, fIsig values may be selected based on a value of CR that is closest to a predicted CR value. The predicted CR value, in turn, is closest to the current value of the Cal Factor, unless the latter, or EIS data, indicate that CF should change.</p><p id="p-0786" num="0778">As noted previously, in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>34</b></figref>, e.g., values for 1 kHz real impedance provide information on potential occlusion(s) that may exist on the sensor membrane surface, which occlusion(s) may temporarily block passage of glucose into the sensor and thus cause the signal to dip. More broadly, the 1 kHz real impedance measurement may be used to detect sensor events that are typically sudden and may indicate that the sensor is no longer fully inserted. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>105</b></figref> shows a flow chart for a method of blanking sensor data or terminating the sensor in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0787" num="0779">The methodology starts at block <b>9005</b>, where 1 kHz real impedance values are filtered using, e.g., a moving average filter, and, based thereon, a determination is made as to whether the EIS-derived values are stable (<b>9010</b>). If it is determined that the EIS-derived values are not stable, the methodology proceeds to block <b>9015</b>, wherein a further determination is made based on the magnitude of the 1 kHz impedance. Specifically, if both the filtered and unfiltered values of 1 kHz real impedance are less than 7,000&#x3a9;, then EIS is set as stable (<b>9020</b>). If, on the other hand, both the filtered and unfiltered values of 1 kHz real impedance are not less than 7,000&#x3a9;, then EIS is set as unstable (<b>9025</b>). It is noted that the above-described <b>7</b>,<b>000</b>Q threshold prevents data blanking or sensor termination for sensors that have not stabilized.</p><p id="p-0788" num="0780">When EIS is stable, the algorithm proceeds to block <b>9030</b>. Here, if the 1 kHz real impedance is less than 12,000&#x3a9; (<b>9030</b>), and also less than 10,000&#x3a9; (<b>9040</b>), the algorithm determines that the sensor is within normal operating range and, as such, allows sensor data to continue to be displayed (<b>9045</b>). If, on the other hand, the 1 kHz real impedance value is greater than 10,000&#x3a9; (i.e., when the 1 kHz real impedance is between 10 k&#x3a9; and 12 k&#x3a9;), the logic determines whether the 1 kHz real impedance value has been high (i.e., greater than 10 k&#x3a9;) for the past 3 hours (<b>9050</b>). If it is determined that the 1 kHz real impedance value has been high for the past 3 hours, then the sensor is terminated at <b>9060</b>, as the sensor is assumed to have pulled out, rendering sensor data invalid. Otherwise, the sensor is not terminated, as the sensor signal may be simply drifting, which, as discussed previously, may be a recoverable phenomenon. Nevertheless, the sensor data is blanked (<b>9055</b>) while the sensor is given a chance to recover.</p><p id="p-0789" num="0781">It is noted that, in further embodiments, in determining whether data should be blanked, or the sensor terminated, the logic may also consider, in addition to the above-mentioned thresholds, sudden increases in impedance by, e.g., comparing impedance derivatives to historical derivatives. Moreover, the algorithm may incorporate noise-based blanking or termination, depending on the duration of high noise-low sensor signal combination. In this regard, prior methodologies included termination of the sensor after three (3) consecutive 2-hour windows of high noise and low sensor signal. However, in order to prevent unreliable data from being displayed to the user, embodiments of the invention employ noise-based blanking, wherein the algorithm stops calculating SG values after 2 consecutive 2-hour windows (i.e., at the start of the third consecutive window) involving high noise and low signal. In further aspects, the algorithm may allow further calculation and display of the calculated SG values after one hour of blanking, rather than two hours, where the sensor signal appears to have recovered. This is an improvement over methodologies that blank otherwise reliable data for longer periods of time.</p><p id="p-0790" num="0782">Whereas 1 kHz real impedance may be used to detect sudden sensor failures, measurements of imaginary impedance at higher frequencies (e.g., 8 kHz) may be used to detect more gradual changes, where sensor sensitivity has drifted significantly from its typical sensitivity. In this regard, it has been discovered that a large shift in 8 kHz imaginary impedance typically signifies that the sensor has experienced a large change in glucose sensitivity or is no longer stable.</p><p id="p-0791" num="0783"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>106</b></figref> shows a flow diagram for a method of sensor termination in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>106</b></figref>, the algorithm employs a reference at 1.5 days (since sensor start), as doing so provides for a more robust logic, and ensures that the logic focuses on long-term sensitivity changes. Thus, if the sensor has not been operating for at least 1.5 days (<b>9002</b>), no action is taken, and the algorithm &#x201c;waits&#x201d; (<b>9012</b>), i.e., it periodically loops back to step <b>9002</b>. Once the condition in block <b>9002</b> is met, a determination is made as to whether a reference imaginary impedance value is set (<b>9022</b>). If a reference value has not been previously set, the algorithm proceeds to set one by assigning the minimum 8 kHz imaginary impedance value since sensor initialization as the reference value (<b>9032</b>), clipped within the range &#x2212;1,000&#x3a9;-800&#x3a9;. With the reference value set, a change value is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the reference value and the current value of the 8 kHz imaginary impedance (<b>9052</b>). In block <b>9062</b>, the algorithm determines whether the change value is greater than 1,200&#x3a9; for two consecutive measurements, as well as whether the Cal Ratio is larger than 14. If at least one of the latter inquiries is answered in the negative, then the sensor is allowed to continue operating and display SG values (<b>9072</b>). However, if the change value is greater than 1,200&#x3a9; for two consecutive measurements, and the Cal Ratio is larger than 14, then the sensor is terminated at block <b>9082</b>.</p><p id="p-0792" num="0784">Embodiments of the invention are also directed to assessment of reliability of sensor glucose values, as well as estimation of sensor-data error direction, in order to provide users and automated insulin delivery systems&#x2014;including those in closed-loop systems&#x2014;an indicator of how reliable the system is when SG is displayed to the user. Depending on the reliability of sensor data, such automated systems are then able to assign a corresponding weight to the SG and make a determination as to how aggressively treatments should be provided to users. Additionally, the direction of error can also be used to inform users and/or the insulin delivery system in connection with SG being a &#x201c;false low&#x201d; or a &#x201c;false high&#x201d; value. The foregoing may be achieved by, e.g., detecting dips in sensor data during the first day (EIS dip detection), detecting sensor lag, and lower-frequency (e.g., 10 Hz) impedance changes.</p><p id="p-0793" num="0785">Specifically, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, it has been discovered that a Cal Factor (CF) of above about 9 mg/dL/nA may be indicative of low sensor reliability and, as such, a predictor of higher error. Thus, CF values outside of this range may be generally indicative of one or more of the following: abnormal glucose sensitivity; calibrations that occurred during a dip in signal; delay in entering BG information, or high rate of change when calibrating; BG error when calibrating; and sensor with a transient change in glucose sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0794" num="0786"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>107</b></figref> shows a flow diagram for a signal dip detection methodology in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, where increases in unfiltered real 1 kHz impedance may be used in combination with low Isig values to identify the start of a dip. As shown in the diagram, at block <b>9102</b>, the logic determines whether sensor data is currently being blanked due to signal dip. If data is not being blanked, then the logic determines whether less than 4 hours have passed since sensor start (<b>9104</b>). If more than 4 hours have elapsed since sensor start, the logic then determines whether more than 12 hours have passed since sensor start (<b>9106</b>), in which case there will be no dip detection or blanking of data (<b>9108</b>). Thus, in this regard, the methodology is directed to identifying transient dips during the first 12 hours of sensor data.</p><p id="p-0795" num="0787">Returning to block <b>9106</b>, if less than 12 hours have passed since sensor start, then an inquiry is made regarding the recent EIS, Isig, and SG values.

Specifically, if the two most-recent EIS (i.e., 1 kHz impedance) values are increasing, and Isig&#x3c;25 nA, then the algorithm determines that the start of a dip has been detected and notifies the system to stop displaying SG values (<b>9114</b>, <b>9116</b>). If, however, the two most-recent 1 kHz impedance values are not increasing, or Isig is not less than 25 nA, then there will be no dip detection or data blanking (<b>9108</b>), as before.</p><p id="p-0797" num="0789">Returning to block <b>9102</b>, if it is determined that data is currently being blanked due to a dip, there is still a possibility that data will nevertheless be shown. That is, if Isig is greater than about 1.2 times Isig at the start of the dip event (<b>9118</b>), then it is determined that Isig has recovered, i.e., the dip event is over, and data display will resume (<b>9122</b>). On the other hand, if Isig is not greater than about 1.2 times Isig at the start of the dip event (<b>9118</b>), then it is determined that Isig has not yet recovered, i.e., the dip event is not over, and the system will continue to blank sensor data (<b>9120</b>).</p><p id="p-0798" num="0790">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the direction of error in SG (under-reading or over reading), in general, may be determined by considering one or more factors related to under- and/or over-reading. Thus, it has been discovered that under-reading in sensors may occur when: (1) Vcntr is extreme (e.g., Vcntr&#x3c;&#x2212;1.0 V); (2) CF is high (e.g., CF&#x3e;9); (3) lower frequency impedance (e.g., at 10 Hz) is high (e.g., real 10 Hz impedance &#x3e;10.2 k&#x3a9;); (4) FDC is in low CF mode; (5) sensor lag suggests under-reading; (6) lower frequency impedance (e.g., at 10 Hz) increases (e.g., 10 Hz impedance increases over 7000); and/or (7) EIS has detected a dip. Over-reading, on the other hand, may occur when: (1) lower frequency impedance (e.g., 10 Hz) decreases (e.g., lower frequency impedance &#x3c;&#x2212;200&#x3a9;); (2) sensor lag suggests over-reading; and/or (3) FDC when CF is in extreme mode.</p><p id="p-0799" num="0791">Such under-reading or over-reading, especially in closed-loop systems, can have a profound impact on patient safety. For example, over-reading near the hypoglycemic range (i.e., &#x3c;70 mg/dL) may cause an overdose of insulin to be administered to the patient. In this regard, several indicators of error direction have been identified, which may be used as test criteria, including: (1) low sensitivity indicators; (2) sensor lag; (3) FDC mode; and (4) loss/gain in sensitivity since calibration.</p><p id="p-0800" num="0792">Two such low sensitivity indicators are high (lower-frequency) real impedance (e.g., &#x3e;10 k&#x3a9;) and high Vcntr (e.g., Vcntr&#x3c;&#x2212;1.0V), both of which are, in general, indicative of loss of sensitivity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>108</b>A</figref> shows an example in which Vcntr <b>9130</b> gradually increases (i.e., become more negative) as a function of time. At about 115 hours, shown by line <b>9135</b>, Vcntr crosses &#x2212;1.0V, as indicated by line <b>9137</b>, and continues to increase (i.e., Vcntr&#x3c;&#x2212;1.0V) to about &#x2212;1.2V. As shown, prior to about 115 hours, the Isig trend <b>9132</b> generally follows the Vcntr trend. However, once Vcntr passes the threshold (i.e., to the right of line <b>9135</b>), the Isig departs from Vcntr, and continues to drop. At the same time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>108</b>B</figref>, glucose <b>9134</b> also has a generally downward trend, with Cal errors <b>9136</b> being indicated at about 130 hours and about 165 hours.</p><p id="p-0801" num="0793">As discussed previously, (EIS) sensor dips are also indicative of temporary sensitivity loss. Similarly, a high Cal Factor is indicative of the sensor's attempt to compensate for reduced sensitivity. In one example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>109</b>A and <b>109</b>B</figref>, the Cal Factor <b>9140</b> increases steadily as a function of time. At about 120 hours (<b>9145</b>), the Cal Factor <b>9140</b> crosses a threshold value of 9 (<b>9147</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>109</b>B</figref>, once the Cal Factor crosses the threshold, the glucose values <b>9142</b> show more frequent departures from BG values, with several errors <b>9144</b> occurring between about 135 hours and 170 hours.</p><p id="p-0802" num="0794">As mentioned previously, sensor lag is another indicator of error direction.

The CF is set to the value indicated by the calibration, and then ramps up or down to the expected range, as shown, e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B</figref>. During this time, usually high, but generally predictable, errors may exist, resulting in potential over-reads or under-reads. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B</figref>, the CF changes at a generally constant slope as it rises or falls, and then settles, in this case at 4.5 or 5.5.</p><p id="p-0807" num="0796">Lastly, post-calibration sensitivity change, i.e., loss/gain in sensitivity since calibration, is also an indicator of error/error direction. Under normal circumstances, and except for first day calibration as discussed hereinabove, the Cal Factor remains generally constant until a new calibration is performed. Shifts in sensitivity after calibration, therefore, can cause over-reads and under-reads which, in turn, may be reflected by values of lower-frequency (e.g., 10 Hz) real impedance.</p><p id="p-0808" num="0797">Specifically, it has been discovered that a drop in lower-frequency real impedance causes over-reading, with the direction of error being indicated by the real impedance curve. Conversely, lower-frequency real-impedance increases cause under-reading, with the direction of error also being indicated by the real impedance curve. However, current directionality tests may be unable to readily decipher points at peaks and valleys of the glucose profile. Thus, in one embodiment, the degree of sharpness of such peaks and valleys may be reduced by filtering, such as, e.g., by deconvolution with lowpass filtering.</p><p id="p-0809" num="0798">As described previously in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>, e.g., sensitivity change and/or loss may be used to inform proper sensor calibration. In this regard, in a further aspect of the invention, changes in sensor sensitivity may be predicted based on the previous calibration factor or on impedance so as to enable implementation of &#x201c;smart calibrations&#x201d;, which help address continued generation and/or display of inaccurate glucose data when, e.g., sensor sensitivity has changed.</p><p id="p-0810" num="0799">It is known that, in some existing continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS), calibration fingersticks are required every twelve hours. The calibration allows the CGMS to update the function used to convert the measured sensor current into a displayed glucose concentration value. In such systems, the 12-hour calibration interval is selected as a balance between reducing the user burden (of performing too many fingersticks) and using an interval that is sufficient to adjust for changes in sensor sensitivity before inaccuracies can cause too large of a problem. However, while this interval may be appropriate in general, if the sensor sensitivity has changed, 12 hours can be too long to wait if a high level of accuracy (in support of closed loop insulin delivery) is expected.</p><p id="p-0811" num="0800">Embodiments of the invention, therefore, address the foregoing issues by using the previous calibration factor (see discussion of FDC below), or impedance (see discussion of EIS-based &#x201c;smart calibrations&#x201d; below), to predict if sensitivity has changed. Aspects of the invention also use time limits to maintain predictability for users, as well as include steps (in the associated methodology) to ensure that detection is robust to variations between sensors.</p><p id="p-0812" num="0801"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>111</b></figref> shows a flow diagram in accordance with an embodiment of the invention for First Day Calibration (FDC). Starting at block <b>9150</b>, if FDC is not on after successful calibration, there is simply no smart calibration request (<b>9151</b>). However, if FDC is on, a determination is made at block <b>9153</b> as to whether this is the first calibration and, if it is not, then a smart calibration request is made, with the timer set for 6 hours, i.e., it is requested that an additional calibration be made in 6 hours (<b>9155</b>). If, on the other hand, this is the first calibration, then block <b>9157</b> determines whether the Cal Ratio is less than 4, or greater than 7. If the condition in block <b>9157</b> is not met, then the logic proceeds to block <b>9155</b> where, as noted above, a smart calibration request is made, with the timer set for 6 hours. However, if the criterion in block <b>9157</b> is not met, then a smart calibration request is made, with the timer set for 3 hours, i.e., it is requested that an additional calibration be made in 3 hours (<b>9159</b>). Thus, in order to improve accuracy for sensors which need calibration adjusted, additional (smart) calibrations are requested which, in turn, limit the amount of time where the adjustment is incorrect.</p><p id="p-0813" num="0802">In contrast with FDC mode, EIS-based smart calibration mode provides for additional calibrations if impedance changes. Thus, in an embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>112</b></figref>, an allowed range relating to impedance values (and as defined hereinbelow) is set in the hour after calibration and, following the calibration, a request for additional calibrations is made if impedance is outside of range. Thus, if not within one hour since calibration, a determination is made as to whether the filtered 1 kHz imaginary impedance value is outside of range (<b>9160</b>, <b>9162</b>). If the impedance value is not outside of range, then no change is made (<b>9164</b>). However, if the filtered 1 kHz imaginary impedance value is outside of range, then the calibration timer is updated so that calibration is requested to be performed at 6 hours from the previous calibration (<b>9168</b>). It is noted that, while higher-frequency imaginary impedance tends to better identify changes in glucose sensitivity, towards the higher end of the frequency spectrum, measurements are generally noisier and, as such, may require filtering.</p><p id="p-0814" num="0803">Returning to block <b>9160</b>, if it is determined that less than one hour has passed since calibration, then the range for impedance values may be updated (<b>9166</b>). Specifically, in one embodiment, the impedance range calculation is performed on the last EIS measurement 1 hour after calibration. In a preferred embodiment, the range is defined as</p><p id="p-0815" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>range=3&#xd7;median(|<i>x</i><sub>i</sub><i>&#x2212;x</i><sub>j</sub>|)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0816" num="0000">where j is the current measurement, and i are the most recent 2 hours of values. In addition, the range may be limited to be values between 50&#x3a9; and 100&#x3a9;. It is noted that the range as defined above allows for 3 times median value. The latter has been discovered to be more robust than the 2-standard-deviation approach used in some prior algorithms, which allowed noise and outliers to cause inconsistencies.</p><p id="p-0817" num="0804">As has been discussed in detail herein, most continuous glucose sensor monitoring (CGM) systems require finger-stick blood glucose measurements for calibration. For real-time systems, it can be difficult to determine changes in sensor behaviors, such as sensitivity or sensor anomaly, at the time of the data output. Therefore, calibration using a finger-stick measurement is needed to assure sensor accuracy. Calibration using fingersticks, however, is not only painful, but also cumbersome for the user. Embodiments, therefore, have been directed to retrospective calibration-free algorithms for continuous sensor recorders, including use of the ASIC previously described in detail herein. In this regard, as was noted previously in connection with EIS-related algorithms and calibration, within the context of the instant description, the term &#x201c;calibration-free&#x201d; does not mean that a particular sensor needs no calibration at all. Rather, it means that the sensor can self-calibrate based on the data that is stored in the sensor recorders, without the need for additional finger-stick or meter data. Thus, the need for finger-stick measurements to provide a reference can be eliminated for retrospective systems.</p><p id="p-0818" num="0805">Retrospective sensor systems have the ability to have the entire traces of raw signals available for use by an algorithm before processing and converting to glucose values. Specifically, sensor recorders may record the raw signals, such as, e.g., Isig and Vcntr, as well as EIS data for diagnostics. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>113</b></figref>, the retrospective algorithm may comprise several processing components, including: (1) raw Isig signal processing (<b>9205</b>, <b>9210</b>); (2) discrete wavelet decomposition of the raw Isig signal (<b>9215</b>); (3) raw EIS signal processing (<b>9230</b>, <b>9235</b>); (4) generating sensor glucose (SG) based on different models from machine learning methods (<b>9240</b>, <b>9245</b>); (5) fusion of the SG values from different models (<b>9250</b>); (6) selective filtering (<b>9263</b>); and (7) blanking of SG (<b>9255</b>, <b>9260</b>).</p><p id="p-0819" num="0806">The processing of the raw Isig signal may use a unified and simplified function to handle several anomalies such as artifacts and noisy signals. In addition, signal smoothing (<b>9220</b>) may be accomplished by using a polynomial model for local regression with weighted linear least squares. Effects of outliers are reduced by assigning less weight. Retrospective processing allows local regression to be done with forward and backward data, with the smoothing having no phase delay as seen in most real-time filtering. Following the smoothing, noise calculation is performed. Noise calculation (<b>9225</b>) is based on evaluating the difference between the raw and smoothed signal and calculating the percentage of data within a defined window that has high noise-to-signal ratio. EIS data may also be smoothed using a similar retrospective smoothing function (<b>9235</b>). After smoothing of the EIS data, the EIS data may then be interpolated to generate EIS data that match the timestamps of the Isig data.</p><p id="p-0820" num="0807">In one embodiment, discrete wavelet transform may be applied on the raw Isig signals (<b>9215</b>). The transform operation decomposes the Isig signal into several predefined levels. At each level, the algorithm generates the coefficients for approximation and detail signals, where the approximations are the high-scale, low-frequency components of the signal, and the details are the low-scale, high-frequency components of the signal. For the approximation signals, the lower level approximation captures the short-term variations and the higher-level approximation captures the long-term trend. Discrete wavelet transform may also be used as a valuable tool in identifying regions with sensitivity loss in the signal.</p><p id="p-0821" num="0808">Machine learning techniques may be used, e.g., for generating the models for converting signals into SG values (<b>9240</b>) as a function of measured signals (e.g., Isig, Vcntr, EIS, etc.). In embodiments, three specific techniques may be used, including genetic programming (GP), artificial neural network (NN), and regression decision tree (DT). To generate the training data set, blood glucose (BG) measurement values and the associated Isig, Vcntr, wavelet and EIS data points are extracted. Preprocessing of the data can also be done to improve the model being generated. Preprocessing steps include reducing the number of data points that are close in time, adjusting the distribution of points within a certain glycemic range to reduce overemphasis at that (BG) range, and removing outliers to reduce/eliminate BG points with high variations.</p><p id="p-0822" num="0809">Genetic programming (GP) is based on rules that imitate biological evolution. Combining basis functions, inputs, and constants creates an initial model population. The models are structured in a tree-like fashion, with basis functions linking nodes of inputs. In each generation (iteration) of the algorithm, relatively successful individuals are selected as &#x201c;parents&#x201d; for the next generation and form a reproduction pool. New generations of solutions evolve, using one of three possible operators: crossover, mutation, and permutation. The procedure is repeated until a stopping criterion is attained.

A neural network model is trained to perform a particular function by adjusting the values of the connections (weights) between elements. The back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm, a multi-layer feedforward network trained according to error back propagation algorithm, may be used, with inputs including, e.g., Isig, Vcntr, EIS, wavelets, duration (i.e., time since sensor insertion), etc., to produce a BG output.</p><p id="p-0831" num="0822">In a decision tree, the model is comprised of several nodes in which splitting of the population occurs and the output is comprised of several regression models.

Initially, a starting tree is built from top down. At each node, a decision is made on a variable and split into subsets. Splitting is based on maximizing the purity of each node. The results at the bottom are the leaves, wherein each leaf is a linear model relating the SG with the input variables.

In practical applications, differences in performance between sensor batches still exist. This is often evident when the performance of batches of sensors are compared over extended time periods. This variability in performance due to variations in manufacturing parameters/processes often means that algorithms for sensor glucose estimation are designed and tested on sensor batches that may have different performance profiles from those of future (i.e., subsequently-manufactured/tested) sensors to which the algorithm may be applied in the field.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>131</b></figref>, in embodiments, this is achieved by characterizing the performance characteristics of the sensors used to build the glucose estimation algorithm (<b>9620</b>), using, e.g., batch-sampling metrics that become standard metrics (<b>9622</b>), and then, for each sensor batch produced afterwards: (1) determining their equivalent performance characteristics (<b>9624</b>); (2) determining deviations from the standard metrics (<b>9626</b>); and (3) determining correction parameters to be applied to mitigate the effect of the deviation and assign the correction parameters to sensors in the batch as factory calibration for each sensor (<b>9628</b>).</p><p id="p-0901" num="0871">In embodiments, the factory calibration focuses on determining a correction factor for each of three key input signals: 1 kHz real impedance, 1 kHz imaginary impedance, and counter voltage (or Vcntr).

The mean, standard deviation and interquartile variances of each distribution is obtained and provided as reference (or standard) metrics (<b>9622</b>). Similar distribution metrics are obtained for each sensor batch that is to be factory calibrated. The factory calibration procedure, in embodiments, involves calculating for each of the three input signals: (a) the difference between the mean of the batch distribution and the mean of the reference distribution; (b) determining the ratio between the batch distribution standard deviation and the reference distribution standard deviation; (c) determining the difference between the interquartile ranges of the batch and reference distributions; and (d) determining the ratios between the interquartile ranges of the batch and reference distributions. These difference and ratio values are the correction parameters that, when applied to inputs from sensors from the sensor batch, can transform them to their equivalent values in the reference distribution.</p><p id="p-0902" num="0872">In embodiments, the four correction factors obtained from each of the key input signals may be together treated as a four-dimensional index of a bin in a 4-by-4-by-4-by-4 matrix, where each dimension corresponds to each correction factor and the bin boundaries are obtained by evenly dividing the experimentally determined maximum and minimum values of each correction factor. For example, the correction factor quartet of 15:0.89:12:0.93 may become: 2:1:2:3. This means that there are at most 16 different configurations of correction factors that can be assigned to sensor batches, and only sixteen correction equations need to be determined for transforming signals from each sensor batch into their equivalent reference signal value. It should be understood that though the indexing structure used in this illustration was a 4-by-4-by-4-by-4 matrix, other indexing structures with more or fewer dimensions and bins per dimension are also possible.</p><p id="p-0903" num="0873"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>132</b></figref> shows an embodiment in which various modules (shown as blocks) of an algorithm, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, are designed to correct for the time-varying change in sensor sensitivity using an optional factory calibration mechanism.

If valid, the factor is converted into a weight metric that is specific to the features used by the glucose estimation algorithm (<b>9652</b>). In embodiments, the conversion to a weight metric is accomplished by using calibration scales such as those depicted, e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>125</b> and <b>126</b></figref>. Thus, each of, e.g., Isig, EIS values, and Vcntr will have a respective weight metric associated therewith (see Block <b>9632</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>132</b></figref>). Next, for each input sensor feature, the feature is weighted by the respective weight metric (<b>9654</b>), that is, those from block <b>9652</b>, and the resulting value is clamped to a pre-defined acceptable correction range (<b>9656</b>). In embodiments, acceptable correction ranges are defined so that applying the factory calibration weight metric to the input features does not result in feature values beyond the natural range of the input features, and the result is sent to the one or more glucose estimation modules implemented by the algorithm (<b>9658</b>). For example, the median value of an input feature, in embodiments, was experimentally observed to be 0.52, with a range of 0.4 to 0.6, but SG producing units could work within a range of 0.25 to 0.95. In embodiments, the acceptable correction range may be a multiplication factor between 1.0 and 1.58 to reduce the chance of a calibration producing a feature value outside the device range.</p><p id="p-0906" num="0876">In an embodiment of the invention, the activation sequence of the sensor involves pairing the glucose estimation algorithm with the factory parameters. In another embodiment, the factory parameters are auto-encoded into the sensor's transmitter and automatically activated upon activation of the sensor prior to use.</p><p id="p-0907" num="0877">In one embodiment, the generation of the factory calibration metrics involves analyzing all the input sensor characteristic features to the SG calculation for fitness. From sensor data collected from a plurality of sensors, pairs of points separated by: (a) a single measurement period (e.g., five minutes in this case); (b) a single day; and (c) up to 5 days may be selected and their differences evaluated.</p><p id="p-0908" num="0878"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>134</b></figref> shows histograms of the differences in sensor values obtained for each of the above-mentioned time periods, where <b>9661</b> is the plot for data collected over a period of up to 5 days, <b>9663</b> is the plot for data collected over a single day, and <b>9665</b> is the plot for data collected for a plurality of single measurements over successive time periods, e.g., every five minutes. The results for this sensor characteristic feature show that the histograms (i.e., plots) all share the same median value. This indicates that the values may originate from a consistent probability distribution and that the feature shows consistent performance and may be a good candidate for use as a factory calibration metric. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>135</b></figref> shows the corresponding histograms for a sensor characteristic feature whose distributions are not uniform, where <b>9671</b> is the plot for data collected over a period of up to 5 days, <b>9673</b> is the plot for data collected over a single day, and <b>9675</b> is the plot for data collected for a plurality of single measurements over successive time periods. As can be seen, it is unlikely that the values originate from the same probability distribution in this case, such that the feature here would not be a good candidate for use as a factory calibration metric.</p><p id="p-0909" num="0879">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, feature selection is limited to features with acceptable histograms. Each feature may further be put through a perturbation analysis, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>136</b></figref>. Here, the input sensor signal <b>9680</b> may be combined with a noise value <b>9682</b> that is derived from a distribution of possible noise values retrospectively observed from signals collected, e.g., from a clinical study. The combined signal <b>9684</b>, and in parallel to it the original signal, are independently passed through blocks that implement the SG calculation, i.e., the sensor algorithm. The outputs from the two separate blocks are subtracted and the difference <b>9686</b> is the observed signal response to input perturbation.</p><p id="p-0910" num="0880"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>137</b></figref> shows an idealized response to perturbation, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>138</b></figref> shows an actual perturbation response plot obtained for an example set of sensor characteristic features. The features are ranked according to the span of the graph below a fixed performance threshold. In a preferred embodiment, the threshold may be set, e.g., at 0.2. The threshold is set at a level that represents the maximum expected range of noise that is expected to be naturally present in the sensing system.</p><p id="p-0911" num="0881">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>137</b></figref> shows the normalized response to perturbation for typical sensor characteristic features used as factory calibration input, including, e.g., signal in (Isig) <b>9711</b>, Vcntr <b>9713</b>, and 1 kHz real impedance <b>9715</b>. It has been discovered that features that are robust to manufacturing variability and, as such, require a relatively lesser degree of tighter controls, tend to have large spans below the threshold <b>9710</b>. In this regard, they are best suited for use as factory calibration metrics. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>137</b></figref>, whereas 1 kHz real impedance <b>9715</b>, e.g., exhibits less of a need for tighter controls, Isig <b>9711</b> exhibits more of a need for tighter controls. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>138</b></figref> shows an actual set of results of perturbation analysis for determining the best features to be used for factory calibration, including the following features: Isig <b>9717</b>; 128 Hz real impedance <b>9719</b>; 1 kHz imaginary impedance <b>9721</b>; Vcntr <b>9723</b>; and Isig moving average <b>9725</b>. In this example, the 1 kHz imaginary impedance is the best feature to use for factory calibration because it displays the least amount of change across the signal change (due to input perturbation) range.</p><p id="p-0912" num="0882">In a preferred embodiment, the means and standard deviations of the best ranked features may be set as the standard metric for the factory calibration. Determining the batch sampling metric involves a similar process as determining the standard metrics. Generating factory calibration data involves determining a mathematical transformation that can modify the histograms of data generated from each batch to make them similar to the histograms of the data used to generate the standard metric. Application of the standard metric involves applying this transformation to the data generated when the sensor is in operation.</p><p id="p-0913" num="0883">In embodiments of the invention, the algorithm may be implemented on existing CGM platforms. An embodiment allows for use with hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems. Another embodiment allows for use in stand-alone CGM systems. In the former embodiment, the system may have transmitters that communicate with an insulin pump supporting a HCL algorithm via a proprietary radio-frequency protocol. In the latter embodiment, the communication protocol may be, e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy Technology that is supported through a mobile device display application. When supporting an HCL system, the transmitter may include logic to ensure sensor values reliably support insulin dosing.</p><p id="p-0914" num="0884">As has been previously discussed, in a normally operating glucose sensor, measured current, Isig is designed to be proportional to measured glucose concentration (SG), thus</p><p id="p-0915" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Measured Glucose=Calibration Factor&#xd7;(Measured Current+offset)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0916" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>and<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0917" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Calibration Factor=Base Calibration Factor&#xd7;Baseline Adjustment.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0918" num="0885">As will be explored further hereinbelow, a theory-based glucose sensor model based on sensor fundamentals can be built piece-by-piece from learnings from in-vitro and in-vivo experimentation with sensors focused on deciphering the components of the base calibration factor, the baseline adjustment and the offset component. In contrast to some of the models based on machine learning methods previously described, the analytical optimization model that results from the piecewise evaluation of the effect of various processes on sensor chemistry and subject physiology is comprehensible, modularized, easier to explain to regulatory bodies and complements models developed through machine learning and other approaches.</p><p id="p-0919" num="0886">The underlying assumption is that the role of input features such as the full suite of real and imaginary impedance values and counter voltage values is to correct for errors from the expected linear glucose/current relationship that is due to physiology, bio-fouling, sensitivity loss, sensor variation and other aberrant processes. Thus, a methodology for estimating the output sensor glucose value of a glucose sensor by analytically optimizing input sensor signals including sensor current, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, counter voltage and sensor age, measured as time from sensor insertion or another sensor wear milestone, may be described to accurately correct for changes in sensitivity, run-in time, glucose current dips, and other variable sensor wear effects, thereby helping to achieve the goal of improved accuracy and reliability without the need for blood-glucose calibration.</p><p id="p-0920" num="0887">In embodiments, the base calibration factor is the primary estimate of the sensor sensitivity, modeled by medium frequency real impedance input features.
