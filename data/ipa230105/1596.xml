In recent times, during the late 19<sup>th </sup>century, an art reform &#x26; social movement led by skilled tradesmen was slowly starting to be recognized by many people across America, Canada, Great Britain and Australia. This movement has often been referred to as the &#x201c;arts-and-crafts movement.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The so-called arts-and-crafts movement that began many years ago has continued to evolve today by many persons that may not necessarily be skilled in a particular trade. As such, it may be said that non-skilled persons may be involved in the arts-and-crafts as a social activity or hobby. In some circumstances, the activity or hobby may be practiced for any number of reasons ranging from, for example: economic gain, gifting, or simply to pass time while finding a sense of personal fulfillment, achievement, satisfaction, and expression.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With advances in modern technology, the &#x201c;arts-and-Crafts Movement&#x201d; that began many years ago is susceptible to further advancements that may enhance or improve, for example, the way a skilled or non-skilled person may contribute to arts-and-crafts. Therefore, a need exists for the development of improved components, devices and the like that advance the art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One category of devices being developed and improved are electronic cutting machines, which may also be referred to as vinyl cutters or cutters in general. Currently available electronic cutting machines fall short in a number of aspects affecting user experience and enjoyment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, typical cutting machines are big and heavy, taking up large areas of table/counter surfaces, such as of crafting table surfaces, during use. These machines can be frustrating to use for those who need space for other tools and supplies on a crafting table alongside the cutting machine.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Current cutting machines are sized such that lifting and transporting the machine can be difficult. Because transporting and setting up these machines is burdensome, users often leave these machines out indefinitely in their place without moving them or storing them out of sight between uses.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Cutting machine manufacturers are constantly trying to simplify user interface features to make their machines easy to use for novice crafters and those just starting out in the arts-and-craft movement. Despite this, user interface features of current cutting machines remain complicated and often non-intuitive, which discourages users, especially less experienced crafters, from realizing the full potential of their cutting machines.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, there are a number of problems in the art that can be addressed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the above independent implementations of the present disclosure, and those implementations described in the detailed description below, may include any of the features, options, and possibilities set out in the present disclosure and figures, including those under the other independent implementations, and may also include any combination of any of the features, options, and possibilities set out in the present disclosure and figures.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional features and advantages of exemplary implementations of the present disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of such exemplary implementations. The features and advantages of such implementations may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or may be learned by the practice of such exemplary implementations as set forth hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The details of one or more implementations of the disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

In particular, the present disclosure relates to miniaturized electronic cutting machines and provides technical solutions to a number of technical problems in the art discussed above.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, in one aspect of the cutting machines disclosed herein, the machines are small enough to be stored on a counter or table surface, such as a crafting table surface, while maximizing space available for other crafting tools and supplies.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Alternatively, the cutting machines described herein can be easily placed within a standard sized drawer or cupboard within a home for convenient storage. Along these lines, the cutting machines described herein are small and light weight so as to be easily moved from one place to another. The cutting machines described herein are thus portable and easy to set up and take down before and after use.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, in one aspect of the cutting machines described herein, the machines are simple to use with minimal or no user interface buttons or complications. Accordingly, the cutting machines of the present disclosure are readily usable by experienced crafters and novices alike.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Example configurations will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. Example configurations are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those of ordinary skill in the art. Specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of configurations of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example configurations may be embodied in many different forms, and that the specific details and the example configurations should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b></figref>, implementations of the present disclosure relate generally to a cutting machine <b>10</b>, components thereof, and methods of use. The cutting machine <b>10</b> includes an outer housing <b>12</b> and a door <b>14</b>. The door <b>14</b> may be arranged in one of a closed orientation (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and an open configuration (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, and <b>3</b></figref>). When the door <b>14</b> is arranged in the open configuration, a workpiece (see, e.g., workpiece <b>100</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>24</b></figref> that may be defined by an upper layer of workpiece material <b>102</b> and a lower layer of workpiece support material <b>104</b>) to be inserted into the cutting machine <b>10</b>. The door <b>14</b> may be selectively opened and closed via a hinge mechanism (not shown) where the door <b>14</b> is connected to outer housing <b>12</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b>. As seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>3</b></figref> a plurality of exemplary internal cutting components of the cutting machine <b>10</b> may include, for example, one or more of a carriage <b>16</b>, a roller assembly <b>18</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The workpiece (e.g., workpiece <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>) that is to be fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b> is at least partially supported on a working surface <b>13</b> as a tool <b>38</b> impinges thereon. In some configurations, an upwardly-facing surface of the door <b>14</b> can also define or act as another portion of the working surface <b>13</b> supporting the workpiece <b>100</b> that is fed through the cutting machine <b>10</b>. As the workpiece <b>100</b> is fed forward-and-backward by the roller assembly <b>18</b>, the carriage <b>16</b>, which manipulates the tool <b>38</b>, such as, for example, a cutting blade, selectively impinges downwardly onto the workpiece <b>100</b>. The carriage <b>16</b> can also move back-and-forth across the workpiece <b>100</b> to form one or more cuts (see, e.g., cut C at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>) at any region of the workpiece <b>100</b>. Although a tool <b>38</b> is shown at, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref> as being a cutting tool <b>38</b> (e.g., a blade), the cutting machine <b>10</b> is not limited to the tool <b>38</b> including a cutting blade, and, as such, other tools may also be secured to and manipulated by the carriage <b>16</b>. For example, in some configurations, the cutting tool <b>38</b> may be replaced with another tool, such as, for example, a scoring tool, an ink pen, or other tool configured to add to, take away from, or otherwise alter the upper layer of workpiece material <b>102</b> of the workpiece <b>100</b> as the workpiece <b>100</b> is fed through the cutting machine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some instances, the roller assembly <b>18</b> may move the workpiece <b>100</b> forward-and-backward in the Y-direction as the carriage <b>16</b> moves back and forth laterally in the X-direction. The X-direction and the Y-direction described above may be reference from an X-Y-Z coordinate system seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some implementations, the tool <b>38</b> may be housed within, contained within, or movably-manipulated by the carriage <b>16</b> upwardly-and-downwardly in a vertical direction (i.e., a Z-direction) relative to the working surface <b>13</b> and the workpiece <b>100</b>. The Z-direction is also referenced from the X-Y-Z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the outer housing <b>12</b> defines a pass-through slot <b>20</b> that allows the workpiece <b>100</b> being cut or fed through the cutting machine <b>10</b> to pass through the cutting machine <b>10</b> without limiting a length (see, e.g., length L<sub>100 </sub>of the workpiece <b>100</b> at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>24</b></figref>) of the upper layer of workpiece material <b>102</b> of the workpiece <b>100</b> being cut by the cutting machine <b>10</b>. During operation, upper layer of workpiece material <b>102</b> of the workpiece <b>100</b> being cut can pass into and out of the pass-through slot <b>20</b>, as needed, depending on the length L<sub>100 </sub>of the workpiece <b>100</b> and the pattern being cut C (see, e.g., cut C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>) into the upper layer of workpiece material <b>102</b> of the workpiece <b>100</b>. Thus, embodiments of the cutting machine <b>10</b> described herein may include internal cutting components and other operating components such as, for example, motors (i.e., a Z-direction motor <b>30</b>, an X-direction motor <b>32</b>, and a Y-direction motor <b>34</b>), gears, belts, and other electronics, arranged so as to not interfere with the workpiece <b>100</b> passing all the way through the cutting machine <b>10</b> during use.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some configurations, the cutting machine <b>10</b> of the present disclosure may be sized in a &#x201c;miniaturized&#x201d; fashion such that the cutting machine <b>10</b> is sized in a manner to define a small, compact form for ease of use. Accordingly, the terms &#x201c;compact,&#x201d; &#x201c;miniaturized,&#x201d; &#x201c;small,&#x201d; &#x201c;portable,&#x201d; or other similar terms used herein to describe the size of cutting machine <b>10</b> are not meant as limiting; rather, these terms are used to reference electronic cutting machines generally appropriate for individual consumer use within a home or workplace. As such, the cutting machine <b>10</b> of the present disclosure are may be light weight, portable, and easily operated by an untrained person.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Dimensions described herein with reference to the cutting machine <b>10</b> are given only as examples of the general size and scale of the cutting machine <b>10</b>. For instance, by way of a non-limiting example, at least one embodiment of the cutting machine <b>10</b> described herein may have the following dimensions; accordingly, as seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>: a height H of about (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 3-to-6 inches; a width W of about (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 6-to-10 inches; and a depth D of about (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 4-to-6 inches. The referenced dimensions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are non-limiting and meant to give only an exemplary scale of the cutting machine <b>10</b> described herein. One or more other embodiments of the cutting machine <b>10</b> may deviate from any or all of the above-referenced dimension while providing a portable, light weight, consumer-friendly cutting machine <b>10</b> appropriate for arts-and-craft applications, which include all the advantages of miniaturization noted herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>, the cutting machine <b>10</b> may be mostly, if not completely, void of any user interface buttons or screens. In some configurations, the cutting machine <b>10</b> is configured to be controlled remotely, for example, from a computer or mobile device, via wired and/or wireless communication methods. In this way, the cutting machine <b>10</b> simplifies the user's experience and presents a clean, aesthetically pleasing device.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>3</b></figref>, because the cutting machine <b>10</b> is configured with such a relatively small form factor, the design of the cutting machine <b>10</b> maximizes available cutting space of a cavity <b>22</b> defined by the outer housing <b>12</b>. The cavity <b>22</b>, as referred to herein, may be generally defined by a lateral dimension along which the tool <b>38</b> secured within or supported by the carriage <b>16</b> can cut or otherwise manipulate the workpiece <b>100</b> that is fed into the cutting machine <b>10</b>. A front view of the cutting machine <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with the door <b>14</b> arranged in the open orientation reveals a lateral dimension or lateral limit of the cavity <b>22</b> that may define a lateral cutting area. Accordingly, the cavity <b>22</b> represents the limitations of a lateral (X-direction) space into which the workpiece <b>100</b> may be inserted and subjected to manipulation (e.g., cutting) by the tool <b>38</b> secured within or supported by the carriage <b>16</b>. In order to maximize the lateral cutting area that is limited by the available space associated with the cavity <b>22</b>, the internal components (e.g., including motors (i.e., a Z-direction motor <b>30</b>, an X-direction motor <b>32</b>, and a Y-direction motor <b>34</b>), gears, shafts, electronics, and other components) are arranged in such a way so as to minimize a thickness T of a left side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b> and a right-side portion <b>24</b>, respectively, of the outer housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the outer housing <b>12</b> is removed in order to illustrate an exemplary configuration of a plurality of internal components of the cutting machine <b>10</b>. As shown, in order to minimize the thickness T of the right-side portion <b>24</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b> and the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>, some of the more voluminous or larger components of the plurality of internal components of the cutting machine <b>10</b>, such as, for example, motors (i.e., a Z-direction motor <b>30</b>, an X-direction motor <b>32</b>, and a Y-direction motor <b>34</b>), circuit boards, and drive gears are disposed rearwardly (i.e.: (1) away from the door <b>14</b>, which is located near the front side of the cutting machine <b>10</b>; and (2) behind the carriage <b>16</b> rather than being disposed laterally within the right-side portion <b>24</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b> and the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some configurations, the cutting machine <b>10</b> may include a plurality of motors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> (e.g., three motors defined by, for example, a Z-direction motor <b>30</b>, an X-direction motor <b>32</b>, and a Y-direction motor <b>34</b>) that are disposed behind the carriage <b>16</b> and separated by an interior housing or wall portion <b>36</b> of the cutting machine <b>10</b>. As seen at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the plurality of motors include a motor for actuation in each direction of the three directions associated with the X-Y-Z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. For example, a first motor <b>30</b> (i.e., a &#x201c;Z-direction motor&#x201d;) is configured to actuate the carriage <b>16</b> in the Z-direction of the X-Y-Z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> via one or more gears, belts, and shafts. In a further example, a second motor <b>32</b> (i.e., an &#x201c;X-direction motor&#x201d;) is configured to actuate the carriage <b>16</b> in the X-direction of the X-Y-Z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> via one or more gears, belts, and shafts. In yet another example, a third motor <b>34</b> (i.e., a &#x201c;Y-direction motor&#x201d;) is configured to actuate the carriage <b>16</b> in the Y-direction of the X-Y-Z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> via one or more gears, belts, and shafts. More detail regarding the specific components that transfer the rotation from the shaft of the Z-direction motor <b>30</b> to vertical actuation of the carriage <b>16</b> will be given hereafter; however it is simply noted here that the relatively bulky Z-direction motor <b>30</b> itself is disposed behind the carriage <b>16</b> and less bulky gears, belts, and other components that transfer motion to the carriage <b>16</b> are arranged within the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>. Because such belts, gears, and other components disposed within the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b> and can be arranged flat and relatively co-planar with one another, the thickness T of the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b> is minimized.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The same is true for components disposed within right-side portion <b>24</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>, which, according to some implementations, accommodated gears and belts that transfer rotational motion from Y-direction motor <b>34</b> to the roller assembly <b>18</b> that actuates the workpiece <b>100</b> back-and-forth in the Y-direction of the X-Y-Z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Similar to the Z-direction motor <b>30</b>, the Y-direction motor <b>34</b> is disposed behind the carriage <b>16</b> rather than to the side within one of the right-side portion <b>24</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b> of the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>, thus reducing the lateral (X-direction) form factor of the cutting machine <b>10</b> and maximizing the cutting space of the cavity <b>22</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Likewise, the X-direction motor <b>32</b> is disposed behind the carriage <b>16</b>, with drive gears, belts, and other drive components, which actuate the carriage <b>16</b> back-and-forth laterally in the X-direction of the X-Y-Z coordinate system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, is disposed within the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>. To the extent that one or more components of the plurality of components are disposed within the right-side portion <b>24</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b> and the left-side portion <b>26</b> of the outer housing <b>12</b>, the one or more components of the plurality of components are not necessarily limited as such.
