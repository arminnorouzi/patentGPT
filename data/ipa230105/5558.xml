Therefore, the clock signal generated by a ring oscillator in the semiconductor memory will change with the change of a process, and the signal controlled by this clock signal will also change with the process. As a result, the signal controlled by this clock signal in different semiconductor memories will have a certain error from an expected value in different process corners, and may even exceed a standard requirement.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the specification (SPEC) of a DDR4 chip, the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of an ALERT signal output by a command/address (C/A) bus parity check alert system is specified between 60 ns and 120 ns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a parity check alert circuit of a DDR4 chip. In this circuit design, after a parity check error occurs, a PAR_Error_Flag signal is output to enable a ring oscillator, such that the ring oscillator generates a clock signal CLK with a fixed cycle of T&#x2032;. Then the stage N&#x2032; of a counter is determined according to the SPEC requirement of tPAR_ALERT_PW. Through this circuit design, the parity check alert circuit outputs logic 1 when receiving the PAR_Error_Flag signal, and then outputs logic 0 after the counting of the counter ends, and the final result is the pulse width of the output ALERT signal tPAR_ALERT_PW=T&#x2032;&#xd7;N&#x2032;, T&#x2032; being the cycle of the clock signal generated by the ring oscillator, and N&#x2032; being the stage of the counter.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">However, although the pulse width of the ALERT signal output in this circuit design does not change with the change of the operating frequency of the chip, it will change with the change of a process. In a manufacturing process of semiconductor devices, due to the position difference on a same wafer, or the difference in the parameters of field-effect transistors between different batches of wafers, there will be variations. Such variations are called process corners. The process corners are generally divided into three process corners, i.e., slow-slow (SS), typical-typical (TT), and fast-fast (FF). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a pulse width variation of an ALERT signal in different process corners. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the case of a particularly large process variation, the cycle T&#x2032; of a clock signal CLK generated by a ring oscillator will be very different. For example, in an FF process corner, the cycle T&#x2032; of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively small, while in an SS process corner, the cycle T&#x2032; of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively large. Under the amplification of the stage N&#x2032; of a counter, finally the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of an ALERT signal in the SS process corner would easily exceed the 60 ns-120 ns range specified by the SPEC, while the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the ALERT signal in the FF process corner would also be easily smaller than the 60 ns-120 ns range specified by the SPEC.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of this application provide a signal generation circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a signal generation circuit provided by embodiments of this application.

This signal generation circuit can be widely used in semiconductor memories, such as DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR2, and LPDDR3, which will not be listed here.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The clock module <b>310</b> provided by the embodiments of this application includes a ring oscillator. When the flag signal changes from the first level to the second level, the ring oscillator generates the clock signal. In the embodiments of this application, the ring oscillator is used to generate the clock signal as an internal clock signal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiments of this application, the control module <b>320</b> includes a process monitor <b>321</b> and an arithmetic unit <b>322</b>, where the process monitor <b>321</b> is configured to output a process monitor code representing the number of transitions of the clock signal within a fixed time; and the arithmetic unit <b>322</b> is configured to receive the process monitor code, multiply the process monitor code by a coefficient and then output as the control signal. In the embodiments of this application, the control signal is obtained by multiplying the process monitor code by the coefficient.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Here, the process monitor code is a parameter representing the number of transitions of the clock signal within a fixed time in a test mode. Because the number of transitions of the clock signal within a fixed time will change with the change of a process, the process monitor code will also change with the change of the process. Specifically, different chips on a same wafer or a same batch of wafers can have different process corners, therefore, the frequencies/cycles of the clock signals of these chips with different process corners will be different, and therefore, the process monitor codes representing the number of transitions of the clock signal within a fixed time will also be different. In the embodiments of this application, such a difference caused by different process corners is called as a change with a process. In the embodiments of this application, the pulse width of the target signal is adjusted by using the change of the process monitor code with the process and the change of the clock signal with the process to control the pulse width of the target signal within a certain range, so as to reduce or eliminate the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the process, thereby stabilizing the pulse width of the target signal.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The frequency of the clock signal decreases with the change of the process, in other words, the cycle of the clock signal increases with the change of the process. Therefore, when the frequency of the clock signal decreases or the cycle of the clock signal increases, the number of transitions of the clock signal within a fixed time will decrease. In this way, the process monitor code will also decrease with the change of the process. Moreover, the control signal is a signal obtained by multiplying the process monitor code by a coefficient, and therefore, the control signal will also decrease with the change of the process. The change of the process is a change from an FF process corner to an SS process corner.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a specific implementation mode, when the signal generation circuit is applied to a DDR4 chip, the process monitor <b>321</b> is configured to output a process monitor code P; and the arithmetic unit <b>322</b> is configured to receive the process monitor code P, multiply the process monitor code by a coefficient N and then output as the control signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a trend diagram of the change of a process monitor code with a process provided by embodiments of this application. The process monitor code P represents the number of transitions of the clock signal within a fixed time, the process monitor code P decreases with the change of the process, the trend of the change of the process monitor code P with the process is opposite to the trend of the change of the cycle of the clock signal with the process, and therefore, the control signal generated based on the process monitor code P can effectively compensate for the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the process.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, the coefficient N is an amplification coefficient of the process monitor code. In actual application, the corresponding coefficient N can be selected according to the actual pulse width of the target signal. Here, the stage of a counter is a target value N&#xd7;P represented by the control signal. In the embodiments of this application, the process monitor code P decreases with the change of the process, such that the target value represented by the control signal decreases with the change of the process. The change of the process is a change from an FF process corner to an SS process corner.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Here, the control signal is a counter stage selection signal of the counter, and the counter can determine its stage according to the control signal, so as to perform counting based on the stage.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiments of this application, the flag signal is a check flag signal, and the check flag signal is used for representing a parity check error or a redundancy check error.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiments of this application, the generation module <b>330</b> includes a counter. When the flag signal changes from the first level to the second level, the counter starts to count the clock signal, and when a count value reaches the target value represented by the control signal, the target signal is controlled to change from the fourth level to the third level. When the flag signal is used to represent a parity check error, after a parity check error occurs, the flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is output. The flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is valid at a high level, such that when the flag signal PAR_Error_Flag changes from a low level to a high level, the generation module controls the target signal to change from a low level to a high level. Meanwhile, the counter starts to count the clock signal, and when the count value reaches the target value represented by the control signal, the target signal is controlled to change from the high level to the low level.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the flag signal is used to represent a parity check error. After a parity check error occurs, the check flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is output. Then the target signal generated with the generation module is a parity check alert signal ALERT. Therefore, the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal can be adjusted through the signal generation circuit provided by the embodiments of this application to control the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal within a certain range, so as to reduce or eliminate the change of the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal with the process, thereby stabilizing the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal within the range specified by the SPEC.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be noted that the ALERT signal here is not a signal that is finally output through an alert_n pin, and the ALERT signal needs to pass through several inverters or output buffer circuits before it is output to the alert_n pin of the chip. In a specific example, the ALERT signal can be output to the alert_n pin of the chip after passing through an odd number of inverters, so as to ensure that the alert_n signal output by the alert_n pin is valid at a low level.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Here, the stage of the counter is the target value N&#xd7;P represented by the control signal. If the cycle of the clock signal is T, the target duration (the pulse width of the target signal) is T&#xd7;N&#xd7;P. The trends of the changes of P and T with the process are opposite. Therefore, the target duration (the pulse width of the target signal) hardly changes with the change of the process, in other words, the target duration (the pulse width of the target signal) is stabilized within the range specified by the SPEC in different processes. The change of the process is a change from an FF process corner to an SS process corner.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a trend diagram of the change of the cycle of a clock signal with a process provided by embodiments of this application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a trend diagram of the change of a target duration with a process provided by embodiments of this application.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in an FF process corner, the cycle T of a clock signal CLK generated by a ring oscillator is relatively small, but a target value N&#xd7;P (the stage of a counter) represented by a control signal is relatively large. In an SS process corner, the cycle T of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively large, but the target value N&#xd7;P (the stage of the counter) represented by the control signal is relatively small. Therefore, the pulse width of the finally output ALERT signal does not change much in an FF process corner and an SS process corner. That is, under the joint control of the clock signal and the control signal, the pulse width of the target signal can be controlled within a certain range, so as to reduce or eliminate the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the process, thereby stabilizing the pulse width of the target signal within the range specified by the SPEC.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the embodiments of this application, the first level is a low level, the second level is a high level, the third level is a low level, and the fourth level is a high level. Then when the flag signal changes from a low level to a high level, the target signal changes from a low level to a high level, and after being maintained at the high level for a target duration, the target signal changes from the high level to the low level. Here, if the flag signal is a check flag signal, the check flag signal is valid at the high level. When the check flag signal is at the high level, it is indicated that a check error has occurred; and when the check flag signal is at the low level, it is indicated that no check error has occurred. In the embodiments of this application, the target duration is determined according to the cycle of the clock signal and the target value represented by the control signal, and the trends of the changes of the cycle of the clock signal and the target value represented by the control signal with the process are opposite.
