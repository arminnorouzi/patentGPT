First, in some implementations, a user looking at one side of the display, in addition to seeing an image intended for him or her, can also see an image intended for a user on the opposite side of the display, and the two images may overlap and interfere with each other, impairing the clarity of the intended image. This is sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;occlusion&#x201d; problem. Second, in some implementations, a user looking at one side of the display, in addition to seeing an image intended for him or her, can also see a backward (horizontally flipped) image intended for a user on the opposite side of the display, causing distraction or confusion, whether the reversed image overlaps with the intended image or not. This is sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;obversion&#x201d; problem. Third, in some implementations, light is intentionally blocked between the two sides of the display to avoid occlusion and obversion, resulting in a dark region delineating an image intended for a user on either side of the display. This is sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;obstruction&#x201d; problem.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various embodiments described herein overcome these shortcomings of conventional dual-sided display panels to provide a true dual-sided transparent display panel. One principle underlying the embodiments described herein is that light propagating through a waveguide becomes visible only when it is scattered (e.g., refracted). This principle is employed in conjunction with an edge-lighted design to provide a dual-sided transparent display panel that displays images independently on both sides of the display panel without occlusion, obversion, or obstruction. That is, a user on one side of the transparent display can view an image intended for him or her at the same time another user on the opposite side of the transparent display views an image intended for that other user, and neither user sees the image (reversed or otherwise) intended for the user on the opposite side. Instead, the portions of the display panel not containing an image intended for a user looking at the applicable side of the display panel appear transparent to that user, and the same applies to a user looking at the opposite side of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, it illustrates the exterior side of a vehicle smart window <b>105</b> that includes a dual-sided transparent display panel, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a user (e.g., a car-sharing customer) is about to enter a vehicle (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), and the vehicle smart window <b>105</b> prompts the user, via displayed outside image <b>110</b>, to enter a rider code to gain entry. In this embodiment, vehicle smart window <b>105</b> can, at the same time, display a completely different image (inside image <b>115</b>, a passenger-verification message) to one or more occupants inside the vehicle, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A vehicle smart window <b>105</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, is merely one example of a variety of applications for a dual-sided transparent display panel. Other applications include, without limitation, a smart store window (e.g., to display advertising outside the store, direct customers inside the store to products of interest, etc.), informational kiosks at airports and bus stations, education, and gaming/entertainment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional diagram a first embodiment of a dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b>. This embodiment includes a first layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>a </i>and a second layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>b</i>, each of which has an inner surface (the surface closest to the axis of symmetry of the waveguide <b>210</b>) and an outer surface (the surface farthest from the axis of symmetry just mentioned). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, waveguide <b>210</b> is disposed between the inner surface of the first layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>a </i>and the inner surface of the second layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, waveguide <b>210</b> is made of glass.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> also includes a first grating coating <b>215</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the outer surface of the first layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>a </i>and a second grating coating <b>215</b><i>b </i>adjacent to the outer surface of the second layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>b</i>. In one embodiment, the first and second grating coatings (<b>215</b><i>a </i>and <b>215</b><i>b</i>) are periodic grating coatings that include alternating diffusive and plain-glass regions.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> also includes light sources <b>225</b> along an edge of waveguide <b>210</b> that is perpendicular to the inner and outer surfaces of the first and second layers of electro-optic material (<b>205</b><i>a </i>and <b>205</b><i>b</i>). In this embodiment, the light sources include red, green, and blue light sources in accordance with the RGB standard. In some embodiments, the light sources <b>225</b> are lasers. In other embodiments, the light sources <b>225</b> are light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In one embodiment, the LEDs are Micro-LEDs. In the coordinate system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the light sources <b>225</b> are disposed along an edge of waveguide <b>210</b> that runs in the y direction (into and out of the page) and faces the negative z direction. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> is thus edge-lighted by light sources <b>225</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As diagramed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, light emitted from light sources <b>225</b> propagates along waveguide <b>210</b> in the z direction. In this embodiment, the first layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>a </i>and the second layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>b </i>can be, for example, an active liquid-crystal matrix or, in a different embodiment, a passive liquid-crystal matrix. In one embodiment, the first and second layers of electro-optic material (<b>205</b><i>a </i>and <b>205</b><i>b</i>) are thin-film-transistor (TFT) liquid-crystal matrices.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As those skilled in the art are aware, a liquid-crystal matrix is a special type of material that has two different refractive indices, n<sub>e </sub>(extraordinary) and n<sub>o </sub>(ordinary), depending on the electro-optical state of the material. In response to electrical control (e.g., a voltage) from driver circuitry (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the molecules of a liquid-crystal matrix can be caused to orient themselves in an &#x201c;off&#x201d; state or an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the vertical lines in first layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>a </i>and second layer of electro-optic material <b>205</b><i>b </i>delineate the boundaries of rows or columns of pixels (in the y direction) in dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Refer to the legend in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for the &#x201c;on&#x201d; and &#x201c;off&#x201d; states. Pixels with molecules oriented in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; (reflective) state <b>245</b> cause light such as the blue light <b>230</b> to be totally internally reflected within waveguide <b>210</b>. The concept of total internal reflection (TIR) is well known in the waveguide-related art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the oblong-shaped molecules oriented in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; state (<b>245</b>) are oriented substantially parallel to the z-axis (parallel to the direction in which light propagates within waveguide <b>210</b>). Thus, a viewer looking at one of the sides of the dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> in the positive or negative x direction would not see the blue light <b>230</b> at those pixel positions. Pixels with molecules oriented in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; (transmissive) state <b>240</b>, on the other hand, are oriented at an angle relative to the z-axis, permitting light to exit waveguide <b>210</b>, the blue light <b>230</b> mentioned earlier being diffused by first grating coating <b>215</b><i>a </i>to produce diffused and emitted blue light <b>235</b> that is visible to a user looking at dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> in the negative x direction. As those skilled in the art will recognize, the individual pixels can be controlled (i.e., placed in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;off&#x201d; state) using the driver circuitry mentioned above. Importantly, this can be done independently for the two sides of dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> (the side facing the positive x direction and the side facing the negative x direction) to permit different images to be displayed on the two opposite sides of dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> also includes first light-blocking element <b>220</b><i>a </i>and second light-blocking element <b>220</b><i>b</i>. These light-blocking elements prevent light from leaking in the x direction from a predetermined portion (e.g., a rectangular strip) of dual-sided transparent display panel <b>200</b> adjacent to the edge of waveguide <b>210</b> (the perpendicular edge mentioned above) along which light sources <b>225</b> edge-light the display panel. In other words, the light-blocking elements <b>220</b><i>a </i>and <b>220</b><i>b </i>block light that is not totally internally reflected near the edge of the waveguide <b>210</b> closest to the light sources <b>225</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In variations of the first embodiment (the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), a different type of electro-optic material other than a liquid-crystal matrix can be used.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram of a second embodiment of a dual-sided transparent display panel <b>300</b> in an illustrative molecular configuration of the liquid-crystal matrices.

Thus, the molecules in a given panel subassembly (<b>360</b><i>a </i>or <b>360</b><i>b</i>) that are oriented in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; state cause light from light sources <b>225</b> to be reflected by that panel subassembly toward the waveguide <b>210</b> instead of exiting that panel subassembly.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Before discussing a third embodiment of a dual-sided transparent display panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> will be discussed to introduce some of the important principles underlying the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a diagram of beam splitting using circular polarization when the molecules of a liquid-crystal substance are oriented in an &#x201c;off&#x201d; state, in connection with a third embodiment of a dual-sided transparent display panel. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, light with two opposite circular polarizations, counterclockwise-polarized light <b>420</b> and clockwise-polarized light <b>425</b>, enters a nematic liquid-crystal substance <b>405</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the molecules <b>410</b> are oriented in the &#x201c;off&#x201d; state.

With the molecules in this &#x201c;off&#x201d; configuration and the incoming light being polarized in opposite senses (clockwise and counterclockwise or right-handed and left-handed, respectively), the nematic liquid-crystal substance <b>405</b> effectively acts as a beam splitter to direct light toward the separate sides of a dual-sided transparent display panel, depending on how the incoming light is polarized.

In a different embodiment, cholesteric liquid crystals are used instead of nematic liquid crystals. As discussed above, this layer acts as a waveguide with reorientable molecules within it (refer to the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> above) that direct, toward the glass layer <b>515</b><i>a </i>of the first panel subassembly <b>535</b><i>a</i>, light <b>525</b> from one or more light sources that is circularly polarized in a first sense and that direct, toward the glass layer <b>515</b><i>b </i>of the second panel subassembly, light <b>525</b> that is circularly polarized in a second sense that is opposite the first sense.

The driver circuitry, in this embodiment, can control both the state (&#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;off&#x201d;) of the molecules associated with individual pixels and the polarization of the light emitted at the edge of nematic liquid-crystal layer <b>520</b> from one or more light sources, such as the light sources <b>225</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A, and <b>3</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, a single light emitter is used, and the polarization is switched as needed over time to support a dual-sided transparent display panel, but in other embodiments, two emitters (one for each side of the dual-sided transparent display panel) are used. Some possible methods to switch polarizations could include photo elastic modulators, variable retarders (also known as variable wave plates), or fast-switching wave plates. In some embodiments, use can be made of diodes that emit circular polarizations from the light source itself.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the various embodiments discussed above, the refresh cycle of a typical liquid-crystal matrix can be reduced by a factor of three in order to account for the different colors emitted by the light sources <b>225</b>. Mixed colors or multiple colors can be emitted by overlapping the time frames of how long the liquid-crystal matrix is open. One possible order is R, then G, then B. A purple pixel can be created, for example, by mixing red and blue light. Therefore, the length of time the pixel is &#x201c;scattering light to a viewer/user&#x201d; will vary the hue of the purple color. To mix red and blue evenly, the activation time should be equal for the two colors. Also, different types of liquid crystals can be used, depending on the particular embodiment, to achieve different effects. Cholesteric liquid crystals can be used to change the refractive index. This abrupt change in refractive index can cause deflection or scattering out of the flat display panel because of its poly-domain structure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Detailed embodiments are disclosed herein.
