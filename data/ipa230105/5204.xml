In the virtual space <b>1</b>, a photographer <b>2</b> (a photographer character) is disposed, and the camera <b>3</b> is virtually operated by the photographer <b>2</b>. In the animation production system <b>300</b> of this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the user arranges the character <b>4</b> and the camera <b>3</b> while viewing the virtual space <b>1</b> from a bird's eye (Third Person's View), shoots the character <b>4</b> using the FPV (First Person View) as the photographer <b>2</b>, and performs the performance of the character <b>4</b> using the FPV, while producing the animation. In the virtual space <b>1</b>, a plurality of characters <b>4</b> (in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, characters <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>) can be disposed, and the user can perform the performance while possessing a character <b>4</b>. If more than one character <b>4</b> is disposed, the user may also switch the object possessed by each character <b>4</b> (e.g., characters <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>). That is, in the animation production system <b>300</b> of the present embodiment, one can play a number of roles (roles). In addition, since the camera <b>3</b> can be virtually operated as the photographer <b>2</b>, natural camera work can be realized and the representation of the movie to be shot can be enriched.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">General Configuration</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the overall configuration of an animation production system <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.

The information received from the HMD <b>110</b> and/or the controller <b>210</b> regarding the movement of the user's head or the movement or operation of the controller is detected in the control unit <b>340</b> as input content including the operation of the user's position, line of sight, attitude, speech, operation, etc. through the I/O unit <b>320</b> and/or the communication unit <b>330</b>, and a control program stored in the storage unit <b>350</b> is executed in accordance with the user's input content to perform a process such as controlling the character <b>4</b> and generating an image. The control unit <b>340</b> may be composed of a CPU. However, by further providing a GPU specialized for image processing, information processing and image processing can be distributed and overall processing efficiency can be improved. The image generating device <b>310</b> may also communicate with other computing processing devices to allow other computing processing devices to share information processing and image processing.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">The control unit <b>340</b> includes a user input detecting unit <b>410</b> that detects information received from the HMD <b>110</b> and/or the controller <b>210</b> regarding the movement of the user's head, the user's speech, and the movement and operation of the controller, a character control unit <b>420</b> that executes a control program stored in the control program storage unit <b>460</b> for a character <b>4</b> stored in the character data storage unit <b>450</b> of the storage unit <b>350</b>, a camera control unit <b>440</b> that controls a virtual camera <b>3</b> disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b> according to the character control, and an image producing unit <b>430</b> that generates an image in which the camera <b>3</b> captures the virtual space <b>1</b> based on the character control. Here, the movement of the character <b>4</b> is controlled by converting information such as the direction, inclination, and hand movement of the user head detected through the HMD <b>110</b> or the controller <b>210</b> into the movement of each part of the bone structure created in accordance with the movement or restriction of the joints of the human body, and applying the bone structure movement to the previously stored character data. The control of the camera <b>3</b> is performed, for example, by changing various settings for the camera <b>3</b> (for example, the position within the virtual space <b>1</b> of the camera <b>3</b>, the viewing direction of the camera <b>3</b>, the focus position, the zoom, etc.) depending on the movement of the hand of the character <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The storage unit <b>350</b> stores in the aforementioned character data storage unit <b>450</b> information related to the character <b>4</b>, such as the attribute of the character <b>4</b>, as well as the image data of the character <b>4</b>. The control program storage unit <b>460</b> controls the operation and expression of the character <b>4</b> in the virtual space and stores a program for controlling an object such as the camera <b>3</b>. The image data storage unit <b>470</b> stores the image generated by the image producing unit <b>430</b>. In this embodiment, the image stored in the image data storage unit <b>470</b> is considered to be action data for generating a moving image. The action data may include, for example, 3D data for displaying the character <b>4</b> in the virtual space <b>1</b>, pause data for identifying the bone structure of the 3D data, motion data for identifying the movement of the bone structure, and the like. The action data is stored for each character <b>4</b> (or for each object if an object other than character <b>4</b> exists). The action data is accompanied by timing data so that the operation of each character <b>4</b> (and each object) can be synchronized. In addition to the action data, the image producing unit <b>430</b> may register a moving image generated (rendered) based on the action data in the image data storing unit <b>470</b>. Here, the image producing unit <b>430</b> generates a moving image in which the frame rate is different between the character <b>4</b> and an object other than the character <b>4</b> (e.g., a background image). The asset data storage unit <b>480</b> stores the data of an asset that can be located in the virtual space <b>1</b>. Asset data includes CAD data. CAD data can be a three-dimensional model data generated by the CAD (Computer Aided Design) software. The CAD data is accompanied by size data. Asset data also includes image data. The image data may be a moving image or a still image. The user may dispose the image data that is the background image behind the character <b>4</b>. The arrangement of the image data can be performed by placing the plate polygon pasted with the image data as a texture in the virtual space <b>1</b>, either in the case of a moving image or in the case of a still image.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the arrangement of the asset data selected from the asset list <b>6</b> in the virtual space <b>1</b> in the animation production system <b>300</b> according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Asset list <b>6</b> is distributed in virtual space <b>1</b>. The asset list <b>6</b> includes an asset type tab <b>61</b>, an asset item <b>62</b>, and a scroll bar <b>63</b>. The asset type tab <b>61</b> may be, for example, a 3DCG model (ACTOR) of the character <b>4</b>, an operational model (MOVE) of the character <b>4</b> (e.g., shaking, pointing, double-piece, etc.), a voice quality or a specific serif (VOICE) when possessed by the character <b>4</b>, an object (OBJECT) that can be disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b>, a background that can be disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b>, an empty or ground image data (BACK GROUND), or the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The asset item <b>62</b> is modified according to the selection of the asset type tab <b>61</b> to display a list corresponding to each type of asset. The items displayed in this list may be data obtained from a server connected via a network such as a cloud server, for example. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a list of available image data is illustrated, and one example is shown in each item with a thumbnail of the image and a description of the content of the image. However, the list may not be limited thereto, for example, a category of color taste or location may be displayed. Also, when there are many display items, for example, a scroll bar <b>63</b> may slide to allow all items to be identified, a sort such as a fifty-tone order may be possible, or the user's preferences may be learned based on the history of use of the image and the asset may be preferentially displayed in accordance with the user's preferences.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when a user grabs on an asset item <b>62</b> selected by the virtual right-hand <b>21</b>R in the virtual space <b>1</b>, various objects can be drawn therefrom and placed in the virtual space <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">For example, a user can pull out the 3DCG model of the character <b>4</b> and place it in the virtual space <b>1</b>, pulling out other objects, and placing it in the virtual space <b>1</b>. The user may also arrange the camera <b>3</b> in the virtual space <b>1</b> as many as necessary.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Next, the user may arrange the asset of the image data on the ground (a plate polygon pasted with the ground image as a texture; the same shall apply hereinafter) from the asset list <b>6</b> in the virtual space <b>1</b>. In this case, the user may also enlarge or reduce the image data on the ground. Similarly, a user may locate an asset of the background image data from the asset list <b>6</b> in the virtual space <b>1</b> and withdraw an asset of the empty image data from the asset list <b>6</b> in the virtual space <b>1</b>. The user may place these images according to the position of the character <b>4</b> using the virtual right hand <b>21</b>R. For example, when the user disposes the background image model in the virtual space <b>1</b>, the user may grasp both ends of the pulled out background image model by the virtual right hand and left hand in the virtual space <b>1</b>, and extend or decrease the background image model.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">The user may also place a source of wind in the virtual space <b>1</b>. The source of the wind may be selected from the asset list <b>6</b> or the source of the wind disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b> may be moved.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">As described above, the character <b>4</b>, the camera <b>3</b>, the image data on the ground, the background image data, the empty image data, and the source of wind are disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b>, and then the operation can be performed by possessing the camera man <b>2</b> or the character <b>4</b> to produce the animation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">When a user retrieves CAD data from asset list <b>6</b> and places it in virtual space <b>1</b>, the size of the object based on CAD data can be adjusted based on the size data attached to CAD data. In this case, the coordinate system in the virtual space <b>1</b> can be defined and the size (width, height, etc.) of the object based on CAD data can be adjusted according to the length of one unit (e.g., 1 mm or 1 inch) in the coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In addition, when placing CAD data, the size of the object based on CAD data can be adjusted according to the size of the other object. For example, for character <b>4</b>, the height of each character can be set, and the size of the object based on CAD data can be adjusted based on the size of character <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In addition, when the CAD data is a 3D model representing a structure such as a building, when an object based on CAD data is disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b>, the character <b>4</b> can enter the inside of the structure. Again, the size of the structure can be adjusted on the basis of the size of the character <b>4</b> so that the character <b>4</b> is placed in the structure without collision. The size of both the character <b>4</b> and the CAD data may be adjusted according to the length of one unit in the coordinate system of the virtual space <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In addition, the user can fine-tune the operation of the object disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b>. For example, while the character <b>4</b> is being operated based on action data with motion, the fingers, facial expressions, lip scenes, and the like may be edited.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">The user may also retrieve video data from the asset list <b>6</b> and place it in the virtual space <b>1</b>. Here, for example, video data. It may be reproduced on one side of an object, such as a plate polygon. That is, movies can be displayed on the walls (plate polygons) in the virtual space <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In addition, when the movie data is disposed in the virtual space <b>1</b> (when the movie data is displayed on one side of the plate polygon), the FPS (Frames Per Second) can be changed by the movie. For example, for an animation material (movie) in which a character operates, 12 to 15 FPS may be used, and for a movie in which a background image is used, 30 FPS (frame rate of camera <b>3</b>) may be used. This may be set to FPS for the video data itself, or all video data may be stored as 30 FPS or 60 FPS data, so that the FPS may be dropped for a particular movie when the video is played. In the video data, the FPS at playback can be set and stored in advance, and the content of the video can be analyzed dynamically to change the FPS depending on the content (pattern) analyzed. In addition, the FPS with a predetermined low rate and the FPS with a high rate may be switched depending on the operation in the virtual space <b>1</b> or the operation such as the HMD <b>110</b> or the controller <b>210</b>. In addition, the FPS may be changed according to the instruction from the user during playback of the movie.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">It is also possible to change the resolution or FPS of the images displayed on the HMD <b>110</b> (such as images that take a bird's-eye view of the virtual space <b>1</b> or images of the FPV of the character <b>4</b>). For example, the resolution or FPS may be changed to be displayed on the HMD <b>110</b> in response to input from the user.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">As described above, according to the animation production system <b>300</b> of the present exemplary embodiment, a user can arrange a ground image and/or an empty image as well as a background image, and then take a character <b>4</b> with the camera <b>3</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to take a photograph while moving the line of sight of the camera <b>3</b> in the vertical direction without impairing the immersion feeling. Therefore, it is possible to increase the freedom of the camera work and to enrich the expression of the animation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Although the present embodiment has been described above, the above-described embodiment is intended to facilitate the understanding of the present invention and is not intended to be a limiting interpretation of the present invention. The present invention may be modified and improved without departing from the spirit thereof, and the present invention also includes its equivalent.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">For example, in the present embodiment, the image generating device <b>310</b> may be a single computer, but not limited to the HMD <b>110</b> or the controller <b>210</b> may be provided with all or some of the functions of the image generating device <b>310</b>. It may also include a function of a portion of the image generating device <b>310</b> to other computers that are communicatively connected with the image generating device <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">In the present exemplary embodiment, a virtual space based on the virtual reality (VR; Virtual Reality) was assumed. However, the animation production system <b>300</b> of the present exemplary embodiment is not limited to an extended reality (AR; Augmented Reality) space or a complex reality (MR; Mixed Reality) space, but the animation production system <b>300</b> of the present exemplary embodiment is still applicable.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">In the present exemplary embodiment, various buttons <b>64</b> are arranged to direct the purchase, rental, extraction of the assets held, etc., but without using a button <b>64</b>, the object may be pulled from the asset list <b>6</b> and the procedure may be performed to purchase or rent the objects when the drawn objects are not possessed by the user.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the ground image is disposed below the foot of the character <b>4</b>. However, for example, in the case where the image is taken with an angle from the lower side to the upper side of the character <b>4</b>, the ground image may not be disposed, and only the background image and the empty image may be disposed.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0063"><b>1</b> virtual space</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0064"><b>2</b> cameraman</li>        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0065"><b>3</b> cameras</li>        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0066"><b>4</b> characters</li>        <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0067"><b>110</b> HMD</li>        <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0068"><b>120</b> display panel</li>        <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0069"><b>130</b> housing</li>        <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0070"><b>140</b> sensor</li>        <li id="ul0003-0009" num="0071"><b>150</b> light source</li>        <li id="ul0003-0010" num="0072"><b>210</b> controller</li>        <li id="ul0003-0011" num="0073"><b>220</b> left hand controller</li>        <li id="ul0003-0012" num="0074"><b>230</b> right hand controller</li>        <li id="ul0003-0013" num="0075"><b>235</b> grip</li>        <li id="ul0003-0014" num="0076"><b>240</b> trigger button</li>        <li id="ul0003-0015" num="0077"><b>250</b> Infrared LED</li>        <li id="ul0003-0016" num="0078"><b>260</b> sensor</li>        <li id="ul0003-0017" num="0079"><b>270</b> joystick</li>        <li id="ul0003-0018" num="0080"><b>280</b> menu button</li>        <li id="ul0003-0019" num="0081"><b>300</b> Animation Production System</li>        <li id="ul0003-0020" num="0082"><b>310</b> Image Generator</li>        <li id="ul0003-0021" num="0083"><b>320</b> I/O portion</li>        <li id="ul0003-0022" num="0084"><b>330</b> communication section</li>        <li id="ul0003-0023" num="0085"><b>340</b> controller</li>        <li id="ul0003-0024" num="0086"><b>350</b> storage</li>        <li id="ul0003-0025" num="0087"><b>410</b> User Input Detector</li>        <li id="ul0003-0026" num="0088"><b>420</b> character control unit</li>        <li id="ul0003-0027" num="0089"><b>430</b> Image Generator</li>        <li id="ul0003-0028" num="0090"><b>440</b> Camera Control</li>        <li id="ul0003-0029" num="0091"><b>450</b> character data storage section</li>        <li id="ul0003-0030" num="0092"><b>460</b> Program Storage</li>        <li id="ul0003-0031" num="0093"><b>470</b> Image Data Storage</li>        <li id="ul0003-0032" num="0094"><b>480</b> Asset Data Storage</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
