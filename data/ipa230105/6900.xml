In some embodiments, network metrics may include one or more of order rate (e.g. order per minute (OPM), service request rate for multiple services, catalog service response time, checkout service response time, promotion engine service response time, health signals from network components (e.g. CPU, memory, garbage collection rate, lifetime), software signals (e.g. number of exceptions, types of exceptions, number of warnings, type of warnings, health status), network latency of all API calls, network congestion signals, HTTP fetch code, HTTP response code, Network errors, etc. In some embodiments, network data may be aggregated from a plurality of software or hardware components of the network.

In some embodiments, the monitored network comprises an e-commerce server and the network metrics comprise one or more of an e-commerce orders rate from a plurality of e-commerce channels of the e-commerce server, page views, response time, throughput, network latency, network congestion signals, and/or HTTP codes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the system may be configured to automatically detect network incidents such as errors, high latencies, and outages based on network metrics. For example, a substantial and/or unexpected drop in OPM, response time, number of requests, etc. may indicate an incident. In some embodiments, one or more metrics may have an associated threshold and an incident may be detected if one or more metrics exceeds or falls below the corresponding threshold. In some embodiments, the system may also determine the duration of each detected incident based on the collected network metrics. In some embodiments, the incidents may include a severity indicator (e.g. mild, medium, severe), an incident type indicator (e.g. error, high latency, outage), and an associated network component identifier (e.g. checkout service, promotion service, catalog service, application server, POS server, etc.). In some embodiments, the aggregated network data and incidents may be oversampled. In some embodiments, the incidents may be determined by the system based on network metrics and/or manually entered by a network administrator.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In step <b>220</b>, collected network metrics are aggregated over time in a historical network data database. The network data may be aggregated and stored as time-series data. In step <b>222</b>, the system generates a training data set based on the aggregated network metrics and incidents. In some embodiments, the training data set is generated based on oversampling the network metrics and the incident prediction. In some embodiments, the historical network metrics are converted to a 2D space with time and data type as dimensions. An illustration of the network metrics as multiple time series in a 2D space is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the training data set comprises time series of network metrics as training input and incidents as labels. In some embodiments, the labels may further specify the incident type, incident severity, associated component, etc. associated with each network incident. In some embodiments, the training data set may further be generated based on performing anomaly detection and removal on the aggregated network data.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step <b>224</b>, the system trains an incident model using the training data set based on a machine learning algorithm. In some embodiments, the incident model comprises a long-term short memory model (LSTM) trained based on shifting time windows of the time series of network metrics and incidents. In some embodiments, the machine learning algorithm is a recurrent neural network (RRN) algorithm. In some embodiments, the LSTM unknit may comprise a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. In some embodiments, an RNN using LSTM units may be trained in a supervised fashion, on a set of training sequences, using an optimization algorithm, like gradient descent, combined with backpropagation through time to compute the gradients needed during the optimization process, in order to change each weight of the LSTM network in proportion to the derivative of the error (at the output layer of the LSTM network) with respect to corresponding weight. Generally, the incident model is trained to accept network metric time series as input and output incident predictions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>230</b>, the system determines an incident prediction based on the incident model using the real-time network metrics as input. In some embodiments, Time series of real-time network metrics are used as shifting window input of the incident model and the output of the incident model comprises the incident prediction. In some embodiments, the incident prediction comprises a future point in time and a likelihood indicator. The future point in time may be based on the length of the shifting time windows of the LSTM. The likelihood indicator may be based on the prediction confidence level of the LSTM. In some embodiments, the incident prediction comprises an incident type indicator, an incident severity indicator, or an indication of a network component. In some embodiments, an incident type indicator, an incident severity indicator, or an indication of a network component may be based on the type, severity, and associated components of the incidents in the training data set.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In step <b>240</b>, the system provides an incident alert to a user via a user interface. In some embodiments, the alert includes the prediction point in time (e.g. 5 minutes) and likelihood (e.g. 20%). In some embodiments, the alert includes the incident type indicator, the incident severity indicator, or the indication of a network component. In some embodiments, the alert may further include a suggested action determined based on one or more of incident type, incident severity, and one or more associated network components. For example, if the incident is associated with a low checkout service throughput, the recommended action may be to increase CPU, GPU, or memory resources dedicated to the checkout service. In some embodiments, the incident probability may be constantly displayed in a user interface and a possible incident is identified when the incident probability exceeds a threshold. In some embodiments, the system may further generate a pop-up notification, sound alert, or send a message to a mobile device (e.g. via text, email, or application notification) when the incident probability exceeds a threshold.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-C</figref> illustrates an example graphical user interface for providing incident alerts that may be displayed to a user via a user interface device such as the user interface device <b>140</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-C</figref>, line graphs are displayed to show real-time network metrics received at the system. Network metrics include OPM from all channels, network condition, mobile application (e.g. &#x201c;scan-n-go&#x201d; (SnG)) throughput, checkout (CXO) throughput, page views, and promotion engine throughput. Additional network metrics may be included in various embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the incident probability is determined to be at 1.91%, and no likely incident is identified. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the incident probability is identified as 27.47%, and the system identifies that page view indicates possible system failure in 5 minutes. the line graph showing real-time metrics for page views is further highlighted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the incident probability is identified as 55.66%, and the system identifies that the checkout service throughput indicates possible system failure in 5 minutes. In some embodiments, the future point in time in the prediction may begin to count down once a likely incident is identified. In some embodiments, the incident probability, future point in time, and the associated network component may be continuously updated based on real-time network metrics. In some embodiments, the system may simultaneously display a plurality of possible service incident types associated with different components of the network. For example, alerts for CXO throughput and page view may be displayed at the same time for the same time frame. In some embodiments, the incident probability may be displayed for each service incident type and/or may be shown as a combined probability. In some embodiments, the user interface may further display a suggested preventive action based on the incident type, severity, and/or component.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, in step <b>250</b>, the system automatically sends an instruction to at least one component of the network to cause a change at the component of the network based on the incident prediction before a predicted incident time. For example, the system may cause more memory or CPU/GPU to be assigned/released to a service if a predicted incident is associated with the service component's low throughput. In another example, if a predicted incident is associated with low storage space, the system may cause additional storage space to be released to the service. In some embodiments, the automatic action may be retrieved from a lookup table associating incident type and/or component with preventive actions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the system may continuously update the incident model based on the real-time network metric and detected incidents, including the network metrics used to make the prediction. In some embodiments, after a preventive action is taken either manually by an administrator or automatically by the system, the system may further record the action and whether the incident is successfully prevented by the action. The recorded action and subsequent changes in network matric may be used for future preventive action recommendations and/or automatic action.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a process for network incident management is shown. In some embodiments, the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be performed by a processor-based device such as a control circuit executing a set of computer-readable instructions stored on a computer-readable memory. In some embodiments, one or more steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be performed by the computer system <b>110</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> herein or a similar device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the feature engineering stage <b>310</b>, network metrics such as order per minute, service response time, network latency, etc. are aggregated from components of a network into time-series data. Data oversampling is applied to the time-series data to generate a training data set.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the incremental learning stage <b>320</b>, the training data set is used to train an LSTM using a deep neural network algorithm. The model is updated to by new batched data continuously or periodically and undergoes continuous model evaluation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the real-time prediction stage <b>330</b>, real-time metrics in shifting time window are feed into the trained LSTM which outputs the incident prediction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When networks go down, companies are often left scrambling to deal with a wide range of costly consequences. For example, during downtimes of e-commerce systems, customers cannot shop or checkout, leading to loss of revenue. Frequent outages also lead to negative customer experience and brand reputation. Often, the restoration path can be costly and result in a workflow backup. In some embodiments, the methods and systems described herein use machine learning algorithms to detect hidden pattern fluctuations in the system signals and alert the support ahead of time such that preemptive actions can be taken to prevent the whole system from going down.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the systems described herein include three components: feature engineering, incremental learning, and real-time prediction. For the feature engineering, the system aggregates many system metrics like order per minute, service response time, network latency, etc., and converts them into time-series data. In the meantime, data oversampling is used to solve the imbalanced distribution of labels. For the learning process, the system is using Deep Recurrent Neural Network, which is a machine learning algorithm for predicting time-series data. The system further uses incremental learning which allows it to update the model with newly available data. Model evaluation is also performed to improve the incident model's performance. Lastly, in the real-time prediction, real-time metric data in a time window is fed into the model and get a prediction of system failures.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the training data includes a list of historical system metrics with oversampling. These data may be converted to a 2D space with time and data type as dimensions. In some embodiments, historical system metrics include but are not limited to OPM (Order Per Minute) trends, Response time, Network Latency, Network congestion signals, HTTP codes, etc. In some embodiments, the system is configured to monitor thousands of real-time system metrics and automatically respond to the changes which could bring down the e-commerce site.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the system can learn hidden patterns from past retail data and predict failures before they occur. In some embodiments, the system utilizes Deep Neural Network to turn real system metric data into time-series data, and train the model on the past data and real-time data for prediction.
