This is due in part to the technical challenge associated with the alignment of optical components. In particular, the spatial relationship of various optical components, such as lasers, filters, tunable filters, and switches are required to be precisely aligned. Accordingly, an optical bench is often used to provide a platform to facilitate the mounting of these various optical components in precise spatial relationship to each other to achieve optical alignment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, current reconfigurable optical benches that may be used for prototype systems include cage systems and optical breadboard plates, which may have flexible positioning of optical components, or optical cells, such as cylindrical lens cells. However, these types of reconfigurable optical benches trade reconfigurability for precision and reliability. Therefore, they may have limited applicability.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The current optical benches that may provide high precision require significant redesign to accommodate changes in optical requirements and are not reconfigurable. These types of high precision optical benches may include a V-groove base plate. They also have discreet mounting points to achieve the desired high precision placement of the optical components.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite the existence of such configurations, further advancements in optical systems may be desirable in certain applications.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An optical system includes a base having a groove and an adjacent slot therein. The optical system also includes at least one optical cell slidably alignable along the groove, and at least one clamp comprising a lower end and an upper end. The lower end is slidably alignable along the slot and is secured at a set location so that the upper end secures the at least one optical cell along the groove.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The slot may extend parallel to the groove, for example. The at least one clamp may include at least one preloaded fastener arrangement securing the lower end of the clamp to the base. The preloaded fastener may include a bolt, a spring biasing the bolt, and a threaded backing plate within the slot and receiving the bolt. The slot may have an inverted T shape, for example, and the groove may have tapered sidewalls, for example.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The optical system may also include at least one clamp fastener removably securing the upper end to the lower end. The at least one optical cell may include at least one cylindrical lens cell rotatable within the groove upon loosening of the at least one clamp fastener. The lower end of the clamp may have an adjustment tool receiving passageway therein, and the lower end of the clamp may define an alignment fixture receiving slot with adjacent portions of the base.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect relates to a method for making the optical system. The method may include forming a base having a groove and an adjacent slot therein, slidably aligning at least one optical cell along the groove, and slidably aligning a lower end of at least one clamp along the slot to a set location and using an upper end of the at least one clamp to secure the at least one optical cell along the groove.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The lower end of the clamp may have an adjustment tool receiving passageway therein and may define an alignment fixture receiving slot with adjacent portions of the base. The method may also include using an adjustment tool and an alignment fixture in cooperation with the adjustment tool receiving passageway and alignment fixture receiving slot, respectively, to set the clamp to the set location.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an optical system according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged fragmentary view of the optical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of the lower end of the clamp and preloaded fastener arrangement of the optical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of an alignment fixture and an adjustment tool that can be used with the optical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of the optical system being adjusted using the adjustment tool and alignment fixture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view, partially in section, of another embodiment of the optical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method of making an optical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout, and prime notation is used to indicate similar elements in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The optical system described herein and generally designated <b>100</b>, addresses the demand for an opto-mechanical system that can satisfy tightly controlled telecentricity, distortion, and spot size requirements while also having high rigidity and high precision placement. In addition, the optical system <b>100</b> has adjustability to compensate for lens variation from nominal dimensions.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the optical system <b>100</b> includes a base <b>102</b> having a groove <b>104</b> therein with tapered sidewalls <b>105</b><i>a, </i><b>105</b><i>b. </i>A first optical component such as an optical cell <b>106</b><i>a </i>is positioned within the groove <b>104</b> and has an outer periphery in contact with the tapered sidewalls <b>105</b><i>a, </i><b>105</b><i>b. </i>The optical cell <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be a cylindrical lens cell, for example, although in other embodiments the optical cell may be filter, optical source, optical receiver, etc. that is accurately aligned along an optical axis <b>107</b> as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The tapered sidewalls <b>105</b><i>a, </i><b>105</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) have a slanted angle relative to a top surface of the base <b>102</b>. The angle and spacing depends, in part, on a diameter of the alignable optical cells <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that are selected to be used with the optical system <b>100</b>. In addition, the groove <b>104</b> may be V-shaped or truncated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as the optical cells <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>f </i>are not supported by a bottom surface of the groove <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the use of the term V-shaped as used herein should be understood to mean a full V-shaped groove as well as a truncated V-shaped groove as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although the optical system <b>100</b> illustratively comprises five alignable optical cells <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>e, </i>those of skill in the art can appreciate that more or less optical cells may be aligned and secured to the base <b>102</b>. The base <b>102</b> serves to support and precisely align any number of the optical cells along the optical axis <b>107</b>. Accordingly, the base <b>102</b> comprises a rigid material that may be machined to define the groove <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The optical cells <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>e </i>are positioned in spaced relation along the optical axis <b>107</b> and each can be adjusted or aligned with high precision, such as within five to ten microns, for example, as discussed in more detail below. An optical source <b>112</b> is positioned at a first end of the optical system <b>100</b> and an optical target <b>114</b> is positioned at an opposing second end of the optical system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The optical target <b>114</b> may comprise an acoustic-optic modulator, in turn, coupled to an ion trap (not shown), as in a quantum computing device, for example. In another example, the optical target may be a semiconductor mask to perform photolithographic patterning, for example. In still another example, the optical target may be a micromachining workpiece. It should be noted that the optical system <b>100</b> may be used with other optical targets in different embodiments as well.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Examples of acousto-optic modulator devices and similar acousto-optic systems are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,958,710 and 9,958,711; and published U.S. Applications 2018/0173027, 2018/0203265, 2018/0203325, and 2018/0299745, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Accordingly, the optical system <b>100</b> allows work over a large spectrum. The optical system <b>100</b> may accordingly provide advantages with respect to numerous different types of optical targets.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The base <b>102</b> also includes a longitudinally extending slot <b>108</b> adjacent to the groove <b>104</b>. The slot <b>108</b> extends parallel to the groove <b>104</b> and in spaced relation therefrom, and may have an inverted Tshape. As those of skill in the art will appreciate, it should be understood that the slot <b>108</b> may have other shapes as well.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The optical system <b>100</b> includes clamps <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>e </i>for securing the respective optical cells <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>e </i>within the groove <b>104</b> at the respective desired, or set, locations. Each of the clamps <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>e </i>has a lower end and an upper end. For example, clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>includes a lower end <b>118</b><i>a, </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, that is slidably positioned along the slot <b>108</b>, and an upper end <b>116</b><i>a </i>securing the optical cell <b>106</b><i>a </i>along, or partially within, the groove <b>104</b> at the desired, or set, location. The upper end <b>116</b><i>a </i>of the clamp <b>110</b><i>a, </i>for example, extends over the groove <b>104</b> to engage a surface of the optical cell <b>106</b><i>a. </i>A lower surface of the upper end <b>116</b><i>a </i>extending over the groove <b>104</b> illustratively has a beveled edge <b>109</b><i>a </i>configured to matingly engage a concentric groove <b>117</b><i>a </i>defined on the surface of the optical cell <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Clamp fasteners <b>122</b><i>a </i>are used for removably securing the upper end <b>116</b><i>a </i>of clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>to its lower end <b>118</b><i>a. </i>Accordingly, the upper end <b>116</b><i>a </i>of the clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>can be loosened so that the lens cell <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be rotated or removed, all without moving the lower end <b>118</b><i>a </i>and disturbing its precise location. Each of the other clamps <b>110</b>b-<b>110</b><i>e </i>may similarly secured together using respective clamp fasteners.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, the clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>illustratively has a pair of preloaded fastener arrangements <b>120</b> securing the respective lower end of the clamp to the base <b>102</b> as will be explained with further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the preloaded fastener arrangement <b>120</b> for securing the lower end <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>to the base <b>102</b> is further explained. Each of the clamps <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>f </i>may be similarly secured using the preloaded fastener arrangements <b>120</b>. The preloaded fastener arrangement <b>120</b> may include a bolt <b>128</b>, a spring <b>134</b> biasing the bolt <b>128</b> upward, and a threaded backing plate <b>132</b> receiving the bolt <b>128</b>. The slot <b>108</b> illustratively has an upper narrow channel portion and a lower wide channel portion, that is, an inverted-T shape. The threaded backing plate <b>132</b> is slidably received within the lower wide channel portion of the slot <b>108</b>. A single threaded backing plate <b>132</b> is used for both bolts <b>128</b> and associated springs <b>134</b> in the illustrated embodiment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>further comprises a pair of flanges <b>136</b><i>a, </i><b>136</b><i>b </i>at its lower end <b>118</b><i>a </i>with respective overhanging portions positioned above the slot <b>108</b><i>a, </i>and the pair of flanges each have a borehole <b>138</b> therethrough for respective bolts <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the optical cells <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>e </i>are similarly adjusted to the respective desired location and secured using respective clamps <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>e </i>and preloaded fastener arrangements <b>120</b>. In addition, the lower end of each of the clamps <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>e </i>defines an alignment fixture receiving slot <b>124</b><i>a </i>with adjacent upper portions of the base <b>102</b>, which is discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an adjustment tool <b>146</b> for use with the optical system <b>100</b> is explained. The adjustment tool <b>146</b> has a handle <b>148</b> on a first end and a cam <b>150</b> on a second end. The alignment fixture <b>140</b> includes a plurality of adjustment apertures <b>142</b> for receiving the cam <b>150</b>. Another aperture <b>144</b> may be used to secure the fixture <b>140</b> to the base <b>102</b>. In operation the cam <b>150</b> is configured to be inserted into one of the apertures <b>142</b> within the alignment fixture <b>140</b> and rotated causing the cam <b>150</b> to move the clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>along the slot <b>108</b> to the desired, or set, location.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As understood with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the lower end <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>has an adjustment tool receiving passageway <b>152</b><i>a </i>therein defined between the two flanges <b>136</b><i>a, </i><b>136</b><i>b. </i>In addition, the lower end <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>defines an alignment fixture receiving slot <b>124</b><i>a </i>(see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) with adjacent upper portions of the base <b>102</b> as explained above, and the alignment fixture <b>140</b> is temporarily or permanently secured to the top surface of the base <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The adjustment tool <b>146</b> is positioned within the adjustment tool passageway <b>152</b><i>a </i>so that the cam <b>150</b> engages an adjustment aperture <b>142</b>. The adjustment tool <b>146</b> is rotated using the handle <b>148</b> so that the cam <b>150</b> contacts the lower end of the clamp <b>118</b><i>a </i>and pushes the clamp <b>110</b><i>a </i>a relatively precise distance, e.g., a few microns. As a result the optical cell <b>106</b><i>a </i>is adjusted to the desired location. The use of the terms desired or set location is generally referring to a location of the lens cell along the groove <b>104</b> where the lens cell functions as intended, such as in focusing a beam, for example.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each of the clamps <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>e </i>can be adjusted similarly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The preloaded fasteners <b>120</b> are loosened so that the respective clamp of the optical cell that is to be adjusted will slide. The upper end <b>116</b><i>a </i>of the clamp <b>110</b><i>a, </i>for example, is secured to the optical cell <b>106</b><i>a </i>so that when the clamp is adjusted the result is that the optical cell is also adjusted. Once the preloaded fasteners <b>120</b> are tightened, the clamps <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>e </i>remain fixed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, another variation of the optical system includes two slots <b>108</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>108</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; on opposite sides of the groove <b>104</b>&#x2032;. The other elements are labeled with prime notation and are similar to those described above, and need no further explanation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to the flowchart <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in accordance with another aspect, a method is for making an optical system as described above. From the start at Block <b>202</b> the method includes forming a base having a groove and an adjacent slot therein (Block <b>204</b>). The groove may have tapered sidewallsand the slot may be parallel with and spaced from the groove. The slot may have an inverted T-shape, for example.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moving to Block <b>206</b>, the method includes slidably aligning an optical cell along the groove. At Block <b>208</b>, the method includes slidably aligning a lower end of a clamp to a set location and using the upper clamp end to secure the optical cell along the groove. Of course, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the aligning of the optical cell and aligning of the lower clamp end may be done simultaneously by taking advantage of the preloaded fastener arrangements as described above. In other embodiments, the optical cell may be roughly aligned first and the clamp used for precise alignment as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The optical cell may also be positioned after securing of the lower end of the clamp by removing the upper end of the clamp. The method ends at Block <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method may include using at least one preloaded fastener arrangement of the at least one clamp to secure the lower end of the clamp to the base. The at least one preloaded fastener arrangement may comprise a bolt, a spring biasing the bolt, and a threaded backing plate receiving the bolt. At least one clamp fastener may be used to removably secure the upper end to the lower end.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The at least one lens cell may comprise at least one cylindrical lens cell rotatable within the groove upon loosening of the at least one clamp fastener. In addition, the lower end of the clamp may have an adjustment tool receiving passageway therein and define an alignment fixture receiving slot with adjacent portions of the base. Accordingly, the method may also include using an adjustment tool and an alignment fixture in cooperation with the adjustment tool receiving passageway and alignment fixture receiving slot, respectively, to set the clamp to the desired or set location.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications and embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-24" num="01-24"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>24</b>.
