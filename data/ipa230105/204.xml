foam in a part excluding a skin layer has at least two main dispersions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">(2) The shoe member according to (1), wherein in the distribution of cell diameters, the peak

further comprising a member that shields at least part of light emitted from the light source.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to figures. The same symbol is given to the same part or part in common in the figures and the description is not repeated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">&#x3c;Shoe Member&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The shoe member of the present embodiment comprises a foam comprising a thermoplastic resin. Using the foam comprising a thermoplastic resin as a shoe member can give high shock absorbing performance to the shoe member.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">(Foam)</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Distribution of cell diameters of the foam in a part excluding a skin layer has at least two main dispersions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, the skin layer includes a non-foam layer which has been preferentially cooled and solidified in the vicinity of the surface of the foam, and the skin layer has a degree of foaming significantly lower than that of the inside.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For the distribution of cell diameters, the area of the respective foamed cells in a cross-section of a sample of a foam in the direction perpendicular to the thickness direction is determined in image processing, and the equivalent circle diameter for the area is calculated and the distribution of cell diameters is determined from the results of calculation (see Table 2).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The probability in the distribution of cell diameters means the proportion of the diameter of cells (%) per sample when a histogram (frequency) is weighted with the diameter of cells and the sum of the histogram is taken as 100%.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The &#x201c;main dispersion&#x201d; has a clear peak in the above distribution of cell diameters with a distribution around the peak. For the total number of main dispersions in distribution of cell diameters, the number of main dispersions that meet the above condition of the main dispersion is counted.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A bimodal foam, the distribution of cell diameters of which has at least two main dispersions, provides a shoe member having both light transmission properties and durability.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">(Distribution of Cell Diameters)</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the distribution of cell diameters, the peak value of &#x201c;the maximum main dispersion&#x201d; is preferably no less than 0.5 mm, and more preferably no less than 1 mm. As used herein, &#x201c;the maximum main dispersion&#x201d; in the distribution of cell diameters means a main dispersion with the largest cell diameter for the peak value out of the main dispersions. The presence of cells with a large diameter corresponding to the maximum main dispersion can improve light transmission properties of the foam (shoe member).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The peak value of the maximum main dispersion is preferably no more than 5 mm or less, and more preferably no more than 3 mm in order to maintain mechanical strength required for the shoe member.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">By contrast, the peak value of main dispersions other than the maximum main dispersion is preferably less than 5 mm, and more preferably 0.1 to 0.3 mm.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When foam includes both cells with a large diameter corresponding to the maximum main dispersion and cells with a small diameter other than those, a foam (shoe member) having both light transmission properties and durability is obtained.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the distribution of cell diameters, the ratio of an area (peak area) of the respective main dispersions is not particularly limited. For example, when there are two main dispersions, the ratio of the peak area of the maximum main dispersion to the total peak area (the total of the peak areas of the main dispersions) is preferably 20 to 60%, and more preferably 30 to 50%.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the foam includes both cells with a large diameter corresponding to the maximum main dispersion and cells with a small diameter other than those at an appropriate ratio, a foam (shoe member) having both light transmission properties and durability is surely obtained.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the cell with a large diameter has a larger diameter, the foam has higher light transmission properties. When the cell with a small diameter has a smaller diameter, the foam has higher durability (mechanical strength). Thus, a larger difference in the diameter between the cell with a large diameter and the cell with a small diameter makes the present invention more effective.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, when the foam has cells with a large diameter of no less than 1 mm which can be visually observed and cells with a small diameter which cannot be visually observed around them, the foam assumes a unique appearance.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">(Thermoplastic Resin)</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The thermoplastic resin used in the present embodiment is not particularly limited. Examples thereof include ethylene vinyl acrylate (EVA), an olefin polymer, a styrene elastomer, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and polyurethane (PU).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Examples of olefin polymers include polyethylene (e.g., linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE)), polypropylene, an ethylene-propylene copolymer, a propylene-1-hexene copolymer, a propylene-4-methyl-1-pentene copolymer, a propylene-1-butene copolymer, an ethylene-1-hexene copolymer, an ethylene-4-methyl-pentene copolymer, an ethylene-1-butene copolymer, a 1-butene-1-hexene copolymer, a 1-butene-4-methyl-pentene copolymer, an ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer, an ethylene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, an ethylene-ethyl methacrylate copolymer, an ethylene-butyl methacrylate copolymer, an ethylene-methyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, an ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, a propylene-methacrylic acid copolymer, a propylene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, a propylene-ethyl methacrylate copolymer, a propylene-butyl methacrylate copolymer, a propylene-methyl acrylate copolymer, a propylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, a propylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and a propylene-vinyl acetate copolymer.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The olefin copolymer is preferably an olefin block copolymer (OBC).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Examples of olefin block copolymers (OBCs) include &#x201c;INFUSE&#x201d; made by Dow Inc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Examples of styrene elastomers include a styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer (SIS), a styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer (SBS), a styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymer (SEBS), a styrene-ethylene-butylene copolymer (SEB), a styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene copolymer (SEPS), a styrene-isobutylene-styrene copolymer (SIBS), a styrene-butadiene-styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBSB) and a styrene-butadiene-styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer (SBSBS). It is preferable that the styrene elastomer is at least one of SIS, SBS and SEBS.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It is preferable that in the present embodiment the thermoplastic resin comprises at least one selected from the group consisting of an ethylene vinyl acrylate (EVA), an olefin block copolymer (OBC) and a styrene elastomer.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It is more preferable that the thermoplastic resin comprises an ethylene vinyl acrylate (EVA) and at least one of an olefin block copolymer (OBC) and a styrene elastomer (e.g., SIS, SBS, SEBS).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this case, of the raw materials of the foam, EVA and OBC (or a styrene elastomer) are in a separate phase. For examples, by setting the temperature in the step of foaming to a temperature lower than the crystal melting temperature of OBC (about 120&#xb0; C.) and higher than the crystal melting temperature of EVA (about 80 to 90&#xb0; C.), the melt viscosity of EVA becomes different from that of OBC, and low viscosity EVA forms a cell with a large diameter and high viscosity OBC forms a cell with a small diameter. This provides a foam having both a cell with a large diameter and a cell with a small diameter.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Theoretically, a foam having both a cell with a large diameter and a cell with a small diameter can be prepared even when a polyolefin elastomer (POE) is used instead of OBC or a styrene elastomer. However, OBC and a styrene elastomer in which regular crystal segments act as a pseudo cross-linking point have high melt viscosity at less than the melting point (crystal melting temperature), and thus are more likely to cause a difference in the cell diameter between EVA.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the total amount of EVA and at least one of OBC and a styrene elastomer is 100 parts by mass in the raw materials of the foam, the amount of at least one of OBC and a styrene elastomer is preferably 10 to 50 parts by mass, and more preferably 20 to 40 parts by mass. In this case, a foam (shoe member) having both light transmission properties and durability is surely obtained.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The foam may also include a resin other than the thermosetting resin or rubber, a plasticizer, a reinforcing agent, a cross-linking agent and the like to the extent that the present invention is effective. In that case, the ratio of the thermoplastic resin is preferably 70 to 100% by mass, and more preferably 85 to 99% by mass based on the amount of the raw materials of the foam.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is preferable that the (raw material of) foam includes a cross-linking agent. When a cross-linking agent is included, mechanical strength of the foam can be surely increased.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Examples of cross-linking agents include DCP (dicumyl peroxide) and BIPB (di-(tert-butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The amount of the cross-linking agent added per 100 parts by mass of the thermoplastic resin is preferably 0.1 to 0.8 parts by mass (phr), and more preferably 0.2 to 0.6 phr. The amount of DCP (dicumyl peroxide) added is preferably 0.3 to 0.4 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the thermoplastic resin. The amount of BIPB (di-(tert-butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene) added is preferably 0.2 to 0.3 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the thermoplastic resin.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is preferable that the shoe member (foam) is transparent or semi-transparent. This allows the foam to be used as a sole of shoes which emit light from a light source embedded, or improves design (appearance) of shoes.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">(Method for Production)</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Various known methods may be used as a method for producing the foam (shoe member).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The distribution of cell diameters of the foam (the proportion of cells with a large diameter) may be controlled by adjusting the rate of decompression (rate of foaming) when producing a foamed cell in the foam by physical foaming or chemical foaming. Usually low foaming rates increase the proportion of the cell with a large diameter (having a peak value of dispersion of no less than 0.5 mm).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is preferable to use physical foaming for preparing the foam of the present embodiment because control of foaming rates is easier in physical foaming. However, the foam of the present embodiment can also be prepared by chemical foaming by controlling foaming rates (decompression rates).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">&#x3c;Shoes&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The present invention also relates to a shoe comprising the above shoe member.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The general structure of a shoe according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a shoe <b>1</b> has an upper <b>10</b> and a sole <b>20</b>.

<b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the foams of Examples 1 and 2, each of the distribution of cell diameters of which has two main dispersions, have both excellent light transmission properties and excellent durability (mechanical strength). In this context, excellent light transmission properties mean that, for example, the foam has a total luminous transmittance (JIS K 7375, thickness 2 mm) of no less than 40%. Furthermore, excellent mechanical strength means that the foam has a tensile strength (JIS K6301) of no less than 1.5 MPa.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0118">In Example 2, there are two dispersions although the peak of dispersion 2 is smaller than that in Example 1. The presence of two main dispersions is identified in the distribution of cell diameters even with such a small peak of dispersion 2 because there is a clear peak diameter in the distribution of cell diameters. This shows that the foam has both excellent light transmission properties and excellent durability (mechanical strength).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0119">By contrast, the foam of Comparative Example 1 has a single dispersion in the distribution of cell diameters (one main dispersion in the distribution of cell diameters), and thus has low light transmission properties.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0120">The foam of Comparative Example 2 has a larger cell diameter and thus has higher light transmission properties than the foam of Comparative Example 1, but the foam has poor mechanical strength due to single dispersion in the distribution of cell diameter, and therefore does not have both light transmission properties and mechanical strength.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0121">The above embodiments and Examples disclosed in the present description are illustrative in all aspects and not restrictive.
