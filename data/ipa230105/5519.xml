For example, a test may be conducted to evaluate whether data of memory cells is correctly inverted by selecting a word line only for a short time in a state where a sense amplifier is activated. In such a test, it is necessary to keep the active state of the sense amplifier even when the selected word line is changed by change of a row address. However, selection firm a group of sense amplifiers is performed based on higher-order bits of the row address and therefore, when a hazard occurs in the higher-order bits of the row address because of change of the row address, the sense amplifier is made temporarily inactive and the word line test cannot be conducted correctly.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a row decoder included in an access control circuit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram for explaining a relation between a row address and a section address and a word line address according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of a latch circuit in an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a main portion of a memory cell array according to an embodiment of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a timing chart for explaining a word line test operation according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various embodiments of the present disclosure will be explained below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present disclosure.

The various embodiments disclosed herein are not necessary mutually exclusive, as some disclosed embodiments can be combined with one or more other disclosed embodiments to form new embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor device <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure. The semiconductor device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is, for example, a DRAM and includes a memory cell array <b>11</b>, an access control circuit <b>12</b> that accesses the memory cell array <b>11</b>, and an I/O circuit <b>13</b> that inputs and outputs data to/from the memory cell array <b>11</b>. The access control circuit <b>12</b> accesses the memory cell array <b>11</b> based on a command address signal CA input from an external controller via command address terminals <b>14</b>. In a read operation, data DQ read out from the memory cell array <b>11</b> is output to data terminals <b>15</b> via the I/O circuit <b>13</b>. In a write operation, data DQ input to the data terminals <b>15</b> from an external controller is written to the memory cell array <b>11</b> via the I/O circuit <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a row decoder included in the access control circuit <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the access control circuit <b>12</b> includes a predecoder circuit <b>20</b> that predecodes a row address RA to generate a section address RSEC and a word line address RWL, a latch circuit <b>23</b> that transmits the section address RSEC as is or latches it, thereby generating a section address RXSEC, a decoder circuit <b>21</b> that decodes the section address RXSEC to generate a section selection signal SECSEL, and a decoder circuit <b>22</b> that decodes the word line address RWL to generate a word line selection signal WLSEL. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the row address RA is constituted by a first address portion <b>31</b> including higher-order bits, a second address portion <b>32</b>, and a third address portion <b>33</b> including lower-order bits. The predecoder circuit <b>20</b> generates the section address RSEC based on the first address portion <b>31</b> and the second address portion <b>32</b>, and generates the word line address RWL based on the second address portion <b>32</b> and the third address portion <b>33</b>. In this manner, the second address portion <b>32</b> included in the row address RA is used for both generation of the section address RSEC and generation of the word line address RWL. Here, the section address RSEC and the word line address RWL do not overlap each other when the number of word lines included in each memory section can be represented by a power-of-2. However, the section address RSEC and the word line address RWL overlap each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> when the number of word lines included in each memory section cannot be represented by a power-of-2.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of the latch circuit <b>23</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a circuit for one bit of the section address RSEC among circuits constituting the latch circuit <b>23</b>. Therefore, the latch circuit <b>23</b> actually includes the circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the number of which is the same as the number of bits of the section address RSEC. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the latch circuit <b>23</b> includes a NAND gate circuit <b>41</b> that receives a predetermined bit of the section address RSEC and an inverted signal of a test signal TEST, and an SR flip-flop circuit <b>42</b> controlled by an output signal of the NAND gate circuit <b>41</b> and the test signal TEST. The test signal TEST is activated to a high level during a word line test operation. During a normal operation, the test signal TEST is maintained at a low level. Therefore, during the normal operation, the section address RSEC is transmitted as is and is output as the section address RXSEC. On the other hand, when the test signal TEST is changed from a low level to a high level, the current section address RSEC is latched by the SR flip-flop circuit <b>42</b>, and the latched section address RSEC is output as the section address RXSEC. This state is maintained over a period of time during which the test signal TEST is at a high level. That is, during the period of time during which the test signal TEST is at a high level, the section address RXSEC input to the decoder circuit <b>21</b> is not changed even when the section address RSEC output from the predecoder circuit <b>20</b> is changed. Therefore, during the period of time during which the test signal TEST is at a high level, the section selection signal SECSEL output from the decoder circuit <b>21</b> is fixed even when the row address RA is changed. Meanwhile, such a latch circuit is not inserted between the predecoder circuit <b>20</b> and the decoder circuit <b>22</b> and therefore, when the word line address RWL output from the predecoder circuit <b>20</b> is changed during the period of time during which the test signal TEST is at a high level, the changed word line address RWL is input to the decoder circuit <b>22</b> as is. Accordingly, when the row address RA is changed, the word line selection signal WLSEL output from the decoder circuit <b>21</b> is also changed irrespective of the level of the test signal TEST.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of a main portion of the memory cell array <b>11</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a plurality of memory sections SEC and a plurality of sense amplifier groups SG are alternately arranged in the memory cell array <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows memory sections SEC<b>0</b> to SEC<b>3</b> and sense amplifier groups SG<b>0</b> to SG<b>4</b>. Each memory section SEC has a plurality of word lines WL, a plurality of bit lines BL, and memory cells MC respectively arranged at intersections of those lines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a word line WL<b>1</b> and bit lines BL<b>0</b> and BL<b>1</b> included in the memory section SEC<b>1</b>, a word line WL<b>0</b> and a bit line BL<b>2</b> included in the memory section SEC<b>0</b>, and a word line WL<b>2</b> and a bit line BL<b>3</b> included in the memory section SEC<b>2</b>. The memory cell army <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> has a so-called open bit architecture, and bit lines BL of each pair respectively belong to memory sections SEC different firm each other. For example, the bit lines BL<b>0</b> and BL<b>2</b> forming a pair respectively belong to the memory sections SEC<b>1</b> and SEC<b>0</b> and are coupled to a sense amplifier SA<b>0</b> included in the sense amplifier group SG<b>1</b>. The bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BL<b>3</b> forming a pair respectively belong to the memory sections SEC<b>1</b> and SEC<b>2</b> and are coupled to a sense amplifier SA<b>1</b> included in the sense amplifier group SG<b>2</b>. To the memory sections SEC<b>0</b> to SEC<b>3</b>, corresponding word drivers WD<b>0</b> to WD<b>3</b> are assigned, respectively. The word drivers WD<b>0</b> to WD<b>3</b> are each activated by a corresponding bit of the section selection signal SECSEL. For example, each of the word drivers WD<b>0</b> to WD<b>3</b> is exclusively activated by its corresponding one of bits SECSEL<b>0</b> to SECSEL<b>3</b> of the section selection signal SECSEL. The section selection signal SECSEL is also supplied to the sense amplifier groups SG<b>1</b>. For example, when the bit SECSEL<b>0</b> of the section selection signal SECSEL is activated, the two sense amplifier groups SG<b>0</b> and SG corresponding to the memory section SEC<b>0</b> are activated. When the bit SECSEL<b>1</b> of the section selection signal SECSEL is activated, the two sense amplifier groups SG<b>1</b> and SG<b>2</b> corresponding to the memory section SEC<b>1</b> are activated. When the bit SECSEL<b>2</b> of the section selection signal SECSEL is activated, the two sense amplifier groups SG<b>2</b> and SG<b>3</b> corresponding to the memory section SEC<b>2</b> are activated. When the bit SECSEL<b>3</b> of the section selection signal SECSEL is activated, the two sense amplifier groups SG<b>3</b> and SG<b>4</b> corresponding to the memory section SEC<b>3</b> are activated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The word line selection signal WLSEL is supplied to the word drivers WD in common. Any one of the word drivers WD is exclusively activated based on the section selection signal SECSEL. Accordingly, the word line WL that is selected by the word line selection signal WLSEL in the memory section SEC that is selected by the section selection signal SECSEL is selected by the row address RA. Subsequently, when the word line WL<b>1</b> belonging to the memory section SEC<b>1</b> is selected, for example, in a normal operation, data pieces held by the memory cells MC<b>0</b> and MC<b>1</b> are read out to the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and BL<b>0</b>, respectively. The potential of the bit line BL<b>0</b> is compared with the potential of the bit line BL<b>2</b> by the sense amplifier SA<b>0</b> included in the sense amplifier group SG<b>1</b> and a difference between them is amplified, so that read data is generated. Further, the potential of the bit line BL<b>1</b> is compared with the potential of the bit line BL<b>3</b> by the sense amplifier SA<b>1</b> included in the sense amplifier group SG<b>2</b> and a difference between them is amplified, so that read data is generated. The read data generated as described above is output to outside via the I/O circuit <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Meanwhile, in a write operation, pieces of write data input from outside via the I/O circuit <b>13</b> are written to the memory cells MC<b>0</b> and MC<b>1</b> via the sense amplifiers SA<b>1</b> and SA<b>0</b>, respectively. In the normal operation, after the above-described read/write operation is performed, a precharge operation is performed. When the precharge operation is performed, the word line WL<b>1</b> returns to an unselected state and bit lines belonging to the memory section SEC<b>1</b> and bit lines (for example, the bit line BL<b>0</b> and the bit line BL<b>2</b>) each forming a pair together with any of the bit lines in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> are equalized to have the same potential as each other.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A test of the word lines WL in a manufacturing stage is performed in accordance with the following procedure. First, in a case of testing the word lines WL included in the memory section SEC<b>1</b>, the same data (for example, a &#x201c;0&#x201d; level) is written to all the memory cells MC in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> by a normal write operation. Further, &#x201c;0&#x201d; level data is written to all memory cells (for example, the memory cell MC<b>2</b>) that are selected by the word line WL<b>0</b> in memory cells in the memory section SEC<b>0</b>, and is also written to all memory cells (for example, the memory cell MC<b>3</b>) that are selected by the word line WL<b>2</b> in memory cells in the memory section SEC<b>2</b>. Thereafter, the word lines WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>2</b> are selected and all the sense amplifiers SA in the sense amplifier groups SG<b>1</b> and SG<b>2</b> are activated, thereby driving all the bit lines BL in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> to a &#x201c;1&#x201d; level. In this state, the row address RA specifying the memory section SEC<b>1</b> is input, and then the test signal TEST is activated to a high level. Thereafter, the value of the row address RA input from outside is sequentially updated, thereby sequentially selecting the word lines WL in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> in a state where all the sense amplifiers SA in the sense amplifier groups SG<b>1</b> and SG<b>2</b> are kept active without performing a precharge operation. That is, unlike a normal operation, in a test operation, the precharge operation is not performed after a certain word line is made to return from a selected state to an unselected state and before another word line is selected.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a timing chart for explaining a word line test operation. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at times t<b>0</b> and t<b>1</b>, an active command is issued and the row addresses RA different from each other are input. When the active command is issued, the word line WL corresponding to the specified row address RA is selected. In the test operation, it is possible to control the timing of deactivation of the word line WL by a control signal ASYNC input from outside. That is, with the timing of input of the control signal ASYNC, it is possible to adjust a period of time T during which the word line WL is in a selected state. When a certain word line WL in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> is activated, &#x201c;I&#x201d; level data is written to the memory cells MC selected by this word line via the corresponding bit lines BL. However, in a case where there is a defect such as slow rising of that word line WL, data of the memory cells MC cannot be inverted in the period of time T and remains at a &#x201c;0&#x201d; level. Therefore, when the word lines WL in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> are sequentially selected in a state where all the sense amplifiers SA in the sense amplifier groups SG<b>1</b> and SG<b>2</b> are kept active without performing a precharge operation, data is inverted to a &#x201c;I&#x201d; level for the memory cells MC corresponding to a normal word line WL and remains at a &#x201c;0&#x201d; level for the memory cells MC corresponding to a defective word line WL. Accordingly, it is possible to detect the defective word line WL by selecting all the word lines WL in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> and then reading out data in the memory section SEC<b>1</b> by a normal read operation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As described above, when the value of the row address RA is updated in the word line test, the test signal TEST is activated to a high level. Therefore, even when a hazard occurs in the section address RSEC due to change of the value of the row address RA, the section selection signal SECSEL does not temporarily change. The reason why a hazard can occur in the section address RSEC due to change of the value of the row address RA is because the second address portion <b>32</b> included in the row address RA is involved in both generation of the section address RSEC and generation of the word line address RWL as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. That is, even in a case where only the word line address RWL is changed while the section address RSEC is fixed, there is a possibility that a hazard occurs in the section address RSEC due to change of the second address portion <b>32</b>. However, in the semiconductor device <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment, the section address RXSEC is fixed in the word line test operation, and therefore the section selection signal SECSEL does not temporarily change even when a hazard occurs in the section address RSEC. Accordingly, it is possible to correctly perform the word line test even in a case where the number of word lines included in each memory section SEC cannot be represented by a power-of-2. In addition, in a case of shifting to a test of the word lines WL included in another memory section, for example, the memory section SEC<b>2</b>, the test signal TEST is deactivated to a low level once, thereafter the row address RA specifying the memory section SEC<b>2</b> is input, and the test signal TEST is activated to a high level again. Thereafter, the value of the row address RA input from outside is sequentially updated, thereby sequentially selecting the word lines WL in the memory section SEC<b>2</b> without performing a precharge operation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although this disclosure has been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the disclosures extend beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the disclosures and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof.
