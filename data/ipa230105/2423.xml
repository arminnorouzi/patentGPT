More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of thiophosphoryl chloride useful for commercial production of pesticides and pharmaceutically active compounds.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Phosphoramidothioates are known for their excellent insecticidal activity against a variety of insects in various environments. Acephate, a systemic insecticide, is one of widely used phosphoramidothioate that controls a wide range of chewing and sucking insects, e.g. aphids, thrips, lepidopterous larvae, sawflies, leaf miners, leafhoppers, cutworms, etc., in fruit (including citrus), vines, hops, olives, cotton, soya beans, peanuts, macadamia nuts, beet, brassicas, celery, beans, potatoes, rice, tobacco, ornamentals, forestry, and other crops.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thiophosporyl chloride is a useful starting material for synthesis of organo-phosphorus compounds in agrochemical industry.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">German Patent 1145589 discloses that thiophosphoryl chloride is obtained by treating phosphorous trichloride and sulfur in liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, using aluminum or alloys thereof, either neat or with halogens. Similar process is disclosed in patents (U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,715,561, 2,850,354, 2,850,354) using metal halides as catalyst.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,600 discloses a process for preparing thiophosphoryl chloride by reacting phosphorous trichloride with sulfur in the presence of tertiary amine catalyst. The improvement in the process is use of tertiary amine (aromatic and aliphatic) as catalyst. The tertiary amine is selected from the group consisting of 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine, 2-methylpyridine, 2,4-dimethylpyridine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine, tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tris-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl]amine and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. As described in examples the reaction mixture was cooked for 9 hours (via 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine) or for 14 hours (via 2,6-Lutidine) or for 3 hour 44 min (via Tributylamine) or for 19 hours and 17 min (via N,N-Dimethylaniline) or for 15 hour 6 min via 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0.]undec-7-ene (DBU).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,350 disclose process for preparing thiophosphoryl chloride by reacting phosphorous trichloride with sulfur in the presence of a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine, and essentially in the presence of a catalytic amount of a nitroxide free radical. The nitroso free radical is 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (&#x201c;TEMPO&#x201d;). Example 1 of this patent disclose reaction in presence of tertiary amine and TEMPO performed for about 2 hours and 8 minutes to produce thiophosphoryl chloride.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Activated charcoal is commonly used as solid phase catalyst to promote the thiolation reaction and observed to give quantitative conversion. However, while use, this catalyst process is associated with many issues at commercial production. Catalyst, while product isolation by distillation, is carried over with product yielding poor product appearance such as blackening of the product. Other practical issues such as foaming issues in the reactor pot/HEEL and flooding in the column with solid catalyst; catalyst depletion; etc are immediate to list. The disadvantages continue with post sufficient recycles, removal and disposal of this highly corrosive two-phase highly viscous slurry mass of HEEL and retained catalyst is often a major effluent concern to dispose as well as a safety hazard. Thus, this process is not industrially viable and amenable for scale-up.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, there exists a need to develop a simple, cost-effective, rapid and commercially viable process for the commercial scale preparation of thiophosphoryl chloride used as an intermediate for preparation of organo-phosphorus compounds in agrochemical industry. The present invention thus provides an industrially viable and cost-effective process for the large scale preparation of acephate and its intermediate thiophosphoryl chloride.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an aspect the present invention provides a commercial and rapid process for preparation of thiophosphoryl chloride.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect the present invention provides continuous process for preparation of thiophosphoryl chloride with high yield and high purity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect the present invention provides a simple and less time consuming commercial process for preparation of acephate using thiophosphoryl chloride prepared according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect the present invention provides a commercial process for preparation of an intermediate thiophosphoryl chloride which is used for preparation of acephate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect the present invention provides a continuous process for preparation of acephate.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Aspects, advantageous features and preferred embodiments of the present invention summarized as follows, respectively alone or in combination, contribute to solving this and other objects of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the various embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention.
