The pipes <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be circular, metallic pipes used in a variety of contexts. For example, the pipes <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be used for plumbing or for other fluid transportation purposes. The pipes <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may have other cross-section shapes beside circular and/or be formed of other materials. In some embodiments, the pipes <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be other fluid-conveying members besides pipes, including but not limited to tubes such as automotive or engine tubes or lines, flexible tubes, channels, and the like. The pipes <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may meet at an interface <b>115</b>. The interface <b>115</b> may be a location where the first pipe <b>110</b> abuts the second pipe <b>120</b>.
