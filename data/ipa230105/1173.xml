No. 63/218,167, entitled &#x201c;Protective Cover for a Medical Device&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter device includes a catheter that is over-the-needle. As its name implies, the catheter that is over-the-needle may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. A catheter assembly may include a catheter hub, the catheter extending distally from the catheter hub, and the introducer needle extending through the catheter. The catheter and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to verify proper placement of the introducer needle and/or the catheter in the blood vessel, a clinician generally confirms that there is &#x201c;flashback&#x201d; of blood in a flashback chamber of the catheter assembly. Once placement of the needle has been confirmed, the clinician may temporarily occlude flow in the vasculature and remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place for future blood withdrawal or fluid infusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusion and blood withdrawal using the catheter may be difficult for several reasons, particularly when an indwelling time of the catheter increases. A fibrin sheath or thrombus may form on an internal surface of the catheter assembly, an external surface of the catheter assembly, or within the vasculature near the distal tip of the catheter. The fibrin sheath or thrombus may block or narrow a fluid pathway through the catheter, which may impair infusion and/or collection of a high-quality blood sample. Sometimes a medical device may be coupled to the catheter assembly and an instrument, such as a guidewire or tube, may be inserted through the catheter assembly to reduce or remove occlusions such as the fibrin sheath or thrombus and extend a life of the catheter. Just prior to use of the medical device and while the medical device is packaged, a distal connector of the medical device may become damaged or contaminated or may pose a danger to a user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced. The protective cover described in the present disclosure may be used with any suitable medical device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to a cover for a medical device. In some embodiments, a medical device may include a distal connector. In some embodiments, the distal connector may include a first lever arm, which may include a distal end and a proximal end. In some embodiments, the distal end of the first lever arm may include a first protrusion. In some embodiments, the distal connector may include a second lever arm opposing the first lever arm. In some embodiments, the second lever arm may include a distal end and a proximal end. In some embodiments, the distal end of the second lever arm may include a second protrusion. In some embodiments, the distal connector may include a blunt cannula disposed between the first lever arm and the second lever arm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the medical device may include a cover coupled to the distal connector. In some embodiments, the cover may include an annular wall surrounding the blunt cannula. In some embodiments, an outer surface of the annular wall may include at least one catch. In some embodiments, the first protrusion and the second protrusion may contact the at least one catch. In some embodiments, the proximal end of the first lever arm and the proximal end of the second lever arm may be configured to be pinched together toward a longitudinal axis of the distal connector to remove the first protrusion and the second protrusion from the at least one catch.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the at least one catch may include an annular stepped surface. In some embodiments, an entirety of an outer surface of the blunt cannula may be spaced apart from the cover, which may allow the cover to slide off the distal connector when the first lever arm and the second lever arm are released, facilitating easy removal of the cover, which may slide off the distal connector. In some embodiments, the annular wall may include a proximal end and a distal end. In some embodiments, the proximal end of the annular wall may form a proximal opening. In some embodiments, a lumen may extend from the proximal opening to and/or through the distal end of the annular wall. In some embodiments, the cover may include an inner surface forming the lumen.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, in response to orienting the blunt cannula to be perpendicular to the ground and pinching the proximal end of the first lever arm and the proximal end of the second lever arm together toward the longitudinal axis of the distal connector such that the first protrusion and the second protrusion are removed from the at least one catch, the cover may be configured to fall off of the distal connector under force of gravity. Thus, in some embodiments, a user may remove the cover from the distal connector with a single hand.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the outer surface of the annular wall may include a ramp proximal to the at least one catch and extending outwardly in a distal to proximal direction, which may facilitate pulling the cover distally off the medical device. In some embodiments, the outer surface of the annular wall may include a ramp proximal to the at least one catch and extending outwardly in a proximal to distal direction, which may facilitate snapping of the first lever arm and the second lever arm onto the at least one catch when the cover is coupled to the distal connector.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the outer surface of the annular wall may include one or more protrusions distal to the at least one catch and configured for gripping. In some embodiments, the protrusions comprises a plurality of ribs generally aligned with the longitudinal axis of the distal connector. In some embodiments, the protrusions may allow two-handed removal of the cover from the distal connector. Thus, in some embodiments, the cover may be configured for both one-handed removal and two-handed removal, depending on a preference of the user or other circumstances. In some embodiments, each of the ribs may include a proximal end that is stepped or tapered inwardly, which may create space for the first protrusion and the second protrusion and facilitate coupling of the first protrusion and the second protrusion to the at least one catch.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the cover may include an annular enclosure, which may extend from the distal end of the annular wall. In some embodiments, the annular enclosure may be configured to surround the first lever arm and the second lever arm. In some embodiments, the annular enclosure may be spaced apart from the annular wall by an annular channel. In some embodiments, the first lever arm and the second lever arm may be disposed within the annular channel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the annular enclosure may include an inner surface. In some embodiments, the inner surface of the annular enclosure may include a portion that is angled outwardly in a distal to proximal direction such that in response to pinching the proximal end of the first lever arm and the proximal end of the second lever arm together toward the longitudinal axis of the distal connector, the first protrusion and the second protrusion may contact the portion and cam against the portion to facilitate removal of the cover from the distal connector. In these and other embodiments, the cover may be configured to be removed from the distal connector with a single hand and/or in any orientation. In some embodiments, the annular enclosure and/or the cover may be constructed of an elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the annular enclosure and/or the cover may be constructed of plastic or another suitable material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the annular enclosure and the annular wall may be monolithically formed as a single unit. In some embodiments, a proximal end of the cover may include a flange configured for gripping. In some embodiments, the flange may be annular. In some embodiments, the annular enclosure, the annular wall, and the flange are monolithically formed as a single unit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the medical device may include a vascular access device. In some embodiments, the vascular access device may include an instrument configured to advance distally through the distal connector when the cover is removed from the distal connector. In some embodiments, the instrument may include a tube, a guidewire, or another suitable instrument. In some embodiments, the distal connector may be configured to couple to a catheter assembly when the cover is removed from the distal connector.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. It should be understood that the various embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality illustrated in the drawings. It should also be understood that the embodiments may be combined, or that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural changes, unless so claimed, may be made without departing from the scope of the various embodiments of the present invention.
