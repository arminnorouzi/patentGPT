a hydraulic composition which permits to obtain ultra-high-performance concrete with high early strength, a method for producing said hydraulic composition, and the use of said hydraulic composition

num="0002">Ultra-high early performance concretes (UHPCs) are well known in the field of construction since the 1990s. These concretes are able to develop a final compressive strength, measured after 28 days of curing, of at least 100 MPa, and generally greater than 120 MPa.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The strength of such concrete compositions develops gradually until reaching the final values; known UHPC compositions typically develop strength at 24 hours of typically 70 to 110 MPa.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many applications a UHPC having a very high early strength would have strong advantages. For example, in the reparation and strengthening of an aging bridge deck, using a UHPC that can develop very high early strength in the first 24 hours would reduce the duration traffic is blocked or limited.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such performance profile of the concretes would be also advantageous in the preparation of precast concrete, as the high strength at 24 hours enables the concrete elements to be delivered to the customer the day following their production, with no additional curing and hardening time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is therefore a strong need for a hydraulic composition allowing to obtain ultra-high performance concrete with high early strength.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aim of the present invention is to provide a hydraulic composition which permits to obtain ultra-high-performance concretes with high early strength.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a hydraulic composition comprising in relative parts by mass with respect to first Portland cement:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">100 parts of a first Portland cement the particles of which have a D50 comprised between 10 and 25 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 10 and 16 &#x3bc;m, even more preferably between 11 and 15 &#x3bc;m;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">from 25 to 76 parts of a second Portland cement the particles of which have a D50 comprised between 0.5 and 6 &#x3bc;m, preferentially between 0.5 and 5 &#x3bc;m;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">from 85 to 200 parts of sand; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">water;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0013">the water content being such that the hydraulic composition comprises from 170 to 250 kg of water per cubic metre of hydraulic composition;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0014">the volume distribution of particle size of the first Portland cement and of the second Portland cement being further such that the ratio D50 of the first Portland cement/D50 of the second Portland cement is greater than 2.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0015">The invention also relates to a hydraulic binder comprising in relative parts by mass with respect to first Portland cement:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0016">100 parts of a first Portland cement the particles of which have a D50 comprised between 10 and 25 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 10 and 16 &#x3bc;m, even more preferably between 11 and 15 &#x3bc;m;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0017">from 25 to 76 parts of a second Portland cement the particles of which have a D50 comprised between 0.5 and 6 &#x3bc;m, preferentially between 0.5 and 5 &#x3bc;m;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0018">from 85 to 200 parts of sand; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0019">the volume distribution of particle size of the first Portland cement and of the second Portland cement being further such that the ratio D50 of the first Portland cement/D50 of the second Portland cement is greater than 2.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0020">In the invention, unless otherwise stated, the component amounts are expressed in part by mass for 100 parts by mass of the first Portland cement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Advantages</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0021">Surprisingly, the inventors found that hydraulic compositions according to the invention permit to obtain efficient UHPCs providing compressive values of at least 160 MPa, preferentially 180 MPa, even more preferably 190 MPa at 28 days. Even more surprisingly, such hydraulic compositions permit to obtain UHPCs that acquire very quickly an important compressive strength of at least 130 MPa, preferably 140 MPa at 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0022">Thus, not only the concretes of the invention present very high compressive strength at 28 days, but also, they reach compressive strengths higher than those of conventional UHPCs in less than 24 h. This is particularly advantageous in the area of the reparation and strengthening of aging infrastructure elements such as bridge decks, pillars, beams or dams.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0023">Another advantage of the hydraulic compositions according to the invention lies in their rheology.

Super-plasticizers have been globally classified in four groups: sulfonated condensates of naphthalene formaldehyde (SNF) (generally a sodium salt); sulfonate condensates of melamine formaldehyde (SMF); modified lignosulfonates (MLS); and others. More recent super-plasticizers include polycarboxylic compounds such as polycarboxylates, e.g. polyacrylates. A super-plasticizer is preferably a new generation super-plasticizer, e.g. a copolymer containing a polyethylene glycol as a grafted chain and carboxylic functions in the main chain like a polycarboxylic ether. Sodium polycarboxylates-polysulfonates and sodium polyacrylates may also be used. The derivatives of phosphonic acid may also be used. The required amount of super-plasticizer generally depends on the reactivity of the cement. The lower the reactivity, the smaller is the required amount of super-plasticizer.

This represents a significant increase compared to the strength of the reference hydraulic compositions M0 and M0&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0174">The two comparative references M0 and M0&#x2032; are similar is that they both contain one type of Portland cement, and have the same water cement ratio. They differ in the fact that M0 makes use of two fillers, the limestone filer Durcal 5 combined with silica fume, and M0&#x2032; makes use of Durcal 1, very fine limestone filler and no silica fume. The strength at 24 hours of M0 and M0&#x2032; is respectively 75 MPa and 94 MPa.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0175">The results also show that for composition M1 an M2 particular high compressive strength values can be achieved even though no fine filler materials such as ground limestone or silica fume is used. Also, these high early strength values are obtained without any need to include a chemical accelerator. This is of interest as such products usually increase the strength development but have a negative effect of the fresh concrete rheology, and especially the slump retention time.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0176">The results show that the strength development of the UHPC compositions M1 and M2 remains high at 28 days, at above 190 MPa compared to 172 and 163 MPa for M0 and M0&#x2032;, respectively.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0177">All concrete mixes M0, M0&#x2032;, M1 and M2 have high slump flow values, which means that the concrete mixes M1 and M2 are so-called self-levelling concretes, even though their early strength is significantly higher that known UHPC compositions.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>UHPC mix designs containing a very fine Portland cement </entry></row><row><entry>and a normal Portland cement, compared to reference </entry></row><row><entry>mix designs M0 and M0&#x2019;.
