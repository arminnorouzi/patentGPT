The image forming apparatus includes not only toner and paper, but also replacement components (also referred to as the consumables) including a photosensitive member used for an image formation process. For example, the photosensitive member cannot exhibit desired performance when it is contaminated with toner or paper powder or it is worn out. To prevent this, it is known that the information processing apparatus determines the replacement time of the photosensitive member based on information on a remaining usable amount of the photosensitive member. Not only the photosensitive member, but also a sheet feed roller, a developing device, and so forth, correspond to the consumables.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2010-145942 discloses a technique in which a server receives information on use history of consumables before replacement thereof from one image forming apparatus, and predicts a replacement time of each consumable of another image forming apparatus which can communicate with the server based on the received information. More specifically, the system disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2010-145942 estimates the film thickness wear rate of a photosensitive member of the other image forming apparatus based on changes in the film thickness of a photosensitive member of the one image forming apparatus, and predicts the replacement time of the photosensitive member based on the estimated film thickness wear rate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the method disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2010-145942, replacement is not notified before the replacement time comes, and hence it is impossible to obtain a result of prediction of a consumption degree (remaining amount) of a consumable at a desired timing.</p><heading id="h-0005"

accompanying drawings showing embodiments thereof.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a consumable management system to which an information processing apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention is applied. This consumable management system is formed by communicably connecting a prediction system <b>201</b>, which is the information processing apparatus, and an image forming apparatus <b>101</b>. The prediction system <b>201</b> and the image forming apparatus <b>101</b> are connected e.g. via a communication network, but the form of communication connection is not particularly limited. Further, the number of image forming apparatuses <b>101</b> connected to the prediction system <b>201</b> is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The prediction system <b>201</b> is a system configured to predict a consumption degree (remaining amount or consumption amount) of a consumable in the image forming apparatus <b>101</b> and determine a proper replacement time. The prediction system <b>201</b> includes a CPU <b>209</b>, a reception section <b>202</b>, a first storage section <b>203</b>, a prediction processor <b>204</b>, an input section <b>205</b>, a display controller <b>206</b>, a management screen <b>207</b>, and a threshold value input section <b>208</b>. The functions of these sections are realized by a cooperative operation of the CPU <b>209</b> and at least one of a RAM, a ROM (neither of which is shown), and various interfaces. Accordingly, the components of the prediction system <b>201</b> are comprehensively controlled by the CPU <b>209</b>. The image forming apparatus <b>101</b> has a counting section <b>180</b>, a second storage section <b>181</b>, and a transmission section <b>182</b>. The functions of these sections are realized by a cooperative operation of various interfaces, a CPU, a RAM, and a ROM (none of which are shown). The components of the image forming apparatus <b>101</b> are comprehensively controlled by the CPU.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the image forming apparatus <b>101</b>, when the time to collect consumption degree information (remaining amount information) as information on the consumption degree (remaining amount or consumption amount) comes, the counting section <b>180</b> collects consumption degree information (remaining amount information or consumption amount information) of consumables. The consumption degree information is a value related to a service life of each consumable and is e.g. a consumption degree (or a remaining amount). The consumption degree information may be, for example, a remaining amount of a consumable, a consumption amount of a consumable, the number of pages on each of which an image was printed by the image forming apparatus <b>101</b> after an consumable was attached to the image forming apparatus <b>101</b>, a cumulative number of driving times of a consumable, a cumulative driving time period, or a cumulative driving distance of a consumable.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present embodiment, the consumption degree refers to a degree of progress of consumption from the start of use of a new consumable assuming that the degree is set to 0% at the start of use of the new consumable, but may be a remaining service life (remaining amount) assuming that the degree is set to 100% at the start of use of the new one. The second storage section <b>181</b> stores the collected consumption degree information of each consumable.

Toner images formed by the four-color image forming sections are transferred onto a sheet S as a recording material conveyed through a sheet conveying section <b>150</b>, via an intermediate transfer belt unit <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sheets S are accommodated in a state stacked on a lift-up device <b>152</b> in an accommodating section <b>151</b> and are fed by the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> in synchronism with image formation timing. The sheet feeding method is not particularly limited. Each sheet S delivered by the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> passes through a sheet conveying path <b>154</b> and is conveyed to a resist roller <b>155</b>. Skew correction and timing correction are performed by the resist roller <b>155</b>, and then the sheet S is conveyed to a secondary transfer section.

The above-described process is similarly executed in the image forming sections <b>110</b>M, <b>110</b>C, and <b>110</b>BK, whereby the toner images of the four colors are formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>1</b> in a superimposed state.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, the intermediate transfer belt unit <b>102</b> will be described.

The sheet S on which the image has been fixed at the fixing section <b>160</b> is conveyed out of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, the consumption degree (degree of consumption) of consumables will be described. First, a method of predicting the consumption degree of the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> and the photosensitive member <b>111</b> will be described. The sheet feed roller <b>153</b> wears as it conveys the sheet S. Wear of the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> results in a reduced conveying force, and causes conveyance failure or reduced conveying speed of the sheet S. To prevent this, it is necessary to replace the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> by predicting the service life of the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> in advance. In general, the roller member has a fixed life-time number of conveyed sheets, for each material thereof and each process speed. A consumption degree Lr [%] of the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> can be predicted by the following equation (1), using the cumulative number PVt of conveyed sheets after replacement of the sheet feed roller <b>153</b>, and the number PVr of conveyed sheets at which the life of the sheet feed roller <b>153</b> expires:</p><p id="p-0049" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Lr</i>=(<i>PVt&#xd7;</i>100)/<i>PVr</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">On the other hand, as the photosensitive member <b>111</b> rotates, a film on the surface of the photosensitive member <b>111</b> is worn by mechanical friction with the photosensitive member cleaner <b>116</b>.
