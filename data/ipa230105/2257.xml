The MBBR may include certain biofilm carriers suitable for the treatment of wastewater. For example, high density polyethylene (HDPE) biofilm carriers may operate in mixed motion within an aerated wastewater treatment basin. Each individual biocarrier may increase productivity by providing a protected surface area to support the growth and sustenance of microbial population on the surface of the biocarrier media, resulting in a high density population of bacteria. This high-density population of bacteria may achieve high-rate biodegradation within the system, while also offering process reliability and ease of operation.

Certain wastewater treatment processes include the use of moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) systems. The MBBR may include certain biofilm carriers suitable for the treatment of wastewater. For example, high density polyethylene biofilm carriers may operate in mixed motion within an aerated wastewater treatment basin. Each individual biocarrier may increase productivity by providing a protected surface area to support the growth of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria within cell of the biocarrier, resulting in a high density population of bacteria. It may be beneficial to combine MBBR systems with disinfection systems, such as oxidizing disinfection systems that use chlorine, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, peracetic acid (e.g., organic compounds with the formula CH3COOOH), ferrates (e.g., [FeO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>), or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The techniques described herein may include a skid system process train, where a skid may include an MBBR system. The MBBR skid may include a disinfection system, or may be fluidly coupled to other skids that include disinfection systems. The disinfection systems may include chlorine based disinfection, ultraviolet (UV) based disinfection, peracetic acid based disinfection, and/or ferrate based disinfection. Accordingly, the disinfection systems may be located upstream of the MBBR system, downstream of the MBBR system, or in the MBBR system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The MBBR and/or disinfection systems may be included in wastewater treatment systems such as aerated treatment units (ATUs), small community plants (SCPs), and/or lagoons. By adding the techniques described herein to ATUs, SCPs, and/or lagoons, a release of treated effluent into the environment may include reduced quantities of pathogens, disinfection byproducts (DBPs), and new categories of emerging pollutants such as Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain locales, such as in the state of Louisiana, a significant portion of small residential and commercial entities are serviced by onsite, Aerated Treatment Units (ATUs) and small community plants (SCP) for the treatment of sanitary wastewater. The majority of these systems may be malfunctioning, thereby releasing insufficiently treated wastewater into the waterways. The effluent from these ATUs may be discharged into stormwater drainage ditches in front of businesses and along streets and highways, frequently resulting in standing, stagnating water contaminated with sewage. Ditches drain to local waterways, contaminating them with fecal pathogens, nutrients, and organic materials. Water quality in these waterways may be greatly diminished, as breakdown of the organic material depletes water dissolved oxygen levels. Consequently, the waterways become impaired for parameters such as dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform bacteria.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To address this situation, some agencies, such as the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) has established Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) limits on streams listed as impaired on EPA's Impaired Waterbodies List. Many streams in Louisiana received TMDLs for Dissolved Oxygen Demanding Substances and/or fecal coliform bacteria. While there are no established nutrient TMDLs in Louisiana for nitrogen and phosphorus, nutrients are implicated in the aforementioned DO and fecal coliform TMDLs. To address nutrient inputs, LDEQ completed a Nutrient Management Strategy (LDEQ, 2014) and has begun implementing elements of the plan, particularly by addressing point-sources of pollution (LDEQ, 2017).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a consequence of the TMDLs and subsequent nutrient management strategy, LDEQ has implemented total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) monitoring in general and individual permits for all facilities requiring a Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (LPDES) permit. This will allow LDEQ to gather data necessary to determine the extent of nutrient contributions from point-source dischargers to water bodies of Louisiana (LDEQ 2017).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Most significantly, however, small commercial ATUs discharging to streams with TMDLs will be given more stringent effluent limits, for which they were not designed (Table 1- LDEQ, 2017a). ATUs that are currently installed and operating will not be able to meet the new limits, which will result in fines and expenses for the treatment unit owners and operators.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Standard and Waterway Parameter Effluent Example Limits,</entry></row><row><entry>Class 1 Sanitary Wastewater Plant.

Given the impending stringent wastewater effluent limits, there is a need to cost-effectively retrofit existing small commercial ATUs to meet new effluent discharge standards. The techniques described herein include up and coming disinfection processing paired with bioaugmentation, resulting in technology potentially capable of addressing this need.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Reuse of treated wastewater is very important in many communities to fulfill water needs round the year. Effluent from treatment plants need advanced treatment steps for reuse applications. Primarily reused water is utilized for irrigation, and the level of treatment depends upon quality of the product, based on specific application. A few of the common tertiary treatments are:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">Polishing residual effluent from an overloaded plant that needs further treatment to fulfill BOD, TSS and ammonia-N limits for reuse applications.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">Nitrification of treated effluent from an operating plant that removes BOD only.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0019">Inactivation of pathogens (bacteria and viruses).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">Advanced treatment needs may be fulfilled by fixed film bioreactors, specifically MBBR as described herein, which are very effective for polishing application requiring limited footprint area.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">Additionally, rural communities that do not have access to a treatment plant, and depend upon septic systems, can also utilize wastewater for reuse by treating it in small package plants. Benefits of replacing septic to community based packaged treatment systems are:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0022">It eliminates leaching of septage and contamination of groundwater; it eliminates the need for periodic hauling of septage to distant and centralized treatment plants; and it can produce treated effluent suitable for reuse by disinfection.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Embodiments include integrated disinfection with bioaugmentation utilized in MBBR reactors to enable an inexpensive simple process for SCP, ATU's, and lagoons. The MBBR will be enhanced by the disinfection process in front and/or in other locations. Certain oxidants (e.g., PAA and Chlorine) will inactivate the pathogens and enhance the MBBR process. The MBBR process will degrade the disinfection by-product and refractory organics, including endocrine disrupting compound (EDC's).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Disinfection Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Disinfection is an essential step for discharge or reuse. Applying the right technology protocols for wastewater disinfection and reuse has become more complex than before in order to address several public health issues. In addition to traditional disinfection challenges for a wide range of pathogens, the generation of a larger number of potentially harmful disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and new categories of emerging pollutants such as Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) must now also be considered. Various disinfection embodiments may be used, including: chlorination, UV radiation, ozonation, peracetic acid (PAA), and ferrate along with utilization of fixed film biological reactors, particularly MBBR. Newer technologies ferrate and peracetic address the greatest number of emerging public health and environmental considerations at lower cost compared to ozonation and UV irradiation. Specifically, ferrate and peracetic acid:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0025">Produce a pathogen free effluent with respect to <i>E. coli</i>, enterococci, bacterial phages, endospores and protozoan oocysts even in wastewater effluent with high suspended and dissolved solids concentrations.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0026">Alters and converts the difficult to remove, refractory organics such as EDCs and PPCPs in wastewater effluents to degradable compounds.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0027">Does not produce harmful disinfection by-products or chlorinated intermediates.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0028">The incorporation of media based reactors will reduce the organic loading to the oxidative disinfectants.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0029">The incorporation of media based reactors will also enhance breakdown of refractory organics constituents in the reactor leading to a reduction in the demand on the oxidative disinfectants.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0030">Ferrate may also provide an additional benefit in that the iron ions may complex with phosphorus and other chemical species in anionic, colloidal and particulate forms by adsorption to the residual ferric hydroxide. This action provides a slow nutrient release to land application sites. Utilization of ferrate may also add iron as a micronutrient to accelerate plant growth. Peracetic acid is innovative and being applied in a small number of wastewater plants in the United States while being utilized in a number of facilities in Europe. In addition, the usage of ozone is becoming more economical with advances in operational controls.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0031">Data suggests that polishing the wastewater effluent with a MBBR reactor after disinfection will reduce the environmental impact of the residual organics. It should be noted that these reactors can polish effluents coming from over loaded activated sludge plants or package plants found in small communities. Data concerning this operation may be presented along with disinfection data shown in Tables 2 and 3.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none"

utilized for wastewater disinfection, there have been growing concerns of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), effluent toxicity, endocrine disruption, and other unintended environmental impacts resulting from this practice. In recent years there has been building research momentum into safer disinfection alternatives. The disinfectant Peracetic Acid (PAA) has been gaining attention for its ability to reduce or eliminate DBPs, sodium pollution, and total dissolved salts in treated water, while providing disinfection comparable to chlorine.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">PAA is a clear, colorless liquid formed by the oxidation of acetic acid by hydrogen peroxide. Its use doesn't result in halogenated byproducts or residuals, and the mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds are fewer in both quantity and composition after application of the disinfectant. PAA has bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, and sporicidal activity. It is generally thought that PAA's mode of activity is by denaturing proteins, disrupting cell wall permeability, and by oxidizing and denaturing essential cellular enzymes or proteins.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">PAA may be incorporated into injectable liquid media and pumped into a contact chamber or tank. The pump and tank would provide the mixing and contact time needed before the effluent is discharged. The PAA can be purchased as a 2% (or stronger) concentrate, which could be diluted 1: 1000 or between 1:500 to 1:1500 (PAA to water), and injected into the tank using a peristaltic or diaphragm pump.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">MBBR is a media based biological treatment system where the microbial population that carry out biological treatment remain attached as fixed films on to HDPE media surfaces and the media themselves are in constant motion due to the turbulence created by aeration. MBBR offers multiple benefits over traditional activated sludge process, as follows:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0036">Requires limited footprint area as biomass population is equivalent to 1,000 to 5,000 mg/L as suspended solids.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0037">Pre and post nitrification and denitrification and chemical phosphorus removal can be added to upgrade existing plants to nutrient removal facilities.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0038">Resilient to peak flows and shock loads.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0039">Resilient to temperature fluctuations.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0040">Resistant to toxic shocks.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0041">Free from sludge bulking due to filaments.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0007" num="0042">Simple, hands free operation.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0031" num="0043">All of the above features render MBBR very attractive as a packaged treatment system for small communities with the need to reuse treated effluent. The incorporation of MBBR reactors for post treatment (and/or pretreatment) may reduce the organic loading and refractory organic constituents on the oxidative disinfectants. Data suggests that polishing the wastewater effluent with a MBBR reactor before disinfection will reduce the environmental impact of the residual organics.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Bioaugmentation Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0044">Bioaugmentation is the process of adding selected bacteriological strains, enzymes, and other biologically active components to improve a treatment process. In short, augmentation improves the living conditions and metabolism of food sources for microbes that degrade pollutants in the treatment facility. Bioaugmentation is widely utilized in industrial and agricultural settings. For wastewater applications, bioaugmentation may be utilized as described herein in larger, municipal wastewater systems to improve the treatment process in the wastewater plant and to begin the waste break down process in the collection system, or in industry-specific cases (i.e.: paper and pulp industry). The application of bioaugmentation can have many beneficial outcomes, including reduced sludge growth in the wastewater facility; reduced odor; reduced fats, oil, and grease; enhanced breakdown of biological oxygen demanding organics and nutrients (including total nitrogen and total phosphorus); and cost savings for the owner/operator. Bioaugmentation has not yet been widely accepted for use in small ATUs and septic systems. However, with the implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) on many streams, local government officials and agencies are looking for alternative policies and technologies to improve wastewater treatment to meet stricter water quality effluent limits.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0045">Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBR) can be utilized as a type of Bioaugmentation system which employs high density polyethylene biofilm carriers operating in mixed motion within an aerated wastewater treatment basin. Each individual biocarrier increases productivity through providing protected surface area to support the growth of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria. It is this high-density population of bacteria that achieves high-rate biodegradation within the system, while also offering process reliability and ease of operation. These MBBR systems potentially provide the greatest cost-effective treatment with minimal maintenance, since MBBR processes self- maintain an optimum level of protective biofilm. Additionally, the biofilm attached to the mobile biocarriers within the system automatically responds to load fluctuations.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0046">PAA dosage may be administered based on the disinfection efficacy of indicator organisms, and the resulting effect on water quality. For example, a dosage of 5 mg/L (15%) PAA, with contact time of 20 minutes, can reduce fecal and total coliform by 4 to 5 logs in secondary effluent.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Combination of Disinfectants and MBBR Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0047">The usage of disinfectants before MBBR (e.g., upstream of MBBR) may be applied to one embodiment, and the oxidants can be used to enhance the effectiveness of the MBBR reactors by:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0048">Optimizing efficiency of ATU's.</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0049">Treating refractory organics to a degradable form.</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0050">Degrading disinfectant by-products.</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0051">Enhancing the disinfection process.</li>        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0052">Reducing EDC's.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0036" num="0053">Some concerns of ozone pretreating waste stream before MBBR process include:<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0054">Increased capital and O&#x26;M costs for facilities</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0055">Require more refined operations</li>        <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0056">Generate the disinfection by-product</li>        <li id="ul0012-0004" num="0057">Oxidize iron and manganese leading to fouling the MBBR media surfaces</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0037" num="0058">The usage of PAA could have the positive effects similar to ozone but may be less impacting. The problem with the residual acetic acid would be removed by its degradation through the MBBR reactor downstream.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Application of Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0059">With small ATU's being mandated to meet effluent discharge limits for which they were not designed, a combination of bioaugmentation (MBBR)/PAA retrofit has broad application potential for numerous small residential and commercial ATUs discharging into community ditches not only in rural parts of the United States, but worldwide.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0060">Over 40% of the small communities in Southeast Texas and Louisiana have been severely impacted by recent storms and flooding over the last year. This includes the ingress of raw sewage in these affected areas. As a result, the development of an inexpensive polishing system, which uses MBBR and the innovative disinfectant could increase the sustainability in the near future.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0061">Additionally, rural and small communities that do not have access to a treatment plant, and depend upon septic systems, can also utilize wastewater for reuse by treating it in small package MBBR based plants.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0062">Advanced treatment needs may be fulfilled by fixed film bioreactors, specifically MBBR, which are very effective for polishing application requiring limited footprint area.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0063">Certain objectives of the embodiments is to retrofit existing commercial ATUs with oxidants (Chlorine, Ferrate, and PAA)/MBBR combination to improve effluent water quality, and to improve watershed water quality. Based on municipal-scale studies, the embodiments may decrease TSS, BOD, TN, TP, fats/oil/grease, fecal bacteria, and/or odor in the effluent and decrease excess sludge build-up within the ATU. The techniques described herein may result in reduced cost to the plant owner/operator due to reduced sludge removal from the ATU.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0064">The results of the embodiments may be very relevant and beneficial specially to rural communities that do not have access to large scale treatment plants and are in need to reuse wastewater. In many cases these communities depend on septic systems, which are sources of groundwater contamination. Moreover, water hauled out as septage is essentially a loss of an important resource that could be utilized for beneficial purposes if it is properly treated. Additionally, hauling requires a very large cost due to transportation.

In the illustrated embodiment, the wastewater treatment system <b>10</b> includes a first disinfection system <b>16</b>, a MBBR system <b>18</b>, and a second disinfection system <b>20</b>. The first disinfection system <b>16</b> may be a chlorine disinfection system, a UV disinfection system, a peracetic acid disinfection system, a ferrate disinfection system, or a combination thereof, located upstream of the MBBR system <b>18</b>. The second disinfection system <b>20</b> may be a chlorine disinfection system, a UV disinfection system, a peracetic acid disinfection system, a ferrate disinfection system, or a combination thereof, located downstream of the MBBR system <b>18</b>. It is also to be noted that in certain embodiments, only the first disinfection system <b>16</b>, or only the second disinfection system <b>20</b>, may be used. Further, a third disinfection system <b>22</b> may be used as part of certain components of the MBBR system <b>18</b> (e.g., in the MBBR system <b>18</b>). The third disinfection system may be a chlorine disinfection system, a UV disinfection system, a peracetic acid disinfection system, a ferrate disinfection system, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0069">Accordingly, the influent <b>12</b> may include wastewater to be treated, such as wastewater to be treated by an ATU, SCP, lagoon, and the likes. The influent <b>12</b> may enter the first disinfection system <b>16</b>. The first disinfection system <b>16</b> may then apply disinfection techniques including chlorine disinfection, UV disinfection, peracetic acid disinfection, ferrate disinfection, or a combination thereof. Treated fluid <b>24</b> may then be directed for further processing, e.g., bioprocessing, via the MBBR system <b>18</b>. The MBBR system <b>18</b> may include one or more reactors <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>.
