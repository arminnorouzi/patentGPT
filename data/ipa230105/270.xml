However, if the snap-fit connector is stiff, it can prove difficult to disconnect the connection mechanism in order to disengage the garment hanger from a garment. When it is difficult to disconnect the garment hanger from a garment, the customer may be less inclined to try on the garment and the re-hanging time for staff is increased. Additionally, a user may damage their fingernails if the connection mechanism is too stiff.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a garment hanger comprising a rail engaging portion and garment supporting means in the form of a deformable elongate member, the end of the elongate member distal from the rail engaging portion comprising a first part of a connection mechanism such that the elongate member can be deformed back upon itself and connected to a second part of the connection mechanism of the hanger to form a closed loop, wherein the elongate member comprises a side flange along its length.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The side flange comprises a section of material that extends away from the axial direction of the elongate member to provide a region of material against which a user can provide a force, preferably using a finger or thumb and the pad thereof, to more readily release the connection mechanism. The connection mechanism, which holds the elongate member in a closed loop, retains the respective parts of the connection mechanism in engagement, but they are readily releasable, preferably in a non-destructive manner, upon sufficient force being applied to separate the parts, which is made easier by use of the side flange. Thus, the side flange makes engaging and disengaging the respective parts of the connection mechanism easier by applying a force close to one of the parts of the connection mechanism.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is preferable that the side flange is at or adjacent the end of the elongate member distal from the rail engaging portion. By positioning the side flange away from the rail engaging portion, a user can hold the rail engaging portion and use the side flange to provide a separating force to disengage the parts of the connection mechanism. Alternatively, the user may hold the side flange and push against the rail engaging portion or a body of the hanger, if present, to disengage the connection mechanism. It will be appreciated that the side flange should be positioned towards the end of the elongate member that is distal from the rail engaging portion. Thus, whilst it might not be at the free end of the elongate member, it should be adjacent thereto so that, in a closed position, pressure on the side flange moves the distal end of the elongate member away from the rail engaging portion and/or the body of the hanger.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Whilst it is preferred that the connection mechanism comprises a click-fit fastening, other mechanisms that require mechanical force to disengage may be employed. The click-fit fastening, which may be in the form of a nipple and hole, is a simple and readily mouldable arrangement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It may be the case that the rail engaging portion is a hook with an opening therein. Where a hook is employed, it may be preferable to have the side flange arranged on the same side of the hanger as the opening of the hook. This makes the device easier to hold and operate, although it will be appreciated that the hook opening and the side flange can be arranged on opposing sides of the device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one arrangement, the side flange comprises a debossed or embossed section. This allows the side flange to be provided with instructions and/or a grip section to allow it to be more readily held and/or engaged by a user and to reduce the risk of a user's finger or thumb slipping off the side flange. The grip section may be present on one or both sides.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one arrangement, the deformable elongate member comprises a least one aperture therein. This at least one aperture, which may be additional to any aperture that is required for the connection mechanism, can be used to attach the garment hanger to a garment independently from the elongate member. A flexible tie may be passed through the aperture and secured to the garment to fix the garment hanger thereto independently of threading the elongate member onto the garment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is advantageous that the side flange is less than half of the width of the elongate member and, more advantageously, the side flange is a third or a a quarter of the width of the elongate member. The side flange is thus sufficiently sized to provide a position to provide force, without being too large to hinder or prevent the elongate member being threaded through a loop on a garment, for example a belt loop. Additionally, the leading edge and/or rear edge of the side flange may be tapered or chamfered to allow the elongate member to more readily slide through a loop on a garment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the side flange extends in a direction non-parallel with the length of the elongate member. The side flange may extend in a direction that is non-parallel with the axial length of the elongate member, and it may be directed perpendicular to the length of the elongate member. The edge of the side flange may be angled to allow it to pass more readily through an aperture in one or both directions. Where one of edges is angled, the other edge may be angled to a lesser degree to make it more difficult for the hanger to disengage a garment to which it is attached.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The side flange may be provided with an aperture therein. This allows objects, such as labels, flexible ties or tags, to be attached to the hanger using the distal end of the elongate member.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention extends to a method of hanging a garment comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">providing a garment hanger according to any preceding claim;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">threading the elongate member through at least one loop of material on a garment; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">closing the elongate member by connecting the respective parts of the connection mechanism of the garment hanger.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">By engaging a loop of material on a garment, the garment hanger can be readily hung on a garment and, preferably, the garment hanger is threaded through a plurality of loops of material on the garment. This provides a reliable and secure engagement between the garment and the garment hanger.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">It is advantageous that a tie is provided through a retaining aperture in the elongate member and the tie engages one loop of material on the garment to connect the garment hanger to the garment independently from the elongate member engaging at least one loop of material of the garment. The tie engages the garment independently from the garment hanger, thereby allowing the garment hanger to be retained on the garment when the garment hanger is disengaged.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">The garment hanger of the present invention may comprise an element-receiving channel to slidably receive an information element. Employing a channel to slidably receive an element, for example a sizer, provides a convenient location to slide a sizer onto the hanger that avoids having to thread the element onto the hook of a hanger. Additionally, it can be located to avoid any interference with the internal edge of the support engaging portion, which is normally a hook. Furthermore, it can be readily accessed and easily applied and removed. In an advantageous arrangement, the information element is applied to the channel from a direction non-perpendicular to the length of the channel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">It is preferable that at least one end of the channel is arranged adjacent the edge of the hanger. Having the channel positioned adjacent the edge of the hanger allows the end of the channel to be substantially open at at least one end to allow the information element to be readily positioned and slid onto, and from, the garment hanger. The open end of the channel makes the application and removal easier, particularly if the axial length of the channel is adjacent an edge of the hanger.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">In one arrangement, the channel comprises a lip at, or adjacent, one end. This reduces the risk of inadvertent disengagement of the element because the element can be positioned within the channel and the lip can abut an end of the element and provide some resistance to disengagement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Advantageously, the channel is located on a hook portion or a body portion of the garment hanger, which provides an easily visible location for customers to see the information.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">It is preferable that at least a portion of the hook and/or body portion of the hanger is substantially planar and the element-receiving channel is located on that planar portion.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Where there is a planar or flat section, it is easier to apply and remove the element to/from the hanger. The whole hanger may comprise a planar material or just part of the hanger may be made of the planar material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">The invention extends to a garment hanger assembly comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0026">a garment hanger as described herein; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0027">an information element;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">wherein the information element slidably engages the element-receiving channel of the garment hanger and is retained therein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">The arrangement of a garment hanger and slidable information element engaging the garment hanger provides a readily replaceable information element that can be reliably retained on the hanger and quickly changed, when needed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">It is preferable that the information element comprises a substantially U-shaped recess that engages the garment hanger and, more preferably, the information element has protrusions or teeth that abut the walls of the element-receiving channel when engaged on the garment hanger. This allows the element to wrap around the hanger and to grip onto the hanger, within the element-receiving channel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">Advantageously, the garment hanger and the information element are made from polypropylene. Employing the same material for both parts allows the combination to be readily recycled without having to disengage the parts beforehand.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0032">An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a garment hanger in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b></figref> shows a front view of the garment hanger of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a rear view of the garment hanger of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the lower part of the garment hanger of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a closed position; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref> shows further detail on an information element channel of the garment hanger of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and an information element for reception therein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>8</b></figref> show a garment hanger arrangement <b>10</b> comprising a garment hanger <b>12</b>, an information element in the form of a sizer <b>14</b> that is slidably engageable with, or connectable to, the garment hanger <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">The garment hanger <b>12</b> comprises a support-engaging portion in the form of a hook <b>16</b>, a body section <b>18</b> and a deformable elongate member <b>20</b>, the elongate member <b>20</b> comprising a first part of a connection mechanism <b>22</b> and the hanger having a second part of a connection mechanism <b>24</b> positioned away from the first part of the connection mechanism <b>22</b>, such that the elongate member <b>20</b> can be deformed back upon itself and connected to the hanger <b>12</b> to form a loop. The end of the elongate member <b>20</b> distal from the support-engaging portion <b>16</b> is narrower than the span of the support engaging portion <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">The first part of the connection mechanism <b>22</b> is in the form of an aperture arranged at the end of the elongate member <b>20</b> that is distal from the support-engaging hook <b>16</b>. The second part of the connection mechanism <b>24</b> is in the form of a nipple arranged at the end of the elongate member <b>20</b> that is proximal to the support-engaging hook <b>16</b>, or on the body section <b>18</b>. The aperture <b>22</b> is sized to fit over the nipple <b>24</b> so that the parts releasably engage but can be readily released. It will be appreciated that the parts may be reversed so that the nipple and aperture are in reverse positions. Alternatively, other connection or fastening mechanisms may be employed, such as hook-and-eye, poppers or other arrangements that retain the hanger in a closed position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">In the embodiment shown in the Figures, although it may be optional, the elongate member <b>22</b> comprises two pre-determined weakened regions <b>26</b> and may include a third predetermined weakened region <b>28</b>. The predetermined weakened regions <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> allow the elongate member <b>20</b>, when it is in its deformed state to form a triangular loop that may have a substantially flat spacer <b>30</b> at the intended lower end of the triangular loop so that an item rests upon the substantially flat spacer <b>30</b>, when in use.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">Extending laterally from the end of the elongate member <b>20</b> is a side flange <b>32</b>, which is provided with embossed grips <b>33</b>. The side flange <b>32</b> is sized to allow a user to provide a force against the distal end of the elongate member <b>20</b> to either open or close the connection mechanism. This assists with providing sufficient force for the first part of the connection mechanism, aperture <b>22</b> to engage the second part of the connection mechanism, nipple <b>24</b> or to release the same.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">The hook <b>16</b> is provided with a channel <b>34</b>, which is shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The channel <b>34</b> has a pair of parallel depressions <b>36</b> either side of a central ridge <b>38</b> and comprises a first section <b>40</b> and a second section <b>42</b>, divided by a lateral ridge <b>44</b>. The channel <b>34</b> is closed at one end <b>46</b> and open at the other end <b>48</b>, so that a sizer element <b>14</b> can slidably engage the channel <b>34</b> through the open end <b>48</b> and abut the closed end <b>46</b>. Whilst the channel <b>34</b> may be provided on just one side of the hanger, it is provided on both sides of the hanger <b>12</b> in the embodiment shown in the Figures.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">The sizer <b>14</b> is cuboid shaped, although other shapes may be employed, and has a U-shaped recess <b>50</b> along on edge.
