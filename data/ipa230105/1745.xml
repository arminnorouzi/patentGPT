In this way, the sipes <b>41</b> can improve wet grip performance during the progress of the wear on of the tread land portion <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, the widened portion <b>51</b> of the present embodiment includes three tubular portions <b>52</b> with different lengths in the tire radial direction A. The three tubular portions <b>52</b> extend from a bottom of the sipe outwardly in the tire radial direction A at different positions in the sipe longitudinal direction D. The tubular portions <b>52</b> have larger sipe widths than positions adjacent in the sipe longitudinal direction D.
