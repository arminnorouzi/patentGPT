The liquid detection sensors are disposed in places where liquid leakage and water flooding have to be prevented. The liquid detection sensors detect electrical changes generated when contacting a liquid from the outside, thereby detecting liquid leakage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a liquid detection sensor, there is, for example, a liquid detection sensor for medical sites having a water battery which generates electric power by a liquid having leaked out (International Publication No. WO2012/020507). In International Publication No. WO2012/020507, the water battery is fixed on an absorbing member with a fixing tape having tackiness, and a liquid such as blood or a drip solution absorbed and diffused in the absorbing member being supplied to a whole water battery causes the water battery to generate electric power and detect liquid leakage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, as a liquid detection sensor, there is, for example, a liquid detection sensor for medical sites having a liquid leakage sensor section composed of a magnesium battery (Japanese Patent Application Publication Laid-Open No. 2017-148332). In Japanese Patent Application Publication Laid-Open No. 2017-148332, the magnesium battery is one in which a positive electrode sheet, a catalyst sheet, a sheet-form separator and a negative electrode sheet are laminated in order; and the liquid detection sensor has a signal transmitting unit that is electrically connected to the liquid leakage sensor section and transmits a detection signal by electric power of the magnesium battery, and a signal receiving terminal having a signal receiving unit that receives the detection signal transmitted from the signal transmitting unit and alarm means that issues an alarm about a liquid leakage state based on the detection signal from the signal transmitting unit.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The liquid leakage sensor section detects, as a liquid leakage state, the state in which the magnesium battery using, as an electrolytic solution, blood or an injection solution having leaked from an injection needle generates electric power.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The liquid leakage has to be detected precisely; however, in the liquid detection sensors of Patent Literatures 1 and 2, in which blood or the like being an object to be detected functions as an electrolytic solution, no proposal is specially made except for detection of blood and the like in medical sites as liquid objects to be detected.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, the detection of liquid leakage and water flooding is demanded not only in medical sites but also in wide-ranging fields such as buildings, underground facilities and factories, and liquid detection sensors may be required to exhibit general purpose usability including detection of water or oil. The liquid detection sensors of Patent Literatures 1 and 2, however, are poor in the general purpose usability as described above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With regard to imparting a liquid detection sensor with the general purpose usability, when liquid leakage and water flooding in a building, an underground facility, a factory or the like is monitored by using the liquid detection sensor, a monitor monitors the liquid leakage and water flooding at a place at some distance from the site of the liquid leakage and water flooding. In order for the liquid detection sensor to securely transmit an alarm signal to the place at some distance from the site of liquid leakage and water flooding, the electric power generation performance of a battery mounted in the liquid detection sensor needs to be improved.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">When a metal-air battery is used as an electric power source mounted in a liquid detection sensor, use of an alkaline metal salt such as sodium chloride or potassium chloride as an electrolyte sometimes improves the electric power generation performance of the metal-air battery. For example, an alkaline metal salt may be incorporated previously in a separator of a metal-air battery, and when the separator containing the alkaline metal salt contacts water being a liquid being an object to be detected, an action of the water containing the alkaline metal salt improves the ionic conductivity between a positive electrode and a negative electrode, whereby the metal-air battery can exhibit an excellent electric power generation performance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the long-term installation of a liquid detection sensor in the state that the alkaline metal salt is contained in the separator sometimes causes the alkaline metal salt in the separator to absorb moisture and be liquefied and to result in deteriorating the negative electrode of the metal-air battery. The deterioration of the negative electrode of the metal-air battery during the long-term installation of the liquid detection sensor poses such a problem that liquid leakage and water flooding cannot precisely be detected.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In consideration of the above situation, the present disclosure has an object to provide a liquid detection sensor which has the general purpose usability and can prevent the deterioration of a metal-air battery being an electric power source even when the liquid detection sensor is installed for a long term, and in which the metal-air battery being an electric power source can exhibit an excellent electric power generation performance.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The gist of the constitution of the present disclosure is as follows.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">[1] A liquid detection sensor, comprising a metal-air battery having a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and an electrolytic solution-forming component positioned between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, wherein the electrolytic solution-forming component is enclosed in an inside of a resin-made bag; and a resin of the resin-made bag has dissolvability or dispersibility in a liquid being an object to be detected.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">[2] The liquid detection sensor according to [1], wherein the resin of the resin-made bag is a water-soluble resin or an oil-soluble resin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">[3] The liquid detection sensor according to [1] or [2], wherein the resin-made bag having the electrolytic solution-forming component enclosed therein is one or plural in number.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">[4] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [3], further comprising a support member having voids and supporting the positive electrode and the negative electrode, between the positive electrode and the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">[5] The liquid detection sensor according to [4], wherein the resin-made bag having the electrolytic solution-forming component enclosed therein is carried by the support member.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">[6] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [5], wherein the resin-made bag having the electrolytic solution-forming component enclosed therein is disposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">[7] The liquid detection sensor according to [4], wherein the resin-made bag having the electrolytic solution-forming component enclosed therein is disposed between the support member and the positive electrode and/or between the support member and the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">[8] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [7], wherein the electrolytic solution-forming component comprises water, an alkaline metal salt, or an aqueous solution of an alkaline metal salt.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">[9] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [8], wherein an active material of the negative electrode comprises at least one metal selected from the group consisting of magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), lithium (Li), calcium (Ca), and zinc (Zn).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">[10] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [9], having a notifying unit that receives electric power of the metal-air battery and notifies detection of a liquid.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">[11] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [9], having a notifying unit capable of wireless signal transmission of a detection signal of the metal-air battery to a signal receiving unit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">[12] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [11], wherein the liquid detection sensor is a water detection sensor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">[13] The liquid detection sensor according to any one of [1] to [11], wherein the liquid detection sensor is an oil detection sensor.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the aspect of the above [1], when a liquid being an object to be detected by the liquid detection sensor contacts the resin-made bag of the metal-air battery, the resin-made bag is dissolved in the liquid being an object to be detected and the electrolytic solution-forming component enclosed in the inside of the resin-made bag is thereby released in between the positive electrode and the negative electrode of the metal-air battery. The release of the electrolytic solution-forming component in between the positive electrode and the negative electrode of the metal-air battery leads to generation of electric power or an improvement in the electric power generation performance, and the liquid detection sensor, by the electric power generation of the metal-air battery, notifies to the outside that the liquid being an object to be detected has been detected.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to aspects of the liquid detection sensor of the present disclosure, because the electrolytic solution-forming component of the metal-air battery being an electric power source is enclosed in the inside of the resin-made bag having dissolvability in a liquid being an object to be detected, by suitably selecting the resin kind of the resin-made bag, the general purpose usability including detection of water and detection of an oil is improved.
