Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Approaches to judging the integrity of a bolt in use to decide whether it can continuously be used or not include a process for evaluating the deterioration of the material of the bolt by measuring the hardness of the bolt and observing changes in the metallographic structure of the bolt and a process for evaluating the deterioration of the material of the bolt by measuring a time-depending change in the elongation of the bolt due to creep. The latter process that directly measures elongation is useful as a simple process and is widely used on high-temperature parts (JP-2004-225692-A).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent document 1: JP-2004-225692-A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A number of stud bolts are used to fasten upper and lower half casings for steam turbines to each other.

In this case, the overall length M and the length N (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) of the lower jaw <b>22</b> are limited because the lower jaw <b>22</b> needs to pass through the minimum-diameter portion of the central hole <b>13</b>, possibly resulting in a failure to reach the end face of the lower end of the stud bolt <b>6</b> beyond the beveled edge <b>14</b> the lower end of the stud bolt <b>6</b> around the central hole <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the present embodiment, on the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the portion <b>37</b> of the rod <b>21</b> for abutment against the inner circumferential surface of the stud bolt <b>6</b> that defines the minimum-diameter portion of the central hole <b>13</b> has the beveled corner, and has its cross-sectional shape progressively narrower in the direction along which the lower jaw <b>22</b> extends.

Stated otherwise, the rod <b>21</b> that has the square cross-sectional shape is advantageous in that since it has flat outer surfaces, it is easy to provide the main scale <b>39</b> on one of the flat outer surfaces.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">(3) Since the rod <b>21</b> is guided by the slit <b>35</b> in the cap <b>25</b> to move radially of the stud bolt <b>6</b>, the cap <b>25</b> can be fitted into the central hole <b>13</b> and the rod <b>21</b> can be inserted into the central hole <b>13</b> in random order. The length of the stud bolt <b>6</b> can be measured after the rod <b>21</b> has been fixed to the slider <b>23</b> by the screw clamp <b>32</b> and the length measuring jig <b>20</b> has been pulled out of the stud bolt <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">To achieve the primary advantage (1) referred to above, the slit <b>35</b> in the cap <b>25</b> may be shaped to match the cross-sectional shape of the rod <b>21</b> such that the rod <b>21</b> is not movable radially of the cap <b>25</b> when the rod <b>21</b> is inserted through the cap <b>25</b>. According to such a modification, the length of the stud bolt <b>6</b> can be measured by first inserting the rod <b>21</b> into the central hole <b>13</b> and then lowering the cap <b>25</b> down the rod <b>21</b> until the cap <b>25</b> is fitted into the central hole <b>13</b>. Providing the inner wall surface <b>36</b> has enough positional accuracy, the rod <b>21</b> is placed in a desired length measuring position by fitting the cap <b>25</b> into the central hole <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">(4) As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the lower jaw <b>22</b> is progressively thinner toward the upper jaw <b>24</b>. Consequently, the measuring surface <b>43</b> abuts against the end face of the lower end of the stud bolt <b>6</b> nearly in linear contact therewith when the rod <b>21</b> inserted in the central hole <b>13</b> is pulled upwardly. The measuring surface <b>43</b> that abuts against the end face of the lower end of the stud bolt <b>6</b> nearly in linear contact therewith is effective to restrain a reduction in the accuracy with which to measure the length of the stud bolt <b>6</b> due to irregular localized contact which otherwise occurs between the measuring surface <b>43</b> and the end face of the lower end of the stud bolt <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">(5) As described above, it is possible to measure the length of the stud bolt <b>6</b> by measuring the distance between the measuring surfaces <b>33</b> and <b>43</b> after the length measuring jig <b>20</b> has been removed from the stud bolt <b>6</b>. However, when the length measuring jig <b>20</b> is pulled out of the stud bolt <b>6</b>, the rod <b>21</b> may possibly be displaced with respect to the slider <b>23</b>, resulting in a reduction in the accuracy with which to measure the length of the stud bolt <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the present embodiment, on the other hand, since the slider <b>23</b> and the rod <b>21</b> have the respective graduated scales <b>31</b> and <b>39</b>, the length of the stud bolt <b>6</b> can be measured from a reading of the graduated scales <b>31</b> and <b>39</b> without removing the length measuring jig <b>20</b> from the stud bolt <b>6</b> while the measuring surfaces <b>33</b> and <b>43</b> are clamping the stud bolt <b>6</b> therebetween.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE CHARACTERS</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0059"><b>1</b>: Casing (product)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0060"><b>2</b>: Lower half casing (first part)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0061"><b>3</b>: Upper half casing (second part)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0062"><b>6</b>: Stud bolt</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0063"><b>7</b>: Nut</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0064"><b>11</b>: Threaded portion (threaded portion on one side in longitudinal direction)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0065"><b>12</b>: Threaded portion (threaded portion on other side in longitudinal direction)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0066"><b>13</b>: Central hole</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0067"><b>20</b>: Length measuring jig</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0068"><b>21</b>: Rod</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0069"><b>22</b>: Lower jaw (first jaw)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0070"><b>23</b>: Slider</li>    <li id="ul0001-0013" num="0071"><b>24</b>: Upper jaw (second jaw)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0014" num="0072"><b>25</b>: Cap</li>    <li id="ul0001-0015" num="0073"><b>35</b>: Slit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0016" num="0074"><b>42</b>: Hook</li>    <li id="ul0001-0017" num="0075">B: Diameter of minimum-diameter portion of central hole</li>    <li id="ul0001-0018" num="0076">F: Distance from central axis</li>    <li id="ul0001-0019" num="0077">O: Central axis</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
