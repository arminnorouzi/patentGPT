In high-power applications, two boost converters are often interleaved to improve the performance and reduce the size of converter. For high-current applications and voltage step-up, the currents through the solid-state switches are just fractions of the input current. Interleaving also doubles the effective switching frequency and allows the size of energy-storage inductors and EMI filter components to be reduced. This also reduces input and output ripples in the current. The switches are used to time the power phase of each converter. Typically, the two converters alternate in operation so that their power cycles are 180 degrees out of phase.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Power Factor Correction (PFC) converters are used for improved power quality and improved efficiency. Passive PFC may be performed using tuned LC filters, but these may have a limited frequency and power range. Active PFC uses actively controlled solid-state switches in association with passive elements. The switches allow the PFC converter to operate in different modes. A PFC boost converter boosts the input voltage for a higher output voltage.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A method and apparatus are described for controlling the phase of an interleaved boost converter using cycle ring time.

The two converters are switched on and off independently so that the on time of each converter is regulated separately. By controlling the on times, the phase between the two converters can be maintained close to 180 degrees so that the power output is interleaved. As described herein, the on time has two dimensions. The first is the duration that a converter is drawing power from the input. In a simple single MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) switch converter circuit, this on time is the time during which the switch is on. The second dimension is the time at which the gate is switched on. This is directly related to the phase or period of the converter switch.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of a DC-DC (Direct Current to Direct Current) interleaved boost converter <b>100</b> with an application <b>102</b> and a control system <b>104</b>. The application <b>102</b> receives a DC input voltage <b>110</b> which is divided into two interleaved converters. The first converter receives the DC input voltage <b>110</b> at a first inductor <b>112</b> in series with a first diode <b>120</b> coupled to the converter voltage output <b>124</b>. A drain of a switch <b>130</b> in the form of a MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) is coupled between the first inductor <b>112</b> and the first diode <b>120</b>. While a MOSFET is shown, other transistor types, such as bipolar transistors and other materials may be used such as GaN or SiC, among others, to suit different loads and input voltages. The source of the switch is coupled to ground. The second converter receives the DC input voltage <b>110</b> at a second inductor <b>116</b> in series with the DC input voltage <b>110</b> on one side of the inductor and in series with a second diode <b>122</b> on the other side of the inductor. The output nodes of the two diodes are coupled together at the converter output <b>124</b> opposite the inductors <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>. A drain of a second switch <b>132</b> in the form of a second MOSFET is coupled between the second inductor <b>116</b> and the second diode <b>122</b>. The source of the first switch <b>130</b> and of the second switch <b>132</b> are both coupled to ground. The second converter has the same converter output <b>124</b> coupled to the outputs of the two diodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. The output has a filter <b>128</b> in the form of parallel capacitor but a more complex filter may be used to suit different loads and input voltages. A load <b>126</b> is coupled to the converter output <b>124</b> and shown here as within the application. The load may be any type of energy storage or energy consumption device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the gate of a converter is ON, a power phase starts with a primary stroke as power is drawn from the input and stored in the inductor. Then during a secondary stroke of the power phase power is drawn from the input and delivered to the output. Also, the energy stored in the inductor is delivered to the output. When the current becomes zero, a ringing phase starts.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The two switches <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> are controlled by cycle-by-cycle controller <b>140</b> that generates respective first and second drive signals <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>. The cycle-by-cycle controller <b>140</b>, also referred to as the cycle controller, adjusts the first and second drive signals <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> such that phase can be adjusted and the total power is regulated. The current through the respective two diodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> therefore is interleaved and shifted in time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A 180 degree phase difference means that the second converter turns on at a time that is exactly half-way between two turn on times of the first converter. Under some circumstances, the power from the two converters to the output alternates. At low input voltages each converter may be turned on for more than half of its cycle. As a result, the power phases of the converters overlap. At high input voltage the diode conducting time may be more than half of the converter's cycle. In this case both diodes are conducting at the same time, although one of the diodes may be at a higher current because of the phase difference of the converters.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A differential ON time generation circuit <b>158</b> receives an ON time input <b>160</b> from an external controller (not shown) and a phase difference signal from a phase controller <b>156</b>.

The graph shows inductor current of one of the converters on the vertical axis against time on the horizontal axis. The solid-state switches of an interleaved PFC boost converter allow the converter to be operated in different modes. For medium and high-power applications, a CCM (Continuous Conduction Mode) is common. The CCM has a continuous input current which results in low conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">The first mode <b>302</b> represents CCM in which the inductor current never reaches zero and so the converter is conducting continuously. At the start of a power phase <b>310</b>, the inductor current has reached its lowest point and the cycle-by-cycle controller turns the gate of the converter switch to ON. The inductor current increases through a primary stroke <b>312</b> reaching a peak at a point <b>314</b> corresponding to the transition to a secondary stroke. The duration of the primary stroke is the gate ON time indicated as torr. After the gate is switched off the current declines through the secondary stroke <b>316</b> until the end of the period of the power cycle as defined by the primary stroke and the secondary stroke. The end of the second stroke <b>318</b> corresponds to the beginning of the next period and the start of the next primary stroke.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">If the entire period is viewed as 360 degrees by analogy to sine waves, 180 degrees is exactly the middle. If the two converters are interleaved so that the primary stroke of the second converter starts at the midpoint of the period of the second converter and the point <b>314</b> is exactly in the middle, then the input current of the interleaved converter will be approximately a constant current. As the first converter inductor current is decreasing, the second converter inductor current is increasing. The position of the peak at the point <b>314</b> is dependent on input voltage and output voltage of the converter at low mains voltages, the peak is closer to the end and at high mains voltages, the peak is closer to the beginning. The output voltage is controlled to a value, the ripple voltage, caused by switching, for example may be further reduced with additional filtering as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">The second mode <b>304</b> is commonly referred to as BCM (Boundary Conduction Mode) or sometimes as CrCM (Critical Conduction Mode). In this mode, the primary and secondary stroke are very similar except that the gate of the converter switch is only turned ON when the inductor current reaches zero. The initial zero crossing <b>320</b> is the beginning of the primary stroke <b>322</b> of the ON time in the BCM mode <b>304</b>. At the peak current time <b>324</b> the transition is made and the switch is set to OFF. The inductor current decreases during the secondary stroke <b>326</b> until a zero crossing <b>328</b>. The period in BCM mode may be increased by increasing the ON time and thereby increasing the primary stroke. The secondary stroke will accordingly become longer as well. Increasing the period also increases the inductor current as the current becomes higher during the primary stroke. The described control loop of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be used to change the ON time of a primary or master converter to increase or decrease the inductor current and the period. The secondary or slave converter may be matched to that period time or ON duration by adjusting the ON time of both converters, e.g., increasing the torr of one converter while decreasing the torr of the other converter. The timing may be adjusted through the phase detector and phase controller until the entire period is aligned to be out of phase with the first converter. In some embodiments, the phase between the two interleaved converters is aligned by adjusting only the duration of the switch ON time of both converters. This does not necessarily require adjustments to a ringing phase of the converters.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">The third mode <b>306</b> is commonly referred to as DCM (Discontinuous Conduction Mode) because the inductor current (=input current) has a dead period where no power is delivered. There is an added delay after the secondary stroke before the next primary stroke. In the DCM mode <b>306</b>, the first stroke begins at a zero inductor current crossing time <b>330</b> with the switch turned ON. The primary stroke <b>332</b> extends through a current rise time and a peak inductor current <b>334</b> at which the switch ON time is ended and the inductor current falls during the second stroke <b>336</b> to a zero inductor current crossing <b>338</b>. Instead of starting the next period at the end of this power phase, the switch remains off for an additional time <b>340</b> during a ringing phase. The end of the ringing phase is the end of the period <b>342</b> at which time the next power phase begins with another primary stroke <b>332</b> by turning the switch to ON with a drive signal from the cycle-by-cycle converter.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">The power phase may be considered as the time during which power is drawn from the input node. The ringing phase is a time during which the inductor current is ringing around zero current due to the inductor value and the and capacitance of the physical circuit. The drain voltage of the MOSFET switch rings around the input voltage in this phase. If the amplitude of the drain voltage ringing is below the threshold of the output diode, then no power will reach the output node during the ringing phase.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph of the voltage measured at two different locations and the measured inductor current to characterize the ringing phase as in a DCM mode. At <b>402</b>, the drain voltage is graphed on the vertical axis against time on the horizontal axis. At time <b>408</b> a power phase <b>410</b> begins with the gate enabled or ON. The gate is enabled for a time determined as torr and then it is disabled. The drain voltage immediately rises. The start of the ringing phase may be measured in different ways. One suitable event is when the drain voltage begins to fall as shown at time <b>412</b>. Another suitable event is when the drain voltage hits zero as shown at time <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">At <b>404</b> the voltage of the auxiliary winding of the inductor is shown. This voltage is similar to that of the drain and the same suitable occurrences apply as with the drain voltage. The shape of the curve is the same as for the drain voltage only the average value of the drain voltage <b>402</b> is Vin and the average value of the AUX voltage <b>404</b> is 0. The zero crossing <b>416</b> of the AUX voltage is a good start time for the ringing phase because a zero crossing is easy to detect.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">At <b>406</b> the inductor current is shown on the vertical axis against time. At the time <b>412</b> when the power phase <b>410</b> ends, the inductor current has a zero crossing. It then starts ringing and has a second zero crossing at a second later time <b>418</b>. This time corresponds to a first valley in the ringing voltage of the drain voltage <b>402</b> and the inductor auxiliary winding voltage <b>404</b>. Any one or more of these events may be used to determine a start time for the ringing phase.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">The end of the ringing phase <b>420</b> marks the beginning of the next power phase. The gate is enabled for the duration of the ON time. The primary stroke begins. At the end of the ON time, the gate is disabled and the inductor current reduces until the start <b>422</b> of the next ringing phase. In DCM mode, the duration of the ON time is regulated to control the output of the converter and the duration of the ringing phase.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">While any time may be selected for the start of the next power phase, the switch operates best when the voltage across the transistor channel is as close as possible to zero volts. This may be referred to as a valley for the drain or inductor measurement. The time of the ringing phase is accordingly adjusted to align with a valley. The positions of the valleys are determined by the physical characteristics of the converter circuit and may vary with design and process as well as with the operating frequency and temperature. Selecting a specific valley for the end of the ringing phase may be referred to as a valley lock. As compared to BCM and CCM, DCM uses an additional control mechanism to interleave the two converters. The period in DCM mode may be regulated first with an ON time as with BCM and CCM. The period is also regulated in part with a second parameter of the duration of the ringing phase which may be done using valley lock. The valley lock determines how long the period is extended by the ringing phase past the end of the power phase and the system stays on the same valley through each cycle or period.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph of an example of a suitable measure of a converter such as the drain voltage, auxiliary winding voltage, or another suitable indicator, on the vertical axis plotted against time on the horizontal axis. After a power phase, the voltage starts to ring and transitions through a first valley <b>510</b>, a second valley <b>512</b>, a third valley <b>513</b> and more. There may be many more valleys depending on the damping factor of the ringing. The damping factor like the oscillation frequency of the ringing is determined by the physical characteristics of the converter at the time. The controller may select any of the three valleys or a subsequent valley, such as the eighth, twelfth, or another valley. The controller may also determine the oscillation frequency of the ringing <b>515</b> of the converter by measuring the time between valleys or between zero crossings. The oscillation frequency may be affected by the damping factor but will be about the same value for nearby valleys. For the inductor auxiliary winding, the zero voltage value is marked on the highest dashed horizontal line. For the drain voltage the highest dashed line corresponds to the input voltage, Vin, and the lowest horizontal dotted line is corresponds to zero voltage. The measurement of the oscillation time of the ringing phase, i.e., the master ringing phase time, can be from the same converter cycle or from previous cycles and then filtered. So, when in certain situations no measurements can be made a stored value can be recalled and used.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">For an interleaved converter, the two converters should be separated by 180 degrees. With the valley lock, a primary converter, referred to as the master converter, may be controlled and operated. In some instances, the secondary converter, referred to as the slave converter, may be controlled and operated with the same valley lock. In this case, the number of valleys for the master is counted and the same number of valleys is counted and directly applied to the slave. However, in some instances, the oscillation frequency in the ringing phase may not align with the oscillation of the master converter. If the ringing phase time is copied from the master to the slave, then the time may not correspond to a valley. If the number of valleys is copied from the master to the slave, then the ringing time may not correspond to that of the master. In either case, the duration of the ringing phase may be adjusted to be more suitable for the slave.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is graph of the first and second cycle signals to show copying a master ringing phase time to the slave converter. The first cycle signal <b>602</b>, for example one of the signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> from the first converter has a power phase <b>604</b> during which power is applied to the output and a ringing phase <b>606</b> during which the voltage output is blocked by the output diode. The duration of the ringing phase <b>606</b> is controlled by the first drive signal that drives the switching transistor in the first converter. At a selected valley <b>612</b>, the drive signal goes high and the gate of the transistor is enabled. This ends the ringing phase <b>606</b> and starts a new power phase. The duration of the ringing phase <b>606</b> can be measured from different start times but ends with the selected valley <b>612</b> which is a local minimum of the first cycle signal <b>602</b>. In this example a master time duration <b>608</b> starts with a first zero crossing <b>610</b> of the first cycle signal <b>602</b> and ends at the last valley of the ringing phase. This time duration may be determined by an external controller to control the output power of the converter, the frequency of the converter, or based on other parameters of the converter operation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">The second cycle signal <b>622</b> also has a power phase <b>624</b> and a ringing phase <b>626</b>. The second cycle signal is delayed with respect to the first cycle signal <b>602</b> by an amount approximately equal to 180 degrees or one-half cycle so that the outputs of the two converters are interleaved. The slave ringing phase time is determined as starting at an analogous or corresponding point, a first zero crossing <b>630</b> of the second cycle signal, to the master ringing phase. The second cycle signal <b>622</b> of the slave has an oscillation frequency <b>628</b> which is higher than that of the master for shorter wavelengths. As shown, the oscillation frequency is measured based on a time between zero crossings <b>630</b> in the ringing phase but any other measure may be made. The oscillation frequency is subject to damping, perturbations, and other effects and will change over time so that for a long ringing phase with many valleys, the oscillation frequency for later valleys may be different from the oscillation frequency for earlier valleys. In some embodiments the oscillation frequency is measured using the second and third zero crossings, but any other positions may be used. Multiple measurements may be averaged for longer ringing phase times. Alternatively, the measured oscillation time can be a result determined by measuring earlier cycles and the results may also be filtered.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">The master time duration <b>608</b> is applied to the second cycle signal <b>622</b>, however as shown, the master time duration does not end at a local minimum or valley of the second cycle signal. Instead, the master time duration ends at time <b>632</b> just after a peak <b>633</b> or local maximum of the second cycle signal. Instead of switching the second converter to ON at the maximum, the next valley <b>638</b> is chosen. The slave ringing phase time is longer than the master time duration <b>608</b> so that the power phase of the second converter begins at a next valley <b>638</b> of the second cycle signal. The time duration indicated as t<sub>ring_actual </sub><b>636</b> is the actual time at which a switching decision is made at the cycle-by-cycle controller.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">At the end of the actual time <b>636</b> at the current valley <b>634</b> the slave ringing time measurement is equal to t<sub>ring_actual </sub>and the cycle-by-cycle controller compares the slave curve to the copied master time duration <b>608</b> ending after the next peak at time <b>632</b>. The cycle-by-cycle controller can choose the current valley at <b>634</b> or wait at least one valley at <b>638</b>, if, for example, the distance from the current valley <b>634</b> is more than a half oscillation time away from the end of the copied master ringing phase time at <b>632</b>, as shown. This test may be performed at each cycle and at each valley on each cycle. The check may be expressed as: t<sub>ring_master</sub>&#x2212;&#xbd;t<sub>osc</sub>&#x2264;t<sub>ring_actual</sub>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">The slave cycle is always lagging behind the master cycle so that a current master time duration may be applied to the current slave cycle as the cycles occur. When the oscillation frequency of the master and the oscillation frequency <b>628</b> of the slave are exactly the same then the master time duration can be copied to the slave and both converters will switch to the power phase in the valleys. However, due to, for example, spread in inductor values or parasitic capacitances between the two converters, the oscillation frequencies may not always be the same. The adjustment shown from the master time duration to the next valley ensures that the slave also uses valley switching.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph of the first and second cycle signals to show a different situation of copying a master ringing phase time to the slave converter. In this example the oscillation time of the ringing of the slave is a little longer so that the near valley <b>738</b> is the valley before the end of the master time duration <b>732</b> which falls before a peak <b>733</b> of the second cycle signal <b>722</b> in the ringing phase <b>726</b>. In other words, the closest valley to the end of the master time duration <b>708</b> is the valley at the end of the actual time <b>736</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">As in the previous example, the first cycle signal <b>702</b> of the master converter has a power phase <b>704</b> and a ringing phase <b>706</b>. The time duration <b>708</b> of the ringing phase <b>706</b> is measured from a first zero crossing <b>710</b> at the end of the power phase <b>704</b> to the bottom of the last valley <b>712</b> when the master converter is switched on. When the master converter is switched on a new power phase begins and the ringing phase ends. This time duration is applied to the second cycle signal <b>722</b> of the slave starting at the first zero crossing <b>730</b> at the end of the power phase <b>724</b> of the second cycle signal <b>722</b>. At the moment that the actual time, t<sub>actual_time</sub>, <b>736</b> reaches a near valley <b>738</b>, the distance to the end of the master time duration at <b>732</b> is less than a half oscillation time away. As a result, the cycle-by-cycle controller switches the slave controller at the time of the bottom of that near valley <b>738</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">A similar approach may be applied using cycle signals from other aspects of the converter circuits such as transistor drain current, among others. As further alternatives, a similar result may be obtained using different techniques. In some embodiments, the time duration of the master ringing phase time is based not on a particular time duration, e.g., milliseconds or microseconds, but on a number of valleys <b>634</b>, <b>638</b> of the ringing phase of the cycle signal. The valley number may then be applied to the second cycle signal from the slave converter by counting the number of valleys in the second cycle signal from the slave converter. This approach will interfere with the interleaving phase relationship at the output when the spread between the oscillation frequency of the master is too different from the oscillation frequency of the ringing phase of the slave. When the ringing frequency difference is great and the valley number is large the disparity may become so large that the slave converter may never be switched on. Accordingly, the examples above show selecting the closest valley number of the slave that matches to the ringing time of the master.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">The selection of the closest valley may be expressed mathematically as</p><p id="p-0077" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>choose earlier valley if <i>t</i><sub>ring_master</sub>&#x2212;&#xbd;<i>t</i><sub>osc</sub><i>&#x2264;t</i><sub>ring_actual </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0078" num="0000">wherein t<sub>ring_master </sub>is the time duration of the master ringing phase, t<sub>ocs </sub>is the oscillation period time of the slave ringing phase time, and t<sub>ring_actual </sub>is the time duration to the local minimum at the moment the decision is made to take this valley or a later one.

The second cycle signal <b>822</b> of the slave has an oscillation frequency <b>828</b> which is higher than that of the master for shorter wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">The master time duration <b>808</b> is applied to the second cycle signal <b>822</b> and ends at time <b>832</b> just after a peak <b>833</b> or local maximum of the second cycle signal. Instead of switching the second converter to ON at the maximum, the next valley <b>838</b> is chosen. The slave ringing phase time is longer than the master time duration <b>808</b> so that the power phase of the second converter begins at a next valley <b>838</b> of the second cycle signal. The time duration indicated as t<sub>ring_actual </sub><b>836</b> is the actual time at which a switching decision is made at the cycle-by-cycle controller. At the end of the actual time at the current zero crossing <b>834</b> the slave ringing time measurement is equal to t<sub>ring_actual </sub>and the cycle-by-cycle controller compares the slave curve to the copied master time duration <b>808</b> ending after the next peak at time <b>832</b>. The cycle-by-cycle controller can choose the next valley, on quarter cycle later or wait at least for the subsequent valley <b>838</b> at one and one quarter of a cycle later. In this case, the distance from the zero crossing <b>834</b> is more than three quarters of the oscillation time away from the end of the copied master ringing phase time at <b>832</b>, as shown. This test may be performed at each cycle and at each valley on each cycle. The check may be expressed as: t<sub>ring_master</sub>&#x2212;&#xbe;&#xb7;t<sub>osc</sub>&#x2264;t<sub>ring_actual</sub>.

As in the previous example, the first cycle signal <b>902</b> of the master has a power phase <b>904</b> and a ringing phase <b>906</b>. The time duration <b>908</b> of the ringing phase <b>906</b> is measured from a first zero crossing <b>910</b> at the end of the power phase <b>904</b> to the bottom of the last valley when the master converter is switched on.

The state machines may be implemented in hardware using combinatorial logic or software or other implementations may be used. The master state machine <b>1002</b> has at least 5 states and so does the slave state machine <b>1022</b>. These states correspond to operating conditions of the two converters of an interleaved boost converter as discussed herein. The states are Gate ON state <b>1004</b>, <b>1024</b> (ST_GATEON), Secondary Stroke state <b>1006</b>, <b>1026</b> (ST_SEC), Ring Low state <b>1008</b>, <b>1028</b> (ST_RING_L), Ring High state <b>1010</b>, <b>1030</b> (ST_RING_H), and Ring Oscillation state <b>1012</b>, <b>1032</b> (ST_RING_OSC).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0081">In operation, the master state machine <b>1002</b> and the slave state machine <b>1022</b> enter the Gate On states <b>1004</b>, <b>1024</b>, when the gate of the switch of the respective converter is turned on again. They exit the Gate ON states <b>1004</b>, <b>1024</b> to the Secondary Stroke states <b>1006</b>, <b>1026</b>, when the gates are turned off. This will happen out-of-phase at two different times. The converters transition to the Ring Low states <b>1008</b>, <b>1028</b> at the end of the power phase and the end of the second stroke when the ringing phase is started. The states will oscillate between Ring Low <b>1008</b>, <b>1028</b> and Ring High <b>1010</b>, <b>1030</b> states as the cycle signals, in this example AUX<b>1</b>, and AUX<b>2</b> oscillate. When the ringing phase is over, then the converters transition through the Ring Oscillation states <b>1012</b>, <b>1032</b> back to the Gate ON states <b>1004</b>, <b>1024</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0082">The timing is indicated through the states for the master as a time, Ling master, is copied from the master <b>1002</b> to the slave <b>1022</b>.

The t<sub>ring_start </sub>of the slave is also set when the slave exits the Secondary Stroke state <b>1026</b>. Turning on the gate at the slave at the Ring Oscillation state <b>1032</b> is dependent on t<sub>ring_master </sub>which has has been copied over from the master.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0083">In some embodiments, an update of the valley number for entering the Gate ON state <b>1024</b> of the slave <b>1022</b> is only performed when the master <b>1002</b> also changes the valley number used for its transition to the Gate ON state <b>1004</b>. When the valley number of the master does not change, the valley number of the slave will also not change. When the valley number of the master changes, then the mechanism described above is executed.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0084">As described, the phase control loop for the interleaved boost converter may be operated in a DCM mode with valley switching. Different ON times for both converters may be used to change the frequency of the converters and the valley switching adjusts to compensate for any ON time and phase changes. The described implementation may be used in interleaved boost converters running in BCM and DCM modes, especially, but not necessarily using valley switching. As described, in many operations circumstances, the two interleaved converters will run in DCM mode using different valley numbers. Nevertheless, the time duration of the ringing phase of one converter is used to determine the time duration of the ringing phase of the other converter.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0085">In embodiments, the oscillation may be measured for the master and the slave by measuring the time between two valleys or the time between two zero crossings of auxiliary inductor winding signals or in other ways. The oscillation time between, for example, the second and the third valley or other subsequent valleys, peaks or zero crossings may be used. The reliability is improved when the oscillation time is stored and filtered, such that the oscillation time is known even when the measurement cannot be performed in a current cycle.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0086">Similarly, techniques herein use a start of the ringing phase as a time measurement. This time may be selected using a variety of different criteria. Generally, a time may be selected that corresponds roughly to the time at which the output diode of the master converter stops conducting power to the output. This marks the end of the power stage. There are several different other events that occur at about this time. These include the inductor current becoming zero or the inductor auxiliary winding or switch drain voltage of the converter dropping or having its first local minimum or zero crossing.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0087">The described techniques allow the time duration of the slave ringing phase time to be fixed based on the master ringing phase time. This allows the frequency of each converter to be independently controlled and allows for the boost converter to operate as an interleaved PFC in DCM with valley switching. In addition, it inherently supports BCM operation by providing for an extremely short ringing phase.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a process flow diagram of a method of operation suitable for use with the interleaved boost converter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

With the second drive signal, the process continues with additional first drive signals at <b>1106</b> and control of the slave ringing phase time as described during the operation of the boost converter.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0091">In some embodiments, the master ringing phase time has a master time duration corresponding to a number of valleys of the ringing phase of the first cycle signal. The master time duration may be applied to the ringing phase of the second cycle signal so that the slave ringing phase time may be determined as ending at a valley of the ringing phase of the first cycle signal that is closest to an end of the master time duration. The master time duration may begin at a first local minimum of the first cycle signal and end after the number of valleys.
