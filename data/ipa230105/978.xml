Ixodid ticks, such as the <i>Hyalomma </i>tick, are a reservoir and a vector for CCHFV. Wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep, and hares, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected ticks or animal tissue or blood. CCHF can also be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious bodily fluids. Documented spread of CCHFV has occurred in hospitals due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CCHFV has a fatality rate of up to 50%. (www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/symptoms/index.html).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the pathogenesis of CCHFV is not well understood, a common feature of hemorrhagic fever viruses is their ability to disable the host immune response by rapid replication of the virus along with dysregulation of the vascular system and lymphoid organs. Damage to the endothelium plays an important role in CCHFV pathogenesis and leads to hemostatic failure by stimulating platelet aggregation and degranulation, with subsequent activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. Marked pro-inflammatory response disproportional to the extent of lesion is a hallmark feature. Proinflammatory cytokines are key regulators in the pathogenesis and mortality of patients with CCHF. Levels of Interleukin (IL)-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-&#x3b1; have been shown to be significantly higher in patients with fatal CCHF as compared to those with a non-fatal infection. Ergonul et al., 2006, J Infect Dis. 193(7):941-4.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">CCHFV has a tripartite genome comprising a small (S), a medium (M), and a large (L) RNA segment. The M segment encodes two viral glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Ahmed et al., 2005, J Gen Virology 86:1-10. CCHFV strains may exhibit considerable genetic variability, with the mucin-like domain of Gn being particularly divergent. Gn and Gc are thought to interact with cell surface receptors and mediate the entry of the virus into cells. Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005, J. Virology, 79(10): 6152-6161. Thus, Gn and Gc serve as potential targets for neutralizing antibodies.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Despite decades of research, the development of safe and effective vaccines or therapeutic and/or prophylactic antibodies against CCHFV has remained elusive, highlighting the need for novel strategies that induce or provide protective immune responses. Indeed, to date, there are currently no approved CCHFV vaccines, and treatment of the virus is primarily supportive. Ribavirin is active against CCHFV in vitro, and some groups have shown beneficial effects of ribavirin if given at an early phase of CCHF infection. Tasdelen et al, 2009, Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 28(8):929-33. However, a systematic meta-analysis showed no change in mortality rate or difference in length of hospital stay with the use of ribavirin in randomized control studies. Soares-Weiser et al., 2010, BMC Infect Dis. 10:207. Further, the use of ribavirin is limited due to concerns surrounding its potential risk to pregnant women who may be exposed to the aerosolized drug while it is being administered in a hospital environment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The development of a vaccine is problematic for many reasons, including under-reporting and the sporadic nature of the disease. Although neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting the CCHFV surface glycoprotein complex (GnGc) have been isolated from immunized mice, the specificities and functional properties of human antibodies elicited by natural CCHFV infection remain unknown. Therefore, there remains a need for highly specific, high affinity, and highly potent neutralizing anti-CCHFV antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Applicant has discovered, isolated, and characterized, inter alia, an extensive panel of CCHFV-specific monoclonal antibodies from the memory B cells of four CCHFV-convalescent donors. Sequence analysis of these antibodies revealed the GnGc-specific memory B cell repertoires to be highly diverse, with few to no expanded clonal lineages. Binding studies showed that 90% of the antibodies recognize epitopes within the Gc subunit, the putative fusion glycoprotein. Additionally, competitive binding assays revealed that most of these antibodies target one of seven distinct antigenic sites. Approximately half of the antibodies from each donor recognize a single immunodominant site. Neutralization studies performed using a CCHF-VLP assay showed a proportion of antibodies display highly potent neutralizing activity. A subset of these antibodies is currently being evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of CCHF. Altogether, the panel of antibodies described herein provides promising therapeutic candidates and a framework for the rational design of CCHFV vaccines.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Such antibodies may be useful when administered prophylactically (prior to exposure to the virus and infection with the virus) to lessen the severity, or duration of a primary infection with CCHFV, or ameliorate at least one symptom associated with the infection.

Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (&#x201c;HCVR&#x201d; or &#x201c;V<sub>H</sub>&#x201d;) and a heavy chain constant region (comprised of domains C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, and C<sub>H</sub>3). Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (&#x201c;LCVR or &#x201c;V<sub>L</sub>&#x201d;) and a light chain constant region (C<sub>L</sub>). The V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining region (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. In certain embodiments of the invention, the FRs of the antibody (or antigen-binding fragment thereof) may be identical to the human germline sequences or may be naturally or artificially modified. An amino acid consensus sequence may be defined based on a side-by-side analysis of two or more CDRs. Accordingly, the CDRs in a heavy chain are designated &#x201c;CHRH1&#x201d;, &#x201c;CDRH2&#x201d;, and &#x201c;CDRH3&#x201d;, respectively, and the CDRs in a light chain are designated &#x201c;CDRL1&#x201d;, &#x201c;CDRL2&#x201d;, and &#x201c;CDRL3&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Substitution of one or more CDR residues or omission of one or more CDRs is also possible. Antibodies have been described in the scientific literature in which one or two CDRs can be dispensed with for binding. Padlan et al. (1995 FASEB J. 9:133-139) analyzed the contact regions between antibodies and their antigens, based on published crystal structures, and concluded that only about one fifth to one third of CDR residues actually contact the antigen. Padlan also found many antibodies in which one or two CDRs had no amino acids in contact with an antigen (see also, Vaj dos et al. 2002 J Mol Biol 320:415-428).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">CDR residues not contacting antigen can be identified based on previous studies (for example residues H60-H65 in CDRH2 are often not required), from regions of Kabat CDRs lying outside Chothia CDRs, by molecular modeling and/or empirically. If a CDR or residue(s) thereof is omitted, it is usually substituted with an amino acid occupying the corresponding position in another human antibody sequence or a consensus of such sequences. Positions for substitution within CDRs and amino acids to substitute can also be selected empirically.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The fully human monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The present invention includes antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residue(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;germline mutations&#x201d;). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L </sub>domains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antibodies of the present invention may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residue of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, and the like Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The present invention also includes fully monoclonal antibodies comprising variants of any of the CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or more conservative substitutions.

The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is not intended to include mAbs in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species (e.g., mouse), have been grafted onto human FR sequences.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to human antibody in which one or more CDRs of such antibody have been replaced with one or more corresponding CDRs obtained a non-human derived (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, primate) antibody. Humanized antibodies may also include certain non-CDR sequences or residues derived from such non-human antibodies as well as the one or more non-human CDR sequence. Such antibodies may also be referred to as &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; antibodies.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; generally refers to any protein, polypeptide, or cell expressing a gene of interest that is produced by genetic engineering methods. The term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; as used with respect to a protein or polypeptide, means a polypeptide produced by expression of a recombinant polynucleotide. The proteins used in the immunogenic compositions of the invention may be isolated from a natural source or produced by genetic engineering methods.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The antibodies of the invention may, in some embodiments, be recombinant human antibodies. The term &#x201c;recombinant human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include all antibodies, including human or humanized antibodies, that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector-transfected into a host cell (described further below), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (described further below), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves the splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The term &#x201c;specifically binds,&#x201d; or &#x201c;binds specifically to&#x201d;, or the like means that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant of at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M or less (e.g., a smaller K<sub>D </sub>denotes a tighter binding). Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. As described herein, antibodies have been identified by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE&#x2122;, biolayer interferometry measurements using, e.g., a ForteBio Octet HTX instrument (Pall Life Sciences), which bind specifically to CCHFV.

This inhibition of the biological activity of CCHFV can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of CCHFV biological activity by one or more of several standard in vitro assays (such as a neutralization assay, as described herein) or in vivo assays known in the art (for example, animal models to look at protection from challenge with CCHFV following administration of one or more of the antibodies described herein).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The term &#x201c;surface plasmon resonance&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biomolecular interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACORE&#x2122; system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to an antigenic determinant that interacts with a specific antigen-binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a paratope. A single antigen may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different areas on an antigen and may have different biological effects. The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; also refers to a site on an antigen to which B and/or T cells respond. It also refers to a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. Epitopes may be defined as structural or functional. Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the affinity of the interaction. Epitopes may also be conformational, that is, composed of non-linear amino acids. In certain embodiments, epitopes may include determinants that are chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The term &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d;, or &#x201c;substantially identical,&#x201d; when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity, such as FASTA, BLAST or GAP, as discussed below. Accordingly, nucleic acid sequences that display a certain percentage &#x201c;identity&#x201d; share that percentage identity, and/or are that percentage &#x201c;identical&#x201d; to one another. A nucleic acid molecule having substantial identity to a reference nucleic acid molecule may, in certain instances, encode a polypeptide having the same or substantially similar amino acid sequence as the polypeptide encoded by the reference nucleic acid molecule.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In certain embodiments, the disclosed antibody nucleic acid sequences are, e.g.: at least 70% identical; at least 75% identical; 80% identical; at least 85% identical; at least 90% identical; at least 95% identical; at least 96% identical; at least 97% identical; at least 98% identical; at least 99%; and/or all percentages of identity in between; to other sequences and/or share such percentage identities with one another (or with certain subsets of the herein-disclosed antibody sequences).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As applied to polypeptides, the term &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 90% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity. Accordingly, amino acid sequences that display a certain percentage &#x201c;identity&#x201d; share that percentage identity, and/or are that percentage &#x201c;identical&#x201d; to one another. Accordingly, amino acid sequences that display a certain percentage &#x201c;identity&#x201d; share that percentage identity, and/or are that percentage &#x201c;identical&#x201d; to one another.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In certain embodiments, the disclosed antibody amino acid sequences are, e.g.: at least 70% identical; at least 75% identical; 80% identical; at least 85% identical; at least 90% identical; at least 95% identical; at least 96% identical; at least 97% identical; at least 98% identical; at least 99%; and/or all percentages of identity in between; to other sequences and/or share such percentage identities with one another (or with certain subsets of the herein-disclosed antibody sequences).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Preferably, residue positions, which are not identical, differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. (See, e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331). Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include 1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; 2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; 3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; 4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; 5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; 6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and 7) sulfur-containing side chains: cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acid substitution groups are valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al. (1992) Science 256: 1443-45. A &#x201c;moderately conservative&#x201d; replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Sequence similarity for polypeptides is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions, and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as GAP and BESTFIT which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA with default or recommended parameters; a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson (2000) supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters.

In addition to the methods for conducting such characterization, various other techniques are available to the artisan that can be used to carry out such characterization or to otherwise ascertain whether an antibody &#x201c;interacts with one or more amino acids&#x201d; within a polypeptide or protein. Exemplary techniques include, for example, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described Antibodies, Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harb., NY) can be performed. Other methods include alanine scanning mutational analysis, peptide blot analysis (Reineke (2004) Methods Mol Biol 248:443-63), peptide cleavage analysis crystallographic studies and NMR analysis. In addition, methods such as epitope excision, epitope extraction and chemical modification of antigens can be employed (Tomer (2000) Protein Science 9: 487-496). Another method that can be used to identify the amino acids within a polypeptide with which an antibody interacts is hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry. In general terms, the hydrogen/deuterium exchange method involves deuterium-labeling the protein of interest, followed by binding the antibody to the deuterium-labeled protein. Next, the protein/antibody complex is transferred to water and exchangeable protons within amino acids that are protected by the antibody complex undergo deuterium-to-hydrogen back-exchange at a slower rate than exchangeable protons within amino acids that are not part of the interface. As a result, amino acids that form part of the protein/antibody interface may retain deuterium and therefore exhibit relatively higher mass compared to amino acids not included in the interface. After dissociation of the antibody, the target protein is subjected to protease cleavage and mass spectrometry analysis, thereby revealing the deuterium-labeled residues that correspond to the specific amino acids with which the antibody interacts. See, e.g., Ehring (1999) Analytical Biochemistry 267 (2):252-259; Engen and Smith (2001) Anal. Chem. 73:256A-265A.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As the artisan will understand, an epitope can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by the tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Modification-Assisted Profiling (MAP), also known as Antigen Structure-based Antibody Profiling (ASAP) is a method that categorizes large numbers of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the same antigen according to the similarities of the binding profile of each antibody to chemically or enzymatically modified antigen surfaces (US 2004/0101920). Each category may reflect a unique epitope either distinctly different from or partially overlapping with the epitope represented by another category. This technology allows rapid filtering of genetically identical antibodies, such that characterization can be focused on genetically distinct antibodies. When applied to hybridoma screening, MAP may facilitate the identification of rare hybridoma clones that produce mAbs having the desired characteristics. MAP may be used to sort the antibodies of the invention into groups of antibodies binding different epitopes.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As the artisan understands, one can easily determine whether an antibody binds to the same epitope as, or competes for binding with, a reference anti-CCHFV antibody by using routine methods available in the art. For example, to determine if a test antibody binds to the same epitope as a reference CCHFV antibody of the invention, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a CCHFV protein or peptide under saturating conditions. Next, the ability of a test antibody to bind to the CCHFV molecule is assessed. If the test antibody is able to bind to CCHFV following saturation binding with the reference anti-CCHFV antibody, it can be concluded that the test antibody binds to a different epitope than the reference anti-CCHFV antibody. On the other hand, if the test antibody is not able to bind to the CCHFV molecule following saturation binding with the reference anti-CCHFV antibody, then the test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-CCHFV antibody of the invention.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">To determine if an antibody competes for binding with a reference anti-CCHFV antibody, the above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a CCHFV molecule under saturating conditions followed by an assessment of binding of the test antibody to the CCHFV molecule. In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to a CCHFV molecule under saturating conditions followed by an assessment of binding of the reference antibody to the CCHFV molecule. If in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to the CCHFV molecule, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to CCHFV. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the identical epitope as the reference antibody but may sterically block the binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent epitope.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Two antibodies bind to the same or overlapping epitope if each competitively inhibits (blocks) binding of the other to the antigen. That is, a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. (1990) 50:1495-1502). Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate the binding of the other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate the binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate the binding of the other.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry, or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Immunoconjugates</heading><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The invention encompasses a human CCHFV monoclonal antibody conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (&#x201c;immunoconjugate&#x201d;), such as an agent that is capable of reducing the severity of primary infection with CCHFV or ameliorating at least one symptom associated with CCHFV infection, including fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, or the severity thereof. Such an agent may be a second different antibody to CCHFV or a vaccine. The type of therapeutic moiety that may be conjugated to the anti-CCHFV antibody and will take into account the condition to be treated and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved.

(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include but are not limited to, intradermal, transdermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings {e.g., oral mucosa, nasal mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, and the like), and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. It may be delivered as an aerosolized formulation (See US201 1/031 1515 and US2012/0128669). The delivery of agents useful for treating respiratory diseases by inhalation is becoming more widely accepted (See A. J. Bitonti and J. A. Dumont, (2006), Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev, 58:1 106-1 1 18). In addition to being effective at treating local pulmonary disease, such a delivery mechanism may also be useful for systemic delivery of antibodies (See Maillet et al.

In one embodiment, a pump may be used. In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, and the like These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example, the injectable preparations may be prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending, or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, and the like, which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], and the like As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, and the like, which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, and the like The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Numerous reusable pens and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.

Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, and the like. The amount of the aforesaid antibody contained is generally about 5 to about 500 mg per dosage form in a unit dose; especially in the form of injection, it is preferred that the aforesaid antibody is contained in about 5 to about 100 mg and in about 10 to about 250 mg for the other dosage forms.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Administration Regimens</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0146">According to certain embodiments, multiple doses of an antibody to CCHFV may be administered to a subject over a defined time course. The methods according to this aspect of the invention comprise sequentially administering to a subject multiple doses of an antibody to CCHFV. As used herein, &#x201c;sequentially administering&#x201d; means that each dose of antibody to CCHFV is administered to the subject at a different point in time, e.g., on different days separated by a predetermined interval (e.g., hours, days, weeks, or months). The present invention includes methods that comprise sequentially administering to the patient a single initial dose of an antibody to CCHFV, followed by one or more secondary doses of the antibody to CCHFV and optionally followed by one or more tertiary doses of the antibody to CCHFV.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The terms &#x201c;initial dose,&#x201d; &#x201c;secondary doses,&#x201d; and &#x201c;tertiary doses,&#x201d; refer to the temporal sequence of administration of the antibody to CCHFV. Thus, the &#x201c;initial dose&#x201d; is the dose that is administered at the beginning of the treatment regimen (also referred to as the &#x201c;baseline dose&#x201d;); the &#x201c;secondary doses&#x201d; are the doses that are administered after the initial dose, and the &#x201c;tertiary doses&#x201d; are the doses which are administered after the secondary doses. The initial, secondary, and tertiary doses may all contain the same amount of antibody to CCHFV, but generally may differ from one another in terms of frequency of administration. In certain embodiments, however, the amount of antibody to CCHFV contained in the initial, secondary, and/or tertiary doses varies from one another (e.g., adjusted up or down as appropriate) during the course of treatment. In certain embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) doses are administered at the beginning of the treatment regimen as &#x201c;loading doses&#x201d; followed by subsequent doses that are administered on a less frequent basis (e.g., &#x201c;maintenance doses&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each secondary and/or tertiary dose is administered 1 to 26 (e.g., 1, 1&#xbd;, 2, 2&#xbd;, 3, 3&#xbd;, 4, 4&#xbd;, 5, 5&#xbd;, 6, 6&#xbd;, 7, 7&#xbd;, 8, 8&#xbd;, 9, 9&#xbd;, 10, 10&#xbd;, 11, 11&#xbd;, 12, 12&#xbd;, 13, 13&#xbd;, 14, 14&#xbd;, 15, 15&#xbd;, 16, 16&#xbd;, 17, 17&#xbd;, 18, 18&#xbd;, 19, 19&#xbd;, 20, 20&#xbd;, 21, 21&#xbd;, 22, 22&#xbd;, 23, 23&#xbd;, 24, 24&#xbd;, 25, 25&#xbd;, 26, 26&#xbd;, or more) weeks after the immediately preceding dose.

Similarly, in embodiments involving multiple tertiary doses, each tertiary dose may be administered at the same frequency as the other tertiary doses. For example, each tertiary dose may be administered to the patient 2 to 4 weeks after the immediately preceding dose. Alternatively, the frequency at which the secondary and/or tertiary doses are administered to a patient can vary over the course of the treatment regimen.

CCHFV Antibody Characterization</heading><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Applicants have comprehensively profiled the human antibody response to CCHFV by isolating and characterizing 393 CCHFV-specific monoclonal antibodies from the memory B cells of four CCHFV-convalescent donors and used these antibodies to comprehensively map the antigenic topology of CCHFV. The antibody response to CCHFV was determined to be comprised of a number of clones that target several antigenic sites. The majority of antibodies target the Gc subunit and are cross-reactive for multiple GnGc strains, providing strong support for the development of CCHFV antibodies that target the Gn and/or Gc subunits. Taken together, the results have implications for the design and evaluation of the CCHFV vaccine and antibody-based therapeutic candidates and offer new options for passive prophylaxis.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Generation of CCHFV Sorting Probes</heading><p id="p-0232" num="0231">The CCHFV GnGc and GP38 glycoproteins were engineered (transmembrane regions deleted) to be secreted as soluble recombinantly expressed proteins from Schneider 2 insect cells. The proteins were then purified using standard Strep II tag purification techniques. The purified proteins were then complexed with labeled streptavidin probes (utilizing the Strep-II tags fused to the proteins) together providing the antigen-specific probes required to support single-cell fluorescence-activated B-cell sorting and resulting antibody isolation from CCHFV-convalescent adult human donors (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0000">Isolation of CCHFV-Specific Monoclonal Antibodies from CCHFV-Convalescent Adult Human Donors</p><p id="p-0234" num="0232">In order to comprehensively profile the human antibody response to CCHFV, approximately 364 monoclonal antibodies from the memory B cells of four CCHFV-convalescent adult donors (&#x201c;Donor 1&#x201d;, &#x201c;Donor 5&#x201d;, &#x201c;Donor 6&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Donor 7&#x201d;) were isolated and characterized. 450 GnGc-specific B cells were single-cell sorted from a Donor 1 sample, and 184 GnGc-specific B cells were sorted for samples from Donor 5, Donor 6, and Donor 7. Antibody variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain genes were rescued by single-cell PCR. Tiller et al. (2008) J Immunol Methods 329, 112-124. Cognate heavy and light chain pairs were subsequently cloned and expressed as full-length IgGs in an engineered strain of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>for further characterization.

B cells isolated from the donors bind to GnGc (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).

IgD and IgM staining profiles reveal that the CCHFV-specific repertoires are class-switched, meaning that the cells are affinity matured (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Consistent with this observation, most B cells show an IgM-IgD-CD27+ phenotype (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Thus, most antibodies were derived from classical memory B cells.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0235">Sequence analysis of isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that the CCHFV-specific repertoire is highly diverse, with few to no expanded clonal lineages. More than 70 unique lineages were observed for each donor (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). CDRH3 lengths are similar to unselected repertoires (generally, approximately 13-17 amino acids in length; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). The average level of somatic hypermutation (SHM) ranged between 0 and 30 nucleotide substitutions per VH gene (excluding CDRH3) and 0 and 12 substitutions per VK/L gene (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Somatic mutation load may correlate with time post-infection, as the number of nucleotide substitutions in Donors 6 and 7 (two months post-infection) is significantly less than the number of nucleotide substitutions in Donors 1 and 5. Sequence analysis also revealed that CCHFV-specific repertoires tend to use similar proportions of VH, VK, and VL families. For example, the repertoires tend to use VH1 or VH3 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) and tend to use VK rather than VL (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). If VK is chosen, the repertoires tend to use VK1 and VK3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>); if VL is chosen, the repertoires tend to use VL1, VL2, and VL3 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Antibody Binding Studies</heading><p id="p-0238" num="0236">The apparent binding affinities of the IgGs for IbAr10200 GnGc were measured using biolayer interferometry. McLellan et al., (2011) J Virol 85, 7788-7796 (2011). IbAr10200 is a CCHF virus strain originally isolated from <i>Hyalomma excavatum </i>ticks from Sokoto, Nigeria in 1966. Results show that antibodies from each donor bind with high affinity to IbAr10200 GnGc (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and Table 2). Interestingly, a relatively large proportion of the antibodies not only bound to IbAr10200 GnGc but also other strains of CCHFV&#x2014;China GnGc and Kosovo GnGc&#x2014;as well as just the Gc subunit (IbAr10200 Gc) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>C</figref>). More than 70% of the antibodies isolated from each donor bound to Gc (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows that antibodies in some bins, such as the ADI-36120 bin, bound to all CCHFV strains with high affinity. Conversely, antibodies from an undefined bin bound only one or two of the CCHFV strains. Such results suggest that the antibodies of the ADI-36120 bin may bind a conserved Gn or quaternary epitope.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0237">Since certain antiviral antibody specificities have been associated with poly- and autoreactivity, the CCHFV antibodies were tested for polyreactivity using a previously described high-throughput assay that correlates with down-stream behaviors such as serum clearance.

The vast majority of CCHFV antibodies lack significant polyreactivity in this assay (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0240" num="0238">To further analyze the binding affinities of the CCHFV antibodies, antibodies were sorted by bin and performed competitive binding experiments using a previously described yeast-based assay. Bowley et al. (2007), Protein Eng Des Sel 20, 81-90. Epitope binning of the antibodies was performed on a Forte Bio Octet Red384 system (Pall Forte Bio Corporation, Menlo Park, Calif.) using a standard sandwich format binning assay. No binding following addition of a Fab/Ag complex indicates epitope blocking (competitor), while binding after addition of the Fab/Ag complex indicates an unoccupied epitope (non-competitor) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). The majority of antibodies from each donor bin with ADI-36193 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). Further, a significant portion of antibodies from each donor were not binned. Sequence analysis of antibodies in several bins revealed germline preferences. For example, within the ADI-36193 bin, antibodies showed preferences for VH1-46 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>). Other germline preferences are highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>B-<b>9</b>F</figref> and in Table 1.

More than half of the antibodies from each donor showed at least 50 percent neutralization or greater (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> and Table 2). Antibodies from bins ADI-36193 and ADI-36121 showed the highest proportion of neutralizing antibodies (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref> demonstrate that ADI-36121 potently neutralized CCHF virus-like particles (VLPs) by themselves, while ADI-36193 bin members leave an unneutralized fraction. Combination index analysis of ADI-36121 in combination with ADI-36193 bin members showed CI values of less than 1, indicating synergistic inhibition of CCHFV VLPs for both observed data and data fitted through linear regression.

The specificities and functional properties of antibodies induced by natural CCHFV infection have remained largely undefined. As disclosed herein, a high-throughput antibody isolation platform and a collection of GnGc-specific B cells were used to dissect the human memory B cell response to CCHFV in four naturally infected adult donors, and highly potent and selective CCHFV-neutralizing antibodies were isolated and characterized.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0247">To enhance neutralization potency and breadth and mitigate the risk of viral mutational escape (Gilchuk et al., Immunity 52, 388-402, 2020; Keeffe et al., Cell Rep. 25, 1385-1394, 2018; Wec et al., Science 354, 350-354, 2019), we evaluated combinations of non-competing nAbs. Only combinations of Site 3/domain II or Site 6/domain III binders with Site 1/fusion loop binders afforded synergistic neutralization, characterized by Chou-Talalay combination index (CI) scores &#x3c;1 and improvements in both neutralization IC50 and un-neutralized fraction. The site-specificity of nAb synergy suggested that it did not arise solely from the simultaneous engagement of two non-overlapping functional epitopes (Diamant et al., 2015). Instead, we speculate that these synergies reflect cooperative binding. Specifically, the Site 3/Site 6 nAbs may trap &#x201c;open&#x201d; Gc conformers in which the fusion loops are more exposed for recognition by Site 1 nAbs. The further improvements in neutralization IC50 with bsAbs may reflect increases in binding avidity of the physically linked variable domains to these pairs of sites, which may be further magnified by the tetravalent DVD format used herein (Diamant et al., A Platform for Next-Generation Anti-Toxin Drugs: Toxins (Basel) 7, 1854-1881 2015; Jakob et al., MAbs 5, 358-363, 2013; Wec et al., Microbe 25, 39-48, 2016). The reduced potency of the alternate DVD-Ig configurations bearing the fusion loop-binding domains as outer variable domains (DVD-801-121 and DVD-801-145) presumably reflects structural constraints that reduce the efficiency of bivalent and/or tetravalent bsAb engagement with Gc. An understanding of these constraints awaits structural elucidation of the supramolecular organization of CCHFV Gn/Gc in intact viral particles.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0248">Single doses of candidate nAbs targeting Gc domains II and III afforded prophylactic protection against virulent CCHFV strains from two distinct viral clades. That these studies were independently performed in two BSL-4 laboratories using genetically distinct immunocompromised murine models attests to the robustness of our findings. However, single doses of all tested nAbs, synergistic nAb combinations, and non-neutralizing GP38-specific mAbs failed to protect mice in a more stringent therapeutic setting. Strikingly, a single bsAb, DVD-121-801, combining variable domains from the synergizing nAbs ADI-36121 (Site 3/domain II) and ADI-37801 (Site 1/fusion loops), protected mice when administered 24 h post-viral challenge, concordant with its enhanced neutralization potency against tecVLPs bearing Gn/Gc from the cognate challenge strain. We speculate that this bsAb may also benefit from enhanced Fc-mediated effector functions by virtue of its increased length and/or flexibility relative to its IgG1 precursors. DVD-121-801 is the first antibody-based treatment demonstrated to afford therapeutic protection against lethal CCHFV challenge with a single dose, and it is a lead candidate for further evaluation in murine and nonhuman primate models of CCHFV challenge (Cross et al., PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 14, e0008637, 2020; Haddock et al., Nat. Microbiol. 3, 556-562, 2018).</p><p id="p-0252" num="0249">The development of an effective CCHFV vaccine has presented a number of unique challenges, and selection of the optimal vaccination strategy will be of the utmost importance. The in-depth analysis of the human antibody response to natural CCHFV infection presented here provides insights for the development of such a vaccine. The repertoire analysis disclosed herein revealed that most CCHFV-specific antibodies target the Gc subunit. Most of these antibodies have clean-low polyreactivity, thus showing high specificity to GnGc. Additionally, many of these antibodies are cross-reactive to multiple strains of CCHFV.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

The primers used in the second round of PCR contained 40 base pairs of 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; homology to the digested expression vectors, which allowed for cloning by homologous recombination into <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The lithium acetate method for chemical transformation was used to clone the PCR products into <i>S. cerevisiae </i>(Gietz and Schiestl, Nat Protoc 2007). 10 uL of unpurified heavy chain and light chain PCR product and 200 ng of the digested expression vectors were used per transformation reaction.

For high-throughput KD determination, IgGs were immobilized on anti-human IgG quantitation biosensors (Pall Life Sciences) and exposed to 100 nM antigen in PBS with 0.1% BSA (PBSF) for an association step, followed by a dissociation step in PBSF. Data were analyzed using the ForteBio Data Analysis Software 7. Kd values were calculated for antibodies with BLI responses &#x3e;0.1 nm, and the data were fit to a 1:1 binding model to calculate association and dissociation rate constants.

Briefly, soluble membrane protein (SMP) and soluble cytosolic protein (SCP) fractions were prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells and biotinylated with NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Pierce, ThermoFisher Cat #21336). 2 million IgG-presenting yeast were transferred to a 96-well assay plate, pelleted to remove supernatant, then the pellets were resuspended in 50 uL of 1:10 diluted stock of biotinylated SCPs and SMPs and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBSF, and the samples were incubated in 50 uL of secondary labeling mix (Extravadin-R-PE, goat F(ab&#x2032;) 2-anti human kappa-FITC, and propidium iodide) on ice for 20 minutes. The samples were analyzed for polyspecificity reagent binding using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) with HTS sample injector.

After washing with PBSF to remove unbound antigen, the bound antigen was detected using streptavidin Alexa Fluor 633 (Life Technologies) at a 1:500 dilution and antibody light chain was detected using Goat F(ab&#x2032;)2 anti-human kappa FITC and Goat F(ab&#x2032;)2 and anti-human lambda FITC (SouthernBiotech) both at a 1:100 dilution. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using FACSCanto II. The amount of antigen bound was normalized to the light chain FITC level. Competition level was determined by the fold reduction in antigen binding in the presence of a competitor Fab compared to antigen binding in the absence of competition. Antibodies with greater than tenfold reduction were considered to be in competition with the precomplexed Fab.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="2">CCHFV Virus-Like Particle Production and Purification</heading><p id="p-0264" num="0258">Virus-like particles (VLPs) carrying CCHFV Gn/Gc were produced as previously described (Zivcec Metal. 2015.

Pelleted VLPs were resuspended in complete DMEM (2% FBS, 1% Penicillin-streptomycin, 1% GlutaMax) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) prior to storage at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="2">Screening of mAb Neutralization Potential Using CCHFV VLPs</heading><p id="p-0265" num="0259">Gn/Gc specific mAbs were diluted to 350 and 35 nM in complete DMEM. Pelleted VLP dilutions in complete DMEM were determined empirically in order to reach a level at which maximal Luciferase signal is &#x3e;100-fold higher than background. Diluted VLPs were added to the mAbs and the mixture was incubated at 4&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Confluent Vero African grivet kidney cells were infected with the VLP: mAb mixture, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for &#x2dc;16 hours. The inoculum was then aspirated, and cells washed with phosphate buffered saline. NanoLuciferase substrate (Promega, Madison, Wis.) was added to infected cells and following a 5-minute incubation luminescence was measured using 10 second integration in a Perkin Elmer Victor 2 microplate reader. Based on two technical replicates per mAb, neutralizing potential was calculated as a ratio of signal compared to VLP signal in the absence of mAb.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="2">Analysis of Synergistic Neutralization</heading><p id="p-0266" num="0260">Neutralizing mAbs were analyzed for synergy by performing neutralization assays of 1:1 molar ratio mixtures of parental antibodies and comparing the neutralization potential to the parental mAbs alone. Briefly, dilution series of neutralizing mAbs were made in complete DMEM. VLPs were diluted as above and then added to the mAbs, followed by incubation at 4&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Infection and luminescence readings were performed as above. Resulting mAb neutralization curves were analyzed for synergy using combination index analysis (Chou T-C and Talalay P, 1984 Adv Biol Regul (22). pp 27-55).

First, we benchmarked the prophylactic efficacy of ADI-36121, ADI-36145, and ADI-37801 against a chimerized version of the previously described GP38-specific mouse mAb 13G8 (c13G8).

Essentially complete protection was observed with all mAbs and mAb combinations tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>), with associated prevention of weight loss (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). ADI-36121 and ADI-36145 also protected STAT1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> (STAT1-KO) mice (Bente et al., 2010; Bowick et al., 2012) against CCHFV-Turkey challenge when administered at 30 min post-exposure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C-D</figref>), as shown previously for c13G8 (Mishra et al., 2020).</p><p id="p-0268" num="0262">Having demonstrated pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylactic protection, we next tested the same set of mAbs in a therapeutic setting (24 h post-challenge). Neither individual Gc-specific nAbs nor their combinations afforded measurable protection against CCHFV-IbAr10200 when dosed at 0.5 mg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E-F</figref>) or 1 mg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G-H</figref>) per animal (25 or 50 mg/kg, respectively). Further, although two 1-mg doses of 13G8 administered at days 1 and 4 post-challenge afforded partial protection in the same murine model (Golden et al., 2019), we observed no significant protection with single doses of c13G8 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E-H</figref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that human nAbs targeting CCHFV Gc can be at least as efficacious as non-neutralizing mAbs targeting GP38 in prophylactic and pre-exposure settings. However, they also show that single doses of currently available mAbs cannot protect against CCHFV challenge in a therapeutic setting, at least in the highly stringent rodent models presently in use.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="1">Example 4. Engineered Dual-Variable Domain IgGs Provide Enhanced Synergistic Neutralization and Potent Therapeutic Protection</heading><p id="p-0269" num="0263">We postulated that the synergistic activity of our most potent nAb pairs (ADI-36121+ADI-37801, ADI-36145+ADI-37801) could be further amplified through avidity effects by physically linking their corresponding variable domains into bispecific antibodies. Accordingly, we engineered four dual-variable domain antibodies (aka. dual-variable domain immunoglobulins, or DVD-Igs) to bear these pairs of variable domains in both possible configurations (i.e., as &#x201c;inner&#x201d; or &#x201c;outer&#x201d; variable domains) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>). The DVD-Igs, expressed in ExpiCHO cells and purified from cell supernatants, yielded largely monodisperse preparations with the expected relative molecular weights (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A-D</figref>). The capacity of both combining sites in each DVD-Ig to recognize rGn/Gc was confirmed by biolayer interferometry through two-phase experiments in which binding to rGn/Gc in the presence of the respective parental monospecific mAbs was assayed. The DVD-IGs were able to bind rGn/Gc in the presence of each monospecific mAb (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>E-H</figref>) but not in the presence of both mAbs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>I-J</figref>) indicating that both sets of variable domains were active and recognized their expected targets. In neutralization studies, DVD-121-801 was more potent than the equimolar mixture of its parental nAbs against all four tecVLP preparations bearing divergent Gn/Gc proteins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B-E</figref>). DVD-145-801 also displayed enhanced potency, but only against Oman and Kosova Hoti tecVLPs; it resembled the mixture of its parental nAbs in its activity against IbAr10200 and Turkey tecVLPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>F-I</figref>). Interestingly, the relative positions of the two sets of variable domains in these two DVD-Igs was important to their enhanced activity: neither of their counterparts bearing the same variable domains in the reverse configuration (DVD-801-121 and DVD-801-145; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>) afforded enhanced neutralization against Oman tecVLPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>F</figref>), despite retaining rGn/Gc binding activity via both of their combining sites (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0270" num="0264">Finally, we sought to test if the enhanced in vitro activity of DVD-121-801 and DVD-145-801 would translate to improved therapeutic efficacy in vivo. To this end, we exposed IFNAR1-KO mice to CCHFV-IbAr10200 and then treated animals with DVD-121-801 and DVD-145-801 (equimolar to 1 mg mAb) as part of the study described above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>G-H</figref>) that also included nAb and nAb-combination arms. Strikingly, DVD-121-801 afforded essentially complete protection whereas DVD-145-801 provided no benefit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref>). This result was concordant with the enhanced neutralizing activity of the former bsAb, but not the latter, against IbAr10200 tecVLPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>G</figref>). We thus identify a single dual-variable domain antibodies that combines two synergizing nAbs that target distinct sites in Gc domain II to achieve 10-100-fold enhanced neutralization potency relative to its component nAbs. A single dose of this bsAb afforded therapeutic protection in a stringent model of lethal CCHFV challenge.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230000979A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
