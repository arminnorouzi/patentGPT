id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to connectors for terminating fiber optic cable. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a fiber optic connector retention assembly that secures a fiber optic connector body to a cable jacket.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fiber optical communication systems typically use a network of fiber optic cables to transmit large volumes of data. Typical fiber optic connectors include a ferrule that supports an end portion of an optical fiber. When two fiber optic connectors are interconnected, end faces of the ferrules, on each connector, directly oppose one another. Thus, the optical fibers, which are supported by each ferrule, are also directly opposed to each other. Furthermore, springs in each connector bias the optical fibers towards each other when the connectors are in this interconnected state. An optical signal can then be transmitted from one optical fiber to the other optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional fiber optical connectors are either fastened to a Kevlar strengthening member that is included in the fiber optic cable or crimped onto a crimp ring through the use of a crimp tool. Attaching the connector to the Kevlar strengthening member creates a relatively weak connection that is easy to bend. Further, some types of fiber optic cable, such as Miniflex&#xae; fiber cable, contains less Kevlar than other standard jumper cord, which could result in a less reliable connection under load.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Crimp-type connectors are not convenient because they require every installer to carry a specialized tool for crimping the connector onto the cable. Also, use of a crimping tool can lead to a poor connection due to potential installer error. Further, such connectors may require double crimping that relies on crushing the cable to retain the connector.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It may be desirable to provide a connector that overcomes one or more of the aforementioned disadvantages of conventional fiber optics connectors. For example, it may be desirable to provide a connector retention assembly that secures a fiber optic connector body to a cable jacket without crimping. It may be desirable to provide a connector retention member that provides increased connection strength between the connector body and the cable jacket. It may be desirable to provide a connector body that is welded to the retention member.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to various aspects of the disclosure, a fiber optic cable connector configured to be securely coupled with a cable jacket without crimping includes a metallic connector body including a through bore and a rear sleeve portion configured to receive a jacket of a fiber optic cable, a ferrule holder configured to be slidingly seated in a forward end of the bore of the connector body, a ferrule configured to be seated in the ferrule holder and to terminate an optical fiber passing through the connector body and the ferrule holder, a spring configured to be seated around a stem of the ferrule holder between a rearward-facing annular shoulder of the ferrule holder and a forward-facing annular surface within a cylindrical recess of the connector body, and a fiber optic connector retention member configured to secure the connector body to the jacket of the fiber optic cable.

The fiber optic connection device <b>150</b> includes a retention member <b>152</b>, for example, a split ring, such as a metallic split ring, optionally a stainless steel split ring, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. The split ring <b>152</b> has an inside diameter sized to fit into an annular groove <b>194</b> in the jacket <b>192</b> of the fiber optic cable <b>190</b> and an outside diameter sized to extend radially outward of an outer surface <b>196</b> of the jacket <b>192</b> such that the split ring <b>152</b> engages an inner surface <b>132</b> of the sleeve portion <b>130</b> of the connector body <b>110</b>, for example, a metallic connector body.
