id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A patient support apparatus, such as a hospital bed, includes an alert light assembly or an alert light module having separate zones that are individually illuminated to convey information regarding respective alert conditions. The zones each have indicia related to a particular condition of the patient support apparatus. The illuminated zones are each sufficiently large so as to be seen from afar, such as on the order of ten feet or more. Alternatively or additionally, a GUI of the patient support apparatus displays alert indicia as part of a screen saver. Further alternatively or additionally, the patient support apparatus illuminates an alert light in a manner indicating an optimal time for taking a patient's vital signs.</p></abstract><drawings

More particularly, the present disclosure relates to hospital beds that alert caregivers to different alert conditions of the hospital bed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hospital beds having lights to alert caregivers of undesirable conditions are known. For example, the CENTRA&#x2122; bed marketed by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. starting in the early 1980's had four light emitting diodes (LED's) at the foot end of the bed in a vertical arrangement which indicated, respectively, an electrical ground loss, bed not in low position, bed motors locked out, and foot brake not set. The LED's were rather small and thus, caregivers needed to view these close up, such as on the order of two feet or closer, in order to read the explanatory text next to each of the LED's.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent times, alert lights on beds have been made much larger and conspicuous so that caregivers can easily see these lights from a distance of ten feet or more. Thus, a caregiver is able to view the alert light status from a hallway by looking through a doorway of a patient room. See, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2012/0105233 A1, 2011/0277242 A1 and 2010/0073168 A1. These more recent types of alert lights typically are illuminated green to indicate that multiple monitored bed conditions are all in a desired state and are illuminated some other color, such as amber or red, to indicate that at least one of the monitored bed conditions is in an undesirable state. However, the caregiver does not know which of the monitored conditions is causing the alert light or lights to be illuminated the color other than green. Instead, the caregiver must know what the monitored conditions are and to make a visual inspection of various bed features to determine which feature needs attention to correct the alert situation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Based on the foregoing, it will be appreciated that there is room for improvement in connection with alert lights on hospital beds.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A patient support apparatus may comprise one or more of the features recited in the appended claims and/or the following features which, alone or in any combination, may comprise patentable subject matter:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A patient support apparatus may include a base frame and an upper frame that may be supported above the base frame and that may be configured to support a patient.

<b>20</b> that supports a surface or mattress <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The hospital bed <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is based on the VERSACARE&#x2122; bed marketed by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. However, the present disclosure is applicable to other patient support apparatuses including, for example, other types of beds, patient tables, stretchers, wheel chairs, and the like. Furthermore, use of the term &#x201c;hospital bed&#x201d; herein is intended to mean beds that support patients in all types of settings including, for example, nursing homes, outpatient facilities, medical clinics, and even a patient's own home, and is not intended to imply that such beds must be located in a hospital. As will be described in further detail below, the present disclosure is focused primarily on various alert light assemblies or alert light modules that convey information regarding the status of multiple features or functions of bed <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, frame <b>20</b> of bed <b>10</b> includes a base frame <b>28</b>, an upper frame assembly <b>30</b> and a lift system <b>32</b> coupling upper frame assembly <b>30</b> to base frame <b>28</b>. Lift system <b>32</b> is operable to raise, lower, and tilt upper frame assembly <b>30</b> relative to base frame <b>28</b>. Bed <b>10</b> has a head end <b>24</b> and a foot end <b>26</b> that is spaced from head end <b>24</b> in a longitudinal dimension of bed <b>10</b>. Hospital bed <b>10</b> further includes a footboard <b>12</b> at the foot end <b>26</b> and a headboard <b>14</b> at the head end <b>24</b>. Illustrative bed <b>10</b> includes a pair of push handles <b>47</b> coupled to an upstanding portion <b>27</b> of base frame <b>28</b> at the head end <b>24</b> of bed <b>10</b>. Headboard <b>46</b> is also coupled to upstanding portion <b>27</b> of base frame <b>28</b> as well. Footboard <b>45</b> is coupled to upper frame assembly <b>30</b>. Base frame <b>28</b> includes wheels or casters <b>29</b> that roll along a floor (not shown) as bed <b>10</b> is moved from one location to another. A set of foot pedals <b>31</b> are coupled to base frame <b>28</b> and are used to brake and release casters <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Illustrative hospital bed <b>10</b> has four siderail assemblies coupled to upper frame assembly <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The four siderail assemblies include a pair of head siderail assemblies <b>48</b> (sometimes referred to as head rails) and a pair of foot siderail assemblies <b>50</b> (sometimes referred to as foot rails). Siderails <b>48</b> are spaced from each other in a lateral dimension of bed <b>10</b> and the same can be said of siderails <b>50</b>. Each of the siderail assemblies <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> is movable between a raised position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and a lowered position (not shown). Siderail assemblies <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> are sometimes referred to herein as siderails <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. Each siderail <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> includes a barrier panel <b>54</b> and a linkage <b>56</b>. Each linkage <b>56</b> is coupled to the upper frame assembly <b>30</b> and is configured to guide the barrier panel <b>54</b> during movement of siderails <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> between the respective raised and lowered positions. Barrier panel <b>54</b> is maintained by the linkage <b>56</b> in a substantially vertical orientation during movement of siderails <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> between the respective raised and lowered positions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Upper frame assembly <b>30</b> includes a lift frame <b>34</b>, a weigh frame <b>36</b> supported with respect to lift frame <b>34</b>, and a patient support deck <b>38</b> carried by weigh frame <b>36</b>. Each of frames <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, either individually of collectively, is considered to be an &#x201c;upper frame&#x201d; according to this disclosure. Thus, patient support apparatuses that omit one or more of frames <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> but yet still have an upper frame are within the scope of this disclosure. So, basically, the upper frame is considered to be the portion of bed frame <b>20</b> that is moved by lift system <b>32</b> relative to base frame <b>30</b>, regardless of its configuration. Accordingly, upper frame assembly <b>30</b> is sometimes referred to herein as simply upper frame <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Patient support deck <b>38</b> is carried by weigh frame <b>36</b> and engages a bottom surface of mattress <b>22</b>. Patient support deck <b>38</b> includes a head section <b>40</b>, a seat section <b>42</b>, a thigh section <b>43</b> and a foot section <b>44</b> in the illustrative example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The placement of reference numerals <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> generally denotes the location of the corresponding sections. Sections <b>40</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> are each movable relative to weigh frame <b>36</b>. For example, head section <b>40</b> pivotably raises and lowers relative to seat section <b>42</b> whereas foot section <b>44</b> pivotably raises and lowers relative to thigh section <b>43</b>. Additionally, thigh section <b>43</b> articulates relative to seat section <b>42</b>. Also, in some embodiments, foot section <b>44</b> is extendable and retractable to change the overall length of foot section <b>44</b> and therefore, to change the overall length of deck <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the illustrative embodiment, seat section <b>42</b> is fixed in position with respect to weigh frame <b>36</b> as patient support deck <b>38</b> moves between its various patient supporting positions including a horizontal position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to support the patient in a supine position, for example, and a chair position (not shown) to support the patient in a sitting up position. In other embodiments, seat section <b>42</b> also moves relative to weigh frame <b>36</b>, such as by pivoting and/or translating. Of course, in those embodiments in which seat section <b>42</b> translates along upper frame <b>42</b>, the thigh and foot sections <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> also translate along with seat section <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Bed <b>10</b> includes one or more motors or actuators, which in some embodiments, comprise linear actuators with electric motors to move the various sections <b>40</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> relative to frame <b>36</b> and operate lift system <b>32</b> to raise, lower, and tilt upper frame assembly <b>30</b> relative to base frame <b>28</b>. These actuators are well-known in the hospital bed art and thus, are not illustrated herein. Alternative actuators or motors contemplated by this disclosure include hydraulic cylinders and pneumatic cylinders, for example. Further details of the various aspects of bed <b>10</b> can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,658,680; 6,611,979; 6,691,346; 6,957,461; and 7,296,312, each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the illustrative example, bed <b>10</b> has four foot pedals <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i>, <b>84</b><i>d </i>coupled to base frame <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Foot pedal <b>84</b><i>a </i>is used to raise upper frame assembly <b>30</b> relative to base frame <b>28</b>, foot pedal <b>84</b><i>b </i>is used to lower upper frame assembly <b>30</b> relative to base frame <b>28</b>, foot pedal <b>84</b><i>c </i>is used to raise head section <b>40</b> relative to frame <b>36</b>, and foot pedal <b>84</b><i>d </i>is used to lower head section <b>40</b> relative to frame <b>36</b>. In other embodiments, foot pedals <b>84</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are omitted.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each siderail <b>48</b> includes a first user control panel <b>66</b> coupled to the outward side of the associated barrier panel <b>54</b> and each siderail <b>48</b> includes a second user control panel <b>67</b> coupled to the inward side of the associated barrier panel <b>54</b>. Control panel <b>66</b> includes various buttons that are used by a caregiver (not shown) to control associated functions of bed <b>10</b> and control panel <b>67</b> includes various buttons that are used by a patient (not shown) to control associated function of bed <b>10</b>. For example, control panel <b>66</b> includes buttons that are used to raise and lower the head section <b>40</b>, buttons that are used to operate knee motor to raise and lower the thigh section <b>43</b>, and buttons that are used to raise, lower, and tilt upper frame assembly <b>30</b> relative to base frame <b>28</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, control panel <b>67</b> includes buttons that are used to raise and lower the head, thigh, and foot sections <b>40</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>. In some embodiments, the buttons of control panels <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> comprise membrane switches.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the illustrative embodiment, a scale/ppm control panel <b>68</b> is also provided on the outward side of at least one barrier panel <b>54</b> of siderails <b>48</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A scale/patient position monitoring (ppm) system of bed <b>10</b> is a well-known feature to those skilled in the art and is used to weight a patient supported on bed <b>10</b> and to monitor a position of the patient on bed <b>10</b>. Such a scale/ppm system, in some patient support apparatuses, such as bed <b>10</b> has weight and/or position sensors <b>70</b> as shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. Sensors <b>70</b> in some embodiments include load cells with strain gages. The load cells support scale frame <b>36</b> with respect to lift frame <b>36</b> in the embodiment of bed <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. Signals from sensors <b>70</b> are electrically coupled to control circuitry <b>72</b> of bed <b>10</b> and are processed by a microprocessor <b>74</b> of control circuitry of bed <b>10</b> using software stored in memory <b>76</b> to determine a patient's weight and position on bed <b>10</b>. Further details of a suitable scale/ppm system for use on bed <b>10</b> are included in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,658,680; 6,611,979; 6,691,346; 6,957,461; and 7,296,312 which are already incorporated by reference herein. Still more details of a suitable scale/ppm system for bed <b>10</b> can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,253,366 which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, footboard <b>12</b> has a main body <b>90</b> that serves as a barrier at foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b>. Main body <b>90</b> is formed to include a pair of grip handles <b>92</b> at its upper end or top <b>94</b> and is formed to include a laterally extending, generally horizontal opening <b>96</b> adjacent its lower end or bottom <b>98</b>. Footboard <b>12</b> is removably coupleable to upper frame <b>30</b> as is well-known in the art. Thus, footboard <b>12</b> includes a first set of couplers (not shown) that mate with a second set of couplers (not shown) provided on upper frame <b>30</b>. For example, in some embodiments footboard <b>12</b> has posts (not shown) that are received in sockets (not shown) provided at the foot end <b>26</b> of foot section <b>44</b> of deck <b>38</b>. In other embodiments, footboard <b>12</b> has sockets and foot end <b>26</b> of foot section <b>44</b> of deck <b>38</b> has upstanding posts that are received in the sockets of footboard <b>12</b>. An example of footboard coupling to a bed frame using posts and sockets is discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">When footboard <b>12</b> is coupled to upper frame assembly <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, opening <b>96</b> aligns with an alert light assembly <b>100</b> such that the alert light assembly is visible through opening <b>96</b> at the foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b>. Alert light assembly <b>100</b> is attached to a lateral frame member <b>110</b> of foot section <b>44</b> of deck <b>44</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. When footboard <b>12</b> is detached from upper frame assembly <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, alert light assembly <b>100</b> remains attached to lateral frame member <b>110</b> and, of course, can still be seen at the foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Alert light assembly <b>100</b> has four separate zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> that are individually illuminated to convey information regarding respective alert conditions of bed <b>10</b>. According to this disclosure, alert light assembly <b>100</b> is sufficiently large to occupy at least about one third of the distance between the longitudinally extending, laterally spaced apart sides <b>118</b> of the upper frame <b>30</b> and to occupy at least about half the distance between a top surface <b>112</b> and a bottom surface <b>114</b> of the lateral frame member <b>110</b> without extending beyond top surface <b>112</b> and bottom surface <b>114</b> of the lateral frame member <b>110</b>. In fact, in the illustrative example, alert light assembly <b>100</b> occupies roughly three fourths of the distance between the longitudinally extending sides <b>118</b> of upper frame <b>30</b>. Thus, alert light assembly <b>100</b> is on the order of about two to three feet in length across the lateral dimension of upper frame <b>30</b> between sides <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Alert light assembly <b>100</b> has an elongated bar or housing <b>120</b> that carries the zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> that are illuminated. Thus, alert light assembly <b>100</b> is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;light bar.&#x201d; In the illustrative example, opening <b>96</b> is shaped as an elongated, narrow, horizontally extending rectangle defined by a rectangular edge <b>116</b> as shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Opening <b>96</b> is about the same size as the periphery of housing <b>120</b> of alert light assembly <b>100</b>. Furthermore, lateral frame member <b>110</b> has a vertically oriented wall <b>115</b> formed with a rectangular hole or opening <b>117</b> that is also about the same size as opening <b>96</b> and the periphery of housing <b>120</b>. Thus, the majority of housing <b>120</b> is situated inside an interior region of lateral frame member <b>110</b> but a portion of housing <b>120</b> is received within opening <b>117</b> to fill opening <b>117</b>. In some embodiments, however, housing <b>120</b> is recessed just slightly within opening <b>117</b> so that an outer surface of wall <b>115</b> of lateral frame member <b>110</b> protects alert light assembly <b>100</b> to some extent from impacts. In the illustrative example, opening <b>117</b> in wall <b>115</b> is situated about midway between the sides <b>118</b> of upper frame assembly <b>30</b>. Later frame member <b>110</b>, therefore, is a tubular member having a substantially hollow interior region that receives a portion of housing <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, each of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is approximately square in shape or slightly rectangular. According to this disclosure, each of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is substantially the same size and this size may range from about 1 inch to about 3 inches in the vertical dimension and from about 1 inch to about 3 inches in the horizontal dimension, at the option of the bed designer. Thus, zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>, even at their lower size range, are much larger than standard light emitting diodes (LED's) having domes which typically come in sizes of three or five millimeters in diameter. Accordingly, when any of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> are illuminated, they can be viewed and understood from a distance that is on the order of ten to twenty feet away. Thus, a caregiver standing in a hallway of healthcare facility and looking through the door of a patient room will easily be able to discern which of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is illuminated green or illuminated a color other than green, such as red, orange, or amber, or not illuminated at all.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the amount of housing material situated horizontally between each of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is larger that the horizontal dimension of each of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. In other words, a fairly noticeable unilluminated space between zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> exists in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, housing <b>120</b> is formed to include openings <b>121</b> that receive lenses <b>122</b> which are associated with respective zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. The portions of housing <b>120</b> between the openings <b>121</b> that receive lenses <b>122</b>, therefore, serve as partitions between the lenses.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Inside housing <b>120</b>, behind each of the lenses <b>122</b> is at least one light emitter. In some embodiments, the at least one light emitter behind each lens <b>122</b> includes a first LED <b>78</b> that emits green light and a second LED <b>80</b> that emits amber or yellow light as shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. In other embodiments, second LED emits some other color of light other than green, such as red or orange. In the diagrammatic example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, a pair of electrical conductors <b>82</b> electrically couple control circuitry <b>72</b> of bed <b>10</b> to each respective LED <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> with at least one conductor <b>82</b> of each pair having a current limiting resistor <b>86</b>. Thus, control circuitry <b>72</b> controls whether LED <b>78</b> of each zone <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is lit or whether LED <b>80</b> of each zone <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is lit depending upon the status of the monitored bed conditions. In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>72</b> includes one or more LED driver integrated circuit (IC) chips (not shown) that control the application of current on conductors <b>82</b> to illuminate the respective LED's <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Other light emitters for assembly <b>100</b>, including light bulbs of suitably small size, are within the scope of this disclosure. In lieu of two separate LED's <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, a bi-color or tri-color LED is used in other embodiments of alert light assembly <b>100</b>. Organic light emitting diodes (OLED's), including light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEC's), are used as the light emitters in still other embodiments contemplated by this disclosure. Thus, the term light emitter is intended to cover all devices that are capable of emitting light. A flexible light strip that carries a set of LED's is attached to a rear of housing <b>120</b> in some embodiments such that LED's on the flexible light strip are positioned within the openings of housing <b>120</b> behind respective lenses <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Each of lenses <b>122</b> is translucent such that light appears to be emitted from each lens <b>122</b> across the entire surface area of the lens <b>122</b>, with one exception in some embodiments. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, each lens <b>122</b> has an indicia provided thereon which blocks the emitted light from passing through the indicia. The indicia on the lenses <b>122</b> of each zone <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> relates to a particular bed function such that each zone <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is illuminated in a manner to indicate a satisfactory status or unsatisfactory status of four different bed conditions, assuming the particular bed condition is being monitored. If a particular condition of bed <b>10</b> associated with one or more of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> is not being monitored, then the light emitter(s) associated with that zone is turned off altogether. In some embodiments, lenses <b>122</b> are frosted in appearance.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the illustrative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, zone <b>101</b> is associated with a bed exit or ppm function of the scale/ppm system of bed <b>10</b>. Thus, the indicia of zone <b>101</b> is an icon of a person starting to exit the bed and stand up. Thus, when the ppm system of bed <b>10</b> is armed such that a patient's position on bed <b>10</b> is being monitored by the control circuitry of bed <b>10</b> in a known manner, zone <b>101</b> is illuminated green to indicate a satisfactory status if the patient is within a range of permissible positions on bed <b>10</b> and zone <b>101</b> is illuminated a color other than green (e.g., amber, red, or orange) to indicate an unsatisfactory status if the patient has moved outside the range of permissible positions. Bed exit is one of the modes or levels of sensitivity of the ppm system, as is well-known in the art. Other modes of other patient movement amounts or sensitivities are also known in the art for ppm systems. For example, many beds marketed by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. have three modes of sensitivity: patient movement mode, patient position mode, and out-of-bed mode. Zone <b>101</b> changes from being illuminated green to being illuminated a color other than green in response to the detection of an alarm condition associated with the selected mode of operation of the ppm system of bed <b>10</b>. If the ppm system is disarmed, then zone <b>101</b> is not illuminated any color at all. The ppm system of bed <b>10</b> includes weight/position sensors <b>70</b> and the portion of control circuitry <b>72</b>, both hardware and software, related to the weighing and ppm function of bed <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the illustrative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, zone <b>102</b> is associated with a head of bed (HOB) angle. Thus, bed <b>10</b> includes an angle sensor <b>88</b>, shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, such as a potentiometer or accelerometer that measures an angle at which head section <b>40</b> of deck <b>38</b> is raised relative to frame <b>36</b>, in the case of the potentiometer, or relative to horizontal, in the case of the accelerometer. Sensor <b>88</b> is electrically coupled to control circuitry <b>72</b>. In some embodiments, a potentiometer or other type of shaft encoder, such as a magnetic sensor or optical rotary encoder, is included in the actuator that moves head section <b>40</b> and an output from the potentiometer or shaft encoder of the actuator is correlated to an angle of head section <b>40</b> relative to frame <b>36</b>. Thus, in such embodiments the potentiometer or the shaft encoder of the linear actuator serves as the angle sensor <b>88</b>. In any event, when a HOB angle monitoring feature of bed <b>10</b> is armed, control circuitry <b>72</b> of bed <b>10</b> monitors the HOB angle to make sure that head section <b>40</b> is raised above a threshold angle, such as thirty degrees or fifty degrees, for example. Other threshold angles are within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is not uncommon for doctors to order that the HOB angle be raised to at least the threshold angle as a preventative measure for ventilated assisted pneumonia (VAP) from occurring in the patient.

Such information may be transmitted from, for example, a computer device of a nurse call system, an electronic medical records (EMR) system, or an admission/discharge/transfer (ADT) system. Thus, in some embodiments, the messages shown on display <b>290</b> include messages relating to the patient associated with bed <b>10</b>, such as displaying the patient's name or physiological data like vital signs. It is also contemplated by this disclosure that messages directed to caregivers are displayed on electronic display <b>290</b>. For example, messages reminding caregivers to wash their hands or providing information of a general nature such as lunch room hours are a couple of possibilities of such messages.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the illustrative embodiment, electronic display <b>290</b> is sufficiently large to occupy more than half the distance between the laterally spaced apart sides <b>118</b> of the upper frame <b>30</b> and to occupy a space between top <b>112</b> and bottom <b>114</b> of lateral frame member <b>110</b> without extending beyond top <b>112</b> and bottom <b>114</b>. In fact, display <b>290</b> spans almost the entire length of lateral frame member <b>110</b> as shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.

Shell <b>308</b> has a top wall <b>312</b>, a bottom wall <b>314</b> and a set of partition walls <b>316</b> extending vertically between walls <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>. Partition walls <b>316</b> define pockets that receive LED's (not shown, but similar to LED's <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> described above) which are mounted on a circuit board <b>318</b> of module <b>300</b>. One or more LED driver IC chips are also mounted on circuit board <b>318</b> in some embodiments. A rear wall <b>320</b> of shell <b>308</b> has a rectangular opening <b>322</b> through which the LED's extend into the pockets defined between partition walls <b>316</b>. Circuit board <b>318</b> is sized to fit into, and substantially fill, opening <b>322</b>. Portions of the circuit board <b>318</b> between the groups of LED's associated with each of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> engage rear edges <b>324</b> of partition walls <b>316</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Backing plate <b>310</b> includes a vertical wall <b>326</b> and a top wall <b>328</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.

Thus, circuit board <b>318</b> is sandwiched between wall <b>326</b> of plate <b>310</b> and shell <b>308</b>. When lens <b>302</b> is being coupled to housing <b>306</b> with the fasteners, lens <b>302</b> is drawn into contact with the front edge of each partition wall <b>316</b>. This prevents light emitted in one of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> of module <b>300</b> from bleeding into an adjacent zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Top wall <b>328</b> of backing plate <b>310</b> extends from the wall <b>326</b> and overlies top wall <b>312</b> of shell <b>308</b>.

Aperture <b>336</b> receives a suitable fastener that permits module <b>300</b> to pivot or rotate relative to the frame member of frame <b>20</b> to which module <b>300</b> is attached. In some embodiments, plate <b>310</b> is made of sheet metal and shell <b>308</b> is made of a plastics material. Lens <b>302</b> is made of a translucent plastics material in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Rounded end walls <b>304</b> of lens <b>302</b> cover rounded end walls <b>338</b> of shell <b>308</b> when lens <b>302</b> and housing <b>306</b> are coupled together. Shell <b>308</b> has a U-shaped rear flange <b>340</b> that abuts a U-shaped rear edge <b>342</b> of lens <b>302</b> when lens <b>302</b> and housing <b>306</b> are coupled together. Shell <b>308</b> also has a U-shaped top flange <b>344</b> that abuts a U-shaped top edge <b>346</b> of lens <b>302</b> when lens <b>302</b> and housing <b>306</b> are coupled together. A bottom surface of flange <b>344</b> is formed to include a groove (not shown) that receives a U-shaped ridge <b>348</b> that projects upwardly with respect to edge <b>346</b> of lens <b>302</b>. An additional opening or slot (not shown) is provided in backing plate <b>310</b> for conductors, such as a ribbon or cable of wires extending from circuit board <b>318</b>, to pass through. The light emitters of zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> of module <b>300</b> are illuminated in the same manner and under the same circumstances as modules <b>160</b>, <b>160</b>&#x2032; discussed above.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref>, another alternative alert light module <b>400</b> includes a housing <b>402</b> having a front wall <b>404</b> that is formed to include four square-shaped openings <b>406</b>. Module <b>400</b> includes lenses <b>408</b> that extend across respective openings <b>406</b>. Each lens <b>408</b> has indicia in the form of graphical icons that relate to monitored bed conditions. Thus, module <b>400</b> has four separate zones <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b> that are individually illuminated to convey information regarding respective alert conditions of the bed to which module <b>400</b> is coupled. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, portions of the bed that can be seen are denoted with reference numbers that correspond to like elements of bed <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The indicia of zone <b>411</b> is a bed not down icon. The indicia for zone <b>412</b> is a HOB angle icon. The indicia for zone <b>413</b> is a stop sign icon which indicates that the casters <b>29</b> of the bed are not braked. Thus, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the bed has one or more sensors to sense whether or not the casters <b>29</b> are brake and the sensor(s) is/are electrically coupled to the control circuitry <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>) of the bed. The indicia for zone <b>414</b> is a siderail icon. The discussion above, in connection with the preceding embodiments, regarding the various monitored bed conditions is equally applicable to module <b>400</b>. Thus, module <b>400</b> includes one or more light emitters behind each of lenses <b>408</b>. For example, in some embodiments, a first LED which shines green light is situated behind each of lenses <b>408</b> and a second LED which shines light other than green, such as amber, red, or orange, is also situated behind lenses <b>408</b>. In other embodiments, a single bi-colored LED is located behind respective lenses <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Housing <b>402</b> of module <b>400</b> has a bottom wall <b>410</b> that is formed to include cutouts <b>416</b> that match the graphical icons or indicia on associated lenses <b>408</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. In some cases, the cutouts <b>416</b> comprise a single hole and in other cases, the cutouts comprise multiple holes. The cutouts <b>416</b> are located on bottom wall <b>410</b> so as to correspond to associated zones <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b> of module <b>400</b>. Partition walls (not shown, but similar to those described above in preceding embodiments) are provided in the interior region of housing <b>402</b> to separate the zones <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Some of the light emitted from the respective light emitters (e.g. green LED and amber LED) passes through the respective cutout <b>416</b> and projects an image <b>418</b> of the cutout on the floor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. Only one image <b>418</b> is projected on the floor in the illustrative example. Most healthcare facilities have neutral colored floors that are relatively light in shade, such as being off white, beige, or gray, for example. Thus, the color of image <b>418</b> on the floor will match the color of the light emitted through the respective cutout <b>416</b>. Light also passes through lenses <b>408</b> in the illustrative embodiment, but in other embodiments, lenses <b>408</b> are omitted and front wall <b>404</b> is solid across its entire surface. In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>, module <b>400</b> is sufficiently large for a caregiver to discern the color of the light emitted through lenses <b>408</b> when the caregiver is standing at a distance of ten to twenty feet or more from module <b>400</b>. The images <b>418</b> on the floor enhance the ability of caregivers to determine the alert status of the associated bed.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In those embodiments in which two differently colored light emitters are located side-by-side in the interior region of housing <b>402</b> of module <b>400</b> for each of zones <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b>, then the position of the image <b>418</b> on the floor will shift by a slight amount when module <b>400</b> switches from emitting light from the first light emitter to emitting light form the second light emitter, and vice versa. Thus, the spacing between the light emitters of each zone <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b> dictates how far the image <b>418</b> shifts on the floor. It will be appreciated that the light emitters should be positioned within housing <b>402</b> so that there is no overlap on the floor of the images <b>418</b> projected from all four zones <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b> regardless of which light emitter of each zone is emitting light at any given time. In other embodiments that use a bicolor LED, for example, the issue of a shifting location of image <b>418</b> on the floor is avoided because the light is emitted from the bicolor light emitter at the same location within housing <b>402</b> regardless of color. In some embodiments, module <b>400</b> is operated so that image <b>418</b> is flashed on the floor when an alert condition is detected on the bed for a corresponding zone <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b>. The light emitted from the associated lens <b>408</b>, of course, also will flash in such embodiments.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, the light emitters of module <b>400</b> are arranged within housing <b>402</b> so that green colored images <b>418</b> are projected onto the floor for each zone <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b> a first distance outwardly from foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b> in the longitudinal direction of bed <b>10</b> and so that amber colored images <b>418</b> (or whatever color other than green is used) are projected onto the floor for each zone <b>411</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b> a second distance outwardly from foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b> in the longitudinal direction of bed <b>10</b>. The second distance is greater than the first distance in some embodiments. Thus, in such embodiments, green images <b>418</b> on the floor will be generally aligned with each other at the first distance from foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b> and will be generally parallel to the lateral dimension of bed <b>10</b>. Similarly, amber images <b>418</b> on the floor will be generally aligned with each other at the second distance from foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b> and will be generally parallel to the lateral dimension of bed <b>10</b>. For example, green images <b>418</b> may be projected onto the floor one foot from foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b> and amber images <b>418</b> may be projected onto the floor two feet from foot end <b>26</b> of bed. Of course, other dimensions for the first and second distances may be chosen in other embodiments at the discretion of the bed designer. Because the amber images are projected further out from foot end <b>26</b> of bed <b>10</b> and because, in some embodiments, the amber images <b>418</b> also flash, the amber images <b>418</b> will be readily noticeable to caregivers from afar.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Housing <b>402</b> is box-like in structure such that there are side walls and a back wall which cannot be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>.

In the illustrative example, a portion of front wall <b>404</b> projects upwardly and serves as a mounting flange <b>422</b>.

In other embodiments, apertures are provided on flange <b>422</b> and/or top wall <b>420</b> for receipt of fasteners such as rivets, screws or bolts. Housing <b>402</b> also has an opening or slot (not shown) for conductors, such as a ribbon or cable of wires, to pass through to provide current to a circuit board within housing <b>402</b> or to connect directly to the light emitters without an intervening circuit board.

Accordingly, alert light assembly <b>500</b> has a very thin substrate <b>506</b> which carries bi-color light emitting diode (LED) regions <b>508</b> which define separate zones <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b>, <b>504</b> that are illuminated to convey information regarding respective alert conditions. Each region <b>508</b> of zones <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b>, <b>504</b> of assembly <b>500</b> has the same indicia and relates to the same functions of bed <b>10</b> as assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032;, <b>100</b>&#x2033; discussed above. Thus, the discussion herein of diagrammatic circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> is also applicable to assembly <b>500</b>. Furthermore, the light emitters of zones <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b>, <b>504</b> of assembly <b>500</b> are illuminated in the same manner and under the same circumstances as assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032;, <b>100</b>&#x2033; discussed above.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The adhesive backing of substrate <b>506</b> is used to adhere assembly <b>500</b> to an outer surface of barrier panel <b>54</b> of siderail <b>50</b>.

Those various control screens are not salient to the present disclosure. What is salient is a screen saver screen <b>602</b> that appears on GUI <b>600</b> after a period of inactivity of use of the GUI <b>600</b>. The period of inactivity of use is monitored by control circuitry <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>) and may be on the order of about 1 minute to about 5 minutes, for example, at the discretion of the bed designer. Of course, other time out periods are within the scope of this disclosure. Screen saver screen <b>602</b> is sometimes referred to herein simply as screen saver <b>602</b>.

In some embodiments, icons <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> associated with unsatisfactory conditions of bed <b>10</b> are flashed on screen saver <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the illustrative example, an angle at which head section <b>40</b> is raised relative to frame <b>66</b> or relative to horizontal is displayed in a field <b>610</b> adjacent to icon <b>608</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, field <b>610</b> indicates that the HOB angle is 35 degrees. The threshold angle above which head section <b>44</b> is supposed to be raised in order to have a satisfactory status is 50 degrees as indicated in icon <b>608</b>. Thus, head section <b>44</b> is below the threshold angle. Accordingly, a bell symbol <b>612</b> is added to icon <b>608</b> to indicate an alert condition. Thus, due to the alert condition, icon <b>608</b> is displayed a color other than green, whereas icons <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> are displayed green in color.

Examples of the types of sensors that are suitable for use as sensor(s) <b>800</b> include force sensors, such as force sensitive resistors (FSR's), piezoelectric materials, and strain gain gages. In some embodiments, sensors <b>70</b> of the scale/ppm sensor are used to monitor the patient's sleep state such that separate sensors <b>800</b> are not needed for this purpose. Motion sensor pads situated between mattress <b>22</b> and deck <b>38</b>, acoustic sensors, and temperatures sensors that measure patient temperature are examples of other types of sensors that may be used as sensor(s) <b>800</b> if desired. Accordingly, block <b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> is intended to represent any and all types of sensors that may be used in connection with monitoring a patient's sleep state.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">A sleep state alert light <b>802</b> is also included on bed <b>10</b> as indicated diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. For example, in some embodiments, light <b>802</b> is coupled to frame <b>20</b> of bed <b>10</b> at a location spaced from the alert light assemblies and the alert light modules, if any, on bed <b>10</b>. Control circuitry <b>72</b> controls the illumination of alert light based on the sleep state of the patient, as measured by sensor(s) <b>800</b>, so as to indicate an optimal time for a caregiver to take at least one vital sign of the patient. In some instances, the optimal time for the caregiver to take the at least one vital sign is when the signal from sensor <b>800</b> indicates that the sleep state of the patient is a deep sleep state. In other instances, the optimal time for the caregiver to take the at least one vital sign is when the signal from the sensor <b>800</b> indicates that the sleep state of the patient is an alert state of sleep.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In some embodiments, the alert light <b>802</b> is changed from a first color to a second color to indicate the optimal time for the caregiver to take the at least one vital sign of the patient. In other embodiments, the alert light <b>802</b> is changed from an off state to an on state to indicate the optimal time for the caregiver to take the at least one vital sign of the patient. It is contemplated by this disclosure that each of the alert light assemblies and each of the alert light modules described above, as well as the GUI <b>600</b>, are used to indicate the optimal time for the caregiver to take at least one vital sign of the patient. For example, if a third light emitter of a third color, say blue, is added to the illuminated zones (e.g., zones <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> or zones <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b>, <b>504</b> or zones <b>701</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>703</b>, <b>704</b>) then when the optimal time for taking patient vitals signs is detected by circuitry <b>72</b>, then all four of the zones are illuminated the third color.

Furthermore, in some embodiments, sensor(s) <b>800</b> monitor one or more vital signs of the patient in addition to monitoring the patient's sleep state. Thus, when circuitry determines that it is the optimal time for taking the patient's vital signs, circuitry <b>72</b> operates automatically to take the patient's vital signs using sensor(s) <b>800</b> and then either stores the vital signs in memory <b>76</b> or transmits the vital signs information to the network of the healthcare facility for storage in a remote computer device (e.g., the patient's electronic medical record in an EMR computer database) or both.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">While several of the embodiments discussed above have four separate zones for alerting, it is within the scope of this disclosure for an alert light assembly or an alert light module of the types discussed herein to have a number of zones less than or greater than four.

Thus, the current flowing to the light emitters, such as LED's <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, is increased or decreased, such as by use of a voltage controller, based on the signal received from the ambient room light sensor. In some embodiments, the voltage applied to the light emitters uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to control the brightness. Thus, the duty cycle of the PWM voltage applied to the light emitters, such as LED's <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>, is increased or decreased based on the signal received from the ambient room light sensor to, in turn, adjust the brightness of the light emitters.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Although certain illustrative embodiments have been described in detail above, many embodiments, variations and modifications are possible that are still within the scope and spirit of this disclosure as described herein and as defined in the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-10" num="01-10"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>10</b>.
