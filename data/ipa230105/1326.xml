Samples are separated into asphaltenes, saturates, aromatics and resins, mass percentages of which are measured respectively.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, NB/SH/T 0509-2010 &#x201c;TEST METHOD FOR SEPARATION OF ASPHALT INTO FOUR FRACTIONS&#x201d; is applied in petrochemical field in China for measuring the four fractions of heavy oil. Major steps of this standard method includes: (1) Preparation of packing materials of alumina chromatography column. it is necessary to activate commercially available alumina at 500&#xb0; C. for 6 h, then add 1% mass of water, shake vigorously and let it stand for 24 h. The stationary phase is valid for one week. (2) Separation of asphaltenes. The samples need to be heated and refluxed in n-heptane for 0.5 h-1 h, settle for 1 h and then filtered. The container needs to be washed with hot n-heptane several times, then the filter paper with precipitate needs to be refluxed and extracted with n-heptane for 1 h and then with toluene for 1 h, finally the toluene extracts are dried by evaporation to a constant weight for obtaining the content of asphaltenes. (3) Packing of chromatography column: the alumina prepared in step (1) needs to be added to a glass adsorption column tube. Gently tap continuously to form a tightly packed column. (4) Separation of saturates, aromatics and resins. Pre-wet the column with n-heptane, then solutions without asphaltenes obtained in step (2) are loaded therein. Elute the column with n-heptane, toluene, toluene-ethanol respectively to obtain the saturates, aromatics and resins. (5) Weigh each fraction. The solution of each fraction obtained in step (4) has to be distilled by distillation apparatus firstly to remove most of the solvent, placed in a vacuum oven for 1 h and then removed therefrom, cooled and weighed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This standard mainly has following problems in current applications. (1) Steps are cumbersome, the operator is labor-intensive, and the time for analysis is too long (two days for one sample). (2) In order to ensure an accuracy of the data, one sample needs to be measured twice in parallel. The steps in above standard method are tedious, the required experimental equipment covers a large area, and it requires a floor-standing fume hood, which makes it difficult to analyze multi-path and multiple samples at the same time. (3) Since the preparation and packing of alumina are performed manually, the properties of alumina packing materials obtained in various laboratories have large difference and short valid time, and the packing thereof is not tight enough, which will affect the separation effect. (4) The column separation process is pressurized by the gravity and duplex ball, and the elution speed is slow and uncontrollable, which affect repeatability of separation. (5) The glass conical flasks of 150 mL-250 mL are used when the asphaltenes are refluxed and the other three fractions are received. The mass of the container itself exceeds 100 g, and the mass of each fraction after drying is less than 1 g, even less than 0.1 g, such that the weighing error caused by the mass of the container is relatively large. (6) It requires about 500 mL n-heptane, toluene and other volatile organic solvents to process each sample, which bring many potential dangers to the health of the operators and the safety and environmental protection of laboratory. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an separation apparatus for the four fractions which has easy steps, high degree of automation, good separation effects, and low solvent consumption, so as to lay a foundation for the development of a method for measuring four fractions which has a better precision, less labor and time, and safety and environmental protection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The American Society for Testing and Materials also has a similar method standard ASTM D-4124. Compared with the separation apparatus proposed in NB/SH/T 0509, the main improvement in ASTM D-4124 is a plunger pump which is adopted for controlling the flow rate of the elution solvent in step (4), so as to improve the speed and repeatability of separation. A peristaltic pump is used in Chinese utility model patent CN207366580U for controlling the flow rate of elution solvent, an angle splitter is further used for realizing the automatic switching of the elution solvent and the automatic receiving of the eluted fractions, and a solvent condensation recovery apparatus is further added therein. On the basis of realizing the control of flow rate with pump, automatic switching of solvents, collection of eluted fractions, and recovery of solvents, an automatic analyzer for four fractions of heavy oil (model BN-118) produced by Dalian Bangneng Petroleum Instrument Co., Ltd has further added an automatic column packing apparatus which uses mechanical vibrations to replace the manual tap in step (3). However, when the above devices are used to separate four fractions, the following problems still exist: (1) it is still necessary to separate the asphaltenes according to step (2), and this cumbersome step cannot be omitted; (3) the glass conical flask of 150 mL-250 mL are still used as receiving containers, so that the weighing error caused by the excessive mass of the container is still unavoidable; and (4) a chromatographic column packed in a glass tube is still used for separation, which requires a long separation time and a large amount of solvent. Therefore, the separation of four fractions using the improved apparatus described above is still a time-consuming and manual process, which affects the simplicity and accuracy of the four fractions measurement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Medium pressure liquid chromatography refers to preparative liquid chromatography that is operated at 5 bar-20 bar. Generally, this pressure is provided by a pump. Compared with a normal pressure or low pressure chromatography column, a medium pressure chromatography column uses finer packing materials, which can be packed more tightly, and correspondingly, the column efficiency will be higher; since the solvent flows under the pressure, the back pressure of the chromatography column can be higher, so the column efficiency can be improved by increasing the length of the column; flow rate of solvent of the medium pressure liquid chromatography is controllable and gradient elution can be achieved, which has the advantages of good repeatability of separation, short separation time, and less solvent consumption. In addition, compared with the high pressure liquid preparative chromatography, the medium pressure chromatography instruments and chromatographic columns are cheaper, and chromatographic columns can even be made into disposable consumables. Therefore, medium pressure liquid chromatography has a wide range of applications in the food, pharmaceutical and other industries, and it is an efficient, economical and precise means of chromatographic separation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the medium pressure liquid chromatography has not yet achieved successful application in the separation of four fractions of heavy oil. The difficulties in achieving a fast, accurate, highly automated, and low solvent consumed separation of four fractions of heavy oil by using medium pressure liquid chromatography are: (1) changing the asphaltenes separation step to a method that can be carried out online and automatically; (2) using a medium pressure chromatography column with a smaller volume to achieve four fractions separation effects equivalent to or better than the chromatography column with a larger volume in original standard; (3) achieving online collection of four fractions eluents and simultaneous solvent removal and reach constant weight, and reducing weighing errors; and (4) setting the splitting and solvent preheating apparatus on the basis of (1) to (3) to achieve simultaneous separation by using multiple paths and meet the needs of several samples and parallel experiments. Currently, there is no apparatus that can overcome any of the above-mentioned difficulties.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present disclosure is to provide an automatic separation apparatus for four fractions of heavy oil capable of realizing the automatic and rapid separation of four fractions of heavy oil, thereby saving time, reducing manual-induced operating errors, and improving the precision of separation and measurement.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide an automatic separation method for four fractions of heavy oil capable of realizing the automatic and rapid separation of the four fractions of heavy oil, thereby saving time, reducing manual-induced operating errors, and improving the precision of separation and measurement.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the above objects, the present disclosure provides an automatic separation apparatus for four fractions of heavy oil comprising:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a solvent reservoir tank;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a filter disc having one end in communication with the solvent reservoir tank, and the other end in communication with a first inlet of a pre-column flow path switching valve;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">a chromatographic column having an inlet in communication with the first outlet of the pre-column flow path switching valve, and an outlet in communication with a first inlet of a post-column flow path switching valve; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">a bypass pipeline having one end in communication with a second outlet of the pre-column flow path switching valve, and the other end in communication with a second inlet of the post-column flow path switching valve; and</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">a receiving apparatus in communication with an outlet of the post-column flow path switching valve.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">The present disclosure further provides a separation method for four fractions of heavy oil comprising the following steps of:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">S1: adding the heavy oil dispersed with a first solvent into a separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil, the heavy oil flowing through a filter disc and a chromatographic column sequentially, and using the first solvent to flush the separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil, to obtain a saturates eluent;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">S2: switching a pre-column flow path switching valve and a post-column flow path switching valve, adding a second solvent into the separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil for flushing, and the second solvent flowing through the filter disc and a bypass pipeline sequentially, to obtain an asphaltenes eluent;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">S3: switching the pre-column flow path switching valve and the post-column flow path switching valve, adding the second solvent into the separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil for flushing, and the second solvent flowing through the filter disc and the chromatographic column sequentially, to obtain an aromatics eluent;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">S4: adding a third solvent, a second solvent, and a fourth solvent sequentially into the separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil for flushing, to obtain a resins eluent, and using a receiving apparatus to collect eluents respectively obtained in S1-S4.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Compared with the prior arts, the present disclosure has the following advantages:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000">the automatic separation apparatus for four fractions of heavy oil and separation method thereof in the present disclosure can realize the online automatic separation and receiving of asphaltenes, saturates, aromatics and resins, and can remove solvents therefrom.

In order to ensure the accuracy of the measurement results, it is usually necessary to perform at least two parallel experiments, and take the average of the experimental results as the final measurement result. In the present disclosure, two or more separation units for four fractions of heavy oil <b>100</b> are preferably arranged in parallel. The automatic separation processes of four fractions of heavy oil are carried out simultaneously in parallel, so that the samples can be processed in multiple parallel experiments at the same time, thereby saving experimental time. For this purpose, a liquid splitting apparatus which has three multi-way joint with equal-divided paths (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) or one multi-way joint with four paths (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) for splitting liquid is provided between the sample loading apparatus <b>3</b> and the separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil <b>100</b>. As shown, the liquid splitting apparatus includes a splitter and four paths of metal pipes with equal back pressure. The splitter includes an inlet and three three-way pipes, namely three-way-1, three-way-2, and three-way-3. The branch pipes of three-way pipes have equal inner diameters and equal total lengths. The four paths of metal pipes <b>12</b> with equal back pressures have inner diameters of 0.05 mm-0.5 mm, and length-to-diameter ratios of 5000:1-50,000:1. In addition, a heating element <b>11</b> may also be provided, and the heating element <b>11</b> here is a metal heating element <b>11</b>. The heating element <b>11</b> is also provided with a fixing element <b>13</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the fixing element <b>13</b> is a metal sheet with grooves. Four paths of metal pipes <b>12</b> with equal back pressures are wound on the fixing element <b>13</b>, and a top cover <b>14</b> of the external heat exchange box is covered on the heating element <b>11</b>. The outlet ends of the four paths of metal pipes <b>12</b> with equal back pressures are connected to the inlet end of the separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil <b>100</b>. After being split by the liquid splitting apparatus, the solvent is injected into four separation units for four fractions of heavy oils <b>100</b> so that multiple groups of automatic separation processes for four fractions of heavy oil can be performed in parallel at the same time, thereby multiple groups of parallel experiments can be performed at the same time. The fixing element <b>13</b> can fix the metal pipe <b>12</b> so as to prevent the metal pipe <b>12</b> from sliding off the heating element <b>11</b> and failing to be heated. The top cover of the heat exchange box <b>14</b> can have a heat preservation effect on the heating element <b>11</b> and the metal pipe <b>12</b> to ensure that the temperature is controlled within the required range, preferably the temperature is 40&#xb0; C.-60&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0068">It should be noted that the solvent in the solvent reservoir tank <b>1</b> is preferably passed through the heating element <b>11</b> before being injected into the filter disc <b>4</b> by the pump <b>2</b>, and the heated solvent is split through parallel lines, delivered to each group separately, and enters the filter disc <b>4</b> separately. The present disclosure does not particularly limit how to split the solvent and set up the parallel lines, and also does not particularly limit whether to heat the solvent and how to heat it.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0069">When using the separation method for four fractions of heavy oil in the present disclosure, the heavy oil is firstly dispersed using a first solvent such as n-heptane, and then the dispersed heavy oil is added to the filter disc <b>4</b>, which is eluted with n-heptane. At this time, a flow direction of n-heptane and heavy oil is liquid inlet-filter disc <b>4</b>-chromatographic column <b>6</b>-liquid outlet. At this time, when n-heptane is loaded and eluted, n-heptane can dissolve saturates, aromatics and resins, but cannot dissolve asphaltenes, so that asphaltenes are trapped on the filter disc <b>4</b>. The saturates, aromatics and resins that can be dissolved in n-heptane enter chromatographic column <b>6</b>. Among them, the saturates are weak in polarity and cannot be retained by chromatographic column <b>6</b>. Therefore, it is first eluted from chromatographic column <b>6</b>, and saturates eluent is obtained. The aromatics and resins which are strong in polarity remain on the chromatographic column <b>6</b> for further elution. The asphalt is trapped on the filter disc <b>4</b> since it cannot be dissolved in the first solvent.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0070">Then, the pre-column flow path switching valve <b>5</b> is rotated to cut out the chromatographic column <b>6</b>. At this time, a flow direction of the liquid is liquid inlet-filter disc <b>4</b>-bypass pipeline <b>7</b>-liquid outlet. The asphaltenes on the filter disc <b>4</b> is eluted with a second solvent such as toluene, and the asphaltenes dissolved in toluene does not flow through the chromatographic column <b>6</b> but directly leads to subsequent detection or receiving apparatus <b>9</b>. At the same time, as there is no chromatographic solvent flows through the chromatographic column <b>6</b> which is outside the flow direction, the aromatics and resins temporarily retained on the chromatographic column <b>6</b> are not affected. After the asphaltenes on the filter disc <b>4</b> is completely dissolved by toluene and eluted to the subsequent detection or receiving apparatus <b>9</b>, the next step is performed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0071">The pre-column flow path switching valve <b>5</b> is rotated again to cut into the chromatographic column <b>6</b>. At this time, a flow direction of the liquid returns to the sequence of liquid inlet-filter disc <b>4</b>-chromatographic column <b>6</b>-liquid outlet. Firstly, it is eluted with a second solvent such as toluene to obtain the aromatics eluent, and the subsequent detection or receiving apparatus <b>9</b> is used for online analysis or collection. Then, maintaining the flow direction, the third solvent, the second solvent and the fourth solvent are used for elution in sequence, so as to obtain the resins eluent, and the subsequent detection or receiving apparatus <b>9</b> is used for online analysis or collection.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0072">In order to prevent the asphaltenes flowing out of the bypass pipeline <b>7</b> from flowing back into the chromatographic column <b>6</b>, the post-column flow path switching valve <b>8</b> and the pre-column flow path switching valve <b>5</b> need to be in the same phase to play a protective role.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0073">When filtering the asphaltenes, the temperature of the solvent has a great influence on the dissolution of non-asphaltenes. Generally, the preferred temperature is 40&#xb0; C.-60&#xb0; C. If the solvent is not heated when separating the fractions, some fractions, such as long-chain saturated hydrocarbon, may precipitate out of the solvent. In order to allow the solvent to be fully preheated before reaching the filter disc <b>4</b>, a heating element <b>11</b> is added to the liquid splitting apparatus in the present disclosure. The heating element <b>11</b> can use a metal or a heat exchange liquid such as an oil bath, etc. to heat the solvent in the metal pipe <b>12</b> to a temperature required by the actual analytical method In addition, the heating element <b>11</b> can also compensate for the errors of the split. The principle is as follows: if there are uneven split pressures for parallel channels in multiple paths, the actual flow rate will be low for the channel with relatively high back pressure, the solvent therein will stay for a long time, the heat exchange is sufficient, and the temperature is high, thus the viscosity decreases and the pressure decreases, which can partially compensate for the error of split caused by the parallelism of pipeline processing, and further ensure the consistency of the flow in each channel.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0074">Of course, in other embodiments, the separation unit for four fractions of heavy oil <b>100</b> can also be designed in other numbers, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The number of the separation units for four fractions of heavy oil <b>100</b> can be expressed as n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the liquid outlet ends of then paths of metal pipes with equal back pressures are in communication with the liquid inlet ends of the separation units for four fractions of heavy oil <b>100</b>, and the number of the liquid outlet ends is equal to the number of the liquid inlet ends. The splitter can be designed as a multi-way pipe with three or more ways, and the number of the splitters can also be one or more. When the number of splitters is more than one, total lengths of respective branches should be ensured to be equal. When there are n channels, each channel is split passively, and back pressures of respective channels are expressed as P1, P2, P3 . . . Pn. When the infusion flow rate of the pump is V, infusion flow rates of respective channels are correspondingly expressed as V1, V2, V3 . . . Vn.

In addition, a group of glass conical flasks that can automatically control the receiving position are provided directly below the chromatographic column as the receiving apparatus. The other steps are still operated according to the standard method SH/T 0509. Since the elution process and chromatographic column are substantially the same as those of SH/T 0509, the amount of solvent consumed is also equivalent, that is, 160 mL of n-heptane, 200 mL of toluene, and 60 mL of ethanol. Since manual operations of separating asphaltenes and solvent removal are still required, a large amount of labor is still required, and the entire process still takes about 10 h.
