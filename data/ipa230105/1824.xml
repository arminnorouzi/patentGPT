This vehicle accepts input of programmed time and a set amount of charging from a user, and determines a charging plan using a plurality of charging types such that the amount of charging of a battery attains to the set amount of charging at the programmed time.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the vehicle according to Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2016-140193, the charging plan is determined in consideration only of electric power provided to the battery. Charging by the wireless charging type has been known to be lower in charging efficiency than the plug-in charging type. Lowering in this charging efficiency results in thermal energy. From a point of view of efficient use of energy, effective use of thermal energy and preparation of a charging plan including also thermal energy are desired.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure was made to solve problems above, and an object of the present disclosure is to prepare a charging plan capable of achieving enhanced energy efficiency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A plan preparation system according to one aspect of the present disclosure prepares a charging plan of a movable body in which a battery is chargeable by a plurality of charging types. The plurality of charging types include a wireless charging type. The movable body incorporates a subject device a target temperature of which has been determined. The plan preparation system includes a storage in which information is stored, the information defining relation between a parameter and an amount of required heat which is an amount of heat required for increasing a temperature of the subject device to the target temperature, and a controller that prepares the charging plan from a current location to a destination of the movable body. The controller obtains the parameter, calculates the amount of required heat by collating the obtained parameter with the information, and increases, when the amount of required heat is large, a ratio of charging by the wireless charging type occupied in the charging plan as compared with the ratio when the amount of required heat is small.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the configuration, when the amount of required heat which is the amount of heat required by the movable body is large, the ratio of charging by the wireless charging type occupied in the charging plan is increased as compared with the ratio when the amount of required heat is small. With increase in ratio of charging by the wireless charging type occupied in the charging plan, thermal energy produced by charging increases, and hence the amount of required heat can be obtained. By using thermal energy originating from charging by the wireless charging type as the amount of required heat, energy efficiency can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the parameter includes an outside air temperature. The information indicates a larger amount of required heat as the outside air temperature is lower.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the outside air temperature is low, the amount of required heat is larger than the amount of required heat when the outside air temperature is high. According to the configuration, an appropriate amount of required heat can be calculated in accordance with the outside air temperature.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the wireless charging type includes a first wireless charging type performed indoors and a second wireless charging type performed outdoors. An indoor temperature is lower than the outside air temperature. When the outside air temperature is high, the controller increases the ratio of the first wireless charging type occupied in charging by the wireless charging type as compared with the ratio when the outside air temperature is low.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the battery is charged while the outside air temperature is high, the amount of heat more than necessary may be obtained and the temperature of the subject device may increase more than necessary. According to the configuration, when the outside air temperature is high, the ratio of indoor wireless charging is increased as compared with the ratio when the outside air temperature is low. Therefore, the amount of heat more than necessary obtained in charging by the wireless charging type can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the parameter further includes a temperature of the subject device. The controller obtains the outside air temperature and the temperature of the subject device and calculates the amount of required heat by collating the outside air temperature and the temperature of the subject device with the information.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The amount of required heat is, for example, the amount of heat required for causing the temperature of the subject device mounted on the movable body to attain to the target temperature. According to the configuration, the amount of required heat is calculated with the outside air temperature and the temperature of the subject device being defined as parameters, and hence the amount of required heat can accurately be calculated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the subject device includes at least the battery.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the controller prepares a plurality of charging plans, and adopts as a recommended plan, a charging plan that best satisfies a condition set in advance among the plurality of charging plans.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, a condition concerning an amount of stored power in the battery at the time of arrival at the destination, a condition concerning a time period required for travel from the current location to the destination, or a condition concerning a travel distance from the current location to the destination is included.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the configuration, since the charging plan that best satisfies the condition set in advance among the plurality of charging plans is adopted as the recommended plan, a user of the movable body can readily recognize the charging plan suitable for the condition. Therefore, convenience of the user can be improved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A plan preparation apparatus according to another aspect of the present disclosure prepares a charging plan of a movable body in which a battery is chargeable by a plurality of charging types. The plurality of charging types include a wireless charging type. The plan preparation apparatus includes an information obtaining unit that obtains an outside air temperature and a plan preparation unit that prepares the charging plan from a current location to a destination of the movable body. When the outside air temperature is high, the plan preparation unit increases a ratio of charging by the wireless charging type occupied in the charging plan as compared with the ratio when the outside air temperature is low.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present disclosure when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a configuration of a charging management system according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a configuration of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram for illustrating preparation of a charging plan.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a procedure in processing for setting a charging plan.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a procedure in processing for preparing a charging plan.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a procedure in processing for setting a charging plan in a second embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.
