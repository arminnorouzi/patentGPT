The term compound, as used herein, shall cover compounds which might comprise one or more different components.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The mobile phase, for example a solvent, is pumped under high-pressure typically through a chromatographic column containing packing medium (also referred to as packing material or stationary phase). As the sample is carried through the column by the liquid flow, the different compounds, each one having a different affinity to the packing medium, move through the column at different speeds. Those compounds having greater affinity for the stationary phase move more slowly through the column than those having less affinity, and this speed differential results in the compounds being separated from one another as they pass through the column. The stationary phase is subject to a mechanical force generated in particular by a hydraulic pump that pumps the mobile phase usually from an upstream connection of the column to a downstream connection of the column. As a result of flow, depending on the physical properties of the stationary phase and the mobile phase, a relatively high-pressure drop is generated across the column.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The mobile phase with the separated compounds exits the column and passes through a detector, which registers and/or identifies the molecules, for example by spectrophotometric absorbance measurements. A two-dimensional plot of the detector measurements against elution time or volume, known as a chromatogram, may be made, and from the chromatogram the compounds may be identified. For each compound, the chromatogram displays a separate curve feature also designated as a &#x201c;peak&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In preparative chromatography systems, a liquid as the mobile phase is provided usually at a controlled flow rate (e. g. in the range of 1 mL/min to thousands of mL/min, e.g. in analytical scale preparative LC in the range of 1-5 mL/min and preparative scale in the range of 4-200 mL/min) and at pressure in the range of tens to hundreds bar, e.g. 20-600 bar.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a liquid as the mobile phase has to be provided usually at a very controlled flow rate (e. g. in the range of microliters to milliliters per minute) and at high-pressure (typically 20-100 MPa, 200-1000 bar, and beyond up to currently 200 MPa, 2000 bar) at which compressibility of the liquid becomes noticeable.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The sample fluid to be separated is typically provided in a respective receptacle, such as a vial, and needs to be transferred from such respectable to an injection unit configured for injecting the sample fluid into the mobile phase. This is typically done by a fluid handling unit providing a more or less automated handling of one or more receptacles, each containing a respective sample fluid. Such fluid handling&#x2014;prior to sample injection&#x2014;may comprise transport of the receptacle, e.g. from and to a vial tray, operating an injection needle to immerse into the respective receptacle and aspirate sample fluid therefrom, and transporting the aspirated sample fluid, e.g. to a dedicated injection valve, for injection into the mobile phase. Additionally or alternatively, separated fractions of the sample fluid may be dispensed into a respective receptacle, which may also comprise transport of the receptacle, operating an injection needle to immerse into the respective receptacle and dispense an amount of the separated fractions into the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO2019207844A1 discloses an autosampler with an imaging unit providing image recognition used for operating an injection needle to a sample containing vial.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">While optical recognition of vials can provide acceptable results under controlled conditions, it has been shown that limitations can occur under real life situations, e.g. as resulting from varying light conditions, reflecting surfaces, stray light, dirt, or others, rendering optical recognition failure prone.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the invention to provide an improved fluid handling, preferably for chromatographic sample separation. The object is solved by the independent claims. Further embodiments are shown by the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment comprises a fluid handling unit configured for handling a fluid contained or to be contained in a receptacle bearing a marking. The receptacle has a body for containing the fluid and an opening for reaching into the receptacle, and the marking is positioned on the receptacle in a spatially defined relationship to the opening into the receptacle. The fluid handling unit comprises a needle having an elongated shape with an open end (such as a needle tip) and being configured for at least one of: aspirating (also referred to as intaking) the fluid from the receptacle and dispensing (also referred to as outputting or discharging) the fluid into the receptacle. The fluid handling unit further comprises a needle drive configured for (spatially) positioning the needle with respect to the receptacle, a detection unit configured for detecting at least the marking of the receptacle, and a control unit. The control unit is configured for at least analysing the detected marking for determining (e.g. detecting, calculating, recognizing, or similar) at least one feature being part of the marking or the marking itself, determining a target position based on the detected at least one feature, wherein the target position is selected to be in spatial relationship to the center point of the opening, and operating the needle drive to (spatially) position the open end of the needle relative to the determined target position. This allows to provide a more reliable fluid handling under real life situations, e.g. as resulting from varying light conditions, reflecting surfaces, stray light, dirt, or others. Further, the likelihood for not precisely detecting the (preferably purpose-made) marking might be lower than not precisely detecting the surface of the receptacle e.g. with the optical background of the receptacle holding unit, especially if receptacles of different material and/or color are used.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the control unit is configured for correcting a deviation of an actual position from the determined target position of the open end of the needle, preferably by determining the deviation by using at least one of: an image recognition, an optical measurement, a capacitive measurement, and an inductive measurement. Without correcting the deviation, the open end of the needle would not hit the determined target position when being moved toward the target position. Preferably, the control unit is configured for operating the needle drive to correct for the determined deviation, so that after correction of the deviation, the open end of the needle would hit the determined target position when being moved toward the target position.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, a reference position for providing a correction of the deviation of the actual position from the determined target position is provided by a coordinate system, e.g. of the needle drive. For example, the actual position of the needle, preferably a needle tip, can be determined with respect to such coordinate system. This may result e.g. from analysing the control information applied by the needle drive to position the needle. In other words, the operation information used for moving the needle by the needle drive can be applied for determining the actual position of the needle (or the needle tip), which may be set in relation to the coordinate system, e.g. to a defined starting point of the needle (or needle tip). Such starting point may be, for example, a defined spatial position of the needle (or needle tip) within the fluid handling unit, such as when the needle is positioned in a fluid tight manner into a corresponding needle seat. Alternatively or in addition, image information as provided by the detection unit can be applied for determining the actual position of the needle (or needle tip), e.g. using image recognition. In other words, the detection unit determines the actual position of the needle (or needle tip), for example by applying image recognition. Alternatively or in addition, a respective sensor can be applied, for example for detecting a deviation in actual positioning or in the actual shape of the needle (or needle tip) e.g. resulting from bending the needle. Such sensor may be an optical or capacitive sensor applied for determining a distance between a reference point (of or in the sensor) and a respective point or position of the needle (or needle tip). It is clear that any other method can be applied accordingly in order to determine the actual position of the needle (or needle tip) in order to ensure that the needle (or needle tip) can actually and sufficiently accurately hit the determined target position e.g. for penetrating into the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the receptacle has a body for containing the fluid and an opening (e.g. an entry area or mouth) for reaching into the receptacle. The marking is preferably positioned on the receptacle in a spatially defined relationship to the opening into the receptacle, so that preferably the at least one feature has a defined spatial relationship to the opening and preferably to a center point of the opening. In preferred applications, the marking can be sufficiently accurately positioned on the receptacle, which can be ensured by applying state-of-the-art positioning of the marking, such as to apply a sufficiently accurate printing (or other type of depositing) of the marking on the receptacle, such as on an upper surface of a cap or other coverage of the receptacle. With the marking being sufficiently accurately positioned with respect to the opening of the receptacle, the positioning of the needle (with respect to the receptacle) can be applied in the sense of a positioning of the needle (or e.g. a needle tip) with respect to the marking. In other words, the positioning of the needle according to embodiments of the present invention is provided with respect to the marking (and not in respect of an optical recognition of the receptacle as such).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In such embodiments, the target position can be selected to be in spatial relationship to the center point of the opening, preferably the target position can be selected to be the center point of the opening.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the needle comprises an elongated shape with an open end for fluid aspiration and/or dispensing, and may be or comprise at least one of a conduit and a nozzle. The open end may be preferably coupled to another open end of a fluid path, preferably a needle seat, in a fluid-tight manner. The needle may have a sharpened end e.g. configured for penetrating through a surface (e.g. a cap or other coverage covering the receptacle), but may also be embodied without such sharpened end, e.g. having a blunt end. Further, while the needle is preferably embodied using a substantially rigid material, such as a metal (e.g. stainless steel), ceramic, et cetera, softer materials may be applied as well e.g. allowing to bend the needle (e.g. in the sense of a soft(er) tubing).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the receptacle is or comprises at least one of: a container, a vial, a vessel, a tube, a microtiter plate. The receptacle may comprise one or more individual wells each for receiving and storing a respective fluid. As an example, a microtiter plate may comprise e.g. 96 wells, 384 wells, or the like.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the needle drive comprises at least one of: a linear stage, an xyz-robot, a robot arm, a manipulator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the needle drive is configured for immersing the needle into the receptacle, preferably into the fluid contained within the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the marking is or comprises at least one of: a fiducial, a fiducial mark, a barcode preferably EAN, a 2D barcode preferably a QR code, Aztec code, or any other machine-readable label or marking.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the marking is located on a surface of the receptacle, such as an upper surface, a lateral surface, or a lower or bottom surface of the receptacle. In case the receptacle comprises a plurality of individual wells (each for receiving and storing a respective fluid), the receptacle may comprise a respective marking assigned to each respective well. Alternatively, a plurality of wells may be related to a respective marking. In one embodiment, the receptacle comprises only one single marking related to each of the plurality of wells and allowing to determine a respective target position for each respective one of the plurality of wells based on the one single marking. Such single marking (for a plurality of wells) is preferably provided on a lateral side and/or a lower or bottom side of the receptacle. In an example of a microtiter plate (e.g. with 96, 384 or the like wells) as the receptacle, a single marking is provided on a bottom side of the microtiter plate allowing to determine the respective target position (for penetrating into the respective well) for each of the plurality of wells. Additional information about the receptacle may be used for such determination, for example information about the geometry (preferably including tolerances) of the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the marking is located on an upper surface of the receptacle, preferably on at least one of a cap, lid, flap, coverage, foil, seal, wherein preferably the upper surface is at or in the area of an opening of the receptacle</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the marking is provided as a label, a sticker, or a tag, and/or is applied by printing, stamping, or laser marking, preferably on the receptable, whereby it may contain at least one material of the group: an ink, a dye, fluorescent dye, a dielectric material, a metal, a magnetic material, a polymer, a polarizable material, a molten polymer printing, preferably of different color than the surface of the receptable.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the marking is part of the receptacle, preferably part of at least one of a cap, lid, flap, coverage, foil, seal of the receptacle, e.g. as provided by directly during a molding process of the vial cap.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the marking comprises an RFID antenna or RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the marking is provided by an indentation into and/or elevation on the receptacle, preferably an upper surface of the receptacle.

The individual components are retained by the stationary phase differently and separate from each other while they are propagating at different speeds through the column with the eluent. At the end of the column they elute at least partly separated from each other. During the entire chromatography process the eluent might be also collected in a series of fractions. The stationary phase or adsorbent in column chromatography usually is a solid material. The most common stationary phase for column chromatography is silica gel, followed by alumina. Cellulose powder has often been used in the past. Also possible are ion exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography (RP), affinity chromatography or expanded bed adsorption (EBA).

It can also contain additives, i.e. be a solution of the said additives in a solvent or a mixture of solvents. It can be chosen e.g. to adjust the retention of the compounds of interest and/or the amount of mobile phase to run the chromatography. The mobile phase can also be chosen so that the different compounds can be separated effectively. The mobile phase might comprise an organic solvent like e.g. methanol or acetonitrile, often diluted with water. For gradient operation water and organic solvent is delivered in separate containers, from which the gradient pump delivers a programmed blend to the system.

A mobile phase drive <b>20</b> (such as a pump) receives a mobile phase from a solvent supply <b>25</b>, typically via a degasser <b>27</b>, which degases the mobile phase and thus reduces the amount of dissolved gases in it. The mobile phase drive <b>20</b> drives the mobile phase through a separating device <b>30</b> (such as a chromatographic column). A sample injector <b>40</b> (also referred to as sample introduction apparatus, sample dispatcher, etc.) is provided between the mobile phase drive <b>20</b> and the separating device <b>30</b> in order to subject or add (often referred to as sample introduction) portions of one or more sample fluids into the flow of a mobile phase.

The needle drive <b>310</b> preferably comprises one or more of a linear stage, an xyz-robot, a robot arm, a manipulator, et cetera, allowing to position the needle <b>215</b> as readily known in the art and which does not need to be detailed here. Preferably, the needle drive <b>310</b> allows immersing the needle <b>215</b> into the respective receptacle <b>260</b> as well as removing the needle <b>215</b> from being immersed into the receptacle <b>260</b>. The needle drive <b>310</b> may also allow to position the needle <b>215</b> into the needle seat <b>218</b>, preferably in a fluid tight manner, thus allowing to prepare the sample injector <b>40</b> for injecting sample fluid into the mobile phase.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows in greater detail an embodiment of the receptacle <b>260</b>. The receptacle <b>260</b> has a body <b>400</b> for containing fluid. A cap <b>410</b> is covering an opening (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the body <b>400</b> for reaching into the body <b>400</b> of the receptacle <b>260</b>. The cap <b>410</b> has an upper surface <b>420</b> bearing a marking <b>430</b> which may comprise an optional alignment fiducial <b>440</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Such caps <b>410</b> are often used in analytical applications, such as the liquid separation system <b>10</b>, to seal the receptacle <b>260</b> e.g. to avoid evaporation of sample fluid. The cap <b>410</b> may comprise in its center a membrane which can be penetrated by the needle <b>215</b> to aspirate sample out of the receptacle <b>260</b>. In certain embodiments, tapered vial inserts are used to minimise the sample volume inside the receptacle <b>260</b>. This represents a receptacle in the receptacle or, in other words, a vial in a vial. In such embodiments, it is important that the needle <b>215</b> is exactly positioned in the center of the cap <b>410</b> e.g. to avoid collision with the vial insert.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The marking <b>430</b> as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a QR code as readily known in the art. Such markings <b>430</b> are often applied to identify and track respective sample receptacles <b>260</b> e.g. within a sample injection module <b>40</b>. Instead of QR code, other types of identification codes, such as a fiducial, a fiducial mark, a barcode preferably EAN, a 2D barcode preferably a QR code, Aztec code, or any other machine-readable label or marking may be applied accordingly. Also, the marking <b>430</b> (or additional identifiers) may also be provided on any other surface of the receptacle <b>260</b>. The marking <b>430</b> may be printed or otherwise be provided on the receptacle <b>260</b>. The marking <b>430</b> may be provided for optical recognition, but other recognition types, such as magnetic recognition or microwave recognition, may be applied accordingly. The material applied for the marking <b>430</b> depends accordingly on the applied recognition type. In case of optical recognition, ink or other type of dye may be applied. Also, specific detection types such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, magnetic, or microwave detection may be applied accordingly.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the detection unit <b>320</b> is configured for detecting the marking <b>430</b> on the respective one of the receptacles <b>260</b>A-<b>260</b>G. In the example here, the marking of the receptacle <b>260</b>A is to be detected by the detection unit <b>320</b>. Such detection can be provided using e.g. image recognition as readily known in the art. Dependent on the detection type of the marking <b>430</b>, other recognition types than optical recognition can be applied accordingly.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In order to spatially position the needle <b>215</b> into the receptacle <b>260</b>A (in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the precise position of the center of the upper surface <b>420</b> of the cap <b>410</b> needs to be determined, thus allowing the needle drive <b>310</b> to penetrate the needle <b>215</b> through such detected center and to immerse into the receptacle <b>260</b>A. Any deviation from the precise position of the center may jeopardize the process of immersing the needle <b>215</b> into the receptacle <b>260</b>A and may even lead to a collision e.g. of the needle tip <b>330</b> with a wall of the receptacle <b>260</b>A or with a respective insert into the receptacle <b>260</b>A.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">It has been shown that an optical recognition process of the receptacle <b>260</b> may not be sufficient in real life situations to sufficiently securely position the needle <b>215</b> into the receptacle <b>260</b>, e.g. as resulting from varying light conditions, reflecting surfaces, stray light, dirt, or others. To overcome such limitations, the invention applies an additional determining process in order to reliably position the needle <b>215</b> into the receptacle <b>260</b>. Such determining process is based on the assumption that the marking <b>430</b> can be sufficiently accurately positioned on the receptacle <b>260</b>, which can be ensured by applying state-of-the-art positioning of the marking <b>430</b>, such as to apply a sufficiently accurate printing (or other type of depositing) of the marking <b>430</b> on the upper surface <b>420</b> of the cap <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">With the assumption that the marking <b>430</b> is sufficiently accurately positioned with respect to the opening of the receptacle <b>260</b>, the positioning of the needle <b>215</b> (with respect to the receptacle <b>260</b>) can be applied in the sense of a positioning of the needle <b>215</b> (or better of the needle tip <b>330</b>) with respect to the marking <b>430</b>. In other words, the positioning of the needle <b>215</b> according to the present invention is provided with respect to the marking <b>430</b> (and not in respect of an optical recognition of the receptacle <b>260</b> as such).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in order to spatially position the needle <b>215</b> into the receptacle <b>260</b>A, the control unit <b>70</b> analyses the information of the detected marking <b>430</b> as provided by the camera (detection unit) <b>320</b> in order to detect at least one feature for geometrical positioning. In the example here, the camera <b>320</b> has detected the QR code of the marking <b>430</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The control unit <b>70</b> analyses the detected marking <b>430</b> and determines three features <b>500</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>520</b>, namely the three rectangular patterns (e.g. including an outer rectangular black line with an inner rectangular black box, or only the outer rectangular black line, or only the inner rectangular black box) in the outer corners of the marking <b>430</b>. Preferably, the exact size and shape of the features is determined to proceed. Alternatively, the inner or outer edges of the features may be determined. With such determined features <b>500</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>520</b>, the control unit <b>70</b> can further determine a target position <b>530</b> to which the needle tip <b>330</b> shall be positioned in order to penetrate the needle <b>215</b> into the receptacle <b>260</b>. While such target position <b>530</b> preferably is the center of the marking <b>430</b>, it is clear that the respective position of the target position <b>530</b> depends on the specifics of the used receptacle <b>260</b>. Also, it is clear that the number of features required to sufficiently accurately determine the target position <b>530</b> also depends on the specifics of the used type of marking <b>430</b>. In the present example of a QR code as marking <b>430</b>, two of the determined features <b>500</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>520</b> would already be sufficient to determine the center of the marking <b>430</b> as the target position <b>530</b>. However, accuracy of determining the target position <b>530</b> can be increased by using more than two of the determined features <b>500</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>520</b>, preferably by using the three determined features <b>500</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>520</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the marking <b>430</b> additionally contains an optional alignment fiducial <b>440</b>, which may be applied accordingly in order to determine the target position <b>530</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> with the alignment fiducial <b>440</b> being provided by a plurality of concentric circles, the center of such concentric circles, as can be easily determined from such plurality of concentric circles, shall represent the target position <b>530</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">It is clear that more than one marking can be used for determining the target position <b>530</b>, such as both of the marking <b>430</b> and the alignment fiducial <b>440</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Accuracy of positioning may be increased by using and analysing plural such markings.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the alignment fiducial <b>440</b> is not part of the information containing QR code but rather represents an additional fiducial. In other words, the QR code in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> solely contains the information e.g. for identifying the content of the receptacle <b>260</b>, while the alignment fiducial <b>440</b> is purely provided for finding the target position <b>530</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is clear that the number of features for sufficiently accurately determining the target position <b>530</b> as well as whether a respective alignment fiducial <b>440</b> is part of an information containing marking <b>430</b> or not depends on the specifics of the chosen type of marking, type of detection, and/or the required accuracy of the target position <b>530</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Once the target position <b>530</b> has been determined by the control unit <b>70</b>, the control unit <b>70</b> can operate the needle drive <b>310</b> to spatially position the needle tip <b>330</b> relative to the determined target position <b>530</b>, preferably by positioning the needle tip <b>330</b> precisely onto the target position <b>530</b>. The control unit <b>70</b> can then operate the needle drive <b>310</b> to lower the needle <b>215</b> into the receptacle <b>260</b> in the sense of penetrating the needle <b>215</b> through the target position <b>530</b> on the upper surface <b>420</b> of the cap <b>410</b> and into the body <b>400</b> of the receptacle <b>260</b>. With the needle <b>215</b> thus immersing into the receptacle <b>260</b>, the control unit <b>70</b> may then operate the metering device <b>245</b> to aspirate fluid from inside of the receptacle <b>260</b>, e.g. into the sampling volume <b>200</b>. Alternatively, with the needle <b>215</b> being immersed into the receptacle <b>260</b>, the control unit <b>70</b> may operate the fractionating unit <b>60</b> to dispense portions of separated sample fluid into the receptacle <b>260</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As apparent from the described embodiment above, the needle <b>215</b> can be safely and sufficiently accurately aligned to the center of the receptacle <b>260</b>, either by analysing an information containing part of the marking <b>430</b> and/or by analysing the alignment fiducial <b>440</b> which may also be subject of the information containing part of the marking <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment for correcting a deviation <b>600</b> of an actual position <b>610</b> of the needle tip <b>330</b> with respect to the determined target position <b>530</b>. Such deviation may result e.g. from bending or misalignment of the needle <b>215</b> or any other inaccuracy or tolerance in the fluid handling unit <b>65</b>, in particular in the needle drive <b>310</b>. For determining the deviation, the control unit <b>70</b> operates the needle drive <b>310</b> to move the needle tip <b>330</b> towards the target position <b>530</b> (on the upper surface <b>420</b>). The position where the needle tip <b>330</b> actually touches on the upper surface <b>420</b> represents the actual position <b>610</b>. The camera <b>320</b> detects the actual position <b>610</b>, and the control unit <b>70</b> can then determine the deviation <b>600</b> of the actual position <b>610</b> from the target position <b>530</b>. The control unit <b>70</b> can then calibrate, adjust or otherwise correct the positioning of the needle drive <b>310</b> or update the coordinate system the needle drive relies on, for instance by adding or subtracting the determined deviation to the coordinates to which the needle drive is moving the needle, so that the needle tip <b>330</b> will actually hit the determined target position <b>530</b>. This may also be done in an iterated way.
