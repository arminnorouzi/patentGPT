Conductive polymers out of BSA were made. The same process can be applied for human serum albumin (HSA) also. Both the proteins are commercially available in large quantity by various providers such as Sigma-Aldrich. In the inventors typical procedure 14 wt % BSA is dissolved in 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol (TFE):H<sub>2</sub>O (4:1) mixture in a 20 mL glass vial. The solution is mixed thoroughly under strong vortex for 1 hr to get a clear solution. Then 6% 2-Mercaptoethanol is added, and mixed thoroughly under strong vortex for 20 min, which causes the solution to become cloudy. This is followed by the addition of 100 &#x3bc;L/mL of ethylenediamine ethanol mixture (1:1), which immediately whitens the solution. The final mixture is stirred under strong vortex for few minutes until it becomes clear (not white). This mixture is then drop casted to a desired surface (such as Petri dish), and kept at room temperature overnight covered by a lid to allow slow evaporation of solvent and a transparent film is formed. The film can be taken out from the petri dish with the help of a spatula/tweezers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The measured conductivity of the film is 0.7 mS cm<sup>1</sup>, which the inventors ascribe to ionic conductance.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 2</heading><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Albumin Based Films with Increased Conductivity</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0151">To increase the conductivity of the film different modification can be done. One methodology is to sulphonate the film to increase its protonic conductivity. For this purpose, a piece of BSA film (in a desired size, we use 1&#xd7;5 cm) is placed in a 50 ml round bottom flask fitted with a septum. All air inside is removed by applying vacuum and nitrogen is purged into the flask, followed by the addition of 10 mL of dry DCM and 0.12 M chlorosulfonic acid. The mixture is kept under stirring condition in a nitrogen atmosphere for several hour. Then, the film is washed thoroughly with water. As a result of the sulphonation process, the measured conductance increases to above 10 mS cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">To improve electronic conductivity, the film can be doped with Hemin (porphyrin containing iron as electron mediator). A piece of the film is placed in a petri dish containing 0.5 mM of Hemin. The whole solution kept under continuous shaking overnight covered with aluminum foil. The solution become clear and the color of the film become dark red.

The photoacid of pyranine can be used. The pyranine molecule is functionalized first by adding acetic anhydride to acetylate its free hydroxyl, followed by adding a thionyl chloride to chlorinate its sulfonate groups. The product is added to a piece of the film in a dry DCM environment with triethylamine (TEA), where the end film product is composed of the pyranine photoacid covalently attached to free primary amines within the film (belongs to lysine residues), and the reactive hydroxyl is deprotected.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 3</heading><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Protein Based Films Formation</heading><p id="p-0155" num="0154">14 Wt % of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein was dissolved in TFE:water (4:1) and mixed well on a vortex for 14 hour to get a clear solution.

After that, 5% ethylenediamine was diluted with (1:1) absolute ethanol and added into the mixture. Upon addition some white fibrils appears immediately. Then the reaction mixture was vortexed for 30-40 min to get a clear solution. Finally the clear solution was drop casted to a desired mold (such as a 90 mm borosil petri dish) and kept under well-ventilated area for 6-10 (depending on solvent evaporation rate) hour to obtain a transparent film.

Upon dissolving the BSA in the acidic TFE solution, the CD spectrum is dominated by a single negative band at 227 nm, indicating the fundamental change in the BSA secondary structure. The reduction of disulfide bonds by 2-mercaptoethanol, results in a further red shifting of the negative CD band to 238 nm with a significant decrease in its intensity, hence reflecting further denaturation of the protein. In the last polymerization step, the addition of ethylenediamine (EDA) to initiate the crosslinking via oxidative disulfide bond formation, the CD spectrum changes, showing both features of the native &#x3b1;-helical protein (the negative band at 208 nm and the positive one at 195 nm) as well as the negative peak of the denatured protein (at 235 nm). The complex CD spectra of the film indicates presence of both alpha helix and beta sheet in the protein structure.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> presents FTIR spectra of BSA film (top) and native BSA (bottom). The sharp peaks of the native BSA (at 1647 and 1537 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), corresponding to the &#x3b1;-helical nature of the protein, are clearly changing and exhibiting a double-band for both amide I (1645 and 1625 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and amide II (1539 and 1484 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). This complex FTIR signature of the BSA film indicates on the presence of two different types of secondary structures within the BSA film. In addition, the change in the location and intensity of the broad peak at 3600-3000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, corresponding to both &#x2014;OH and &#x2014;NH stretching, further indicates a structural change.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> presents Raman spectra of BSA film (top) and native BSA (bottom). The Raman spectrum of native BSA shows sharp peaks at 452 and 489 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which are ascribed to signal from disulfide bonds. These peaks undergo shifting (to 447 and 486 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively) following polymerization, indicating a different environment of the disulfide bonds between the native protein (intramolecular bonds) to the formed polymer (intermolecular bonds). Another indication for the structural transition of the protein is the change in the weak double peak of skeletal 6-CH (1280-1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) that changes from symmetric before polymerization to asymmetric after, and the shift in the amide I band from 1653 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 1663 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Other peaks, such as the ones of aromatic amino acids (at 1003 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and of water (2860-3000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) do not undergo major changes.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> represents optical absorption spectra of BSA film in the UV-Vis region, showing the transparency nature of the film across the visible.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a wide-angle x-ray scattering profile of the BSA film.
