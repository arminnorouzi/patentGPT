occluding and discharging hydrogen using a hydrogen storage metal or the like is reported (see, for example, NPL 1). Hydrogen can be generated from water and is thus inexhaustible and inexpensive as a resource, and does not generate a greenhouse gas such as carbon dioxide and is thus clean energy. Unlike a nuclear fission reaction, the heat generation phenomenon using the hydrogen storage metal or the like is safe since there is no chain reaction. Heat generated by occluding and discharging hydrogen can be utilized as it is, and can be further utilized by being converted into electric power. Therefore, the heat is expected as an effective energy source.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">NPL 1: A.
