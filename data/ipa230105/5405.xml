With development of display technology and popularization of display panels, application scenarios of display panels are gradually increasing, wide visual angle and high picture quality characteristics of the display panels have a higher requirement in order to achieve a best viewing experience.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the primary color pixel of a television is composed of red/green/blue (RGB) gray scales; the gray scale is 0-255; and each gray scale has its corresponding brightness. Display of all colors in a television is mixed by these RGB gray scales. RGB has a mixing scale at a vertical angle, but due to factors such as the performance of a display itself, a scale of brightness of RGB changes at a squint visual angle, resulting in color deviation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A chrominance visual angle is an important indicator to measure performance of the display panel. Due to directionality of color display on the screen, colors of a picture change with visual angles. When the color changing causes the color difference=0.02, an angle is a color visual angle. When the chrominance visual angle is larger, the visual angle of the display panel is also larger so that viewing experiences from different angles are better. At present, there are many ways to improve the chrominance visual angle of the display panels in industry, among which the main methods are: polarizer process and function optimization, RGB pixel array partitioning, etc. These methods can achieve improvement of the chrominance visual angle to a certain extent, but a corresponding performance of other aspects of the display panel is sacrificed, such as increasing cost and process difficulty. Polarizer treatment on a television surface affects brightness; changing pixel array can change the backlight area and transmittance, etc.; and a range of improvement with the chrominance visual angle is limited. It is difficult to match requirements of some large visual angle and specific scenario.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, prior art technology needs to be improved and developed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A main object of the present disclosure comprises to provide a chrominance visual angle correction method for a display, and an intelligent terminal and a storage medium, which aim to solve the problem when improving the chrominance visual angle in the prior art, it is necessary to sacrifice other performance of the display panel, the degree of improvement of the chrominance visual angle is limited, and which is difficult to match the viewing requirements of the large visual angle and the specific scenario.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to realize above object, the present disclosure provides a chrominance visual angle correction method for a display, comprises steps below:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">acquiring data of the brightness of different primary colors varying with a gray scale at a vertical visual angle and a squint visual angle, and generating a search database;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">splitting a pixel gray scale of the display into a plurality of high and low gray scale combinations composed of high gray scales and low gray scales according to the search database and a preset rule;

It should be understood that the specific embodiments described herein are only used to explain the present disclosure, but not to limit the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">A chrominance visual angle correction method for a display according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a chrominance visual angle correction method for a display comprises following steps:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">Step S<b>10</b>, acquiring brightness data of different primary colors varying with gray scale at a vertical visual angle and a squint visual angle, and generating a search database.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">Specifically, the vertical visual angle is a direction in which a user is facing a display directly (for example, an angle that the user looks at a center of the display, that is, an angle between the user and the center of the display is 0&#xb0;, and a visual angle at this time is defined as the vertical visual angle), and the squint visual angle is a direction in which there is a preset angle difference between a facing direction of the user and the display. The squint visual angle is a certain squint angle when the user is viewing, and the squint visual angle is relative to vertical vision (that is, the user does not look at the center of the display directly; for example, when a preset range angle is greater than 0&#xb0; and less than 90&#xb0;, it is defined as the squint visual angle).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">Before the step S<b>10</b>, the method further comprises: acquiring brightness data of primary color pixel gray scales at the vertical visual angle and the squint visual angle separately. For example, the primary color pixel of a television is composed of RGB gray scales, and the gray scale is 0-255. Each gray scale has a corresponding brightness, display of all colors in the television is mixed by these RGB. For example, each pixel on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen is composed of red, green, and blue of different brightness levels, and finally forms different color points. In other words, color change of each point on the screen is actually caused by a variety of the gray scales of three RGB sub-pixels. RGB has a mixing ratio at the vertical visual angle, but due to factors such as performance and technology of the display itself, a scale of brightness of RGB will change at the squint visual angle, resulting in color deviation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">Specifically, the brightness data of the primary colors (R/G/B) at the vertical visual angle and at the squint visual angle in the gray scale of 0-255 are collected respectively, and the data of the brightness of different primary colors changing with the gray scale at the two visual angles are obtained, which is used as a search database. The search database comprises a database of primary color brightness at the vertical visual angle and a database of primary color brightness at the squint visual angle.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">Wherein, the brightness data of the search database can be collected at every preset size gray scale (for example, 2 gray scales), or can be gray scales of other sizes, and numerical search is based on an average value of adjacent gray scale data; or the brightness data of the search database is obtained by acquiring part of the brightness data and performing data fitting. For example, when collecting the brightness data of the primary color (R/G/B) in the 0-255 gray scale, only a part of the gray scale values may be collected, for example, 0 gray scale, 30 gray scale, 60 gray scale, 100 gray scale, 200 gray scale, and 255 gray scale brightness data, and then through data fitting (for example, using an existing two-degree function to perform data fitting or curve fitting), the brightness data of the primary color (R/G/B) in 0-255 gray scale can be obtained in the search database.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">Step S<b>20</b>, splitting, according to the search database and preset rule, pixel gray scale of the display into a plurality of high and low gray scale combinations composed of high gray scales and low gray scales.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">Wherein, the preset rule is that brightness of a display pixel does not change before and after the gray scale is split; wherein, a meaning of a display pixel gray scale is that each pixel of the display is composed of three primary color gray scales of R/G/B. R is red (0-255 gray scale), G is green (0-255 gray scale), and B is blue (0-255 gray scale). Different colors are generated by mixing three colors RGB, such as the RGB gray scale of a white screen is 255/255/255.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">Specifically, the search database as known above comprises the primary color database of brightness at the vertical visual angle and the primary color database of brightness at the squint visual angle. According to the primary color database of brightness at the vertical visual angle and the brightness of the pixel gray scale of the display remaining unchanged before and after splitting (that is, a sum of the brightness of a combination of high and low gray scales is equal to a brightness of the gray scale which is not split), split the pixel gray scale of the display into a plurality of high and low gray scale combinations composed of high gray scales and low gray scales. Wherein, each of the high and low gray scale combinations comprises the high gray scale and the low gray scale, and a reason for splitting into two gray scales is that the split two gray scales has already sacrificed half of pixel resolution. If it is split into a plurality of (more than two) gray scales, the pixel resolution will be too low; and the sum of the brightness of the high gray scale and the low gray scale in each of the high and low gray scale combinations is same as the brightness of the pixel gray scale of the display.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">For example, splitting the original gray scale with RGB (200/200/200) into two pixels with gray scales (100/150/50) and (150/100/200), regarding the primary color gray scale, such as 100 gray scale, split into 101 and 99, then this 101 is the high gray scale, and 99 is the low gray scale.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">The pixel primary color gray scale of the display is split into two gray scales (the high gray scale and the low gray scale), and the brightness remains unchanged before and after splitting; a gray scale splitting rule can be that the gray scale value is successively added with a preset value (such as a preset value of 1 or other values) to split.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">Step S<b>30</b>: Calculating a scale of brightness of the plurality of high and low gray scale combinations, and acquiring a high and low gray scale combination that is closest to a scale of vertical visual of brightness as the primary color pixel gray scale.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">Specifically, the search database as known above comprises the primary color database of brightness at the vertical visual angle and the primary color database of brightness at the squint visual angle. The scale of brightness of the plurality of combinations of high and low gray scales according to the primary color database of brightness at the squint visual angle can be calculated. Wherein, the scale of brightness is a scale of the scale of brightness R/G/B at the vertical visual angle before splitting to the sum of brightness of the high and low gray scale R/G/B at the squint visual angle after splitting. For example, the primary color pixel RGB has a brightness at the vertical visual angle, and RGB has a scale of brightness. After splitting, at the squint visual angle, the sum of brightness of the split RGB (R1=R<sub>high</sub>+R<sub>low</sub>; G1=G<sub>high</sub>+G<sub>low</sub>; B1=B<sub>high</sub>+B<sub>low</sub>) R1G1B1 also has a scale of brightness. Acquiring a high and low gray scale combination which is closest to the scale of vertical visual brightness among the plurality of high and low gray scale combinations as the primary color pixel gray scale; and writing the primary color pixel gray to the display.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">For example, the brightness of the television gradually decreases with a change of the visual angles, and brightness decreases when viewed from a side. At the vertical visual angle (0&#xb0;), different RGB gray scales have different brightness. For example, before splitting, R has a brightness, G has a brightness, and B has a brightness, and these have a scale of brightness. At the squint visual angle (such as 20&#xb0;, or 30&#xb0;, or 40&#xb0;), the RGB brightness decreases, and R/G/B also have their own brightness and a scale of brightness. Color changes when viewing at an angle, which is caused by inconsistent scale of brightness.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">Splitting the primary color RGB gray scale into the plurality of high and low gray scale combinations (the sum of the brightness of the high and low combinations is equal to the brightness of the gray scale that is not split), sums of the brightness of these high and low gray scale combinations are equal at the vertical visual angle. The scales of brightness of RGB are also same. But the sums of the brightness of these combinations and the scales of brightness of RGB changes at the squint visual angle, therefore, acquire a high and low gray scale combination the scale of brightness closest to the scale of vertical visual brightness in the plurality of high and low gray scale combinations as the primary color pixel grayscale (that is, finding a group where the scale of brightness of the sum of brightness of the split group is closest to the vertical visual angle scale).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">Wherein, the display comprises but is not limited to LCD, organic light emitting display (OLED), quantum-dot light emitting display (QLED), micro-LED and other display devices.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">The present disclosure improves the chrominance visual angle of the display.
