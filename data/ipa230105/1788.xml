with an actuator driven by a solenoid. The actuator is engaged with a rotating member and applies force in a return direction.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The actuator does not have any other function than a function of exerting force in a return direction.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">An accelerator device according to a first example includes at least one drive source, a pedal lever, and a power transmission mechanism. The pedal lever is moved according to a pedal depressing operation. Using driving of the drive source, the power transmission mechanism is configured to transmit force both in a pedal lever closing direction and opening direction to the pedal lever. As a result, expansion of the functionality of the accelerator device can be implemented based on the actuator.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">An accelerator device according to a second example or a third example includes a drive source, a pedal lever, a power transmission mechanism, a locking mechanism, and a control unit. The pedal lever is moved according to a depressing operation. The power transmission mechanism is configured to transmit driving force form the drive source to the pedal lever. The locking mechanism drives a locking member to a lock position by the drive source and locks the pedal lever there.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">According to the second example, the control unit includes a drive control unit that controls driving of the drive source and an erroneous depression determination unit that determines an erroneous depression of the pedal lever. When an erroneous depression of the pedal lever is determined, the drive control unit drives the drive source to lock the pedal lever.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">According to the third example, the control unit includes a drive control unit that controls driving of the drive source and a range determination unit that determines a shift range. When a shift lever is determined to be in a reverse range, the drive control unit drives the drive source to lock the pedal lever.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">A fourth example to a sixth example are provided with a drive source, a pedal lever, a power transmission mechanism, and a control unit. The pedal lever is moved according to a depressing operation. The power transmission mechanism is configured to transmit force in a pedal lever closing direction to the pedal lever by driving of the drive source.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to the fourth example, the control unit includes a drive control unit that controls driving of the drive source and an erroneous depression determination unit that determines an erroneous depression of the pedal lever. When an erroneous depression of the pedal lever is determined, the drive control unit drives the drive source to exert reaction force in a return direction of the pedal lever.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to a fifth example and a sixth example, the control unit includes a drive control unit that controls driving of the drive source. According to the fifth example, the drive control unit controls driving of the drive source so as to exert driver-sensible pulsed reaction force at least once. According to the sixth example, constant reaction force is exerted in a return direction of the pedal lever for a predetermined time or longer.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Hereafter, a description will be given to an accelerator device according to the present disclosure with reference to the drawings. In the following description of a plurality of embodiments, substantially identical configuration elements will be marked with identical reference numerals and symbols and a description thereof will be omitted.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrate the first embodiment. An accelerator device <b>1</b> is so configured that the accelerator device can be mounted on a floor panel, not shown, constituting a part of a vehicle body of a vehicle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the accelerator device <b>1</b> includes a case <b>10</b>, a pedal lever <b>20</b>, a motor <b>40</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and the like) as a drive source, a power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The case <b>10</b> can be mounted on the vehicle body and houses therein such internal movable mechanisms as a pedal <b>35</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the like show the case <b>10</b> with a cover, not shown, provided on this side of each page, removed. Also, in the drawings in connection with the following embodiments, the cover and the like are appropriately removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an accelerator fully closed state in which the pedal lever <b>20</b> is not depressed and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an accelerator fully opened state in which the pedal lever <b>20</b> is depressed to the limit.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The pedal lever <b>20</b> includes a pad <b>21</b>, an arm <b>31</b>, and the pedal <b>35</b> and these elements are integrally driven by a driver's depressing operation or the like. The pad <b>21</b> is so provided that the pad can be depressed by a driver. The pad <b>21</b> is rotatably supported in the case <b>10</b> by a fulcrum member <b>23</b> provided on the case <b>10</b>. The pedal lever <b>20</b> in the present embodiment is of a so-called &#x201c;floorstanding type&#x201d; and is so provided that the pad <b>21</b> is extended in a direction along one face of the case <b>10</b>. A wall portion of the case <b>10</b> on the side opposed to the pad <b>21</b> is taken as a top wall portion <b>11</b> and a wall portion opposed to the top wall portion <b>11</b> is taken as a bottom wall portion <b>12</b>. A side guard <b>24</b> is a member that guards a gap between the pad <b>21</b> and the case <b>10</b> to prevent a driver's foot from getting clamped between the pad <b>21</b> and the case <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The arm <b>31</b> couples the pad <b>21</b> and the pedal <b>35</b> with each other. An opening into which the arm <b>31</b> is inserted is formed in the top wall portion <b>11</b> of the case <b>10</b>. The opening into which the arm <b>31</b> is inserted is so formed that the opening will not interfere with the arm <b>31</b> throughout the range of pedal operation.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The pedal <b>35</b> is housed in an internal space in the case <b>10</b> and includes a shaft portion <b>351</b> and a coupling portion <b>352</b>. The shaft portion <b>351</b> is rotatably supported in the case <b>10</b>. The coupling portion <b>352</b> is so formed as to extend from the shaft portion <b>351</b> substantially along the top wall portion <b>11</b>. An end portion of the coupling portion <b>352</b> on the side opposed to the shaft portion <b>351</b> is engaged with the arm <b>31</b>. As a result, the pad <b>21</b>, the arm <b>31</b>, and the pedal <b>35</b> are integrally driven by a driver's operation on the pad <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">A pedal biasing member <b>37</b> is a compression spring. With one end thereof fixed on the pedal <b>35</b> and the other end fixed on the bottom wall portion <b>12</b>, the pedal biasing member biases the pedal <b>35</b> in a closing direction. When the pad <b>21</b> is not depressed by a driver, the arm <b>31</b> is abutted against a fully closed stopper <b>17</b> formed inside the top wall portion <b>11</b>. When the pad <b>21</b> is depressed, the pad <b>21</b> is abutted against a fully opened stopper <b>18</b> formed outside the top wall portion <b>11</b>. Hereafter, a state in which the arm <b>31</b> is abutted against the fully closed stopper <b>17</b> will be referred to as &#x201c;accelerator fully closed state&#x201d; and a state in which the pad <b>21</b> is abutted against the fully opened stopper <b>18</b> will be referred to as &#x201c;accelerator fully opened state.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">An accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> generates an accelerator opening signal corresponding to a rotation angle of the shaft portion <b>351</b>. The accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> has a detection circuit including, for example, a Hall element detecting an orientation of a permanent magnet embedded in the shaft portion <b>351</b>. Any other element than a Hall element may be adopted as long as the accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> is configured to detect an accelerator opening. An accelerator opening signal is outputted to such ECU as an engine ECU by way of a connector, not shown.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The motor <b>40</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) is, for example, a DC motor and is provided between the arm <b>31</b> and the tip side of the pad <b>21</b>. Driving force of the motor <b>40</b> is transmitted to the pedal lever <b>20</b> by way of the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>. As a result, the pedal lever <b>20</b> is driven by the driving force of the motor <b>40</b>. By providing the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, the accelerator device <b>1</b> in the present embodiment is so configured that the accelerator device is configured to actively drive the pedal lever <b>20</b> both in an accelerator closing direction (hereafter, also referred to as &#x201c;return direction&#x201d; as appropriate) and in an accelerator opening direction (hereafter, also referred to as &#x201c;depressing direction&#x201d; as appropriated) by driving force of the motor <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Prior to a detailed description of the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, a conceptional description will be given to bidirectional driving of the pedal lever <b>20</b> by an actuator. A series of configuration elements that transmits power from the drive source to the pedal lever <b>20</b> by way of the power transmission mechanism will be designated as &#x201c;actuator.&#x201d; When the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b> is formed of such a linear-motion member as a rack gear and a compression spring as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>A</figref>, the pedal lever <b>20</b> can be driven in an accelerator closing direction by the linear-motion member being moved by driving of the motor <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">When the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b> is formed of a linear-motion member and a tension spring as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>B</figref>, the pedal lever <b>20</b> can be driven in an accelerator opening direction by the linear-motion member being moved by driving of the motor <b>40</b>. As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b>B</figref>, the linear-motion member may directly drive the pedal lever <b>20</b> without the intervention of a spring. As a result, reaction force is adjustable. In the description here, a mechanism in which the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b> is caused to make a linear motion by the motor <b>40</b> is taken as an example. Instead, a rotating mechanism may be adopted to configure the accelerator device.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">When a locking member <b>55</b> that locks the pedal lever <b>20</b> in a fully closed state is provided as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref>, the pedal lever can be caused to function as a footrest, for example, by fixing the pad <b>21</b> during an automatic operation. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b>B</figref>, the accelerator device is preferably so configured that a driver's pedal effort is divided by a slope to reduce a load applied to the motor <b>40</b> side when the pedal is locked. When a load LD applied to the motor <b>40</b> side can be kept smaller than a detent torque Td produced when energization of the motor <b>40</b> is cut, a locking state can be maintained even when energization of the motor <b>40</b> is turned off. This is also the case with locking in a fully opened state. The accelerator device may be so configured that a driver's pedal effort is not exerted on the motor <b>40</b> side when the pedal is locked as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>85</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>85</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>86</b></figref>, the accelerator device may be so configured that the pedal lever <b>20</b> is locked in a fully opened state by the locking member <b>55</b>. In this case, vehicle control according to an accelerator opening is cut on the system side, for example, by stopping an output of an accelerator opening signal or taking like measures. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>85</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>85</b>B</figref>, the accelerator device is preferably so configured that biasing force of the pedal biasing member <b>37</b> is divided by a slop to reduce a load exerted on the motor <b>40</b> side when the pedal is locked. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>86</b></figref>, the accelerator device may be so configured that biasing force of the pedal biasing member <b>37</b> is not exerted on the motor <b>40</b> side when the pedal is locked.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>86</b></figref> illustrate an overview of the power transmission mechanism according to the present specification and a description of concepts of the following embodiments is also included. Though all the concepts do not correspond to the present embodiment, reference numerals and symbols corresponding to the present embodiment are given for convenience's sake.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The pedal lever <b>20</b> is actively driven in a return direction by the motor <b>40</b> as a drive source. As a result, when it is determined, for example, based on a driving situation that depression of the pad <b>21</b> will degrade fuel efficiency, reaction force is exerted to produce a wall-like feeling and suppress a driver from depressing the pad <b>21</b>. As a result, fuel efficiency can be enhanced. Further, that the pedal lever <b>20</b> is pulse-driven in a return direction can be utilized as a means for transmitting information about switching from automatic operation to manual operation or the like.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">By driving the pedal lever <b>20</b> in a depressing direction, a pedal footing face position can be adjusted, for example, from a fully closed locking state to a pedal position corresponding to the vehicle's movement during transition from automatic operation to manual operation. Further, comfortability can be ensured during automatic operation or on other like occasions by locking the pedal lever <b>20</b> to cause the pad <b>21</b> to function as a footrest. It can be said that the accelerator device <b>1</b> has three functions, &#x201c;active operation in a return direction,&#x201d; &#x201c;active operation in a depressing direction,&#x201d; and &#x201c;pedal lock.&#x201d; If structures for implanting these functions are separately provided, increase in the physical size of the accelerator device and complication thereof will result. To cope with this, in the accelerator device <b>1</b>, the above three functions are implemented by the one motor <b>40</b> and one power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">A description will be back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and given to the details of the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b> in the present embodiment.

The driving rack gear portion <b>521</b> is formed in a side face opposed to the gear <b>51</b> and is so formed that the driving rack gear portion is enabled to engage with the first gear portion <b>511</b> of the gear <b>51</b>. The engagement hole portion <b>522</b> is so formed that, when the pedal lever <b>20</b> is locked, the engagement hole portion is enabled to engage with an engagement portion <b>552</b> of the locking member <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">One end side of the connecting pin <b>53</b> is housed in the housing chamber <b>523</b>. The housing chamber <b>523</b> is so formed that the housing chamber does not interfere with driving of the connecting pin <b>53</b> throughout the range of the pedal lever <b>20</b> from fully closed to fully opened. The spring receiving portion <b>524</b> is provided an end face of the linear-motion member <b>52</b> on the side opposed to the pad <b>21</b> and has one end of the reaction force adjusting biasing member <b>54</b> abutted thereagainst and fixed there.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">One end of the connecting pin <b>53</b> is housed in the housing chamber <b>523</b> of the linear-motion member <b>52</b> and the other end is fixed in the pad <b>21</b> by clearance fit. An opening in which the connecting pin <b>53</b> is inserted is formed in an end portion of the linear-motion member <b>52</b> on the pad <b>21</b> side. The reaction force adjusting biasing member <b>54</b> is a compression spring provided outside a shank portion of the connecting pin <b>53</b> in the radial direction; and one end thereof is hooked to the spring receiving portion <b>524</b> of the linear-motion member <b>52</b> and the other end is abutted against the pad <b>21</b> and fixed there. A position sensor <b>59</b> is provided for detecting a position of the linear-motion member <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The locking member <b>55</b> includes the locking rack gear portion <b>551</b> and the engagement portion <b>552</b>. The locking rack gear portion <b>551</b> is so formed that the locking rack gear portion is enabled to engage with the second gear portion <b>512</b> of the gear <b>51</b>. The engagement portion <b>552</b> is so formed that the tip side thereof is reduced in diameter and is fit into the engagement hole portion <b>522</b> of the linear-motion member <b>52</b> when the pedal lever <b>20</b> is locked. In the present embodiment, the locking member <b>55</b> and the engagement hole portion <b>522</b> are provided closer to the depressing direction side than the gear <b>51</b> is. In other words, the operation surface of the pad <b>21</b>, the gear <b>51</b>, and the locking member <b>55</b> are arranged in this order.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">A description will be given to an operation of the accelerator device <b>1</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In the present specification, a direction of rotation is described as clockwise direction or counterclockwise direction relative to the page surface for the sake of simplification but a member only has to be drivable in a relevant direction. It is added that a direction of rotation is not limited to clockwise direction or counterclockwise direction. In the drawings, the directions of movement of the pedal lever <b>20</b> and the linear-motion member <b>52</b>, the direction of rotation of the gear <b>51</b>, and the directions of movement of such members as the linear-motion member <b>52</b> will be indicated by an arrow of an alternate long and short dashed line.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the left side of the page surface shows an accelerator fully closed state, the central part shows an intermediate opening, and the right side of the page surface shows an accelerator fully opened state. In the accelerator fully opened state, the first gear portion <b>511</b> of the gear <b>51</b> and the driving rack gear portion <b>521</b> of the linear-motion member <b>52</b> are engaged with each other. When the pad <b>21</b> is depressed by a driver, the linear-motion member <b>52</b> is moved in the driver's depressing direction (that is, downward direction in the page surface) by tensile force of the reaction force adjusting biasing member <b>54</b>. As a result, the gear <b>51</b> is rotated and the motor <b>40</b> is corotated. Even after the linear-motion member <b>52</b> is moved downward in the page surface to an accelerator fully opened state, the gear <b>51</b> and the locking member <b>55</b> are away from each other. That is, the gear <b>51</b>, the linear-motion member <b>52</b>, and the locking member <b>55</b> are so configured that the following takes place within a normal operation range: the first gear portion <b>511</b> and the driving rack gear portion <b>521</b> of the linear-motion member <b>52</b> are engaged with each other and the second gear portion <b>512</b> and the locking rack gear portion <b>551</b> of the locking member <b>55</b> are not engaged with each other.

That is, in the present embodiment, reaction force is indirectly given to the pedal lever <b>20</b> by way of the reaction force adjusting biasing member <b>54</b>; and the pedal lever <b>20</b> is directly pulled toward a depressing direction by the connecting pin <b>53</b>. Further, a position and reaction force of the pedal lever <b>20</b> can be appropriately controlled by controlling driving of the motor <b>40</b> based on a detection value of the position sensor <b>59</b>.

The drive control unit <b>91</b> controls driving of the motor <b>40</b> based on detection values of an accelerator opening sensor <b>39</b> and a position sensor <b>59</b> or the like.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">The erroneous depression determination unit <b>92</b> determines whether a driver can be considered to be erroneously depressing the pedal lever <b>20</b>.
