level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, imaging elements including photoelectric conversion films which are sensitive to light in an infrared region have attracted attention. For example, one of such imaging elements includes: a photoelectric conversion unit that includes a photoelectric conversion film formed using a group III-V compound semiconductor, such as indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), and photoelectrically converts incident light to generate a charge; and a semiconductor device that is joined to the photoelectric conversion unit, reads out the charge as a signal, and performs predetermined signal processing on the read signal. This semiconductor device is sometimes referred to as a readout integrated circuit (ROIC) substrate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: JP 2016-213286 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When evaluation (an operation test) of the above imaging element is performed, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a defect occurs in the photoelectric conversion unit or the ROIC substrate even if the defect is found. If evaluation is performed to discover a defect in the ROIC substrate, it is necessary to perform such evaluation before the photoelectric conversion unit and the ROIC substrate are joined.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Regarding a test of an integrated circuit, a method of measuring a leakage current between well regions formed in a semiconductor substrate is disclosed in, for example, Patent Literature 1. However, Patent Literature 1 has no mention regarding evaluation of the ROIC substrate used with the photoelectric conversion unit and evaluation of the imaging element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above circumstances, the present disclosure provides a readout semiconductor device that enables circuit evaluation regardless of the presence or absence of a photoelectric conversion unit, and an imaging element and an electronic device including the same.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the first embodiment of the present disclosure, a semiconductor device is provided that includes: a first charge accumulation unit capable of accumulating a charge;

In the present embodiment, the voltage VDR1 of the wiring L<b>1</b> is set to any voltage lower than a withstand voltage of the reset transistor Trst and higher than the voltage VDR2 of the wiring L<b>2</b>.

The voltage Vfd of the floating diffusion layer FD during the D-phase readout is the voltage VDR1, and the voltage Vfd of the floating diffusion layer FD during the P-phase readout is the voltage VDR2. That is, the voltage Vfd of the floating diffusion layer FD has different voltage values between the D-phase readout and the P-phase readout, and thus, the pixel readout circuit <b>20</b>A can be evaluated for both the D-phase readout and the P-phase readout without using a charge signal from the photodiode PD.
