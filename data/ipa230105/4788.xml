The ANN includes multiple layers of neurons, and the outputs of the neurons of each layer are connected to all of the neuron inputs (x<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;x<sub>n</sub>) of the next layer. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each connection between the neurons has a &#x201c;weight&#x201d; (w<sub>1j</sub>&#x2212;w<sub>nj</sub>) associated with it. The activation of each neuron is computed by performing a weighted sum of the inputs (x<sub>1</sub>&#x2212;x<sub>n</sub>) to the neurons and transferring the linear combination of the weighted inputs into a thresholding activation function (f(S)) with a transfer function. That is, the essential computational element of the ANN performs a multiplication of a set of input signals by a set of weights, followed by a summation (e.g., a linear combination of input signals), which is then thresholded by a comparator.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Analog neurons have been proposed as a fast and energetically efficient way of performing the multiply-and-add operation performed in ANNs. Storing the weights locally (i.e., local to the neuron-neuron interconnections) is important to performing to the multiply-and-add operations of the ANNs efficiently. Some related art systems utilize analog memory elements for the storage of the neuron weights, with the conductance of the analog memory element representing the weight. The higher the conductance, the higher the weight and therefore the greater the influence of the neuron input which utilizes that conductance. However, analog weights present significant hardware design challenges because analog weights are difficult to program precisely, due in part to the non-linear nature of the non-volatile memory (NVM) elements typically utilized, such as flash, phase-change memory (PCM), oxide-based resistive memory (OxRAM), conductive bridging RAM (CBRAM), or memresistors. Additionally, process variation in the NVM elements or the programming circuitry means that each element must be programmed in a feedback loop that senses the level of programming (i.e., the weight). Accordingly, a complex iterative algorithm must be implemented on-chip if analog weights are utilized, which results in a significant increase in circuit complexity, size, and energy requirements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, some related art memory cells include NVM elements in series with the passive resistor elements to activate and deactivate current paths through passive resistors. However, providing the NVM elements in series with the passive resistor elements results in a uniform distribution of quantized resistances (i.e., inverse weights), and therefore a non-uniform distribution of weights. For instance, some related art memory cells including NVM elements in series with the passive resistive elements may be biased to produce more weights near zero. Furthermore, such related art memory cells may be suitable for high-density integration in a V-NAND process, but less suitable for integration with a system on chip (SoC) CMOS process.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to various embodiments of a neuromorphic multi-bit digital weight cell configured to store a series of potential weights for a neuron in an artificial neural network (ANN).

The neuromorphic cells of the present disclosure utilize non-volatile memory (NWM) elements in series with passive resistors to activate and deactivate current paths through the passive resistors. Providing the NVM elements in series with the passive resistors results in a uniform distribution of the weights (i.e., a uniform distribution of conductances which are utilized to represent the weights), which results in better accuracy and a smaller number of neurons needed to achieve the same accuracy compared to neuromorphic cells with a non-uniform distribution of weights. In one or more embodiments, the neuromorphic cells may store the weights as the states of a ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap), which enables non-volatile storage. The multi-bit digital representation of the weights provided by the neuromorphic cells of the present disclosure enable ANN training (i.e., ANN learning) to be performed off-chip and enables the exact weights to be transferred accurately to the multi-bit digital network. Additionally, storing multiple bits enables a wider range of possible neural nets to be implemented compared to storing a single bit. Furthermore, the neuromorphic cells of the present disclosure are suitable for integration with a system on chip (SoC) CMOS process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, example embodiments will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout.

The 2-bit representation can provide 4 levels of weights (i.e., 2<sup>2 </sup>levels of weights). In one or more embodiments, the neuromorphic cell <b>100</b> may have any other suitable number passive resistors, such as, for instance, three passive resistors providing a 3-bit representation of the weight (i.e., <b>2</b><sup>3</sup>=8 levels of weights) or more than three resistors providing an n-bit representation of the weight (i.e., <b>2</b><sup>n </sup>levels of weights).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each passive resistor of the neuromorphic cell <b>100</b> has a resistance that is half or substantially half of the resistance of the immediately preceding passive resistor. In the illustrated embodiment, the first passive resistor <b>101</b> has a resistance R<sub>0 </sub>and the second passive resistor <b>102</b> has a resistance R<sub>1 </sub>that is half the resistance R<sub>0 </sub>of the first passive resistor <b>101</b> (i.e., R<sub>1</sub>=R<sub>0</sub>/2).

The total conductance G<sub>tot </sub>of the neuromorphic weight cell <b>100</b> is defined by G<sub>tot</sub>=&#x3a3;<sub>i=0</sub>b<sub>i</sub>2<sup>i</sup>G<sub>0</sub>, where b<sub>i </sub>is a Boolean value of bit i and G<sub>0 </sub>is a smallest conductance in the neuromorphic weight cell <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the smallest conductance G<sub>0 </sub>in the neuromorphic cell <b>100</b> is 1/R<sub>0 </sub>associated with the first passive resistor <b>101</b>, which has the highest resistance. For instance, when the first gating transistor <b>103</b> is in the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state and the second gating transistor <b>104</b> is in the &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; state, the Boolean value of the first bit b<sub>1 </sub>(i.e., bit corresponding to the first passive resistor <b>101</b>) is 1 and the Boolean value of the second bit b<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., the bit corresponding to the second passive resistor <b>102</b>) is 0, and therefore the total conductance G<sub>tot </sub>of the neuromorphic cell <b>100</b> is 1/R<sub>0</sub>. When the first gating transistor <b>103</b> is in the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state and the second gating transistor <b>104</b> is in the &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; state, the Boolean value of the first bit b<sub>1 </sub>(i.e., bit corresponding to the first passive resistor <b>101</b>) is 0 and the Boolean value of the second bit b<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., the bit corresponding to the second passive resistor <b>102</b>) is 1, and therefore the total conductance G<sub>tot </sub>of the neuromorphic cell <b>100</b> is 2/R<sub>0</sub>. When the first and second transistor are in the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state, the Boolean value of the first and second bits b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., the bits corresponding to the first and second passive resistors <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>) is 1, and therefore the total conductance of the neuromorphic weight cell is 3/R0. Accordingly, since the weight is proportional to the total conductance, the distribution of weights produced by the neuromorphic cell <b>100</b> is uniform (e.g., the conductances of the resistors form the base two geometric sequence G, 2G, 4G, . . . 2<sup>n&#x2212;1</sup>G, where n is the number of bits of the neuromorphic cell <b>100</b>), which results in better accuracy and a smaller number of neurons needed to achieve the same accuracy compared to neuromorphic cells with a non-uniform distribution of weights.
