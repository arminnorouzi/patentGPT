For example, banking and financial systems are subject to complex regulations that can subject those institutions to significant fines, other regulatory penalties, reputational risk and other economic loss. Financial crime and sanctions-related risks can arise from directly or indirectly conducting or supporting financial transactions with entities under sanctions or otherwise engaged in illicit activity. These regulations can be complex and can involve identified entities and other entities that fall under sanctions by association. Other business-related risks may arise from export controls on restricted entities or jurisdictions and supply chain-focused security restrictions. Generally, such risks are referred to as financial, trade, and other business-related risks.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various procedures and systems have been developed to assist in monitoring, investigating, and avoiding risks posed by global security threats. There are a number of existing systems, but thus far, they have been found to be inadequate in providing the institution with a cogent and quick representation of the risk as new situations arise. There is a tremendous amount of information, and understanding and assessing the information down to relevant parts has been difficult to achieve. The efficiency in providing such services and the way the information is interactively made available have also been inadequate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with principles of the invention, a computer implemented system for providing a visual interactive software tool that permits users to investigate and evaluate financial, trade, and business-related risks is disclosed.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to improvements in the field of interactive electronic investigation systems and in particular to interactive electronic risk investigation platforms. Such systems are actively being developed to provide tools, information, guidance, and resources for users to interact via a dedicated platform to investigate and comprehend financial, trade, and other business risk related to past or future activity and in particular the field is directed to financial crime or sanctions related risk. As can be well understood, the number of entities, activities, resources, rules or regulations, and known relationships (direct or indirect) is massive and complex. In addition, in each particular situation (such as proposed involvement with an individual), the greater the size and detail of the generally available information, the more difficult to know or detect risk related relationships or activities through known standard methods. Interactive platforms integrating advanced tools such as interactive guided or aided tools can be implemented. However, the filter or guided nature and the way the graphical tool interacts with the user are important aspects of the system that can provide benefits and advantages. These can provide a fluid and simple interface while maintaining valuable content and access to content. It can be key to the user for the interface to provide rapid discovery through the interactive tools (rapid in user action and rapid in user learning and comprehension) without potentially eliminating important information. The development and construction of such interactive and/or integrated systems are important and successful solutions materially add to the growth and success of this field. As mentioned, the platform or system can combine advanced processing such as a software engine with improved user interface tools to advance this field.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At a high level, a software platform can be configured to map entities, relationships, and characteristics of financial, trade, and other business networks such as the commercial, financial, and facilitation networks of sanctioned or other actors that may be associated with illicit activity. Through embodiments of the present invention, financial institutions, multinational corporations, legal professionals, and other stakeholders can access visual graphs depicting relationships between relevant actors in order to evaluate their possible exposure to financial, trade, or other business-related risks. For example, such stakeholders can access visual graphs depicting relationship between sanctioned and non-sanctioned actors in order to evaluate their possible exposure to financial crime or sanctions-related risks. Many embodiments illustrated herein are directed to financial crime and sanctions-related solutions and have particular suitability to solving and assisting users with financial crime and sanctions compliance related issues but are also applicable in other ways to financial, trade, and other business risks. For example, constructs for similar sanctioned and non-sanctioned entity relationship can exist or interconnect with sanctions in other financial, trade, or business area. It should be understood that the present features or systems can have broader or different applications.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With respect to the application to sanctions, sanctions refers to laws or regulations issued by a government that places commercial restrictions on certain identified entities or entities that are described in more general terms or indirectly (e.g., all subsidiaries of an entity that is specifically identified) and also place restrictions on commercial activities involving the restricted entities. Individuals, companies, or organizations that violate the restrictions are subject to civil or criminal penalties, which can be significant source of risk, typically arising from being a primary or secondary actor in a financial transaction. In the United States, government organizations involved in issuing and enforcing such regulations include the Department of the Treasury, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, but others exist in the U.S. and in other countries.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The investigation of actions or relationships involving financial, trade, or other business activity such as sanctions, financial crime, or other similar activity using a software platform for conducting financial crimes and trade compliance is an established niche area and, as mentioned, is a field of development. From an investigation and process perspective, the field can be demanding in the amount of information to evaluate, the volume of transactions to consider, the time to carry out the process, and amount of visual or navigational interaction and information. New navigation tools that are supported by automated traversal tools that interact with each other can provide improved features to the field of development.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The tools can, for example, allow the software platform to discover entities (nodes) in the graph through traversal that meet certain traversal rules based on edge type stemming from a node of interest and in response, display a graphical element in close association with the discovered node. The graphical element can be interactive and can include information communicating that the node was found in a specialized automated discovery procedure, using traversal rules, and can also display that the node (if applicable) is discovered to meet multiple traversal rules (such as one being 50% owned by one or more sanctioned entity, directly or through intermediaries, and another being a series of vendor relationships that connect a supplier of parts to a retailer of finished goods). The tool can be configured to allow the user to interact with the visual representation of the node to visually see the option (while visually focused on the node) and to select for example the 50% owned option and in response, the software platform displays and adds the subgraph that explains the path(s) that meets the traversal qualification to be displayed in the current visual workspace. This is available at the same time for example as a visual interactive tool to add corridors to the current visual workspace. The software platform may display in the visual workspace interactive panels in which options for adding nodes, edges, or subgraphs can be selected. There are many advantages. For example, the interface in some embodiments allows for an interactive tool to be selectable in an area close to the node which allows a user to quickly conduct an investigation to assess exposure to financial, trade, and other business risk. Another example is that the traversal qualification can be part of a related service that defines the criteria and is configured as a service to send identified nodes (entity names) to customers by way of a list of entities that meet defined criteria. The software tool can be configured to enhance the visual workspace for interactive investigation to be able to include the entities (and the corresponding subgraph) and provide a specialized graphical tool that is for quick and efficient visual investigation using that underlying system-wide knowledge. It is possible that user and/or system defined qualifications or criteria are used. Considering the tremendous volume of transactions in this field, enhanced tools that provide quick value to the user in the investigation can be critical to the success of the user and adoption of the platform.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The integration of the &#x201c;back end&#x201d; capabilities with interactive graphical user tools can provide a sophisticated interactive guide and advanced navigational tools to users. The combination can for example actively determine and identify, in the visual interface, that the platform previously determined (or can simultaneously or simultaneously in combination with saved graph features) that with respect to a current node under view (selected in the interface) there is a graph pattern (node, edge, and/or combination) that is associated with the node in the platform. If desired, the platform can apply a set of rules based on the current node or current displayed graph and the platform in response, determines the identification and display of further information about associations with the node (or graph).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative computer-implemented system <b>100</b> for providing a visual interactive software tool that permits users to evaluate financial, trade, and other business risks. The below described implementations are primarily directed to financial crime and sanctions-related risks, but the application to other financial, trade, and business risk is understood. The system <b>100</b> comprises a graph database <b>105</b> configured to store nodes, edges, and properties, a data repository <b>110</b> configured to communicate with different sources over a network to receive financial crime and sanctions-related risk information and save received information used by analysts and automated processes to create nodes, edges, and properties, a production environment <b>120</b> configured to interact with customers. It would be evident that this is one implementation and variations are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The graph databases <b>105</b> include an internal graph database and an external graph database. The internal graph database is configured to store nodes, edges, and properties inputted into the system <b>100</b> by analysts and automated processes, store nodes, edges, and properties for access and use by analysts and automated processes and store other information entered and produced from the inputted nodes, edges, or properties. The information produced may be information created using the nodes, edges, and properties (e.g., connections and corridors). System <b>100</b> may have a process such as an automated process that adds nodes, edges, properties or other data to the external graph (e.g., from the internal graph database). System <b>100</b> may be configured for example to include a graph database <b>105</b> without an internal graph database (e.g., only an &#x201c;external graph database&#x201d;) such that system <b>100</b> adds or updates the graph database from various sources based on automation (e.g., using a set of configured rules), manual entry, or variations thereof without requiring a preliminary (internal) graph database. The graph database <b>105</b> is configured to store nodes and edges for customers' use in the production environment <b>120</b> and store visual graphs produced and saved by customers in the production environment <b>120</b>. The graph database <b>105</b> may be a component separate from the production environment <b>120</b> or be integrated with the production environment <b>120</b>. The system <b>100</b> is configured to logically divide or secure (e.g., by a mechanism such as user authentication executed by subsystem <b>155</b>) the production environment <b>120</b>, wherein customers are only permitted to access or interact with nodes or edges in the external graph database (in graph database <b>105</b>) and authorized features for that customer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A node represents a subject. The system <b>100</b> is configured to allow for the subject to be an individual, entity, postal address, e-mail address, event, number, telephone number, campaign, or other subject. In the application to sanctions and financial crime, the subject may be one that appears on a sanctions list or one that faces similar government imposed restrictions (sanctioned subject), one that is materially associated with a sanctioned subject but does not appear on a sanctions list (associated subject), or one that is neutrally associated with a sanctioned subject or an associated subject and does not appear on a sanctions list (neutral subject). A node is described by properties that include one or more words, numbers, symbols, or a combination thereof by which the underlying subject is known or referred to. When the subject (or property) is a number, the number may be a phone number, fax number, driver license number, social security number, passport number, bank account number (including credit card and debit card account numbers), identification number used by the system <b>100</b>, or other number.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">An edge represents a relationship between two nodes. The relationship may be a business relationship (e.g., creditor, supplier, joint-venture, etc.), an ownership relationship (e.g., majority shareholder, minority shareholder, subsidiary, etc.), a position relationship (e.g., director, manager, owner, etc.), a banking relationship (e.g., account holder, mortgagor, etc.), a familial relationship (e.g., father, daughter, cousin, etc.), and other relationships. An edge is described by properties that include one or more words, numbers, symbols, or a combination thereof by which the underlying subject is known or referred to. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative node, property, and edge and their respective roles.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a graphical structure of the node, property, and edge that is presented to user when he or she assembles them through the workspace in the production environment. The graph database <b>105</b> stores nodes, edges, and information in nonvolatile memory. Nodes and edges are part of a graph database and can also have a graphical representation as part of a user interface.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As would be understood, a range of variations and combinations are contemplated such that the features or components of the system can interact and support each other or be available if desired. The system <b>100</b> can create particular nodes or edges (and related properties) from one or more sources of data in accordance with a model, ontology, or structure such as by the system receiving or applying a data ontology to a set of received data into the system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> can be configured to communicate with many different data sources and perform manual or automated operations to process and add the data from the different data sources to the graph database <b>105</b> in accordance with one or more corresponding data ontologies. In automated form, for example, data from a certain source is known by the system to be structured and the system can automatically perform operations to add the data to the graph database.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Data repository <b>110</b> can be included in the system to receive and store for retrieval structured, unstructured, and partially structured data or information from a various sources. Data repository <b>110</b> can be configured to be a data lake, which is defined as a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. It can store data in its native format and process any variety of it. The data repository <b>110</b> communicates with different data sources over a network to receive information such as financial crime and sanctions related information. Data sources may include government sanctions lists, court records, records of incorporation, corporate filings, shipping records, news, websites, public social media postings, multi-media, and other sources. The information is used by the system <b>100</b> to create or input a node and related properties in graph database <b>105</b>. Information in the data repository can include supporting information (including links or text of webpages) that provide underlying evidence of the nodes and edges that are added to the graph database <b>105</b>. For example, data received from Securities and Exchange Commission filings with the government can be used to generate nodes and edges in the graph database <b>105</b> and the data repository <b>110</b> can store or provide access to the related government documents or company filings. This can allow the system <b>100</b> to permit customers to retrieve for display from the system <b>100</b> the specific documents that are the source of the graph configuration. In this way, entered nodes, edges, and/or properties can be checked for accuracy or evaluated in context by reviewing the actual received information directly (instead of just the nodes, edges, and properties) if necessary. For example, the received information may include a legal filing (or other source), a link to the legal filing, or information about the legal filing, and the customer can review that legal filing from the customer interface.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The system <b>100</b> can automatically add nodes and related properties using data in the data repository <b>110</b>. The system <b>100</b> can use one or more data models or data ontologies adapted for the field of application to add data from the data repository <b>110</b> as nodes and/or related properties.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A node can be identified as a node of interest. Once a node is identified as being a node of interest, the system can as a result, designate it as a corridor endpoint node. For example, the system can identify whether an entity of a node is found on a sanctions list and the system can record that in the system and select to make one or more (all) sanctioned nodes to be individual points of interest. The designation imparts to the inputted node different characteristics and effects that enables the software engine <b>135</b> to find paths and corridors (further discussed below) accordingly and that allows the electronic online platform of the production environment <b>120</b> to generate a visual graphic as a distinctive representation. A node can be identified to be a node of interest by the system automatically or designated manually. System <b>100</b> can review the inputted nodes against one or more criteria and data in the data repository to identify which inputted nodes are to be identified as a node of interest. For example, an inputted node can be identified as appearing on a sanction list. Also by way of example, a node of interest can be identified by the system using data in the data repository to determine which inputted nodes are state owned, are located in a particular city, and develop certain technology. The resulting entities may not be a sanctioned entity (directly or indirectly) but the identified nodes can provide an additional strategy for visually investigating risk such as through relationships or network of activities.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A node can also be created to represent a legal filing or other data that serves as a source for additions. In some situations, this type of node is configured not to have a graphical node inserted into a workspace.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The system can allow the addition of a second category of information specifying an edge and related properties between inputted nodes. The system <b>100</b> can automatically add edges and related properties using data in the data repository. The system <b>100</b> can use one or more data models or data ontologies adapted for the field of application to add data from the data repository <b>110</b> as edges and/or related properties between inputted nodes. In some embodiments, adding a certain node and/or specifying the type and direction of the relationship between two nodes in the graph database <b>105</b> may cause the system <b>100</b> to automatically select a certain relationship between that certain inputted node and another inputted node and store that relationship in the graph database for those nodes. The relationship selected by the system <b>100</b> may be a mandatory relationship. In some embodiments, specifying a certain relationship may cause the system <b>100</b> to automatically change or specify the type of node (e.g., source or corridor endpoint node). The type of node selected by the system <b>100</b> may be a mandatory type of node.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The first category of information and the second category of information are stored in the graph database <b>105</b> and can be accessed by the workspace.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The system <b>100</b> can include a first subsystem that is configured to store and provide one or more defined data models or data ontologies (generally referred to as data ontologies) adapted for nodes and edges in the application. A data ontology can refer to data mappings, a graph data structure, or to categories or types of data for entry into the graph database. In general, the data ontology is user defined. In simple applications, data from certain data sources may be structured or primarily structured at the source (e.g., upon transfer to system <b>100</b>) and the system <b>100</b> can define a data ontology that applies to the data structure of the data source (e.g., provide corresponding translation, transformation, or modification to successfully ingest the data into system <b>100</b> for use in system <b>100</b> investigation and operable use). The system can use the information and ontology to determine nodes, edges, and other characteristics for the graph database <b>105</b>. The system can be configured to automatically receive data from a data source and automatically apply such a process to ingest data into the graph database <b>105</b> in accordance with a corresponding data ontology.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A data ontology can govern what and how each piece of information is added to the graph database <b>105</b>. It can govern how information is added in relationship to a node and specify the relationship between nodes and can relate the entered information to a node in the graph database <b>105</b> based on information in the entered information. It can determine how the entered information should be linked to or integrated with the node if the entered information is related. In some embodiments, a data ontology may be available as a template for entering the first and/or second category of information. In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> can automatically select the appropriate data ontology to use for received data into the system <b>100</b>. The data ontology may include the corresponding fields and the required data structure and format so that the system <b>100</b> or the graph database <b>105</b> can be built and maintained uniformly across all users and processes involved in populating data in the graph database. Thus, for example providing automated graph generation based on the data ontology. The data models can also be created for other situations.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The system is configured to allow collaboration. The system can be configured to have many automated graph generation processes and users to interact and save their work on the system. The system can be configured to allow users to share their work and to build on that work (efficiently building a larger and more complex set of information). For example, the system <b>100</b> is built with a database storing information that visually identifies direct and indirect relationships between an actor that does not appear on a list (e.g., a sanctions list) and other actors that do appear on the list. The system <b>100</b> can add additional actors or nodes to the database to continue the direct and indirect relationships and/or new actors or nodes to the database to create new direct and indirect relationships that are not already in the database. The system <b>100</b> can include an approval or transition process for new information that is being added to the production environment. The process can be configured as an automated process involving a workflow in which the system specifies that a new set of subjects or relationships are being added to the system and in response, an automated approval or transition process is implemented that can involve a trigger based on automated or manual approval adding or updating the graph database with the new additions. For example, a daily update from a government database can be received into the system <b>100</b> and the system <b>100</b> applies processes to the update such as to apply a data ontology to model the received data and apply other processes as necessary. In response, the system <b>100</b> updates the graph database available to customers to include the new nodes and relationship and may also perform additional automated processing such as identifying and updating customer navigation and research tools (e.g., identifying new corridors).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The software engine <b>145</b> includes a set of computer implemented rules (generally referred to as rules) that are configured to traverse paths and find (&#x201c;surface&#x201d;) a subset of the paths that meet certain rules (and therefore, eliminate other paths). The subset that meets the rules is referred to herein as corridors. The software engine <b>145</b> is configured to find or identify corridors based on the stored first and second category of information. A corridor is a pathway connecting any node that is not a corridor endpoint node to a node that is designated as a corridor endpoint node via one or more edges and/or one or more connecting nodes. A connecting node can be any node except a node designated as a corridor endpoint node and/or other nodes deemed to have no value in the traversal (e.g., having low or no illicit finance or sanctions-related risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation because the node has a large number of connections). The system <b>100</b> may be configured to specify whether an added node is a corridor endpoint node or some other kind of node (e.g., a node that has no risk relevance or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation, or any further specificity with respect to the type of node can for example be determined by the software engine <b>145</b> based on the edges or paths connected to that node). The system <b>100</b> can automatically specify nodes to be points of interest by applying a process such as by determining whether the node is on a list (e.g., a sanctions or trade restrictions list) or applying a plurality of criteria. At a base level, a corridor is determined (found) by identifying a node (that is not a corridor endpoint node) from the first category of information and connecting the identified node to a designated corridor endpoint node in the first category of information via a direct edge connection or via other nodes in the first category of information and the edges in the second category of information. Rules are incorporated into the software engine <b>145</b> that traverses or finds paths from identified nodes to designated corridor endpoint nodes and finds corridors as a subset of all paths where a path from an identified node can be traversed by the software engine <b>145</b> to reach a designated corridor endpoint node. In operation, the software engine <b>145</b> automatically traverses from the identified node through connected nodes and edges until it reaches a designated corridor endpoint node. A corridor endpoint node is a type of node that is specified or designated within the system as having different properties than other nodes. A corridor endpoint node cannot be the starting point of a corridor and is only available to end a pathway or corridor. The corridor endpoint node is defined by the system <b>100</b> (e.g., by rules, configurations, and/or data structures and ontologies) to function that way with respect to identified nodes. A corridor is found when the identified node is connected to a corridor endpoint node and also certain rules are satisfied. A corridor can be graphically illustrated by the system <b>100</b> (e.g., as part of the graphical user interface) using a graphical structure comprising the connected nodes, edges and corridor endpoint node that form the corridor. Subject to meeting certain additional rules (discussed herein) a corridor can be identified by the software engine <b>145</b> whenever an identified node can reach a corridor endpoint node. Multiple corridors can be generated for an identified node. The multiple corridors may be pathways between an identified node and a corridor endpoint node, between an identified node and multiple corridor endpoint nodes, or a combination thereof. The software engine (or components thereof) can directly or indirectly interact with the customer using the application interface to support the customer facing aspect of the system.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts illustrative corridors <b>350</b>, <b>355</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>364</b>, <b>368</b>. As mentioned above, a corridor is a pathway between a source node and a corridor endpoint node that meets certain rule requirements. For discussion purposes, in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, corridors are discussed in more general terms and additional specificity is discussed further below. The corridors <b>350</b>, <b>355</b>, <b>360</b> represent pathways between a source node <b>305</b> and a corridor endpoint node <b>310</b>. The corridor <b>350</b> includes an edge <b>315</b> joining the source node <b>305</b> and a connecting node <b>320</b>, a connecting node <b>320</b>, and an edge <b>325</b> joining the connecting node <b>320</b> and the corridor endpoint node <b>310</b>. The corridor <b>355</b> is an edge <b>357</b> between the source node <b>305</b> and corridor endpoint node <b>310</b>. The corridor <b>360</b> includes an edge <b>330</b> joining the source node <b>305</b> and a connecting node <b>335</b>, a connecting node <b>335</b>, an edge <b>340</b> joining the source node <b>335</b> and a connecting node <b>345</b>, a connecting node <b>345</b>, and an edge <b>348</b> joining the connecting node <b>345</b> and the corridor endpoint node <b>310</b>. The corridor <b>364</b> represents a pathway between the same source node <b>305</b> and a different corridor endpoint node <b>370</b>. The corridor <b>368</b> represents a pathway between the same source node <b>305</b> and another different corridor endpoint node <b>375</b>. The software engine <b>135</b> may not generate corridors for some of the source nodes since not all the source nodes can be connected to a corridor endpoint node.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The software engine <b>145</b> can be programmed with a maximum number of degrees of node-traversal. The maximum number of degrees of node-traversal refers to the number of nodes in a pathway the software engine <b>145</b> is permitted (by rule) to traverse to reach a corridor endpoint node from a particular source node. The software engine <b>145</b> can end the node traversal, exit the traversed pathway, and eliminate that traversed pathway from qualifying as a corridor when the software engine <b>145</b> determines that the current traversed node is equal to the maximum number of degrees of node-traversal. The software engine <b>145</b> is configured to eliminate a pathway when the number of nodes in the path (after the source node) reaches a maximum. The maximum can be specified internal to the system and not otherwise visible to users when interacting with the system. The maximum can, for example, be selected to be one of 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 nodes, which can have advantages in processing, relevancy, and presentation. Other maximums are contemplated. With this rule, the software engine <b>145</b> prevents pathways that exceed the maximum number of degrees of node-traversal from qualifying to be corridors. If the software engine <b>145</b> has reached the maximum number and no corridor endpoint node is found, then the software engine <b>145</b> moves onto traversing another pathway (e.g., which can start from the same source node again if that source node has other pathways or from the next source node) to find a corridor endpoint node. Since the graph database <b>105</b> may store a large number of nodes and edges, their combinations may produce an enormous number of pathways. The maximum number can control the number of iterations performed by the software engine <b>145</b> to save processing time and power consumption. For brevity, the term maximum number of degrees of node-traversal is sometimes referred to or abbreviated as the maximum number, the maximum number of node traversal, the maximum number of node traversal or degrees of traversal, or the maximum number of traversal nodes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an illustrative process <b>400</b> for finding corridors. In addition to the programmed maximum number, the software engine <b>145</b> can be configured to apply a process that identifies and eliminates pathways that include a node in the path (between a source node and a corridor endpoint node) that has been designated as having no risk relevance or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation when traversing through that node to a corridor endpoint node. The determination by the system of which nodes (or edges) are ones that have no risk relevance or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation can be performed in one or more ways (or combinations thereof) that are described herein as illustrative examples. A node (or edge) can be designated as having no risk relevance or low risk relevance automatically or manually. The software engine <b>145</b> can determine whether a node is one that has no risk relevance or low risk relevance, without user involvement in the decision. The software engine <b>145</b> can make the determination by analyzing the edge connecting the two nodes, the properties of the edge and two nodes, the number of edges the node has, or a combination thereof, and determining that the inclusion of the node, or the path associated with the node, would indicate a neutral or primarily neutral relationship between the two nodes. If desired, a software module that incorporates artificial intelligence, machine learning, or a set of rules can be implemented in some embodiments that determines whether a node or edge has no or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation. Low risk relevance is mentioned to explain that a low level of relevance would still not be sufficient to reach a threshold value for the purpose of corridor generation. The software engine <b>145</b> can be configured to recognize nodes that have no risk relevance or low risk relevance (e.g., government node).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">This configuration improves the technical and informational aspects of the resulting corridors. For example, in a sanctions applications, a node for a government entity can be removed by this rule because its inclusion provides very limited or no relevance for the purpose of evaluating financial crime and sanctions-related risks for two distinct nodes that connect through the government node. In operation, in one embodiment, the system implements a process in which as part of the automated node traversal process, it determines whether each node is identified as a type of node that the system has stored with a designation that this type of node has no risk relevance or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation. If the system identifies a match, the system would eliminate that pathway from consideration and would discontinue traversing that pathway. The node and related connection would be available and displayed (if desired) in a workspace to provide additional information to a user.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts illustrative steps <b>405</b> and <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In this example, a low maximum number (e.g., 3) is used for explanatory purposes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a graphical illustration of the process in order to further elaborate about its operation. If desired, the graphical illustration could be incorporated into an interactive graphical interface. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, node <b>505</b> may have been recently added to the system <b>100</b>. At this point, for example, the system processes the addition as part of the already existing nodes and edges in the production environment. The system will automatically start at node <b>505</b> and traverse connections (e.g., one by one, at the same time, or some variation thereof) and applies automated rules to select corridors. In this case, node <b>505</b> has connections to node <b>510</b> (a node on a sanctions list and thus a corridor endpoint node) through nodes <b>520</b>, <b>521</b>, <b>525</b>, <b>527</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, and <b>529</b>. The software engine <b>135</b> would traverse connected edges and nodes until reaches node <b>510</b> or the node traversal is terminated before it reaches node <b>510</b> when the software engine <b>135</b> determines that the current path it is traversing has reached a maximum number of nodes before reaching a corridor endpoint node or a node or edge (reached in the traversal process) that is in the category of nodes or edges that have no risk relevance or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation. In the illustration, for convenience, lines <b>552</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>556</b>, <b>558</b>, <b>560</b>, and <b>562</b> are provided as a way to mark and discuss an associated set of nodes and edges that (based on information stored in the environment) establish a path from node <b>505</b> to node <b>510</b>. Those lines are markers for discussion purposes. For example, in this case, using step <b>405</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the software engine <b>135</b> identifies pathways, referenced using associated markers, <b>552</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>556</b>, <b>558</b>, <b>560</b>, <b>562</b> that connect node <b>505</b> to corridor endpoint node <b>510</b> and eliminates pathway <b>558</b> because pathway <b>558</b> involves more than 3 connecting nodes (e.g., <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>532</b>, and <b>534</b>). In operation, the process would stop the traversal process when it reaches the maximum number of traversal nodes (3 in this example) and the system would not identify or &#x201c;know&#x201d; that there is a pathway <b>558</b> to node <b>510</b> because it would have stopped the traversal process when it reached the maximum (i.e., node <b>532</b>). By performing step <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the software engine <b>135</b> identifies that node <b>522</b> has no risk relevance or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation, when it reaches that node in the node traversal process, and eliminates pathway <b>560</b> associated with node <b>522</b>. Similarly, in operation, the process would stop the traversal process when it reaches the node <b>522</b> (determines node has no risk relevance or low risk relevance for the purpose of corridor generation) and at that point the system would not identify or &#x201c;know&#x201d; that there is a pathway <b>560</b> to node <b>510</b> because it would have stopped the traversal process when it reached node <b>522</b>. As a result, the software engine <b>135</b> keeps only pathways <b>552</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>556</b> and <b>562</b> after performing steps <b>405</b> and <b>410</b> and the kept pathways are determined to be corridors associated with node <b>505</b> in relation to node <b>510</b> (since there can be other relations). Corridors are automatically added to be available as a tool in the production environment when or in response to being found by the software engine <b>135</b>. Other implementations are also contemplated. The &#x201c;eliminated&#x201d; nodes or edges would continue to exist in the graph database and can be visually added or included in the user workspace when a user is interactively investigating data using system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The predetermined node type for non-traversal, the type of node that the process should identify and use to eliminate the path being traversed (no risk relevance or low risk relevance), and the predetermined number of connecting nodes (maximum number of node traversal or degrees of traversal) may be inputted by a user into the software interface or can be pre-programed in the software engine <b>135</b> (in the implementation of the overall system). For example, a customer that is using the system <b>100</b> to conduct an investigation can be provided an interactive option to select a setting such as the maximum number of node traversal or to exclude/include nodes of low or no relevance in generating or presenting corridors.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The process <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) further comprises determining a degree of relevance for the corridors <b>415</b>. The step <b>415</b> comprises storing a set of weights in correspondence with the different types of edges <b>420</b>, assigning weights based on the type of edges in each corridor <b>425</b>, calculating a cumulative value of weights for each found corridor based on the assigned weights <b>430</b>, and specifying a degree of relevance to other corridors for each corridor <b>435</b> based on the cumulative value. The types of edges may be based on the relationship such as whether the relationship is a shareholder one, an employment one, a banking one, a familial one, or other one and/or the rank in the relationship (majority shareholder vs. minority shareholder, director vs. associate, son vs. cousin, etc.). Each relationship type and rank can an assigned weight, and certain relationships types and ranks can be configured to have a weight higher than other relationship types and ranks. Higher weight may refer to a higher assigned number or a higher multiplier in the calculation step <b>430</b> or the formula used in the calculation step <b>430</b>. An equal weight arrangement can be implemented such that each edge or type of edge is assigned the same weight whereby emphasis is placed on traversal distance rather than weighting the particular type of edge or node connection for example. The calculation step <b>430</b> may be based on adding all the assigned weights of the connecting edges in a corridor. The total sum or cumulative value may be used as the only parameter in the specifying step <b>435</b> to determine the degree of relevance. The cumulative value may also be used with other parameters or in another procedure to determine the relevance in step <b>435</b>. A higher cumulative value may represent that the corridor has a higher relevance compared to other corridors. In some embodiments, a lower cumulative value may represent that the corridor has a higher relevance compared to other corridors. If desired, the degree of relevance may be output as a number on a scale configured to convey such degree. For example, the corridor with the strongest degree of relevance may be marked with &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the corridor with the second strongest degree of relevance may be marked with &#x201c;2,&#x201d; and so forth. Other numbers, letter, characters, or orders (e.g., from large number to small number) may also be used. The number may be different from the cumulative value. In some embodiments, the system can be configured to only assign weights that are equal or greater than 1 (with 1 indicating most relevant and ascending numbers, totals, indicating lower relevance, in relation to a weight of 1).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">If desired as an option, the step <b>415</b> may further comprise a step <b>440</b> that eliminates corridors based on relevance determined from calculating weights. The step <b>440</b> may eliminate corridors based on assigned weights in step <b>425</b> and before the calculation step <b>430</b>. In this case, steps <b>430</b> and <b>435</b> calculate a cumulative value and specify a degree of relevance for the remaining corridors. The step <b>440</b> may eliminate corridors based on the calculated cumulative value in step <b>430</b>. The step <b>440</b> may eliminate corridors that do not have a cumulative value that is above, below, or matches a predetermined cumulative value. In this case, step <b>435</b> specifies a degree of relevance for the remaining corridors. The predetermined cumulative value may be system specified and may include the option to be selected or modified by the customer via a software interface of the system <b>100</b>. Also, to clarify &#x201c;eliminate&#x201d; refers to the process of determining corridors that identified and presented to the customer interacting with the system. The &#x201c;eliminate&#x201d; nodes or edges remain the graph database and can be used in the workspace through visual illustration in response to user interaction with nodes displayed in a workspace or search results.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The step <b>415</b> may be performed after the step <b>405</b> is executed, after the step <b>410</b> executed, or after both steps <b>405</b> and <b>410</b> are executed. In any of these scenarios, the step <b>415</b> may operate to determine a degree of relevance for corridors kept by step <b>405</b> and/or <b>410</b> without the step <b>440</b>. The step <b>415</b> may also operate to further eliminate one or more corridors kept by step <b>405</b> and/or <b>410</b> and determine a degree of relevance for the remaining corridors. In other words, the step <b>440</b> may be optional in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the step <b>415</b> may be configured to perform before steps <b>405</b> and/or <b>410</b>.

The customer platform <b>140</b> communicates with the graph database <b>840</b> to access the information and save the work customer produced from the platform <b>140</b>. The graph database <b>842</b> is configured to allow using or exporting of tailored subsets of data or files containing the information and work produced. The lists may be exported periodically from the database <b>842</b> and for distribution to customers. Generated lists allow individuals to view information and analysis produced by the system without the individuals keyword searching through the production environment <b>810</b>. The lists can be generated using an automated process that incorporates a set of rules such as identities of entities or nodes in the graph database <b>840</b>, <b>842</b> that are more than 50% owned (directly or indirectly) by a sanctioned entity. In application, corridors are configured to provide an efficient navigational tool for customers that automatically starts from nodes and explores and identifies connections (pathways of one or more edges and nodes) to corridor endpoints in accordance with rules (as illustratively described herein) whereas lists as a navigational or investigative tool are configured to apply rules that rely on whether connecting nodes, edges, or properties in a pathway are of a particular type (e.g., owned by type relationship, which can be directional in nature). Being a node of interest or corridor endpoint can be included in the rules for lists. These tools, including other related ones described herein, provide an automated system that assists to remove less valuable data or noise, automatically while also making the &#x201c;eliminated&#x201d; data available in the database for inspection and addition to the workspace. Given the massive amount of interrelated data that can exist, the interactive navigational tools herein address a multitude of needs from perspectives such as comprehensiveness, reduced time of use, visual presentation, speed, or clarity.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, databases <b>840</b> and <b>842</b> may be one single database configured to be accessible by customer web portal <b>844</b> and to export lists <b>846</b>. The production environment <b>810</b> can include the software engine <b>145</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to perform the related or supporting operations of the platform <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments of the present invention, an application of graph databases can be provided to customers while retaining the power of the system and being able to surface highly relevant information for the customer. Due to different operational use cases or other reasons, including technical reasons, customers may want to use a complimentary alternative to the application of the graph database, or the related interactive interface previously described. These reasons can be because of the need for financial institutions and companies to identify and receive data about subsets of actors that are associated with actors of interest according to specific criteria such as sanctioned actors. In the field of sanctions, financial institutions and other companies are prohibited from providing services to or conducting business with sanctioned actors and certain other materially associated parties. The data are used in a different operational use case where financial institutions and companies screen customers, transactions, and/or counterparties to determine if they have material associations with sanctioned actors. As mentioned, other criteria or factors can be important to companies that use the system such as in the event of internal guidelines or polices that are directed to ethics or sustainability (e.g., such as to avoid using prison labor). Financial institutions and other companies can incorporate data about this subset of actors into their operations to screen for possible exposure to sanctions or illicit activity, or to perform other analytics.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As discussed, the system can include a tool that is configured to permit the selection of a criteria to perform a customized navigation, such as traversal in accordance with an algorithm that traverses by a particular edge type, or combination of edge type, node types, and properties, to find nodes of a certain type that are of interest to the customer. The system provider or customer can select the criteria and the system is configured to apply the criteria to the graph database of the production environment of the system, for example. The traversal can involve starting from a node of interest (for example, a node of interest means (or can be) a sanctioned node, a node that does not appear on a sanctions list but is associated with a sanctioned node, a node that presents financial crime and sanctions-related risks but does not appear on a sanctions list, or a non-sanctioned node that the provider or customer wishes to investigate, for example with respect to the latter, because the node has a certain general or specific characteristic such as a specific country association) and only traversing an edge if its immediately connected edge meets the specified criteria. The traversal will end if there is no connected edge that meets the criteria (e.g., that edge type). An edge is a particularly suitable criterion, but other criteria are contemplated, and in some cases, the traversal can traverse multiple nodes and check multiple properties as long as the criteria is satisfied as the traversal proceeds through a node and its edges. Examples of this are further described below.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As mentioned, embodiments of the present invention can also explore an actor that appears on a sanctions list (e.g., sanctioned node) and identify actors that do not appear on a sanctions list but are associated with the sanctioned actor via certain relationships and present financial crime or sanctions-related risk (e.g., associated nodes). For ease of convenience, the text will refer to government issued sanctions (e.g., individuals or entities that are subject to direct government sanctions) but it is understood to also be applicable to financial crime (financial crime and sanctions-related risks can arise from directly or indirectly conducting or supporting financial transactions with entities under sanctions or otherwise engaged in illicit activity). Financial crime can for example involve an entity or its actors that have been found or accused by a government of money laundering, terrorism, nuclear weapons proliferation, human rights abuses, corruption, or other illicit activity. An actor can be an individual or entity or another type of node. In general, embodiments of the present invention are particularly suited for sanctions and financial crimes applications but can be applicable in other areas (e.g., general embodiments are contemplated). In operation, the system, through the software engine, can start traversing from a node of interest, such as the sanctioned node, through its connected edges and nodes and finds the associated nodes based on a specified criterion or traversal process. The node of interest, the associated node(s) (meaning those identified through traversal to meet the specified criteria), and the relationship(s) connecting the node of interest and the associated node(s) can be represented and saved as a subgraph according to the type of traversal (e.g., type of relationship or edge) used to identify the associated node(s). A subgraph is a graph obtained from the information stored in the graph database or from the overall graph constructed using a subset the information stored in the graph database. Subgraphs can be stored in the graph database. The data in a graph or subgraph can be visually represented using nodes, edges, and properties. The subgraph can be quickly accessed by the system in response to a request from users and provide users data surfacing or showing paths that survived a specified traversal process emanating from the node of interest (by way of a data table, graph data, or visual representation). That is, the subgraph represents a portion of the graph database perceived from the node of interest through a virtual lens formed by the traversal criteria. As is evident, in this process, as illustrated, the traversal is configured to start with a node of interest and traverse outward and in the corridor feature, the process is configured to start at a node (that is not a node of interest) and traverse through pathways to a node of interest to generate corridors.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The system can be configured, for example, by way of the combination of the graph database, sets of rules, and interactive user interface to provide a powerful and quick investigative, navigational, and informational tool. The tool can be referred to as a lens or lens tool, as mentioned above. For example, the system can permit the user to use the lens tool in connection with a current node in the workspace (that is selected, e.g., highlighted by the user or system) and the lens tool is displayed to the user (by way of an indicator such as circle positioned on the node) in association with the current node. The graphic visual element can be a circle or other shape or other visually displayed items. This is to communicate that variations are contemplated. For example, a color can by itself be an element. This tool informs the user that one or more subgraphs are in the graph database that meet one or more sets of rules (e.g., a corridor). The lens tool permits the user to be informed of risk or research relevant to the current node as analyzed in the graph database and accessible visually by the lens tool. For example, in the present context, the user can see the node and if there is a lens (indicator), view the contents of the lens (e.g., by seeing a list) and selecting from the lens items to add to the workspace and conduct further review and investigation. This significantly reduces the processing and investigation involved in the user manually traversing the graph. It can also provide a more efficient user interface in that the user can, for example, conduct a purposeful expansion using selections (&#x201c;clicks&#x201d;) that are positionally close to the node in the workspace.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The subgraph may be enriched with custom data. For example, in the application in field of sanctions and financial crime, subsets of the sanctions graph can be classified by sanctions program, research area, themes, or topics such as North Korea, IRGC, al-Qaeda, military end use or human rights to enable specific reporting on the sanctions information or other information. For instance, a subset of the sanctions graph can be classified as related to North Korea to enable reporting on sanctions information related to North Korea gathered from all the sanctions lists or other information. The sanctions subgraph can provide information that may not be available from the sanctions list and in a manner that can be easily digested by users. The subgraph may be displayed on an interactive user display or may be used to enhance other information displayed on an interactive user display as discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The system can find associated nodes by several methods that use a node of interest. The particular method, or traversal process, to be performed by the system in revealing the associated nodes can be set by specifying a criterion. One of the criteria is ownership. Ownership can mean the share of ownership a node of interest (e.g., a sanctioned node) has in another node. The share of ownership can be represented using percentage and available percentages for user selection (either by system or customer) can be pre-stored in the database. The percentage may also be adjustable. For example, the sanctioned node's share of ownership in another node can be 30%, 50%, 80%, or other percentages. By specifying ownership, the system executes a traversal process that involves ownership edges (involves primarily ownership edges or only ownership edges). An ownership edge that includes an ownership percentage property can be used to calculate the share of ownership the sanctioned node has in another node. The traversal process uses the specified percentage to find associated nodes. This traversal process may be referred to as the ownership traversal method.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The process traverses from the node of interest and finds nodes in which the node of interest has ownership and the aggregate share of ownership meets the specified percentage (e.g., equal to or greater than the specified percentage). The software engine traverses from the node of interest through ownership edges, finds nodes connected through ownership edges (nodes in which the sanctioned node has ownership), and determines whether the share of ownership meets the specified percentage. The software engine can determine whether the share of ownership meets the specified percentage directly or indirectly, and individually or in aggregate by one or more nodes of interest (i.e., directly and individually, directly and in aggregate, indirectly and individually, and indirectly and in aggregate). One or more nodes of interest can for example refer to one or more sanctioned nodes. The share of ownership meets the specified percentage when the share of ownership (individually or in aggregate) is equal to or more than the specified percentage (or is at least equal to the specified percentage). In one application, some laws and regulations subject entities that are 50% or more owned by sanctioned actors to the same restrictions as sanctioned actors. Financial institutions and other companies need lists of entities that are 50% or more owned by sanctioned actors to screen against customers or transactions.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, the percentage threshold for ownership by a sanctioned node is set to 50%. In this example, the node of interest is a sanctioned node. For clarification, a sanctioned node can be a category of nodes and similarly a node of interest can be referring to a particular node or a category of nodes (sanctioned nodes). This is relevant because in the context of sanctioned nodes, the question may be to identify a node that is associated to one or more sanctioned nodes (e.g., different entities under government sanctions) by being owned by 50% or more by one or more sanctioned nodes (e.g., different entities under government sanction). For ease of discussion, sanctioned nodes are used in the example. If the share of ownership is set to determine directly and individually, then a node may be an associated node when it is directly connected to the sanctioned node via an ownership edge and the sanctioned node owns at least 50% of that node. If the share of ownership is set to determine indirectly and individually, then a node may be an associated node when it is indirectly connected to the sanctioned node via one or more intermediary nodes and the total share of ownership in one of the available paths or edges needs to be at least 50%. For instance, a sanctioned node is connected to node A and owns 25% of node A, and node A is connected to node B and owns 25% of node B, and the total share of ownership in that series or in each path is 25%. Therefore, node B is not an associated node. Node B would be an associated node if the sanctioned node owns 50% of node A and node A owns at least 50% of node B.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">If the share of ownership is set to determine directly and in aggregate, then a node may be an associated node when it is owned by one or more sanctioned nodes directly and the total share of ownership by the one or more sanctioned nodes is at least 50%. If the share of ownership is set to determine indirectly and in aggregate, then a node may be an associated node when it is owned by one or more sanctioned nodes indirectly and the total share of ownership in all the paths is at least 50%. In some embodiments, the total share of ownership can be calculated using only certain paths from all the paths. The in-aggregate option is used to detect situations or associated nodes when each sanctioned node may not have enough share of ownership in a certain node to qualify as a majority owner (e.g., each sanctioned node is a minority owner), but in aggregate the sanctioned nodes own the majority of the node.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the example, the following procedures can also determine whether the share of ownership meets the specified percentage. If a node is 50% or more owned by a sanctioned node, then the software engine identifies that node as an associated node. If aggregate ownership by one or more sanctioned nodes in a node is 50% or more, then the software engine identifies that node as an associated node. For example, if a sanctioned node A owns 20% of node Z and another sanctioned node B owns 35% of node Z, then the software engine identifies node Z as an associated node.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The software engine performs iterations to determine whether the share of ownership meets the specified percentage. Whether the software engine finds an associated node or a node that is not yet determined to be an associated node, ownership percentage from a previous iteration can be used in a subsequent iteration to determine whether the share of ownership meets the specified percentage. If aggregate ownership by one or more sanctioned nodes in a node is less than 50% and there are additional ownership edges that are connected to that node, the node has an undetermined status and is revisited in a subsequent iteration.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Subsequent iterations check other nodes owned by a sanctioned node or associated node (a 50% or more node), determine ownership percentage in those nodes by the sanctioned node or associated node, and determine whether the share of ownership in those nodes meets the specified percentage by including any additional ownership percentage determined in the previous iteration. For example, if a node with an undetermined status is owned in the aggregate by a sanctioned node and another sanctioned node or by a sanctioned node and an associated node, the node with an undetermined status is identified as an associated node (50% or more node) if aggregate ownership by the sanctioned nodes or by the sanctioned node and associated node is 50% or more. One of the ownership percentages may be determined from a previous iteration and another ownership percentage may be determined from a subsequent iteration. For instance, ownership percentage in the node with an undetermined status by one of the sanctioned nodes may be determined from a previous iteration and ownership percentage in the same node by another sanctioned node may be determined from a subsequent iteration. For instance, ownership percentage in the node with an undetermined status by the sanctioned node may be determined from a previous iteration and ownership percentage in the same node by the associated node may be determined from a subsequent iteration. As mentioned above, sanctioned nodes are provided in this example; other nodes of interest or types of node of interest are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>depict illustrative iterations performed by the software engine to determine whether the share of ownership meets the specified percentage. The traversal process starts from sanctioned nodes <b>905</b>, <b>910</b> which are identified from the research graph and the sanctions graph. In the first iteration, the software engine finds that sanctioned node <b>905</b> has ownership in node <b>915</b> (through ownership edge <b>907</b>) and the share of ownership is 20% (from the ownership edge property <b>909</b>). The software engine also finds that node <b>915</b> has another ownership edge <b>917</b>. Since aggregate or total ownership in node <b>915</b> at this moment is less than 50% and there is another ownership edge <b>917</b> to node <b>915</b>, node <b>915</b> has an undetermined status and will be revisited in a subsequent iteration. The determination of whether node <b>915</b> is an associated node is postponed until a later iteration, or until another iteration when the share of ownership by a sanctioned node or associated node through ownership edge <b>917</b> is determined. The software engine further finds that sanctioned node <b>910</b> has ownership in node <b>920</b> and the share of ownership is 95%. Since sanctioned node <b>910</b> owns 50% or more of node <b>920</b>, the software engine identifies node <b>920</b> as an associated node. Therefore, in the first iteration, the software engine discovers node <b>915</b>, and discovers that node <b>915</b> has an undetermined status, and node <b>920</b> is an associated node.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the second iteration, the software engine finds that associated node <b>920</b> has ownership in node <b>915</b> and the share of ownership is 40%. Since aggregate ownership in node <b>915</b> is 60% (20%+40%) after the second iteration, the software engine also identifies node <b>915</b> as an associated node because aggregate ownership in node <b>915</b> is 50% or more (or changes node <b>915</b>'s undetermined status to an associated node status).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The software engine iterates until all relevant nodes have been visited (determined by the specified criterion). It is understood that 50% and other percentages shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>are merely used for illustration purposes only. Other ownership percentages may also be specified. Moreover, other determination procedures and combinations are also contemplated. Furthermore, the software engine can perform more than two iterations to determine whether the share of ownership meets the specified percentage based on the concepts discussed above. A subsequent iteration may refer to an iteration that occurs after the previous iteration concludes or an iteration that occurs after the previous iteration begins (the previous iteration does not necessarily need to end first).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Ownership refers to an entity or individual's ultimate and exclusive rights, conferred by a lawful claim or title, to property. Share of ownership refers to the proportion of rights an entity or individual has to an entity or other property and can be represented in percentage. Share of ownership can be determined by identifying the number of shares the sanctioned node has in the other node, by identifying a title or other information indicating ownership, or by other methods. The system can be configured to receive data with respect to ownership and use that data property in the graph database for the automated analysis. For example, certain public databases or paid research sites may store entity and ownership information and the system can retrieve that information and apply it in the system in the graph database and related features.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The traversal process could also be based on a sanctioned node's ownership or control of another node only, without considering the share of ownership because that information is unknown or not relevant to the data being analyzed. This traversal process may be referred to as the expanded ownership and control method. This method traverses from the sanctioned node and finds nodes in which the sanctioned node has ownership or control without considering the sanctioned node's share of ownership in that node. Expanded ownership or control is determined by whether a node is a unit of the sanctioned node or controlled by the sanctioned node or owned with an unknown ownership percentage by the sanctioned node. Once this traversal method is initiated, the software engine traverses from the sanctioned node through ownership edges, finds nodes connected through ownership and control edges (nodes in which the sanctioned node has ownership and control), and determines whether a node is a unit of, controlled by, or owned by the sanctioned node. Associated nodes identified by this method may be referred to as expanded ownership and control nodes.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The software engine can use additional criteria to perform a traversal process that identifies other types of associations, or risk types, between nodes of interest and associated nodes. The other types of associations or risk types can include identifiers shared between nodes of interest (e.g., sanctioned nodes) and associated nodes, commercial, facilitation, and leadership relationships, and relationships between vessels and their operators. To satisfy the additional criteria, the software engine can also perform traversal processes that include other types of nodes, edges, and properties.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">A criterion that can be set to find associated nodes is the shared identifier criterion. Setting the criterion to find a shared identifier instructs the software engine to perform a traversal process that starts from a node of interest and traverses through any shared identifier nodes and edges. A shared identifier node is a node that represents information identifying both the node of interest and another node, or information shared by both the node of interest and another node. The identifying information in a shared identifier node can include location or contact information such as postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. A shared identifier node may also be referred to as an identifying information node. A shared identifier edge is an edge that leads to a shared identifier node. By visiting a shared identifier node, other nodes using or sharing the same identifying information as the node of interest can also be identified by the software engine. The identified other nodes are associated nodes. For example, after setting the criterion to shared identifier, a particular type of shared identifier can be further selected such as location or postal address. The traversal process starts from a node of interest and traverses through all available location edges and location nodes to reach other nodes connected to location nodes via location edges. The other nodes reached by the traversal process are nodes sharing a location with the node of interest and are identified as associated nodes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a </i></figref>depicts an illustrative result <b>1005</b> upon performing the shared identifier traversal process. The result <b>1005</b> shows that node <b>1005</b><i>b </i>uses or shares the same address <b>1005</b><i>c </i>as node of interest <b>1005</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Other criteria that can be set to find associated nodes include commercial, vessel owners and operators, leadership, and facilitation. The traversal process for each of these criteria is similar to the shared identifier traversal process discussed above and is based on the corresponding edges and nodes of the selected criterion. Other criteria are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">For the commercial criterion, the traversal process relies on commercial edges (e.g., seller, buyer, distributor, vendor, or other commercial relationship) and commercial nodes (e.g., entities or individuals that have commercial activities or do business with others). In some embodiments, the software engine can consider the strength of the commercial edges in deciding whether the commercial nodes should be identified as associated nodes. The strength may be based on a characteristic or property of a commercial edge (e.g., if the commercial edge is vendor, then the commercial edge should be given a higher weight), the number of commercial edges connecting the node of interest and the commercial node, or a combination of factors. Other factors that may be considered in determining the strength include the amount or volume of the transaction (or the number of transactions) between the node of interest and the commercial node. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>depicts an illustrative result <b>1010</b> upon performing the commercial traversal process. The result <b>1010</b> shows that node <b>1010</b><i>c </i>has commercial exposure to sanctioned nodes <b>1010</b><i>a</i>, <b>1010</b><i>b </i>and is identified as an associated node (e.g., because it has sufficient commercial exposure to sanctioned nodes <b>1010</b><i>a</i>, <b>1010</b><i>b </i>based on the strength of the commercial edges).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For the vessel owners-and-operators criterion, the traversal process uses a sanctioned node that represents a vessel as a starting point and traverses through owner or operator edges to find non-sanctioned (associated nodes). Other entities owned by the non-sanctioned nodes (non-sanctioned owner or operator or associated owner or operator) of the vessel node can also be identified. The traversal process can also start with a sanctioned node and identify vessels owned or operated by the sanctioned node. The non-sanctioned nodes found by this traversal process are also identified as associated nodes. A vessel may be a land vehicle, watercraft, aircraft, or other types of vehicles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>c </i></figref>depicts an illustrative result <b>1015</b> upon performing the vessel owners-and-operators traversal process. The result <b>1015</b> shows that sanctioned node <b>1015</b><i>c </i>is owned by node <b>1015</b><i>a </i>and operated by node <b>1015</b><i>b</i>, and nodes <b>1015</b><i>a </i>and <b>1015</b><i>b </i>are identified as associated nodes.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For the illustrated leadership criterion, the traversal process uses a node of interest that is a sanctioned node as a starting point and traverses through leadership edges to find any non-sanctioned nodes led by the sanctioned node, or any non-sanctioned nodes that are leaders of the sanctioned node. In some embodiments, the software engine can consider the strength of the leadership edges in deciding whether the non-sanctioned nodes should be identified. The strength may be based on a characteristic or property of a leadership edge (e.g., boss, subordinate, or colleague of the sanctioned node), the number of leadership edges connecting the sanctioned node and the non-sanctioned node, or a combination of factors. Other factors that may be considered in determining the strength include the type of leadership activities involved between the sanctioned node and the non-sanctioned node (e.g., management level of meeting, causal or formal one-on-one meeting, number of meetings, etc.). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>d </i></figref>depicts an illustrative result <b>1020</b> upon performing the leadership traversal process.

Nodes <b>1020</b><i>c</i>, <b>1020</b><i>d </i>are identified as associated nodes.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For the facilitation criterion, the traversal process uses a node of interest that is a sanctioned node, for illustrative purposes, as a starting point and traverses through any facilitation or support edges to find non-sanctioned nodes. In some embodiments, the software engine can consider the strength of the facilitation edges in deciding whether the non-sanctioned nodes should be identified. The strength may be based on a characteristic or property of a facilitation edge, the number of leadership edges connecting the sanctioned node and the non-sanctioned node, or a combination of factors. Other factors that may be considered in determining the strength include facilitation activities involved between the sanctioned node and the non-sanctioned node. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>e </i></figref>depicts an illustrative result <b>1025</b> upon performing the facilitation traversal process.

The subgraphs allow queries to rapidly recall the results of the traversal processes. The subgraph can also store information about the parameters used by the traversal processes, such as the threshold percentage and edge types used by the software engine in the traversal processes and the threshold percentage and edge types required by the software engine to continue the traversal process. In some embodiments, the results of each of the above traversal processes are stored by assigning labels to non-sanctioned nodes found by the traversal processes and connecting the non-sanctioned nodes to an additional subgraph that stores any additional information. This enables non-sanctioned nodes, or a subset of non-sanctioned nodes identified by the traversal processes, to be recalled automatically.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Another method or traversal process that can be performed by the system to reveal associated nodes is based on community detection. The software engine uses edge betweenness (the community detection method) to identify highly interconnected networks of nodes of interest such as sanctioned nodes. The method finds highly interconnected networks by making partitions to the graph of the nodes of interest. The method performs partitions by calculating edge betweennesses for all the nodes and edges in the graph of the node of interest, determining edges that have a high edge betweenness or that have an edge betweenness in the top 10% (or other specified percentage) of all the determined edge betweennesses, and removing the determined edges from the graph of the sanctioned node. Removing the determined edges divides the graph of the node of interest into subgraphs (or disconnects the graph of the node of interest from within to create subgraphs or to break it into subgraphs). Each resulting subgraph or partition is a highly interconnected network. The betweenness of an edge is calculated by computing the total number of shortest paths between a first node and a second node (first total number), computing the total number of shortest paths between the first node and the second node via the edge for which the betweenness is calculated (second total number), and dividing the first total number by the second total number. The method may employ Girvan-Newman algorithm or other process to perform partition. The method can be configured to perform a desired number of iterations to produce a desired number of partitions, instead of partitioning the entire graph to find all the interconnected networks.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A sanctioned node may have one or more highly interconnected networks. Each highly interconnected network includes a set of highly interconnected nodes and edges. A set of highly interconnected nodes and edges can be referred to as an actor community (e.g., a sanctioned actor community). Each partition containing an actor community is connected to a community subgraph. The community subgraph allows queries that can rapidly recall the results of the community detection method. The community subgraph may also store details pertaining to risk scoring and qualitative descriptions of the community (e.g., as part of a data model). Risk score may be calculated through a variety of ways, including considering number of nodes, node types, number of edges, edge types, edge weights, and properties, or other measure. The community detection method can detect communities in a complex graph (networks of the sanctioned actor) that may not be distinctly shown in or understood from the complex graph (the graph of or overall information about the sanctioned actor). For example, highly interconnected networks in the graph may be intertwined or otherwise combined such that the system or users may not know such networks exist. The community detection method and community subgraph can provide more detail and precise reporting of nodes of interest and associated nodes than is currently possible such as in the field of financial crime and trade compliance based on information governments provide in sanctions lists. The community detection method and community subgraph can also provide information that may not be available from the sanctions list and in a manner that can be easily digested by users. Girvan-Newman algorithm or other partition process can be connected to the community subgraph to update the community subgraph when an iteration is performed. The number of iterations can determine more or less fine-grained partitions in the graph.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A second traversal process can be executed after the community detection method to identify nodes that interact with the actor community. The identified nodes are also nodes that are not nodes of interest (e.g., not on a sanctions list) and that may present financial, trade, or other business-related risk such as financial crimes and sanctions-related risks. For example, the process starts from sanctioned nodes that are members of the community (sanction nodes that are different from the sanctioned node used to find that node's interconnected networks) and traverses through a specific edge type or relationship. For example, the process can traverse via commercial type edges and find actors that are involved in commercial activity with the sanctioned actor community. The process can further consider node types and properties of found nodes in filtering identified nodes. The identified or resulting nodes can be referred to as members of a specific dimension (e.g., commercial dimension) of the sanctioned actor community. These nodes are connected to the community subgraph so queries can rapidly recall the results of this traversal process. The community subgraph also stores details of the identified node's risk score and qualitative descriptions explaining its relationship to the sanctioned actor community. Risk score may be calculated through a variety of ways, including by weighting edges used to identify the node in the specific dimension, degrees of separation from a sanctioned node or the starting sanctioned node (e.g., the starting node in the community detection method), or other measure. As discussed and generally understood, the embodiments to sanctions are also illustrative of embodiments to more generally involves nodes of interest.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The results generated from executing the above methods or traversal processes can be accessed and shown via an interface of the system such as the visual interactive interface in the production environment. For example, a user can input research data and select a criterion, a relationship type, or risk type from the interface (a query). The selection determines the traversal process the system uses to find associated nodes. The interface may provide additional commands (e.g., buttons) for selection after selecting a criterion. For instance, when ownership is selected, the interface may provide an option allowing users to enter a percentage representing a sanctioned node's share of ownership in a non-sanctioned node. After entering the information, the interface would automatically present a graph, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b></figref>, showing, for example, the extent of the financial crimes and sanctions-related risk spreading from the sanctioned node (e.g., nodes that are not on a sanctioned list but are connected to the sanctioned node in some way and may present risk). For example, the sanctioned node may be presented in a location on the visual workspace and some of the associated nodes may be directly connected to the sanctioned node through the selected criterion and some of the associated nodes may be indirectly connected to the sanctioned node via one or more intermediary nodes through the selected criterion, (e.g., nodes that are not on a sanctioned list but are connected to the sanctioned node in some way and may present financial crimes or sanctions-related risk).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As described above, the customer platform may include a visual workspace and interactive tools in communication with the graph database. The visual workspace may be implemented as a stand-alone application executing on a computer system of the customer and accessing the graph database. In some examples, the visual workspace is web-based, e.g., executing on a page of a web browser. In this case, the web server (e.g., in environment <b>120</b>) may access the graph database. The graph database may be configured to store nodes and edges for customers' use in the production environment and store visual graphs produced and saved by customers. In some examples, the interactive tools provide for customers to research and map the commercial, financial, and facilitation networks of nodes of interest and associated actors such as sanctioned or other actors that may be associated with illicit activity, as described above. Furthermore, the interactive tools may be enhanced by subgraphs including nodes of interest and associated nodes as described in the preceding paragraphs. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> illustrates an example visual interactive interface <b>1100</b>. The interface <b>1100</b> includes a visual workspace <b>1110</b> where the user can explore nodes (e.g., individuals, organizations, or other entities) and edges (relationships) between nodes. The interface <b>1100</b> may also include a toolbar <b>1120</b>, allowing the user to quickly access common functions, and a title area <b>1130</b> allowing the user to provide and/or maintain the name of the workspace (e.g., a name associated with or describing the research being performed by the user in the workspace). Using the toolbar <b>1120</b>, the user may save or print the current workspace, recall saved workspaces, create new workspaces, share access to the workspace with others, and so forth. In this way, users may pursue multiple avenues of research in an interleaved or quasi-simultaneous fashion. For example, the user may store one workspace and recall another workspace to continue a previous research initiative. Graphs and/or subgraphs developed using the interface <b>1100</b> may be stored in the graph database. Within the current workspace, the user may identify nodes of interest using a keyword search to find possible matching nodes in the (graph) database. Here, the search capability may be invoked by selecting the search icon <b>1122</b> in the toolbar <b>1120</b> of the visual interactive interface <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">When the user invokes the search capability, the interface <b>1100</b> may present an interactive search form <b>1140</b>. The search form <b>1140</b> may include a keyword input text box <b>1142</b> into which the user may enter keywords or other search terms used by the system to find or &#x201c;surface&#x201d; nodes in the graph (e.g., in the graph database) with properties that match the search terms. Search terms may include names, aliases, descriptions and/or addresses. The search form <b>1140</b> may provide a list <b>1150</b> of identified nodes to the user. Here, the list <b>1150</b> of identified nodes is separated into sub-lists by type of node. The sub-lists include entities (such as business organizations) <b>1152</b>, persons <b>1156</b>, and addresses <b>1158</b>. Other sub-lists or category of nodes may also be shown, including, but not limited to, bank accounts. As shown, the persons sub-list <b>1156</b> and address sub-lists <b>1158</b> are in a collapsed state. In the collapsed state, the sub-list contents are not currently shown, but each sub-list (<b>1156</b>, <b>1158</b>) includes an indicator of the number of items in the list. In this example, there are nine (9) people in the person sub-list <b>1156</b> and one (1) address in the address sub-list <b>1158</b>. The user may selectively expand each list to explore the items in each list surfaced by the search. Here, entity sub-list <b>1152</b> is shown in a partially expanded state. As shown, there are a total of fifty-three (53) entities in the entity sub-list <b>1152</b>, two of which are currently displayed (<b>1153</b><i>a</i>, <b>1153</b><i>b</i>). The user may cause the interface <b>1100</b> to display additional entities by selecting the &#x201c;Show more&#x201d; button <b>1154</b>. The interface <b>1100</b> may indicate the sanctioned status of each entity as a node of interest such as by indicating it to have a sanctioned status, e.g., using an icon or other visual indication. Here, the interface <b>1100</b> displays an entity icon preceding the entity name for each displayed entity <b>1153</b>. If the entity is a node of interest such as being sanctioned or de-listed, the interface <b>1100</b> may also display a warning indication over or adjacent to the entity icon. The interface <b>1100</b> may display information related to items in other expanded sub-lists (e.g., <b>1156</b>, <b>1158</b>) in a similar manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> includes an example list of symbols <b>610</b> that may be used to provide information about a node displayed in a sub-list. Here, neither Entity 1 nor Entity 2 are nodes of interest, sanctioned in this example. The interface <b>1100</b> may display additional details about each identified node in response the user moving the cursor to &#x201c;hover&#x201d; over the displayed entity <b>1153</b>, or otherwise indicating a desire to see more detailed information about the entity.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Even though neither Entity 1 nor Entity 2 are sanctioned in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the user may want to explore whether Entity 1 and/or Entity 2 have a close association with a sanctioned node, or other node of interest in the graph database. The interface <b>1100</b> facilitates exploring and understanding relationships between nodes in the graph. For example, the user may select one or more nodes from the list <b>1150</b> of identified nodes for display in the visual workspace <b>1110</b> of the interface <b>1100</b>. Here, the user may add entities from the entity sub-list <b>1142</b> (such as Entity 1 or Entity 2) by selecting the plus sign (+) displayed to the right of the entity name. Similarly, the user may add people from the persons sub-list <b>1156</b> (after expanding the persons sub-list <b>1156</b> to display identified nodes) by selecting the plus sign (+) displayed to the right of the person name (not shown). As each node is added to the workspace <b>1110</b>, the interface may automatically display connections between the displayed nodes, if such connections are stored in the graph database. The interface <b>1100</b> may facilitate adding nodes to the workspace <b>1110</b> in additional ways, including dragging the corresponding icon from the sub-list to the workspace <b>1110</b>, right clicking on the entity name, etc. In response to the user selection, the interface <b>1100</b> displays a visual graphic representing the selected entities and/or persons (and/or other selected nodes) in the visual workspace <b>1110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrates the example visual interactive interface <b>1100</b> displaying a graphic <b>1170</b> related to the user-selected node corresponding to Entity 1. Here, the visual graphic <b>1170</b> includes an additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> as an indication that node represented by the visual graphic <b>1170</b> (e.g., Entity 1) is identified by one or more defined traversal rules (relying on edge type) applied to the overall graph to have a defined corresponding type of relation to a node of interest (regardless of whether the one or many nodes of interest are currently displayed on workspace or are not displayed but are known in the graph) (discussed in more detail below). This relationship is sometimes herein referred to as &#x201c;closely associated&#x201d; for ease of discussion but it should be understood that the association can involve multiple traversals of edges and nodes between the node in the workspace and the node of interest. For clarification, the term lens is also used below to generally refer to this feature. When the traversal rule is performed, the system can save the subgraph or information representation of the subgraph in correspondence with the specific traversal rule and retrieve for display (adds the corresponding subgraph) in the current visual interface. This allows for informed navigation and quick appreciation of the landscape by itself and also in conjunction with other tools. The interface <b>1100</b> may provide additional information about nodes displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b> and relationships (graph edges) between nodes displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>. Here, the workspace <b>1110</b> includes an inspection area <b>1180</b>. The user may select (or merely hover the cursor over) one of the visual graphics (e.g., <b>1170</b>) displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>, causing the interface <b>1100</b> to display more detailed information about the selected node or relationship in the inspection area <b>1180</b>. Multiple (separate) visual graphic elements such as element <b>1172</b> can be displayed on the visual graphic to communicate that different corresponding lenses exist for that node. The indicators as discussed here are not necessarily limited to lenses.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As described above, the system can find associated nodes by several methods that use a node of interest such as a sanctioned node. The system, through the software engine, can start traversing from a node of interest, such as the sanctioned node, through its connected edges and nodes and finds the associated nodes based on a specified criterion or traversal process. The node of interest, the associated node(s) (meaning those identified through traversal to meet the specified criteria), and the relationship(s) connecting the node of interest and the associated node(s) can be represented and saved as a subgraph according to the type of traversal (e.g., type of relationship or edge) used to identify the associated node(s). In some embodiments, the software engine performs traversals according to predefined criteria. For example, the predefined criteria may be ownership, by a sanctioned node, greater than 50%. Using that criteria, the software engine may recursively traverse connections of a node of interest (the sanctioned node) to find nodes that are at least 50% owned by the node of interest and identify those nodes as associated with the sanctioned node. The software engine may perform the traversal when a sanctioned node is added to the graph, or when a node becomes sanctioned, e.g., when the person or entity appears on a sanctions list or when updates or additions are performed. As described above, the software engine can use additional criteria to perform a traversal process to identify other types of associations, or risk types, between nodes of interest and associated nodes. The types of associations or risk types can include sanctions risk, identifiers shared between sanctioned nodes and associated nodes, commercial, facilitation, and leadership relationships, and relationships between vessels and their operators. To satisfy the additional criteria, the software engine can also perform traversal processes that include other types of nodes, edges, and properties. The result of these traversals may be subgraphs which include the associated nodes and the connections traversed to identify the associated nodes. In some examples, when a node becomes node of interest such as a sanctioned node or similar type of node, the software engine performs traversals according to a number of predefined traversal types and criteria, generates a number of subgraphs, and stores the generated subgraphs (which may include other nodes found by the traversal process to be closely associated with the node of interest, for example, sanctioned node) in the graph database. Subsequently, when a node is displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>, the interface <b>1100</b> may access the graph database to determine whether the displayed node is an associated node in a stored subgraph. As can be understood, an associated node indicates that the traversal rules (in connection for example with a corridor, list, lens, etc.) have identified that node to meet the particular traversal rules with respect to a node of interest. If the displayed node is an associated node, the interface <b>1100</b> may add the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> as an indication that the node represented by the visual graphic <b>1170</b> (e.g., Entity 1) is currently a specified &#x201c;hit&#x201d; from an identification process adapted to identify entities (other than node of interest such as a sanctioned entity) that have an associated risk stemming from relationship directed path to a node of interest such as a sanctioned node (or similar node), as described above. The additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> may also indicate the traversal type. Here, the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> shows a circle which is half filled. The half-filled circle indicates 50% ownership by a sanctioned node as an example.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, users may define specific traversal types and/or criteria to meet specific requirements. For example, a user may want to identify nodes that are at least 50% owned by a node of interest that is not a sanctioned node (e.g., if the user has reason to believe that a node may become a sanctioned node). Or the user may want to identify nodes that are at least 30% (or other value) owned or controlled by a sanctioned node, rather than at least 50% owned by a sanctioned node. In some examples, the software platform allows users to define custom traversal types and/or criteria. The software platform may perform the custom traversals on the graph database and store the resulting subgraphs in the graph database. The software platform may perform custom traversals on demand by the user, or when the graph database is updated. The software platform may provide for the user to manage custom traversal types and/or criteria, e.g., to edit and/or refine the criteria, to selectively enable and disable traversals, etc. Subsequently, when a node is displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>, the interface <b>1100</b> may add the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> as an indication that node represented by the visual graphic <b>1170</b> (e.g., Entity 1) may be closely associated with a node of interest according to a custom traversal. The results generated from executing one or more of above traversal processes, including custom traversal processes, can also be produced in a data export format, suitable to be ingested into another computer system. The data export may include textual and/or alphanumeric node identifiers and other information related to the associated nodes and the traversed edges. The table may be saved as JSON, XML, or comma-separated values (CSVs) or in a spreadsheet format, such as Excel.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> illustrates the example visual interactive interface <b>1100</b> displaying, in the inspection area, detailed information related to Entity 1. Here, the inspection area <b>1180</b> displays detailed information about a node (Entity 1). The inspection area includes a title region <b>1181</b>, a relationship region <b>1182</b>, and a detailed information region <b>1183</b>. The detailed information region <b>1183</b> may include information related to the node including whether the node is a sanctioned person or entity, any notes related to the sanction status of the node, any other property of the node, or annotations applied to the node, and citations to supporting documentation related to the node, the sanction status of the node, properties of the node, etc. The title region <b>1181</b> includes an icon indicating the type of node. Here, the node type is entity. Therefore, the interface displays the entity icon from the list of icons of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The title region <b>1181</b> also includes information that is also displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>, including the name of the node (Entity 1), and the visual graphic element <b>1172</b> indicating that Entity 1 may be closely associated with a node of interest. The relationship region <b>1182</b> provides information related to connections (graph edges) between Entity 1 and other nodes in the graph database. The relationship region <b>1182</b> may indicate the total number of connections (e.g., 28) between Entity 1 and other nodes in the graph database. The relationship region <b>1182</b> may provide separate sub-lists for different types of connections. Here, Entity 1 has one parent relationship with another node (e.g., an entity node), eleven leadership and/or management relationships with other nodes (e.g., persons), ten ownership relationships, and six items of contact information that may match with other nodes in the graph database. The Connections list is shown in an expanded state, showing each sub-list. Each sub-list (parents, management, ownership, support, and contact info) are shown in their respective unexpanded states. The user may expand one or more sub-list to access items contained in each sub-list. The interface <b>1100</b> may facilitate exploring connections between nodes in additional ways. For example, the interface may present a popup dialog in response to the user selecting the visual graphic <b>1170</b> displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>. The popup dialog may allow the user to select individual connections to be displayed in the inspection area <b>1180</b> or elsewhere in the interface <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The relationship region <b>1182</b> may also provide information related to corridors or pathways between Entity 1 and corridor endpoint nodes. As described above, corridors may be automatically added to the production environment when or in response to being found by the software engine <b>135</b>. The interface <b>1100</b> may access the graph database to obtain corridor information, including the corridors from a node (e.g., Entity 1) to a corridor endpoint node. The interface <b>1100</b> facilitates exploring corridors by presenting the list of corridors from the graph database in the relationship region <b>1182</b> of the inspection area <b>1180</b>. Here, Entity 1 has eight associated corridors. That is, in this example, the software engine <b>135</b> found eight pathways from Entity 1 to a node that is identified on a sanctions list (e.g., following the corridor traversal rules described above). As shown, the corridor sub-list is shown in a partially expanded state. Here, one corridor is shown, identified by the name of corridor endpoint node. An icon is also displayed indicating that the sanctioned node is an entity. The user may cause the interface <b>1100</b> to display additional corridors by selecting the &#x201c;Show more&#x201d; button, as described above with respect to the entity sub-list of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. The user may add the displayed corridor endpoint by selecting the plus sign (+) displayed to the right of the endpoint name. In response, the interface <b>1100</b> may display the entire corridor, and may also display connections and intervening nodes between the corridor endpoint and the node displayed in the inspection region <b>1180</b>. The interface <b>1100</b> may facilitate adding corridor endpoints to the workspace <b>1110</b> in additional ways, including dragging the corresponding icon from the corridors sub-list to the workspace <b>1110</b>, right clicking on the corridor endpoint name, etc. In this way, a user may explore relationships between the node identified in a keyword search and sanctioned nodes. The interface may include features to address overcrowding in the workspace <b>1110</b>, e.g., after a user selects several corridors for display, resulting in many nodes and edges being displayed. The interface <b>1100</b> may include a zoom feature, allowing the user to zoom in to view a particular subset of the workspace <b>1110</b>, or to zoom out to view the entire set of nodes and relationships in the workspace <b>1110</b>. The interface <b>1100</b> may include the ability to select individual nodes and/or connections or select groups of nodes and/or connections, e.g., by defining a bounding box or free-form perimeter around the nodes and/or connections to be selected. Furthermore, the interface <b>1100</b> may include a delete function (e.g., in the toolbar) allowing the user to selectively remove nodes and edges from the workspace <b>1110</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref> illustrates the example visual interactive interface <b>1100</b> displaying graphic <b>1170</b><i>a</i>, <b>1170</b><i>b </i>related to nodes corresponding to Entity 1 and Entity 2, respectively. For example, the user may have selected both Entity 1 and Entity 2 from the Entity sub-list of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. In response to displaying graphics <b>1170</b><i>a</i>, <b>1170</b><i>b </i>corresponding to multiple nodes, the interface <b>1100</b> may automatically display an additional graphical element <b>1174</b>, such as a line indicating the relationship between nodes represented by relationship graphics (e.g., <b>1170</b><i>a</i>, <b>1170</b><i>b</i>) displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>. Here, the relationship between Entity 1 and Entity 2 is an ownership relationship. In response to the user causing Entity 1 and Entity 2 to be displayed in the workspace, the interface displays graphical element <b>1174</b> to indicate the ownership relationship (an edge). The relationship graphic <b>1174</b> includes an arrowhead indicating the direction of the relationship and associated text indicating the type of relationship (e.g., ownership) as well as a property or weight of the relationship (e.g., 55%). Here, the arrowhead and text indicate that Entity 1 owns 55% of Entity 2. The relationship graphic <b>1170</b> may display additional information associated with the relationship in various ways. For example, the interface may display the line as a dashed line to indicate a prior relationship. The user may select (or merely hover the cursor over) one of the visual graphics (e.g., relationship graphic <b>1174</b>) displayed in the workspace <b>1110</b>, causing the interface <b>1100</b> to display more detailed information about the selected node or relationship in the inspection area <b>1180</b>. Here, the user has selected the relationship graphic <b>1174</b> between Entity 1 and Entity 2. When the inspection area <b>1180</b> displays relationship information (i.e., information about a relationship between nodes), the inspection area may include a relationship title region <b>1184</b> and a detailed relationship information region <b>1185</b>. The detailed relationship information region <b>1185</b> may include any property of the graph edge or annotation applied to the edge and citations to supporting documentation related to the edge. The system is configured to provide an option in the graphical user interface to retrieve the supporting document in connection with a node or other features and to review the supporting document. As described above with respect to other sub-lists, the sub-lists of the relationship information region <b>1185</b> may be displayed in expanded or collapsed states and may include indication of the number of items in the sub-list. The user may expand one or more sub-lists to access items in the sub-list. The relationship title region <b>1184</b> may include a graphical representation of the edge, the nodes connected by the edge, and additional edge-identifying information. Here, the relationship title region <b>1184</b> includes the names of the connected nodes (Entity 1 and Entity 2), the type of edge (OWNER), properties of the edge, such as direction and percentage ownership, and an additional graphic element (similar to graphical element <b>1172</b>) indicating that Entity 1 may be closely associated with sanctioned nodes.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">As described above, the interface <b>1100</b> may add the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> as an indication that node represented by the visual graphic <b>1170</b> (e.g., Entity 1) may be closely associated with a node of interest (e.g., a sanctioned node). That is, the node represented by the visual graphic is included in a subgraph resulting from one or more traversal processes described above to find nodes that are associated with a node of interest (i.e., nodes that are found by or that satisfy the traversal process). Traversal processes may be referred to as &#x201c;lenses&#x201d; through which associated nodes are &#x201c;seen&#x201d; from the perspective of the node of interest and the complex view created from a graph of nodes of interest and other nodes and edges. To further facilitate exploring the association, the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> may be selectable, allowing the user to access more information about the lens, such as the node of interest, the traversal criteria and process, and the resulting subgraph. In some examples, Lens information is accessible in response to right-clicking on the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> or hovering the cursor over the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> or provided by the interface <b>1100</b> through a menu selection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref> illustrates the example visual interactive interface <b>1100</b> displaying a popup menu <b>1176</b> in response to the user selecting the additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b>. Here, the popup menu <b>1176</b> provides the user with two options. The user may select the &#x201c;Connections&#x201d; option to access connection information associated with Entity 1, similar to the information available in the Connections sub-list of the relationship information region <b>1182</b> described above. These are direct one edge links in the graph extending from that node. The user may also select the &#x201c;lenses&#x201d; option to access lens information. This can include a process to check whether traversal rule is satisfied and retrieve an available subgraph (e.g., involving more than one edge and one node). In some examples, when the user selects the &#x201c;lenses&#x201d; option, the interface displays a second popup menu <b>1177</b>. The second popup menu <b>1177</b> displays all the traversal processes (lenses) that resulted in subgraphs containing the node represented by the visual graphic <b>1170</b> (e.g., <b>1170</b><i>a</i>, Entity 1). Here, Entity 1 is only contained in the &#x201c;&#x3e;50%&#x201d; subgraph (Entity 1 is more than 50% owned by one or more sanctioned nodes). In some examples, a node may be found in multiple lenses. The user may select which of the multiple lenses to explore. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>F</figref>, in response to the user selecting the &#x201c;&#x3e;50%&#x201d; option of the second popup menu <b>1177</b>, the interface <b>1100</b> displays the subgraph in the workspace <b>1110</b>. As discussed earlier, the results of each traversal process can be saved as a subgraph in the system. The subgraphs allow queries to rapidly recall the results of those traversal processes. Variations are contemplated. In response to the user selecting one of the options in second popup menu <b>1177</b>, the system may recall the corresponding subgraph or the applicable nodes from the corresponding subgraph and display the subgraph and/or nodes in the workspace <b>1110</b>. In some examples, the interface <b>1100</b> displays additional nodes and relationships of the subgraph that are not already displayed, and automatically establishes connections between the previously displayed node and the newly displayed nodes. Here, the newly displayed node <b>1170</b><i>c </i>is node of interest. Because, in this example, the node of interest is a sanctioned entity, the interface <b>1100</b> displays the sanctioned entity icon, including a warning sign. The interface <b>1100</b> automatically displays the relationship graphic <b>1174</b><i>b </i>between the visual graphic <b>1170</b><i>a </i>representing Entity 1 and the visual graphic <b>1170</b><i>c </i>representing node of interest. Here, node of interest owns 75% of Entity 1, which is why Entity 1 was found by the &#x201c;&#x3e;50%&#x201d; traversal and included in the &#x201c;&#x3e;50%&#x201d; subgraph. From this configuration, the user may select (or hover over) relationship graphic <b>1174</b><i>b </i>or visual graphic <b>1170</b><i>c</i>, causing the interface <b>1100</b> to display information about the node and or connection in the inspection area <b>1180</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>F</figref>, only one node and one connection are newly displayed in response to user selecting the &#x201c;&#x3e;50%&#x201d; option. However, in other examples, e.g., examples with large subgraphs, selecting the &#x201c;&#x3e;50%&#x201d; option may cause multiple nodes and edges to be displayed as a group in the workspace <b>1110</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>, a larger sub-graph is displayed in response to selecting the &#x201c;&#x3e;50%&#x201d; option. Here, nodes Entity 3 (<b>1170</b><i>d</i>), Entity 4 (<b>1170</b><i>e</i>), and Entity 5 (<b>1170</b><i>f</i>) are displayed in addition to Node of Interest <b>1170</b><i>c</i>. The interface <b>1100</b> automatically placed the nodes in the workspace <b>1110</b> so that the nodes and the relationships (edges) between nodes can be easily viewed, examined, and understood by the user. The subgraph represents nodes found during an ownership traversal of edges of Node of Interest <b>1170</b><i>c </i>and contains all nodes directly or indirectly owned at least 50% by Node of Interest <b>1170</b><i>c</i>. The interface <b>1100</b> displays an additional visual graphic element <b>1172</b> as an indication that the newly added nodes of the subgraph are all at least owned 50% or more by Node of Interest <b>1170</b><i>c</i>. As such, when a user adds a node to the workspace, the system is configured to automatically inform the user of all or some of the pathways between the added node and nodes already displayed in the workspace. This can for example be all paths between existing nodes in the workspace to the node being added or can be subject to a qualification by the system such as adding corridors if one exists between the added node and an existing node in the workspace. This provides an implicit clarification that is beneficial to the user since the user may be adding a corridor along one line of investigation and the addition of the implicit corridor involving other nodes in the workspace can automatically enhance the user's understanding and navigation of the data. The system would check for such related graph content and would then retrieve the graph data and generate the visual representation for example when the node is added to show visually show the other relationship (one or more) when adding a node. This can provide great insight to the user. In some embodiments, the interface generates a shaded or dashed line visualization of these implicit paths and allows the user to decide whether to include in the workspace by user interaction. It should be understood in the figures that &#x201c;entity x&#x201d; or &#x201c;node of interest&#x201d; are used to indicate the actual entity name such as Jane Doe or Acme Corporation. The system can be configured to display a highlight such as a halo on a node of interest when it is displayed in the workspace. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>, node of interest <b>1170</b>C is displayed by the system with such a halo and it is preferably displayed in a contrast color relative to the other elements such as yellow, light blue, or orange. The halo graphic can provide a quick way for the user to know and digest the potential risks arising from the node of interest. By including an indicator automatically on or more nodes of interest (e.g., as part of the lens tool), the user can quickly assess risk. The halo graphic can be adapted to light up the node by way of the color surrounding the node.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The system may be implemented using Internet protocols that make it compatible with web browsers generally available to the public (ubiquitous) so that user can quickly access and engage with the system.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Nodes of interest and their associated nodes such as sanctioned nodes and their associated nodes can be identified through the system. Users can review identified associated nodes through another interface (e.g., another web-based interface that may be different from the one above). Each entry (e.g., each associated node or a group of associated nodes) in the bulk format can be accompanied by a description that explains why the entry was provided (e.g., explaining the associated node or group, the relationship between the associated node or group and the sanctioned node, and other information). Each entry may also have a unique code that can be used to locate the entity or individual in the web-based interface and display relevant information (e.g., information about the associated node or group and other information).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As new information is introduced into the system, such as new sanctions lists or other data additions to the system, the aforementioned methods can be rerun to identify associated nodes of new nodes of interest (e.g., new nodes identified to be a point of interest because it is on a sanctioned list), update associated nodes for existing nodes, and remove existing nodes and their associated nodes. The step of updating associated nodes for existing nodes may include adding new associated nodes, deleting existing associated nodes, or updating information of associated nodes (e.g., entity name has changed), their relationships to the node of interest (e.g., 50% share of ownership in the associated node is owned by the node of interest, instead of 30%), and other information. The differences (e.g., the additions, deletions, and updates) between the old data (before rerunning with the new information) and the new data (after rerunning with the new information) can be made available via the visual interactive interface in the production environment. This information can also be provided in the form of a delta report. The changes and the new data can also be ingested by a customer system for screening, filtering, risk scoring, or other similar systems in customizable bulk format.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">All of the above methods can traverse all the available nodes, edges, and properties (or entire or overall graph) in the system or graph database to identify associated nodes, and, as a result, reveal pertinent information (including indirect relationship information visible from one or more edge types). The system or graph database includes research data and other information entered by analysts or received from other sources. The process of finding associated nodes is based on the selected edge type or risk type. The process of finding associated nodes can further consider other edge types, nodes, and properties.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">It is understood that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>F</figref> are described with respect to a sanctioned node (i.e., the traversal process starts with a sanctioned node and the results are generated for that sanctioned node), those figures and their corresponding descriptions are also applicable to other financial, trade, and business risks such as other types of nodes or nodes of interest (e.g., a node that presents financial crime and sanctions-related risks but does not appear on a sanctions list, or a node or type of node (due to one or more node criteria) that is of interest to the customer such as to investigate ethics and sustainability risks or associations).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">All of the above methods may be performed by the software engine, which is a software component of the system. The traversal process can be implemented sequentially, in parallel, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The system is also customizable or modifiable to provide results based on new risk relationships, to produce new actor communities, to present new risk types from research, business needs, or customer parameters or requirements. New logic and algorithms can be introduced and implemented in the system to perform those and other functions.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The results from the above methods and traversal processes can be generated on demand or live. The results can be generated only when users query a node, instead of pre-generating the results and storing the results in the database waiting for users to access them. The above methods and associated-node identification process can also be performed with no human involvement or with minimum human involvement. For example, the research data may be automatically gathered and populated by the system or other computer systems, the data, such as a sanctions list, may be automatically collected and processed by the system or other computer systems, and the traversal processes between nodes and associated nodes may be automatically performed by the system or other computer systems.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Each of the system <b>100</b>, the production environments, the graph databases, and the subsystems can be implemented on one or more computer systems and be configured to communicate via a network connection. They all may also be implemented on one single computer system. In either situation, the computer system(s) can communicate with customers' client devices. The computer system(s) may also be referred to as servers. It should be understood that variations are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In embodiments of the present invention, the graphical element that is displayed for the navigation tool to access a lens is adapted to be displayed on or over the graphic of the node such as shown in the figures using reference <b>1172</b> or <b>1176</b> (e.g., partially covering the node). The position is implemented so as to intuitively communicate the functional connection between the element and the node. Variations are contemplated such as to display the element floating or immediately adjacent in the visual workspace without the graphic element touching or overlapping with the node but in close proximity (small visual gap that shows association). In some embodiments, the graphic element is not displayed initially when the node is added to the workspace but the interface is configured to allow the user to hover a pointer over or to take some other action such as a right click while the pointer is on or near the node and in response, the interface, displays (adds) the graphical element to the display (e.g., on or over the node). The user can select (e.g., click) on the graphical element to have the subgraph added or have some intermediary step occur. In some embodiments, a text element providing additional information about financial, trade, or other business risk involved may be displayed or selected in conjunction with the graphical element. If there are multiple lenses, the interface can display the lens that resulted in the node receiving the particular categorization (and threshold criteria to a node of interest) and allow the user to select one. In response, the interface is configured to add the corresponding information (e.g., the subgraph) to the workspace. In some respect, the smaller footprint, the fewer clicks (e.g., one or two, short user action, etc.), position of information, and/or automatic addition can provide a better tool in this field. For example, graphs can already be extremely busy and complicated and by way of providing a simple way to navigate with little additional information, the interface can provide improved features to users.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments, the system is configured to perform an inquiry to a database or in combination with a traversal when the system is prompted to the display the graphical element. In other words, the system can be configured to perform an analysis on the current node when for example the user selects to add a node to the workspace or when the user selects an option to see if the node has any lenses. This interrogation and response can be a condition before the interface displays the graphic element. Relatedly, it should be understood that in some embodiments the graph is updated continuously, regularly, or periodically and the current state of graph can cause the status of the nodes in the graph (each node) to change based on the use of the same threshold rules. As such, the lens for example may find node X this week but may not do so some time later due to changes in the graph. Thus, the status of the node is dynamic as the graph changes and is updated and it is automatically passed along to the nodes.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As mentioned, there is a significant volume of information in the field of financial, trade, and business-related risks including sanctions and financial crime compliance and there is a need to solve problems related to the user interface including the display and organization of information to provide a better electronic interactive investigational tool, that is addressed by embodiments of the present invention. For example, there are configurations and operational decisions that can provide a better tool without being too complicated (in use or visual presentation), slow, or overwhelming. The system needs to be able to aid the user and in so doing provide a balance between allowing the user to freely (free style) conduct investigations (interactive use of data) on their own and the flexibility and quickness to find the germane investigational informational content, directions, or research. In general, the configuration and operation of the interactive graphical user interface is important to provide a strong investigation tool that gains broad adoption. In some embodiments, the system is configured to determine whether an identified node (one selected by the user and added to the workspace and is the current focus of the interface) is contained in different categories of subgraphs. The subgraphs can be subgraphs that were previously identified and saved by (for example) the software engine by way of automatically traversing the graph database according to a set of rules and/or criteria. The identification may also be by manual entry by a user into the system such as an insight from a news article. A mix of automatic and manual entry is also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the system may display node <b>1202</b> in a visual interface such as a visual workspace. The system in response to the user's selection of the node is configured to determine by retrieval, a live (current processing) process, or a combination thereof whether the node <b>1202</b> is contained in one or more subgraphs in the graph database (e.g., the full database of collected information in a graph database). The system may in response to user action (e.g., right click of a mouse over node <b>1202</b>), automatically display a menu or list <b>1204</b> of options on or over node <b>1202</b>. This way the user that is using a mouse or other pointing device only needs to move the pointer a short distance to the menu or list <b>1204</b>. The volume of information and options presented, and the interactive feature allow a user such as a bank officer to be able to quickly investigate an individual case, which can a be significant advantage in this field of technology. In this example, the interactive list contains corridors <b>1206</b>, ownership <b>1208</b>, ownership &#x3e;50% <b>1210</b>, insight <b>1214</b>, and research topic <b>1216</b>. The text or a graphic display for each in menu <b>1204</b> can provide information that quickly communicates that node <b>1202</b> has been found to be contained in a subgraph for a communicated reason in the text or graphic for that option (e.g., ownership, insight, military end-use, etc.). Without such leads or automated information retrieval, the user would need to conduct individual step by step additions of nodes or edges (and visual inspection) to potentially find or understand these individual patterns and their corresponding significance. Not only that but they may need to build a graph that extends outward across multiple edges because the significant or linked value may not be evident until a larger series of edges and nodes are added (completed) which would show the indirect risk, for example, five edges away. This may take hours due to potential complexity and size of graphs. A user may not have a way to figure out or determine how far the graph network should be expanded to reach relevant assessments. Connections <b>1212</b> is included in the list and provides the option for next edge or direct connections (immediate relationships to another node), which is the way that the user can otherwise develop the working graph and understand the node better. The other options can typically represent subgraphs (or patterns) involving two or more edges and two or more other nodes, thus a more complex subgraph and pattern of information. Corridors <b>1206</b> have generally been described. Ownership <b>1208</b> when selected can retrieve a subgraph that contains a graph (connected nodes and edges) of the entities that own that entity node <b>1202</b> or shows that entity node <b>1202</b> is an owner of one or more entities downstream. Ownership &#x3e;50 <b>1210</b> is an option that indicates that node <b>1202</b> is owned by at least 50% of ownership by one or more nodes of interest based on a traversal of the graph of ownership edges of node <b>1202</b> (including potentially iterated traversal). Insight <b>124</b> is an option that indicates that node <b>1202</b> is contained in a subgraph prepared in connection with a particular research such as by an analyst, e.g., reflecting information in a news article, that contains node <b>1202</b> in that research. Research topic <b>1216</b> is an option that indicates that the system has saved or determined by way of node traversal in compliance with a set of rules (for a particular research topic) and/or criteria (for a particular research topic) that node <b>1202</b> (or a subgraph that contains node <b>1202</b>) meets the set of rules and/or criteria. The graphic or text for option <b>1216</b> can be informative of the research such as Country X Commercial Entity Human Rights Abuse or Country Y Commercial Entity Military End Use. The labeling can be used for communicating insights. The graph traversal can be configured by the system or a user to adjust for the situation such as from a sanction node or other type of node. In response to the selection of the option, a corresponding subgraph (by retrieving graph data) is displayed in the workspace (node <b>1202</b> is already in the workspace and would not necessarily need to be added) and thus shows the corresponding pattern in the current workspace for visual comprehension and further investigation using the tools and options. The interface can be configured to allow the user to decide on the location where the graph is added and may visually demonstrate such by way of dashed lines or other visual cues when new nodes have direct or potentially indirect paths to one or more displayed nodes.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The system is configured to display the visual element and/or menu/list (for discussion, visual element or visual graphical element) using a graphical representation on the display screen that is configured by the system to be displayed in a location in relation to the identified node to communicate from the viewers perspective that the element is assigned or affiliated with that node such that it is intuitively understood from the physical proximity that the element is displayed to be a related feature of that node. The use of the term displayed &#x201c;on&#x201d; communicates this relationship. This includes graphical relationship when the element touches, overlaps, or is located next to (in close locational association with) the displayed node. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows for example node <b>1300</b> and how element <b>1302</b> or <b>1304</b> is graphically displayed to have the mentioned assignment or affiliation by way of visual relationship. The element <b>1302</b> or <b>1304</b> is applied to be on the node <b>1300</b> (where in some instances the two are in close physical proximity). The element is shown in the upper right side of the node but it could be in other locations. <b>1304</b> shows a menu type option such as a pop up. This can be displayed in response to a right click or some other pointed action in connection with node <b>1300</b>. It can be used in connection with element <b>1302</b> or can be opened by selecting <b>1302</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The system may save created visual graphics in the graph database, load previous created and saved visual graphics <b>1400</b> from the external graph database, and share created visual graphics <b>1400</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. The visual interactive interface may allow users to export created visual graphics and the accompanying information to a particular file format (e.g., PDF, Word, Powerpoint, etc.) for saving or communicating with another computer system. The visual interactive interface also allows the customer to view graphs (subgraphs) or insights. An insight is a specific research for a particular subject or certain relationships that are illustrative, instructive, interesting, or unique. The research can be understood to include automated analysis such as that described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts an illustrative insight <b>1500</b>. The insight <b>1500</b> includes a short summary <b>1505</b> and a visual graphic <b>1510</b> representing the summary <b>1505</b>.

Hardware processor may be, for example, a general-purpose microprocessor.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The computer system also includes a main memory, such as a random-access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor. Main memory also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor. Such instructions, when stored in non-transitory storage media accessible to processor, render computer system into a special-purpose machine that is customized to perform the operations specified in the instructions.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Computer system further includes a read only memory (ROM) or other static storage device coupled to bus for storing static information and instructions for processor. A storage device, such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus for storing information and instructions.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Computer system may be coupled via bus to a display, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus for communicating information and command selections to processor. Another type of user input device is cursor control, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor and for controlling cursor movement on display. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Computer system may implement the techniques described herein using customized hard-wired logic, one or more ASICs or FPGAs, firmware and/or program logic which in combination with the computer system causes or programs computer system to be a special-purpose machine. According to one embodiment, the techniques herein are performed by computer system in response to processor executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory. Such instructions may be read into main memory from another storage medium, such as storage device. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory causes processor to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The term storage media as used herein refers to any non-transitory media that store data and/or instructions that cause a machine to operation in a specific fashion. Such storage media may comprise non-volatile media and/or volatile media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory. Common forms of storage media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, solid state drive, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic data storage medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, NVRAM, any other memory chip or cartridge.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Storage media is distinct from but may be used in conjunction with transmission media. Transmission media participates in transferring information between storage media. For example, transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Various forms of media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid-state drive of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus. Bus carries the data to main memory, from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus. Communication interface provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link that is connected to a local network. For example, communication interface may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, cable modem, satellite modem, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For instance, network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP in turn provides data communication services through the worldwide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the &#x201c;Internet.&#x201d; Local network and Internet both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link and through communication interface, which carry the digital data to and from computer system, are example forms of transmission media.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Computer system can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link and communication interface.
