The first fluid flow may comprise a fluid mixture, such as for example an air flow with entrained matter (such as dust and/or slurry).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Further, the invention relates to a suction line which may be used with such a coupling.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also relates to a machine incorporating such a coupling. More particularly, the machine may feature an extraction apparatus and an internal combustion engine having an exhaust outlet, wherein the coupling is adapted to connect fluid flow from the extraction apparatus and exhaust gas from the engine exhaust, to a suction line for conveying the fluid flow and the exhaust gas away from the machine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention also relates to apparatus incorporating the machine.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following discussion of the background art is intended to facilitate an understanding of the present invention only. The discussion is not an acknowledgement or admission that any of the material referred to is or was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of the application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention has been devised particularly, although not necessarily solely, for use with a machine which is powered by an internal combustion engine and which is operable to perform working operations (such as cutting and chasing) in masonry surfaces such as brickwork and concrete surfaces.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is often necessary to use such a machine within a confined environment such as internally within buildings, trenches and other closed working environments. In such circumstances, exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine is discharged into the closed environment and can accumulate to an extent where the exhaust gas often create hazardous working conditions. It is therefore desirable to remove the exhaust gas from the closed environment. This may be done by conveying the exhaust gas away along a suction line.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, with such a machine, dust and other debris generated by the working operation is typically contained and collected. The dust may be suppressed with a liquid, creating slurry. It is desirable that the slurry created during operation of the machine be controlled by being contained and collected, in order to maintain a clean and safe working environment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In PCT/AU2017/051256 (WO 2018/090086) there is disclosed an extraction apparatus for containing and collecting the dust, typically within a slurry. Ambient air is also drawn into the extraction apparatus, creating a fluid mixture incorporating the dust (typically within a slurry) and any other cutting debris. The fluid mixture is conveyed away along a suction line.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It may be advantageous to connect the outlet of the extraction apparatus and the exhaust outlet of the engine to a common suction line.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention seeks to provide a coupling for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is, however, not necessarily limited to use with an extraction apparatus for containing and collecting dust (typically within a slurry) and any other debris. The invention may have application more broadly in cases in which there is a requirement to deliver a first fluid flow and an exhaust flow to a common suction line.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a coupling for connecting a suction line to a first fluid flow and an exhaust gas flow, the coupling comprising first and second portions, the first portion being adapted to receive an end section of the suction line and the second portion being adapted to cooperate with the first portion for engaging a portion of the end section therebetween, the first portion having an opening for receiving an exhaust outlet configured to deliver an exhaust gas flow into the first portion, wherein engagement of the end section between the first and second portions serves to compress a marginal portion of a side port in the end section of the suction line in registration with the opening in the first portion to establish a fluid seal around the opening.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the engagement of the end section between the first and second portions comprises clamping engagement.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a coupling for connecting a suction line to a first fluid flow and an exhaust gas flow, wherein the suction line comprises an end section having a side port, the coupling comprising first and second portions, and an opening for receiving an exhaust outlet whereby exhaust gas discharging from the exhaust outlet enters a flow path within the first portion, the first and second portions being adapted to engage the end section of the suction line therebetween with side port in registration with the opening, whereby engagement of the end section between the first and second portions compresses a marginal portion of the side wall bounding the port to establish a fluid seal around the opening.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the engagement of the end section between the first and second portions comprises clamping engagement in each of the above aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In each of the above aspects of the invention, the first and second portions may be adapted to be releasably secured together in a manner adapted to clampingly engage the end section of the suction line therebetween.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The coupling according to each of the above aspects of the invention may further comprise a securing means for releasably securing the first and second portions together in a manner adapted to clampingly engage the end section of the suction line therebetween</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In each of the above aspects of the invention, the first portion may be configured as a tube having a side wall and two opposed ends, wherein the opening for receiving the exhaust gas outlet is provided in the side wall.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The opening in the side wall may be disposed between and spaced inwardly from the two opposed ends.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One end of the tube may be configured to receive a delivery line for the first fluid flow, and the other end may be configured to receive the end section of the suction line, wherein the delivery line communicates with the suction line via a flow path in the tube.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In each of the above aspects of the invention, the second portion may comprise a cradle for receiving the first portion (e.g. the tube).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The exhaust outlet may extend from the second portion (e.g. the cradle), wherein the exhaust outlet is received within the first portion (e.g. the tube) when the first and second portions are mounted together.

The extraction apparatus <b>23</b> is adapted to contain dust and other debris generated during operation of the cutting apparatus <b>11</b>, as well as slurry formed from the dust, and to facilitate extraction of the dust, other debris and slurry as a fluid flow under the influence of suction. The fluid flow also comprises air drawn into the extraction apparatus from ambient air at the work site. Accordingly, the fluid flow may comprise a fluid mixture of air, dust, other debris, and/or slurry.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The extraction apparatus <b>23</b> has an outlet <b>25</b> through which the fluid mixture is drawn under the influence of suction.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The extraction apparatus may, for example, comprise apparatus as disclosed in PCT/AU2017/051256 (WO 2018/090086), the content of which are incorporated herein by way of reference.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A suction line <b>31</b> communicating with a suction source <b>32</b> is arranged to provide requisite suction for extraction of the dust, other debris and slurry from the extraction apparatus <b>23</b>, and also for extraction of exhaust gas discharging from the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> of the muffler <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The suction line <b>31</b> comprises a suction hose <b>33</b> having an end section <b>34</b> terminating at end <b>35</b>, and a side port <b>36</b> extending through the side wall <b>37</b> of the hose inwardly of the end <b>35</b>. The side port <b>36</b> comprises a hole <b>38</b> formed in the side wall <b>37</b>, thereby providing a marginal portion <b>39</b> of the side wall around the hole <b>38</b>. The marginal portion <b>39</b> thus bounds the side port <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The suction hose <b>33</b> may comprise a silicone rubber hose, although other suitable hoses are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Coupling <b>40</b> is provided to communicate fluid flow from the extraction apparatus <b>23</b> (typically a fluid mixture comprising air, other debris, dust and/or slurry, as mentioned above) and exhaust gas from the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> of the muffler <b>15</b>, with the suction line <b>31</b>. In this way, the suction line <b>31</b> can carry the fluid flow and the exhaust gas away from the working environment in which the cutting machine <b>12</b> is operating (for subsequent disposal).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is desirable that the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> of the muffler <b>15</b>, as well as the discharging exhaust gas, be cooled to an extent such as to not cause heat damage to the suction hose <b>33</b>. Accordingly, a cooling means <b>41</b> for cooling of the exhaust outlet <b>16</b>, and more particularly that portion of the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> receivable within the coupling <b>40</b>. In the arrangement shown, the cooling means <b>41</b> comprises a water jacket <b>43</b> fitted around the pipe <b>17</b> of the exhaust outlet <b>16</b>. The water jacket has a water inlet <b>45</b> and a water outlet <b>47</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The exhaust gas is also cooled using the cooling effects of the fluid flow from the extraction apparatus <b>23</b>, with which the exhaust gas mixes within the coupling <b>40</b>, as will become apparent later. The cooling effects of the fluid flow from the extraction apparatus <b>23</b> arise because of the presence of air and water in the fluid mixture which constitutes the fluid flow. It is notable also that in mixing with the exhaust gas in the coupling <b>40</b>, the fluid flow from the extraction apparatus <b>23</b> also dilutes the exhaust gas (predominately due to the air within the fluid mixture which constitutes the fluid flow).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The coupling <b>40</b> comprises first and second portions <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> adapted to clampingly engage the end section <b>34</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> therebetween. The coupling <b>40</b> further comprises securing means <b>53</b> for releasably securing the first and second portions <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> together in a manner adapted to clampingly engage the end section <b>34</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The first portion <b>51</b> comprises a tube <b>54</b> having a side wall <b>55</b> and two opposed ends <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>. The side wall <b>55</b> has an outer surface <b>58</b>, a portion <b>58</b><i>a </i>of which presents an inner clamping face <b>59</b> intermediate the two ends <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>. The interior of the tube <b>54</b> defines a flow passage <b>61</b> which extends between the two ends <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>. An opening <b>63</b> is provided within that portion <b>58</b><i>a </i>of the side wall <b>55</b> which presents an inner clamping face <b>59</b>. The opening <b>63</b> is configured to receive the pipe <b>17</b> of the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> and the associated water jacket <b>43</b>, including the water inlet <b>45</b> (as will be explained in more detail later).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">End <b>56</b> of tube <b>54</b> is adapted to receive the end section <b>34</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b>, with the opening <b>63</b> in the tube <b>54</b> registering with the side port <b>36</b> in the suction hose <b>33</b> (as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The end <b>56</b> of tube <b>54</b> receives the end section <b>34</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> by the end section <b>34</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> being positioned over end <b>56</b> of the tube <b>54</b>. In other words, the end <b>56</b> of the tube <b>54</b> is received within the suction hose <b>33</b>. In this way, the suction hose <b>33</b> communicates with flow passage <b>61</b> within the coupling <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">End <b>57</b> of tube <b>54</b> is adapted to be connected to an outlet <b>25</b> of the extraction apparatus <b>23</b>. With this arrangement, suction induced by suction hose <b>33</b> has the effect of generating a fluid flow through the outlet <b>25</b>, conveying air, dust and/or slurry from the extraction apparatus <b>23</b> as a fluid mixture to flow passage <b>61</b> within the coupling <b>40</b>. In other words, the suction hose <b>33</b> communicates with the outlet <b>25</b> of the extraction apparatus <b>23</b> to provide the requisite suction effect at the outlet <b>25</b> to generate fluid flow through the outlet <b>25</b> (as described).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In practical terms, the tube <b>54</b> and the end section <b>34</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> together provide an assembly <b>65</b>. The assembly <b>65</b> has a lateral port <b>67</b> defined by the opening <b>63</b> in the tube <b>54</b> and the side port <b>36</b> in the suction hose <b>33</b> being in registration, as previously described.)</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The second portion <b>52</b> comprises a cradle <b>71</b> for receiving the tube <b>54</b>. More particularly, the cradle <b>71</b> is configured to receive the assembly <b>65</b> (i.e. the end section <b>35</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b>, with the tube <b>54</b> received within the end section <b>35</b>).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The cradle <b>71</b> presents a surface <b>73</b> which provides an outer clamping face <b>75</b>. An opening <b>77</b> is provided within the cradle <b>71</b> to accommodate the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> and the water jacket <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The cradle <b>71</b> is mounted on the muffler <b>15</b>, with the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> and the water jacket <b>43</b> extending through the opening <b>77</b> and beyond the outer clamping face <b>75</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>. With this arrangement, the water jacket <b>43</b> isolates the hot exhaust outlet <b>16</b> (and in particular the exhaust pipe <b>17</b>) from the cradle <b>71</b> and also from the end section <b>35</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> (when received on the cradle).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The cradle <b>71</b> may be secured to the muffler <b>15</b> in any appropriate way, such as by spot welding.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The cradle <b>71</b> is configured to receive the assembly <b>65</b>, with the assembly <b>65</b> being presented to the cradle in a manner such that the lateral port <b>67</b> of the assembly is aligned with and receives the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> and the water jacket <b>43</b>. With this arrangement, the end section <b>35</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> is disposed between the tube <b>54</b> and the cradle <b>71</b>. More particularly, end section <b>35</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> is disposed between the outer clamping face <b>75</b> defined by the cradle <b>71</b> and the inner clamping face <b>59</b> defined by the tube <b>54</b>. Further, the exhaust pipe <b>17</b> of the exhaust outlet <b>15</b> opens onto the interior of the tube <b>54</b> so as to communicate with the flow passage <b>61</b> for discharging exhaust gas into the flow passage. The outer end section <b>18</b> of the exhaust pipe <b>17</b> is configured to direct exhaust gas in direction towards the suction hose <b>34</b>. In this way, the discarding exhaust gas is introduced into the flow passage to flow in a direction corresponding to fluid flow induced in the flow passage from end <b>57</b> to end <b>56</b> by a suction effect created by the suction hose <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">With the end section <b>35</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> disposed between the outer clamping face <b>75</b> defined by the cradle <b>71</b> and the inner clamping face <b>59</b> defined by the tube <b>54</b>, the marginal portion <b>39</b> bounding the side port <b>36</b> in the end section <b>34</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> undergoes compression when the inner and outer clamping faces <b>59</b>, <b>75</b> are drawn together by the action of the securing means <b>53</b>. Because of the inherent flexible nature of the suction hose <b>33</b> (and particularly so in this embodiment in which the suction hose comprises silicone rubber), the compression establishes a fluid seal around the opening <b>63</b> in the tube <b>54</b>. In other words, the compression establishes a fluid seal between the cradle <b>71</b> and the tube <b>54</b> around the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> and the water jacket <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, the securing means <b>53</b> comprises a retaining plate <b>91</b> attached to the cradle <b>71</b> by way of clip <b>93</b> and tab <b>95</b>. The retaining plate is connected to the tab <b>95</b> by way of retaining bolt <b>97</b>. With this arrangement, the retaining plate <b>91</b> can be either removed or tightened (to increase the compression of the end section <b>35</b> of the suction hose <b>33</b> disposed between the outer clamping face <b>75</b> and the inner clamping face <b>59</b>).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As alluded to above, water inlet <b>45</b> is accommodated within the interior of tube <b>54</b> when the assembly <b>65</b> is mounted on the cradle <b>71</b>. In this way, a water supply line (not shown) for delivering water to the inlet <b>45</b> can be accommodated within and extend along the interior of suction hose <b>43</b>. Accommodating the water supply line within the confines of the suction hose <b>31</b> is advantageous, as it avoids the presence of a further exposed hose at the work site requiring additional handling and also potentially presenting a safety hazard.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The water outlet <b>47</b> is located exteriorly of the tube <b>54</b>. The water outlet <b>47</b> may communicate with a water supply arrangement for the extraction apparatus <b>23</b>; that is, water for injection into the extraction apparatus <b>23</b> for dust control and to generate slurry is derived from the water outlet <b>47</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The opening <b>63</b> is configured to receive the pipe <b>17</b> of the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> and the associated water jacket <b>43</b>, including the water inlet <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, there is shown a second embodiment of coupling <b>40</b>, in which the securing means <b>53</b> is configured as two pipe clamps <b>99</b> operable to releasable secure the assembly <b>65</b> to the second portion <b>52</b> (i.e. cradle <b>71</b>).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">From the foregoing, it is evident that each embodiment of coupling <b>40</b> provides a simple yet highly effective way of connecting the suction line <b>31</b> for extraction of the dust and slurry from the extraction apparatus <b>23</b> and also extraction of exhaust gas discharging from the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> of the muffler <b>15</b>. Further, the coupling <b>40</b> can be readily detached to provide access to the exhaust outlet <b>15</b> as might be necessary. This is considered to be advantageous; for example, in the event of the exhaust outlet <b>15</b> requiring servicing to remove any slurry accumulation which might clog or restrict exhaust gas flow.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Detachment of the coupling <b>40</b> simply requires that the securing means <b>53</b> be released, thereby allowing the assembly <b>65</b> to be moved sidewardly out of the cradle <b>71</b>. As the assembly <b>65</b> is removed from the cradle <b>71</b>, the lateral port <b>67</b> withdraws from around the exhaust outlet <b>16</b> and the water jacket <b>43</b>.
