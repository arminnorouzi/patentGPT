For instance, a fan blade might strike a bird that is ingested into the engine, or a blade-out occurrence may arise wherein one of the fan blades is severed from a rotor disk. If the impact is large enough, a fan blade may break apart into one or more shards before traveling downstream through the engine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gas turbine engines, such as turbofans, generally include fan cases surrounding a fan assembly including the fan blades. Fan cases generally include frangible structures, such as honeycombs or trench-filler material, configured to mitigate load transfer to and through the fan case. However, this approach is costly and may result in larger, heavier, less efficient fan cases. Still further, this approach may not address issues relating to fan rotor unbalance following deformation or liberation of one or several airfoils such as fan blades.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, there is a need for an airfoil that enables a controlled and consistent failure mode of the airfoil that may enable reducing a cost, weight, and load transfer to a surrounding casing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present subject matter is directed to an airfoil defining a span extending in a spanwise direction between a root and a tip; a chordwise direction extending between a leading edge and a trailing edge; a thickness direction extending between a pressure side and a suction side; and a frangible line at a location along the span. The airfoil includes a frangible airfoil portion extending between the leading edge and the trailing edge and extending along the span between the tip and the frangible line. The frangible airfoil portion comprises a first plurality of composite plies, one or more of the first plurality of composite plies having fibers defining a first fiber modulus. The airfoil includes a residual airfoil portion extending along the span from the frangible line to the root. The residual airfoil portion comprising a second plurality of composite plies having fibers defining a second fiber modulus, wherein the second fiber modulus is greater than the first fiber modulus, wherein the residual airfoil portion meets the frangible airfoil portion at the frangible line.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, the present subject matter is directed to a gas turbine engine defining a central axis. The gas turbine engine includes an engine shaft extending along the central axis, a compressor attached to the engine shaft and extending radially about the central axis, a combustor positioned downstream of the compressor to receive a compressed fluid therefrom, a turbine mounted on the engine shaft downstream of the combustor to provide a rotational force to the compressor, and a plurality of airfoils operably connected to the engine shaft. Each of the plurality of airfoils defines a span extending in a spanwise direction between a root and a tip, a chordwise direction extending between a leading edge and a trailing edge, and a thickness direction extending between a pressure side and a suction side.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each includes a frangible airfoil portion extending between the leading edge and the trailing edge and extending between the tip and a frangible line along the span. The frangible airfoil portion includes a first plurality of composite plies having fibers including a first fiber modulus. Each airfoil further includes a residual airfoil portion extending from the frangible line to the root along the span. The residual airfoil portion includes a second plurality of composite plies. The second plurality of composite plies includes fibers having a second fiber modulus. The second fiber modulus is greater than the first fiber modulus. Further, the residual airfoil portion meets the frangible airfoil portion at the frangible line. It should be further understood that the gas turbine engine may further include any of the additional features as described herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the present subject matter is directed to a method of forming a frangible airfoil. The frangible airfoil defines a span extending in a spanwise direction between a root and a tip, a chordwise direction extending between a leading edge and a trailing edge, and a thickness direction extending between a pressure side and a suction side. The method includes laying up a plurality of composite plies to form a residual airfoil portion. The plurality of composite plies includes at least one composite ply with fibers oriented along the spanwise direction. The method further includes laying up a plurality of composite plies to form a frangible airfoil portion. The plurality of composite plies forming the frangible airfoil portion have fibers that are oriented at least partially along the chordwise direction, the thickness direction, or both. Another step of the method includes processing the plurality of composite plies to form the frangible airfoil. It should be further understood that the method may further include any of the additional features as described herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features, aspects and advantages will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.

Additionally, unless specifically identified otherwise, all embodiments described herein should be considered exemplary.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A frangible airfoil for gas turbine engines is generally provided. The airfoil may define a frangible line separating a frangible airfoil portion and a residual airfoil portion. The residual airfoil portion may extend between the frangible line and an airfoil root along a span. Further, the airfoil may define the frangible airfoil portion extending between the frangible line and the tip along the span. The frangible airfoil portion positioned radially outward from the frangible line may include a reduced bending stiffness such that the frangible airfoil portion may break-off or bend during a failure mode of the airfoil. More particularly, the residual airfoil portion may include at least one composite ply with fibers oriented along a spanwise direction to increase the bending stiffness along the span. The frangible airfoil portion may include composite plies having fibers oriented at least partially along a chordwise direction of the airfoil, a thickness direction of the airfoil, or both, such that the frangible airfoil defines a reduced bending stiffness along the span. The embodiments generally shown and described herein may enable a controlled and consistent failure of the airfoil, such as a fan blade, following a failure event, such as a hard rub against a surrounding fan case. The embodiments generally described herein enable the airfoil to deform or detach at a desired span of the airfoil to mitigate load transfer to a surrounding casing. The embodiments generally provided herein may further enable the airfoil to deform or detach such that excessive or extreme unbalance of the fan rotor may be reduced following a failure event, such as airfoil liberation, foreign object damage (e.g., bird strikes, icing, etc.), or loss of lube or damper to a bearing assembly.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Advantageously, by incorporating smaller modulus fibers and/or a lower modulus resin in the frangible airfoil portion, the overall damping effects of the engine during a fan blade out (FBO) event can be modified. For example, utilizing the smaller modulus fibers and/or lower modulus resin allows for failure of the airfoil such that overall loads for the engine are reduced during a FBO event. Accordingly, modification of the modulus values for the fibers and resins utilized in the frangible airfoil portion can tune the damping and can result in an advantage for the overall system load on the engine and can facilitate reducing the overall weight of the engine.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a gas turbine engine <b>10</b> that may be utilized within an aircraft in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. More particularly, for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the gas turbine engine is a high-bypass turbofan jet engine, with the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> being shown having a longitudinal or axial centerline axis <b>12</b> extending therethrough along an axial direction A for reference purposes. The gas turbine engine <b>10</b> further defines a radial direction R extended from the centerline <b>12</b>. Although an exemplary turbofan embodiment is shown, it is anticipated that the present disclosure can be equally applicable to turbomachinery in general, such as an open rotor turbofan engine (e.g., a turbofan without an outer nacelle), a turboshaft, turbojet, or a turboprop configuration, including marine and industrial turbine engines and auxiliary power units.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> includes a turbomachine <b>14</b> and a fan section <b>16</b> positioned upstream thereof. The turbomachine <b>14</b> generally includes a substantially tubular outer casing <b>18</b> that defines an annular inlet <b>20</b>. In addition, the outer casing <b>18</b> may further enclose and support a low pressure (LP) compressor <b>22</b> for increasing the pressure of the air that enters the turbomachine <b>14</b> to a first pressure level. A multi-stage, axial-flow high pressure (HP) compressor <b>24</b> may then receive the pressurized air from the LP compressor <b>22</b> and further increase the pressure of such air. The pressurized air exiting the HP compressor <b>24</b> may then flow to a combustor <b>26</b> within which fuel is injected into the flow of pressurized air, with the resulting mixture being combusted within the combustor <b>26</b>. The high energy combustion products are directed from the combustor <b>26</b> along the hot gas path of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> to a high pressure (HP) turbine <b>28</b> for driving the HP compressor <b>24</b> via a high pressure (HP) shaft <b>30</b> or spool, and then to a low pressure (LP) turbine <b>32</b> for driving the LP compressor <b>22</b> and fan section <b>16</b> via a low pressure (LP) shaft <b>34</b> or spool that is generally coaxial with HP shaft <b>30</b>. After driving each of turbines <b>28</b> and <b>32</b>, the combustion products may be expelled from the turbomachine <b>14</b> via an exhaust nozzle <b>36</b> to provide propulsive jet thrust.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, the fan section <b>16</b> of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> generally includes a rotatable, axial-flow fan rotor <b>38</b> configured to be surrounded by an annular fan casing <b>40</b>. In particular embodiments, the LP shaft <b>34</b> may be connected directly to the fan rotor <b>38</b>, such as in a direct-drive configuration. In alternative configurations, the LP shaft <b>34</b> may be connected to the fan rotor <b>38</b> via a speed reduction device <b>37</b> such as a reduction gear gearbox in an indirect-drive or geared-drive configuration. Such speed reduction devices may be included between any suitable shafts/spools within the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> as desired or required.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the fan casing <b>40</b> may be configured to be supported relative to the turbomachine <b>14</b> by a plurality of substantially radially-extending, circumferentially-spaced outlet guide vanes <b>42</b>. As such, the fan casing <b>40</b> may enclose the fan rotor <b>38</b> and its corresponding fan rotor blades (fan blades <b>44</b>). Moreover, a downstream section <b>46</b> of the fan casing <b>40</b> may extend over an outer portion of the turbomachine <b>14</b> so as to define a secondary, or by-pass, airflow conduit <b>48</b> that provides additional propulsive jet thrust.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">During operation of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b>, it should be appreciated that an initial airflow (indicated by arrow <b>50</b>) may enter the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> through an associated inlet <b>52</b> of the fan casing <b>40</b>. The air flow <b>50</b> then passes through the fan blades <b>44</b> and splits into a first compressed air flow (indicated by arrow <b>54</b>) that moves through the by-pass conduit <b>48</b> and a second compressed air flow (indicated by arrow <b>56</b>) which enters the LP compressor <b>22</b>. The pressure of the second compressed air flow <b>56</b> is then increased and enters the HP compressor <b>24</b> (as indicated by arrow <b>58</b>). After mixing with fuel and being combusted within the combustor <b>26</b>, the combustion products <b>60</b> exit the combustor <b>26</b> and flow through the HP turbine <b>28</b>.

Although the illustrated airfoils <b>62</b> are shown as part of a fan blade <b>44</b>, it is understood that the following discussion of an airfoil <b>62</b> may be equally applied to another airfoil embodiment, e.g., a stator vane or rotor blade of a compressor <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and/or turbine <b>28</b>, <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The outer casing <b>18</b>, LP compressor <b>22</b>, and outlet guide vanes <b>42</b> are also shown. As noted, during operation of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b>, an initial airflow (indicated by arrow <b>50</b>) enters the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> through an associated inlet <b>52</b> of the fan casing <b>40</b>. The air flow <b>50</b> then passes through the fan blades <b>44</b>. Optionally, each fan blade <b>44</b> includes an integral component having an axial dovetail <b>76</b> leading to a transition section <b>80</b>. When mounted within the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> the axial dovetail <b>76</b> is disposed in a dovetail slot of the fan rotor disk <b>39</b>, thereby attaching the fan blades <b>44</b> to the fan rotor <b>38</b>. Each fan blade <b>44</b> extends radially outwardly from an airfoil root <b>64</b> to an airfoil tip <b>66</b>. The airfoil includes a residual airfoil portion <b>92</b> and a frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b> that meet at the frangible line <b>88</b>.

Events generating substantial unbalance in the fan rotor <b>38</b> and/or LP shaft <b>34</b> may include, but are not limited to, foreign object damage (e.g., bird strikes, ice ingestion, other debris, etc.) or fan blade <b>44</b> detachment. Deformation of the frangible airfoil potion <b>94</b> may reduce undesired unbalance or vibrations as the fan rotor <b>38</b> and/or LP shaft <b>34</b> continue to rotate. Further, delamination of the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b> can occur during light rub conditions, e.g. cross wind, or under medium rub conditions, e.g. bird impact. Inclusion of the composite plies having a first fiber modulus described herein, can help prevent material loss of the tip <b>66</b> during certain conditions that can achieve controlled fan rubs.

For example, the composite plies <b>82</b> may be arranged end-to-end and fixed during a process to finish forming the composite component. In other embodiments, the composite plies <b>82</b> may be adhered or coupled together. Further, in one embodiment, composite plies may be joined together using one or more overlap joints. In certain embodiments, one or more butt joints may be used to join the composite plies <b>82</b> together.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In certain embodiments, the first plurality of composite plies including fibers <b>100</b> having a first fiber modulus may define a portion of the airfoil <b>62</b> with a first overall bending stiffness. Similarly, the residual airfoil portion <b>92</b> may define a portion of the airfoil <b>62</b> with a second overall bending stiffness. The first overall bending stiffness of the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b> may be less than the second overall bending stiffness of the residual airfoil portion <b>92</b>. In certain embodiments, use of fibers <b>100</b> having a smaller fiber modulus as compared to fibers <b>101</b> having a larger fiber modulus, decreases the first overall bending stiffness of the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b> relative to the residual airfoil portion <b>92</b>. Furthermore, the composite plies, including the first plurality of plies <b>86</b> and/or the second plurality of plies <b>90</b>, can be oriented to provide increased or decreased bending stiffness in certain directions for either the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b> and/or of the residual airfoil portion. For example, generally, composite plies <b>82</b> define an increased bending stiffness in the direction the fibers <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> are oriented. As such, orienting the first plurality of composite plies <b>86</b> in the spanwise direction S, can decrease overall bending stiffness along the spanwise direction S. The same is true for the chordwise direction C and thickness direction T. Accordingly, in order to achieve the desired decrease in bending stiffness for the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b>, plies <b>86</b> including fibers <b>100</b> can be incorporated in the spanwise direction S, the chordwise direction C, and/or the thickness direction T, in order to achieve the desired bending stiffness for each direction of the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b>. Similarly, the second plurality of composite plies <b>90</b> can be included and oriented in the chordwise direction C, the spanwise direction S, and the thickness direction T, to achieve the desired bending stiffness for the residual airfoil portion <b>92</b> in each direction. Thus, the second plurality of plies <b>90</b> can be oriented in a number of configurations in order to provide a residual airfoil portion <b>92</b> having increased bending stiffness in the spanwise direction S, the chordwise direction C, and/or the thickness direction T, as compared to the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As discussed, the airfoil <b>62</b>, the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b>, and/or residual airfoil portion <b>92</b> may include at least one composite ply <b>82</b>, including plies from a first plurality of composite plies <b>86</b> and a second plurality of composite plies <b>90</b>. The described plies can be incorporated into an airfoil <b>62</b> that is formed, at least partially, from a ceramic matrix composite. More particularly, in certain embodiments, the airfoil <b>62</b> may be formed from one or more composite plies <b>82</b> configured as ceramic matrix composite prepreg plies.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Composite materials may include, but are not limited to, metal matrix composites (MMCs), polymer matrix composites (PMCs), or ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). Composite materials, such as may be utilized in the airfoil <b>62</b>, generally comprise a fibrous reinforcement material embedded in matrix material, such as polymer, ceramic, or metal material. The reinforcement material serves as a load-bearing constituent of the composite material, while the matrix of a composite material serves to bind the fibers together and act as the medium by which an externally applied stress is transmitted and distributed to the fibers.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Exemplary CMC materials may include silicon carbide (SiC), silicon, silica, or alumina matrix materials and combinations thereof. Ceramic fibers may be embedded within the matrix, such as oxidation stable reinforcing fibers including monofilaments like sapphire and silicon carbide (e.g., Textron's SCS-6), as well as rovings and yarn including silicon carbide (e.g., Nippon Carbon's NICALON&#xae;, Ube Industries' TYRANNO&#xae;, and Dow Corning's SYLRAMIC&#xae;), alumina silicates (e.g., Nextel's <b>440</b> and <b>480</b>), and chopped whiskers and fibers (e.g., Nextel's <b>440</b> and SAFFIL&#xae;), and optionally ceramic particles (e.g., oxides of Si, Al, Zr, Y, and combinations thereof) and inorganic fillers (e.g., pyrophyllite, wollastonite, mica, talc, kyanite, and montmorillonite). For example, in certain embodiments, bundles of the fibers, which may include a ceramic refractory material coating, are formed as a reinforced tape, such as a unidirectional reinforced tape. A plurality of the tapes may be laid up together (e.g., as the composite plies <b>82</b>) to form a preform component. The bundles of fibers may be impregnated with a slurry composition prior to forming the preform or after formation of the preform. The preform may then undergo thermal processing, such as a cure or burn-out to yield a high char residue in the preform, and subsequent chemical processing, such as melt-infiltration with silicon, to arrive at a component formed of a CMC material having a desired chemical composition.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Similarly, in various embodiments, PMC materials may be fabricated by impregnating a fabric or unidirectional tape with a resin (prepreg), followed by curing. For example, multiple layers of prepreg plies (e.g., the composite plies <b>82</b>) may be stacked to the proper thickness and orientation for the part, and then the resin may be cured and solidified to render a fiber reinforced composite part. As another example, a die may be utilized to which the uncured layers of prepreg may be stacked to form at least a portion of the composite component. The die may be either a closed configuration (e.g., compression molding) or an open configuration that utilizes vacuum bag forming. For instance, in the open configuration, the die forms one side of the blade (e.g., the pressure side <b>68</b> or the suction side <b>70</b>). The PMC material is placed inside of a bag and a vacuum is utilized to hold the PMC material against the die during curing. In still other embodiments, the airfoil <b>62</b> may be at least partially formed via resin transfer molding (RTM), light resin transfer molding (LRTM), vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM), a forming process (e.g. thermoforming), or similar.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Prior to impregnation, the fabric may be referred to as a &#x201c;dry&#x201d; fabric and typically comprises a stack of two or more fiber layers. The fiber layers may be formed of a variety of materials, non-limiting examples of which include carbon (e.g., graphite), glass (e.g., fiberglass), polymer (e.g., Kevlar&#xae;) fibers, and metal fibers. Fibrous reinforcement materials can be used in the form of relatively short chopped fibers, generally less than two inches in length, and more preferably less than one inch, or long continuous fibers, the latter of which are often used to produce a woven fabric or unidirectional tape. Other embodiments may include other textile forms such as plane weave, twill, or satin.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, PMC materials can be produced by dispersing dry fibers into a mold, and then flowing matrix material around the reinforcement fibers. Resins for PMC matrix materials can be generally classified as thermosets or thermoplastics. Thermoplastic resins are generally categorized as polymers that can be repeatedly softened and flowed when heated and hardened when sufficiently cooled due to physical rather than chemical changes. Notable example classes of thermoplastic resins include nylons, thermoplastic polyesters, polyaryletherketones, and polycarbonate resins. Specific examples of high performance thermoplastic resins that have been contemplated for use in aerospace applications include polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), polyetherimide (PEI), and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS). In contrast, once fully cured into a hard rigid solid, thermoset resins do not undergo significant softening when heated but, instead, thermally decompose when sufficiently heated. Notable examples of thermoset resins include epoxy, bismaleimide (BMI), and polyimide resins.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the airfoils disclosed herein can include a first resin in the frangible airfoil portion <b>94</b> and a second resin in the residual airfoil portion <b>92</b>. Indeed, the first resin can have a lower modulus of elasticity as compared to the second resin.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a method <b>200</b> of forming a frangible airfoil is depicted according to aspects of the present subject matter. Particularly, the method <b>200</b> may be used to form various embodiments of the airfoil <b>62</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. For, instance, the frangible airfoil may define a span extending in a spanwise direction S between a root and a tip, a chordwise direction C extending between a leading edge and a trailing edge, and a thickness direction T extending between a pressure side and a suction side.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The method <b>200</b> may include <b>202</b> laying up a plurality of composite plies to form a frangible airfoil portion. The plurality of composite plies forming the frangible airfoil portion have fibers having a first fiber modulus. The plies can be oriented along the chordwise direction C, the thickness direction T, the span direction S, or combinations thereof. In embodiments, at least 50%, such as at least 75% of the plies can be oriented in the chordwise direction C, the thickness direction T, the span direction S, or a combination thereof. For example, in embodiments at least 50% of the plies are oriented in the chordwise direction C, the thickness direction T, or both. Further, the plurality of composite plies forming the frangible airfoil portion may be the first plurality of composite plies. More particularly, each of the first plurality of composite plies may include fibers having a first fiber modulus. At, <b>204</b> the method includes laying up a plurality of composite plies to form a residual airfoil portion. In such an embodiment, the plurality of composite plies may include at least one composite ply having fibers having a second fiber modulus. Particularly, the first fiber modulus is different from the second fiber modulus. Indeed, in embodiments, the second fiber modulus is greater than the first fiber modulus of the fibers used to form one or more plies in the frangible airfoil portion. The plurality of composite plies may include a composite material such as a CMC material. The composite plies may be laid up on a tool, mandrel, mold, or other suitable supporting device or surface.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a further embodiment of the method <b>200</b>, at least one of the composite plies used to form either the frangible airfoil portion or the residual airfoil portion may be a prepreg ply. For example, at least a portion (e.g., the first and/or second plurality of composite plies <b>86</b>, <b>90</b>) of the composite plies used to form the composite frangible airfoil may be prepreg plies. In one particular embodiment, all of the composite plies may be prepreg plies. In a further embodiment, at least one of the composite plies may a ceramic matrix composite ply, such as all of the composite plies. In certain embodiments, at least one of the composite plies <b>82</b> may be a ceramic matrix composite prepreg ply.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Another step of the method <b>200</b> may include <b>206</b> processing the plurality of plies to form the frangible airfoil. In one embodiment, processing the composite plies may include compacting the composite plies. In another embodiment of the method <b>200</b>, processing the composite plies may include autoclaving the composite plies. In a still further embodiment of the method <b>200</b>, processing the composite plies may include both compacting and autoclaving the composite plies. For instance, the composite plies may be compacted and then processed in an autoclave. The compaction may be performed at atmosphere, i.e., at room temperature and pressure. The autoclave cycle may impart stiffness to the final ply and/or layup assembly through complete drying and/or curing of the composite constituents and produces the final dimensions of the composite component through full consolidation of the plies and/or sub-assemblies.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, in embodiments in which the composite plies are processed in an autoclave, the composite plies may be autoclaved using soft and/or hard tooling. For instance, the composite plies may be autoclaved using metallic tooling, i.e., hard tooling, that is shaped to impart a desired shape to the frangible airfoil. As another example, the composite plies may be autoclaved using soft tooling such as a vacuum bag, e.g., the composite plies may be supported on a metal tool and then the composite plies and tool may be bagged and the air removed from the bag to apply pressure to and compact the composite plies before the composite plies are processed in a autoclave cycle. For instance, processing composite plies may include autoclaving the composite plies to form an autoclaved body. Further, another step may include firing the autoclaved body to form a fired body. Processing the composite plies may further include densifying the fired body to form the composite component. In certain embodiments, processing the composite plies may include at least one of melt infiltration or polymer infiltration and pyrolysis.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In embodiments in which the composite material is a CMC material, the autoclaved body may undergo firing (or burn-off) to form a fired body, followed by densification to produce a densified CMC component that is a single piece component, i.e., the component is a continuous piece of CMC material. For instance, after autoclaving, the component may be placed in a furnace to burn off any mandrel-forming materials and/or solvents used in forming the CMC plies and to decompose binders in the solvents, and then placed in a furnace with silicon to convert a ceramic matrix precursor of the plies into the ceramic material of the matrix of the CMC component. The silicon melts and infiltrates any porosity created within the matrix as a result of the decomposition of the binder during burn-off/firing; the melt infiltration of the CMC component with silicon densifies the CMC component. However, densification may be performed using any known densification technique including, but not limited to, Silcomp, melt-infiltration (MI), chemical vapor infiltration (CVI), polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP), and oxide/oxide processes. In one embodiment, densification and firing may be conducted in a vacuum furnace or an inert atmosphere having an established atmosphere at temperatures above 1200&#xb0; C. to allow silicon or another appropriate material or materials to melt-infiltrate into the component.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Optionally, after processing, the composite component may be finish machined, if and as needed, and coated with one or more coatings, such as an environmental barrier coating (EBC). For example, the composite plies that are wrapped around the core may be oversized such that a portion of the composite plies extend beyond the desired trailing edge of the airfoil. Accordingly, after processing, the composite plies may be machined to define the trailing edge.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Of course, the method <b>200</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is provided by way of example only. As such, other known methods or techniques for compacting and/or curing composite plies, as well as for densifying a CMC component, may be utilized. Alternatively, any combinations of these or other known processes may be used and in any suitable order. Further, although the method <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is described relative to fan blades, the method <b>200</b> may also be used to form other composite components, such as turbine nozzle blades and turbine stator vanes and/or compressor blades and vanes including airfoils as exemplary composite components.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further aspects of the disclosure are provided by the subject matter of the following clauses:</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">An airfoil defining a span extending in a spanwise direction between a root and a tip;
