More specifically, this invention is related to a shipping drum. Even more specifically, the invention is related to a forkliftable drum that can be manipulated alone or in bundles by a forklift without the use of pallets.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Containers have been used since antiquity to transport oil, chemicals, and food. One of the most common containers is the steel drum. Steel drums come in a variety of sizes, such as the ubiquitous 55 gallon, and are inexpensive, durable, and reusable. Steel drums have a number of disadvantages, however.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Transporting conventional drums can be cumbersome and even dangerous to people. Drums are often placed on a pallet which can be moved using a forklift or pallet jack. The drums are then held onto the pallet with straps or plastic wrap. Because the pallet is underneath the containers, if the straps or plastic wrap fail to hold the drum, the drum can tip over and cause injury or break, spilling the contents.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Even if only one drum is transported, an entire pallet must be used, which takes up space in trucks and shipping containers, reducing shipping efficiency. Pallets are not only cumbersome to deal with once the drums are removed from the pallets, but the pallets themselves create waste.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing drums of varying capacities have different heights and diameters, making stacking and bundling different sized drums difficult.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Handling of drums is also a significant source of injury in the workplace. The drums may tip over or fall off a pallet during transport, potentially injuring nearby workers. Drums are often manually transported without pallets by tipping them slightly and rolling them along the ground. Strains and hernias can result from handling such heavy drums. The heavy drums may crush a handler's foot or smash a limb against a wall.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would therefore be advantageous to have a container which avoids these and other drawbacks of existing containers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A forkliftable drum is provided that is designed to be lifted directly by a forklift, eliminating the need for palleting drums. Forkliftable drums disclosed herein may be stacked and nested on top of each other and strapped or otherwise secured together to create a bundle. Several different capacities of drums may be provided which all have the same diameter, allowing different capacity drums to be stacked on each other.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A forkliftable drum according to one embodiment comprises a cylindrical body having a bottom and a top which define an interior volume therein for holding material within the drum. A top ring is attached to the upper edge of the cylindrical body and extends over the top of the body. The top ring has at least two forklift pockets which are configured to accept a fork of a forklift.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The top ring according to one embodiment may have an upper and lower flange formed by bending a portion of the top ring to create the forklift pockets. Holes may pass through the upper and lower flanges and the top ring to allow a fastener to be inserted through two adjacent drums to attach the drums together to form a bundle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The top ring according to another embodiment may comprise a rectangular tube which passes through the top ring to create the forklift pockets. The rectangular tube may extend beyond an outer circumference of the top ring and may sit against the tube of an adjacent drum in a bundle to help stabilize the bundle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The forkliftable drum may comprise a bottom ring attached to a lower end of the cylindrical body. The bottom ring may comprise a plurality of flats which are vertically aligned with the forklift pockets. Strapping material may be used to secure two or more drums when bundled. An upper strapping hole in the top ring, a lower strapping hole in the flat of the bottom ring, and strapping holders attached to the body of the drum are designed to accept strapping used to bundle two or more drums together.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A forkliftable drum may also be formed using a removable top ring which locks onto existing drums. A locking section of the removable top ring is designed to surround a portion of the drum. The top ring may have a nut and bolt clamp or a locking lever for securing and releasing the top ring to the drum. Such a removable top ring may be used to retrofit an existing drum to create a forkliftable drum. A removable top ring may also be used on open top drums in place of a traditional locking ring.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a forkliftable drum according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a cutaway view of the forkliftable drum of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts a bundle of four forkliftable drums arranged horizontally on a set of forklift forks.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts a bundle of eight forkliftable drums arranged on a set of forklift forks.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts a forkliftable drum with removable top ring according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts the top section of the forkliftable drum of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> depicts an exploded view of the top section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Existing shipping drums are cumbersome to transport and are prone to causing injury as well as waste. To this end a forkliftable drum is provided herein.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show an embodiment of forkliftable drum <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an oblique view of drum <b>100</b> while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a cutaway view of the drum of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Forkliftable drum <b>100</b> is comprised of a hollow cylindrical container having an interior volume <b>102</b> therein for holding materials such as liquids, pastes, powders, or any other material for storage or transport. Interior volume <b>102</b> is defined by a cylindrically-shaped body <b>104</b>, as well as a thin disk-shaped top <b>106</b> and bottom <b>108</b>. One or more rolling hoops <b>110</b> may be formed in body <b>104</b> to improve the strength and rigidity of the drum.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Connected to the top of drum <b>100</b> is a top ring <b>112</b>. Top ring <b>112</b> is in the form of a thin-walled cylindrically-shaped section having an inner diameter, an outer diameter, and a height. The central axis of top ring <b>112</b> is collinear with the central axis of body <b>104</b>. Top ring <b>112</b> has a plurality of rectangular forklift pockets <b>114</b> which pass through the top ring <b>112</b>. The forklift pockets <b>114</b> have a rectangular tube shape with a hollow interior configured to accept a forklift fork. Each forklift pocket <b>114</b> has an outer edge <b>116</b> which is a planar surface parallel to the central axis of the drum that extends past the outer circumference of the top ring <b>112</b>. The forklift pockets <b>114</b> are positioned around the top ring <b>112</b> at 90 degrees to one another, with opposing pockets aligned colinearly to create a passage through which a fork may pass. This arrangement allows a forklift operator to lift drum <b>100</b> from any of four sides by passing a forklift fork through any set of opposing pockets.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Forklift pockets <b>114</b> have a number of functions. Forklift pockets <b>114</b> help guide a fork of a forklift through the top ring, reducing the likelihood of damage to the top ring <b>112</b>, the drum top <b>106</b> or any fitting in the drum top. Forklift pockets <b>114</b> also reinforce the lifting point of the drum, improving the strength. When two or more drums are horizontally bundled, the outer edges <b>116</b> of the forklift pockets <b>114</b> of each drum rest against each other, providing stability for the bundle.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Below each forklift pocket <b>114</b> is an upper strapping hole <b>118</b> which passes through top ring <b>112</b>. Each upper strapping hole <b>118</b> is rectangular or oval in shape and is sized to accept a strap for securing two or more drums into a bundle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Connected to the bottom of forkliftable drum <b>100</b> is a bottom ring <b>120</b> in the form of a thin-walled cylindrically-shaped section which extends downward past bottom <b>108</b>. The central axis of bottom ring <b>120</b> is collinear with the central axis of body <b>104</b>. Bottom ring <b>120</b> has a plurality of flats <b>122</b> which are aligned vertically with the forklift pockets <b>114</b>. Flats <b>122</b> are planar sections which may be formed in bottom ring <b>120</b>, such as by a press or may be attached to bottom ring <b>120</b>, such as by being welded into an opening in bottom ring <b>120</b>. Flats <b>122</b> are parallel with outer edge <b>116</b>. Each of flats <b>122</b> has a lower strapping hole <b>124</b> formed therein which passes through the flat. Lower strapping holes <b>124</b> are rectangular or oval in shape and are sized to accept a strap for securing two or more drums into a bundle. When bundled, the flat of one drum may rest against the flat of another drum, providing stability for the bundle.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Bottom ring <b>120</b> is sized to fit within top ring <b>112</b> to allow drums to be securely stacked. That is, the outer diameter of bottom ring <b>120</b> is smaller than the inner diameter of top ring <b>112</b> such that any two drums are nestable. The bottom edge <b>126</b> of bottom ring <b>120</b> and flats <b>122</b> are designed to rest on the upper edge <b>128</b> of the forklift pockets <b>114</b> of another drum. Therefore, no part of the upper drum extends into the passage between the forklift pockets <b>114</b> of the lower drum and the bundle may be lifted and transported using the forklift pockets of the lower drum.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Attached to body <b>104</b> are one or more strapping holders <b>130</b>. Strapping holders <b>130</b> are designed to hold strapping in place when drums are bundled together. Strapping holders <b>130</b> may be comprised of a substantially flat section of metal welded onto the outside of body <b>104</b>. Alternatively, a &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped section may be attached to body <b>104</b> to create strapping holders <b>130</b>. Strapping holders <b>130</b> may be designed to take load or may simply be designed to keep a strap from moving during transport.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Top ring <b>112</b> may be formed integrally with body <b>104</b> or top <b>106</b>. Top ring <b>112</b> may also be attached to one or both of body <b>104</b> and top <b>106</b>. Top ring <b>112</b> may be attached by welding, crimping, threaded fasteners, adhesives, or any combination thereof. Bottom ring <b>120</b> may be formed integrally with body <b>104</b> or bottom <b>108</b>. Bottom ring may also be attached to one or both of body <b>104</b> and bottom <b>108</b>. Bottom ring <b>120</b> may be attached by welding, crimping, threaded fastener, adhesives, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While drum <b>100</b> is shown as being cylindrically shaped, the invention is not limited thereto and drum <b>100</b> may be rectangular, square, oblong, etc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Drum <b>100</b> can be made of any suitable material but preferably metals or polymers. For example, drum <b>100</b> may be made of steel, stainless steel, or aluminum. Suitable polymers include nylon, polypropylene, polyethylene, ABS, and polycarbonate. Drum <b>100</b> may also be manufactured from a combination of materials. For example, the forklift pockets may be made of steel and the rest of the drum made of polymer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Unlike conventional drums, forkliftable drums disclosed herein may be made in a variety of capacities all having the same diameter but with different heights. Because of this, bundles can be formed of varying drum capacities for better space utilization in trucks, shipping containers, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows four drums <b>200</b> connected horizontally to form a bundle <b>201</b>. Forklift forks <b>203</b> are shown engaged with bundle <b>201</b> as would be typical when lifting or moving the bundle. As can be seen, each of the forklift forks <b>203</b> passes through two forklift pockets <b>214</b> of each drum <b>200</b>. When bundle <b>201</b> is created, each drum <b>200</b> is aligned in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> with the forklift pockets of adjacent drums being approximately collinear.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Strapping <b>205</b> is used to secure the individual drums <b>200</b> to form the bundle <b>201</b>. The strapping may be horizontal, held in place by strapping holders <b>230</b> or the strapping may be vertical by passing strapping through upper or lower strapping holes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows eight drums connected to form a bundle <b>211</b>. The bundle <b>211</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is essentially comprised of two bundles <b>201</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> stacked vertically. In bundle <b>211</b>, vertical straps <b>205</b> extend from the bottom drums to the top drums.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When forming a bundle, the drums <b>200</b> may be manually aligned or a forklift may be used. For example, a forklift is driven to a first location and picks up a first drum on one fork. The forklift may then drive to a second location and pick up a second drum on the same fork or another fork. This process is repeated until the forklift has two drums on each fork. The forklift driver drives the drums to a bundling location and sets the drums down. The forks may be pushed together by the forklift driver to bring the drums on the left and right forks together, and the driver may set the drums down and push them with the forklift to bring the front and rear drums together. The driver may then back the forklift out from the set of drums, which are now aligned while workers bundle the drums together.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">By placing the forklift holes on the top of the drum, the drum may be carried such that the center of gravity is below the fork, creating a stable configuration. When drums are carried on pallets, the center of gravity remains above the forks, allowing for the possibility of the pallet to tip or the drum to fall.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the drums described herein may be lifted with a forklift, they are not limited solely to forklifts. For example, straps may be passed through the forklift pockets to allow lifting by overhead crane, helicopter, or large drone.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> show a forkliftable drum <b>300</b> according to another embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows the entire drum <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is an exploded view of the upper drum components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Forkliftable drum <b>300</b> is comprised of a hollow cylindrical container having an interior volume therein for holding materials. The interior volume is defined by a cylindrically-shaped body <b>304</b>, as well as a thin disk-shaped top <b>306</b> and bottom <b>308</b>. Top <b>306</b> is removable from body <b>304</b> to provide access to the interior volume of the drum.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Connected to the top of drum <b>300</b> is a top ring <b>312</b>. Top ring <b>312</b> is in the form of a thin-walled cylindrically-shaped ring having an inner surface, an outer surface, and a height. The central axis of top ring <b>312</b> is collinear with the central axis of body <b>304</b>. Top ring <b>312</b> has a plurality of rectangular forklift pockets <b>314</b> which define openings which pass through the top ring <b>312</b>. The forklift pockets <b>314</b> have a rectangular shape configured to accept a forklift fork. The forklift pockets <b>314</b> are positioned around the top ring <b>312</b> at 90 degrees to one another, with opposing pockets aligned colinearly to create a passage through which a fork may pass. This arrangement allows a forklift operator to lift drum <b>300</b> from any of four sides by passing a forklift fork through any set of opposing pockets.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Forklift pockets <b>314</b> have an upper flange <b>340</b> and a lower flange <b>342</b> formed by bending a section of the top ring 180 degrees. The section of top ring <b>312</b> near each forklift pocket <b>314</b> has a planar shape with the remaining sections of top ring <b>312</b> having curves or angles in between to create an overall roughly cylindrical shape. Holes <b>344</b> pass through upper flange <b>340</b> and lower flange <b>342</b> as well as the main body of top ring <b>312</b> to provide a means to attach two drums together. A fastener such as a bolt, screw, or rivet can be passed through the corresponding holes in two adjacent drums. Upper and lower flanges <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> may have dimples, a rough surface, or other features that create friction or a positive lock when two drums are attached to decrease the likelihood of the drums shifting.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Below each forklift pocket <b>314</b> is an upper strapping hole <b>318</b> which passes through top ring <b>312</b>. Each upper strapping hole <b>318</b> is rectangular or oval in shape and is sized to accept a strap for securing two or more drums into a bundle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Top ring <b>312</b> is attached to body <b>304</b> by clamping around the upper edge of body <b>304</b> in the same manner as a standard closing ring. That is, the upper edge of body <b>304</b> and the outer edge of top <b>306</b> are rounded so as to create a partial toroidal shape which is encompassed by a partially toroidally-shaped locking section <b>346</b> of top ring <b>312</b>. The clamping is provided by nut and bolt clamp <b>348</b> but other mechanisms may be used, such as a lever lock mechanism. A gap <b>350</b> in top ring <b>312</b> allows top ring <b>312</b> to expand and contract to allow installation and removal of top ring <b>312</b> as well as top <b>306</b>. Top ring <b>312</b> can therefore be used on existing drums to convert standard drums into a forkliftable drum. Additionally, top ring <b>312</b> can be used on both open top and closed top drums.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The unique design of top ring <b>312</b> allows it to be manufactured primarily from a single section of sheet metal. Upper flange <b>340</b> and lower flange <b>342</b> may be formed my creating an H or I shaped cut and bending the flanges 180 degrees. The flat section may be formed to create locking section <b>346</b> as well as the overall cylindrical shape of top ring <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Connected to the bottom of forkliftable drum <b>300</b> is a bottom ring <b>320</b> in the form of a thin-walled cylindrically-shaped section which extends downward past bottom <b>308</b>. The central axis of bottom ring <b>320</b> is collinear with the central axis of body <b>304</b>. Bottom ring <b>320</b> has a plurality of flats <b>322</b> which are aligned vertically with the forklift pockets <b>314</b>. Flats <b>322</b> are planar sections which may be formed in bottom ring <b>320</b>, such as by a press or may be attached to bottom ring <b>320</b>, such as by being welded into an opening in bottom ring <b>320</b>. Flats <b>322</b> are parallel with the planar area around pockets <b>314</b>. Each of flats <b>322</b> has a lower strapping hole <b>324</b> formed therein which passes through the flat. Lower strapping holes <b>324</b> are rectangular or oval in shape and are sized to accept a strap for securing two or more drums into a bundle. When bundled, the flat of one drum may rest against the flat of another drum, providing stability for the bundle.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Bottom ring <b>320</b> is sized to fit within top ring <b>312</b> to allow drums to be securely stacked. That is, the outer diameter of bottom ring <b>320</b> is smaller than the inner diameter of top ring <b>312</b> such that any two drums are nestable. Bottom ring <b>320</b> and top ring <b>312</b> are designed so that bottom ring <b>322</b> does not block forklift pockets <b>314</b>. For example, a flange or lip may be created on bottom ring <b>320</b> or top ring <b>312</b>. Alternatively, a protrusion may be pressed, punched, or welded onto the inside of top ring <b>312</b> or the outside of bottom ring <b>320</b>. Upper flange <b>340</b> may also be bent inward, such as at a 90 degree angle parallel to top <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Attached to body <b>304</b> are one or more strapping holders <b>330</b>. Strapping holders <b>330</b> are designed to hold strapping in place when drums are bundled together. Strapping holders <b>330</b> may be comprised of a substantially flat section of metal welded onto the outside of body <b>304</b>. Alternatively, a &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped section may be attached to body <b>304</b> to create strapping holders <b>330</b>. Strapping holders <b>330</b> may be designed to take load or may simply be designed to keep a strap from moving during transport.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The discussion herein of the present invention is directed to various embodiments of the invention.
