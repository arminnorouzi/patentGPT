This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms, and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments or implementations of the disclosure. As used herein &#x201c;embodiments&#x201d; and &#x201c;implementations&#x201d; are interchangeable words that are non-limiting examples of devices or methods employing one or more of the disclosure disclosed herein. It is apparent, however, that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with one or more equivalent arrangements. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring various embodiments. Further, various embodiments may be different, but do not have to be exclusive. For example, specific shapes, configurations, and characteristics of an embodiment may be used or implemented in other embodiments without departing from the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated embodiments are to be understood as providing features of varying detail of some ways in which the disclosure may be implemented in practice. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the features, components, modules, layers, films, panels, regions, and/or aspects, etc. (hereinafter individually or collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;), of the various embodiments may be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and/or rearranged without departing from the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The use of cross-hatching and/or shading in the accompanying drawings is generally provided to clarify boundaries between adjacent elements. As such, neither the presence nor the absence of cross-hatching or shading conveys or indicates any preference or requirement for particular materials, material properties, dimensions, proportions, commonalities between illustrated elements, and/or any other characteristic, attribute, property, etc., of the elements, unless specified.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, in the accompanying drawings, the size and relative sizes of elements may be exaggerated for clarity and/or descriptive purposes. When an embodiment may be implemented differently, a specific process order may be performed differently from the described order. For example, two consecutively described processes may be performed substantially at the same time or performed in an order opposite to the described order. Also, like reference numerals denote like elements.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">When an element, such as a layer, is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, connected to, or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. When, however, an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. To this end, the term &#x201c;connected&#x201d; may refer to physical, electrical, and/or fluid connection, with or without intervening elements.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, the X-axis, the Y-axis, and the Z-axis are not limited to three axes of a rectangular coordinate system, and thus the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, and may be interpreted in a broader sense. For example, the X-axis, the Y-axis, and the Z-axis may be perpendicular to one another, or may represent different directions that are not perpendicular to one another.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For the purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;at least one of X, Y, and Z&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one selected from X, Y, and Z&#x201d; may be construed as X only, Y only, Z only, or any combination of two or more of X, Y, and Z, such as, for instance, XYZ, XYY, YZ, and ZZ. &#x201c;Or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or.&#x201d; As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although the terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and the like may be used herein to describe various types of elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element discussed below could be termed a second element without departing from the teachings of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;under,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;over,&#x201d; &#x201c;higher,&#x201d; &#x201c;side&#x201d; (e.g., as in &#x201c;sidewall&#x201d;), and the like, may be used herein for descriptive purposes, and, thereby, to describe one elements relationship to another element(s) as illustrated in the drawings. Spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of an apparatus in use, operation, and/or manufacture in addition to the orientation depicted in the drawings. For example, if the apparatus in the drawings is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the apparatus may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and, as such, the spatially relative descriptors used herein should be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms, &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Moreover, the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. It is also noted that, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; and other similar terms, are used as terms of approximation, not as terms of degree, and thus are utilized to account for inherent deviations in measured, calculated, and/or provided values that would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Various embodiments are described herein with reference to sectional and/or exploded illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments and/or intermediate structures. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments disclosed herein should not necessarily be construed as limited to the particular illustrated shapes of regions, but are to include deviations in shapes that result from, for instance, manufacturing. In this manner, regions illustrated in the drawings may be schematic in nature, and the shapes of these regions may not reflect actual shapes of regions of a device and are not necessarily intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As customary in the field, some embodiments are described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings in terms of functional blocks, units, parts, and/or modules. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these blocks, units, parts, and/or modules are physically implemented by electronic (or optical) circuits, such as logic circuits, discrete components, microprocessors, hard-wired circuits, memory elements, wiring connections, and the like, which may be formed using semiconductor-based fabrication techniques or other manufacturing technologies. In the case of the blocks, units, parts, and/or modules being implemented by microprocessors or other similar hardware, they may be programmed and controlled using software (e.g., microcode) to perform various functions discussed herein and may optionally be driven by firmware and/or software. It is also contemplated that each block, unit, part, and/or module may be implemented by dedicated hardware, or as a combination of dedicated hardware to perform some functions and a processor (e.g., one or more programmed microprocessors and associated circuitry) to perform other functions. Also, each block, unit, part, and/or module of some embodiments may be physically separated into two or more interacting and discrete blocks, units, parts, and/or modules without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Further, the blocks, units, parts, and/or modules of some embodiments may be physically combined into more complex blocks, units, parts, and/or modules without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Unless otherwise defined or implied herein, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure pertains. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the disclosure, and should not be interpreted in an ideal or overly formal sense, unless clearly so defined herein.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Hereinafter, embodiments of the disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view of a display device according to an embodiment of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a side shape of a display device when a portion thereof is bent in thickness direction.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, an embodiment of the display device <b>1</b> is a device for displaying moving images or still images.
