More specifically, the present invention relates to methods, systems, devices, circuits and functionally related machine executable instructions for operational commands based cybersecurity of a transportation management network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Railway signaling systems are used to direct railway traffic and keep trains always clear of each other. Railway infrastructures are moving towards more intelligent, connected, and collaborative systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As railways increase efficiencies through automation and digitization&#x2014;by moving from strictly mechanical systems and standalone systems to digital, open-platform and standardized equipment&#x2014;they become more vulnerable to cyberattacks through a nearly unlimited number of attack vectors.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a result, the Operational Technology (OT) environment is no longer considered to be a closed network, meaning, from now on any component in the OT network can be hacked and manipulated in a way which could cause serious damage to the railway operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Modern rail systems have highly specific control &#x26; safety technology infrastructures implemented with signaling technology. The signaling technology includes electronic interlocking, radio/cellular-based signaling systems such as the European Train Control System (ETCS) and the Positive Train Control system (PTC), and designated mobile-radio standards to which hackers cannot simply gain access.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Nonetheless, these complex technologies are only able to operate because of their integration into the Internet-based, or other network based, data communication system and the fact they all run via corresponding servers just like any other application. In such vulnerable environments&#x2014;the risk of cyberattacks, interventions, and intrusions from different unauthorized parties, has become increasingly high.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There remains a need, in the fields of cybersecurity and of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) network security, for cybersecurity solutions that secure the operation of, and the communication between, the different endpoints of a transportation network in a way which provides protection to the railway network.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The teachings herein may for example be applicable to any railway industry standard for a signaling system such as, but not limited to, the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) that is the system of standards for management and interoperation of signaling for railways by the European Union (EU). It is conducted by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) and is the organizational umbrella for the separately managed parts of GSM-R (communication), European Train Control System (ETCS, signaling).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention may include methods, circuits, devices, assemblies, systems and functionally associated machine executable code for securing rail transportation networks from malicious electronic interference, such as a cyberattack. According to further embodiments, there may be provided methods and systems for real-time safety monitoring of rolling stock on transportation networks. According to yet further embodiments of the present invention, there may be provided methods and systems for enforcing a given rolling stock's (e.g. train's, trolley's, locomotive's, etc.) adherence to operational rules or parameters associated with the given rolling stock, within a context of the rolling stock's real-time configuration (e.g. payload type and size), location, speed and or state. The operational rules and or parameters may optionally be those rules or parameters provided as part of a &#x2018;start of mission&#x2019; message to a rolling stock's controller. The operational rules and or parameters may be provided to the rolling stock's controller as an update after start of mission.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A rail transportation system according to embodiments of the present invention may include, or may otherwise be functionally associated with, a transportation network segment simulation engine (&#x2018;SimE&#x2019;), or a module thereof&#x2014;for example, implemented on a system server such as a behavior monitoring server&#x2014;to digitally model and simulate operation of one or more segments of the transportation system, such that the SimE may predict a future state of a given transportation network segment, including the rolling stock thereon, at least partially based on: (1) the operational rules and or parameters, and (2) a &#x2018;starting state&#x2019; of the given network segment that is at least partially based on (a) a model of the given network segment, and or (b) a set of inputs indicating timing and operational parameters of rolling stock on and or approaching the given transportation network segment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The SimE may receive the set of inputs and or following real-time input data, directly or through a system monitoring node, from monitoring agents which are integral, or otherwise functionally association with, each of one or more transportation network management units, wherein each transportation management unit may monitor and or regulate a condition, state or operation of a transportation system element, segment, path, functional block, sub-system or rolling stock. The SimE may also receive the operational rules and or parameters, as copies of &#x2018;Start of Mission&#x2019; or &#x2018;Mission Update&#x2019; messages from a rail transportation system control node issued to rolling stock controller type management units. Accordingly, the SimE may predict future real-time input data indicative of locations and states, at various points in the future, of some or all rolling stock passing through its coverage area or segment, for example, based on instantaneous transportation system operational parameters and states of all relevant elements within the network segment being covered. The SimE may recalculate predictions of future locations and states of some or all rolling stock passing through the relevant transportation system segment each time the SimE receives a new &#x2018;Start of Mission&#x2019; or &#x2018;Mission Update&#x2019; message copy, and or each time a new set of real-time input data is received.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A SimE according to embodiments of the present invention may run one or multiple accelerated simulations of varying speeds, resolution and durations, in order to predict future transportation system segment states, each time new real-time input data regarding any element within or approaching the segment under coverage is received. Simulations, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, may result in one or more predicted undesirable system states within the network segment being covered, for example a predicted state where two or more rolling stocks are to be at the same location at the same time, either traveling in the same or opposite directions, at some given point in the future. Additional undesirable system states may include: (a) rolling stock not communicating with a specific network management unit at a predicted time; (b) rolling stock communicating with a specific network management unit at an unpredicted time; (c) rolling stock receiving instructions which cause it to take a turn overloaded and or at an excessive speed; (d) rolling stock approaching a station faster than would allow for a stop at the station; and (e) taking a route unsuitable for the type of payload designated by the &#x2018;Start of Mission&#x2019; or &#x2018;Mission Update&#x2019; states. Many more such undesirable conditions exist and may be predicted for by a SimE according to embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An alert notification module, integral or otherwise functionally associated with the SimE, may generate and transmit an alert notification if the SimE predicts any undesirable future condition or state of any elements of the segments under coverage by the SimE. The alert notifications may be sent back to the control node which generated the signal which caused the SimE to predict an undesirable future state within the segment under coverage. The alert notification module may, responsive to the detection, message multiple transportation system stake holders including the rolling stock at risk.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to further embodiments, the alert notification module may be functionally associated with a risk mitigation module which may either block messages identified as resulting in undesirable results or may generate emergency countermeasures to the message predicted to lead to a predicted collision.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The subject matter regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification.
