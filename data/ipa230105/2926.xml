As a key core material of radiation detectors, scintillation crystals have been widely used in the fields of medical imaging, homeland security, high-energy physics, etc. In order to meet the requirements on sensitivity and confidence coefficient of high-performance energy spectroscopies and imaging detectors, the development of new scintillation crystal materials with high light output and high energy resolution has always been a frontier research direction in the field of radiation detection. Lead-halide perovskites have attracted much attention due to their high ray absorption coefficient, low density of defect states, continuously tunable band gap, and large carrier mobility/lifetime product. However, the toxicity and bioconcentration of lead cannot be ignored, and lead-halide perovskites are often unstable and self-absorbed. In recent years, there have been metal halide materials with a low-dimensional perovskite structure, which are considered as a potential high-performance scintillation material with the advantages such as no self-absorption and high luminous efficiency due to the characteristics such as confined exciton emission, large Stokes shift and high fluorescence quantum efficiency. Recently, related research based on Cu(I) system has progressed rapidly. Typically, the 1D perovskite-structured Rb<sub>2</sub>CuBr<sub>3 </sub>has a scintillation yield of over 90,000 ph/MeV under X-ray radiation, which is comparable to cutting-edge commercial scintillators, but the presence of Rb<sup>+</sup> leads to introduce an unnecessary radioactive background in the scintillator. By comparison, Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>, which uses Cs+ without natural radioactivity instead of Rb<sup>+</sup> and has a lower zero-dimensional structure and also emits light from self-trapped excitons (STE), has more practical application prospects.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A single crystal of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5 </sub>has a Stokes shift of about 150 nm, which avoids self-absorption loss; a center of emission peak of near 445 nm, which is suitable for commercial photomultiplier tubes and is conducive to device integration; an effective atomic number as high as 52.2, and a density of about 4.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, corresponding to a large ray absorption coefficient; an afterglow signal which drops by 4 orders of magnitude within 10 ms after the X-ray cut-off, which is much better than the commercial CsI:Tl; an X-ray detection limit of about 100 nGyair/s, which is dozens of times lower than the medical diagnosis requirements; a main decay time under 137Cs &#x3b3;-ray radiation of about 1 &#x3bc;s, which is much shorter than other low-dimensional perovskites; and an energy resolution at 662 keV as high as 3.4% due to the low nonproportionality in the radiation energy range. Moreover, by incorporating a suitable concentration of Tl<sup>+</sup>, the photoluminescence efficiency (PLQY) of the original pure component, which is close to 70%, is further improved by nearly 10%; the steady-state scintillation yield under X-ray excitation is increased from 32,000 ph/MeV to 150,000 ph/MeV, close to the theoretical limit; the absolute light yield at 662 keV is 87,000 ph/MeV, which is comparable to state-of-the-art &#x3b3;-ray detectors such as LaBr<sub>3</sub>:Ce, Sr and SrI<sub>2</sub>:Eu. Although the introduction of Tl<sup>+</sup> results in greatly improved scintillation performance of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5 </sub>single crystals, it brings considerable safety hazards due to the highly toxic nature of thallium itself. Therefore, it is urgent to find a metal-doped ion that could meet the requirements of high light output without harming environment and health.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a Li<sup>+</sup> doped metal halide scintillation crystal with a zero-dimensional perovskite structure and a preparation method thereof.
