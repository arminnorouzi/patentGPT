The barrier application system embodies a barrier applicator assembly. The barrier applicator assembly includes a primary film layer, a secondary film layer that is removably adhered to an exterior surface of the primary film and a carrier structure comprising separate support layers that is removably adhered to an exterior surface of one or both primary and/or secondary film layers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The inventor is confident that, when confronted with a device with an antiviral and/or antimicrobial protective cover, they are not the only one who wonders whether the person who applied the protective cover in the first place did not themselves contaminate the outer surface of the protective cover that the user is now asked to trust as uncontaminated, thereby frustrating the purpose of the protective cover.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Protective cover applicators for handheld or hand-operated devices known in the art are not conformable two-layer systems that provide the end-user with a removable secondary film layer to the microbial-free and virus-free primary film layer. Rather, existing covers for handheld devices are merely film wraps or bags do not ensure that the person that wrapped the handheld device did not indeed contaminate the protective cover prior to handling by the end-user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As can be seen, there is a need for a disposable film wrap system for use with handheld devices embodying a disposable cover film assembly that forms a barrier between a handheld device and the human hand during the initial wrapping of the device and during subsequent use of the handheld device, thereby affording additional peace of mind to subsequent users.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disposable cover film assembly includes a thin primary film layer that is geometrically asymmetric, a thin secondary film layer that is removably adhered to the primary film layer, and a carrier structure composed of a plurality of support layers that are removably adhered to the primary layer and, in some cases, the secondary film layer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cover film assembly provides a conformable protective barrier for a handheld device, designed to prevent the spread of microbial or viral particulates from the device to its user through a contaminant-free primary film layer. A unique feature of the film wrap system is the presence of the secondary film layer that is applied simultaneously with the primary film layer. The secondary film layer presents itself to the end-user for their removal to expose the contaminant-free primary film layer that was shielded by the secondary film layer during initial application of the film cover system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the primary film layer has a modified trapezoid shape with two extending flaps to assist in the application of the cover film system to a device. Specific sections of the film wrap system are sequentially folded over the top, bottom, left and right sides of a handheld device and provide a facile methodology to wrap and encase such device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the support layers are removably adhered to the primary film layer as four discrete support sections. This design allows each discrete support section to be removed sequentially as the cover film system is sequentially folded over a handheld device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, a secondary film layer is offset from the center of the primary film layer so that it entirely covers the encased handheld device. This feature ensures that the primary film layer&#x2014;that will be exposed by the user upon removing the secondary film layer&#x2014;is not contaminated from any contact that may have occurred during the wrapping process. The end user can use a variety of methods to remove the secondary film layer to minimize direct skin contact (e.g., sanitizing or wearing gloves). The secondary film layer is preferably a colored or tinted film that is easily differentiated from the transparent primary film layer and is removed by the user to expose a previously untouched primary film layer (i.e., first-time use).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In any of the above embodiments, the film wrap system is constructed using transparent and conformable film components so that the encased handheld device control buttons can be easily visualized and manipulated.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, the film wrap system is designed so that the pressure sensitive adhesive can be detached from a handheld device after use and leave no unwanted residue.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the film wrap system can be printed in specific locations with visual or numeric indicators or indicia to guide in the step-by-step application of the film wrap system to a handheld device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In any of the above embodiments, the film wrap system can be sized to conform to a variety of handheld devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect of the present invention, a barrier applicator assembly for a handheld device includes the following: a primary film layer having opposing exterior and interior primary surfaces; a primary adhesive along the interior primary surface; a secondary film layer adhered along the exterior primary surface; and a plurality of support layers adhered to portions of the exterior primary surface, wherein the plurality of support layers defines an opening through which the primary and secondary film layers are visible.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the present invention, the barrier applicator assembly further includes wherein the primary film layer comprises longitudinally opposing first and second primary edges, and further comprising a first flap and a second flap extending from the first and second primary edges, respectively, away from the opening, wherein the primary film layer comprises latitudinal opposing distal and proximal primary edges, wherein the distal primary edge provides cut corners, wherein each support layer has a tab that protrudes beyond the first, second, distal, and proximal primary edges, wherein a proximal edge of the secondary film layer aligns with a substantial portion of the proximal primary edge, and wherein a plurality of remaining edges of the secondary film layer is offset inward from the first, second, and distal primary edges, respectively, wherein a latitudinal width of the secondary film layer is dimensioned to substantially wrap a girth of the handheld device, wherein the exterior primary surface has no adhesive for facilitating post-application use, wherein an interior surface of the secondary film layer has a secondary adhesive, wherein an exterior surface of the secondary film layer has no adhesive for facilitating post-application use, wherein an interior surface of each support layer has a support adhesive, wherein an exterior surface of each support layer has no adhesive for facilitating post-application use, wherein the primary and secondary film layers are transparent, and wherein the plurality of support layers is opaque; and further including a release layer coextensive with and engaged with the primary adhesive in such a way as to be aligned with the primary film layer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another aspect of the present invention, a method of simultaneously wrapping primary and secondary film layers to a handheld device, the method includes the following: providing the assembly disclosed above so that the exterior surface of the plurality of support layers is supported on a horizontal supporting surface; centering the handheld device within the opening, wherein a user interface of the handheld device is facing the opening; and successively folding the first, second, distal, and proximal edges over respective sides of the handheld device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exterior plan view of one embodiment of a film wrap system for handheld devices comprising a barrier applicator assembly.

The barrier applicator assembly includes a thin primary film layer that is geometrically asymmetric and a thin secondary film layer that is removably adhered to an exterior surface of the primary film layer. The barrier applicator assembly also includes carrier structure having a plurality of film support layers wherein each support layer is independently adhered to the exterior surface of the primary film layer and/or the secondary film layer. Utilization of the barrier applicator assembly results in the exterior surface of the device wrapped in the primary film layer, wherein the exterior surface of primary film layer is substantially wrapped in the removable secondary film layer. Thereby providing an end user with a level of confidence that the primary film layer is contamination-free.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be understood that the directional term &#x2018;exterior&#x2019; relates to the end product of the wrapped device/object, wherein the primary layer is wrapped around the exterior surface of the device/object, and wherein the exterior surface of the primary film layer is what is engaged by the end user. The directionally term &#x2018;interior&#x2019; is opposite the &#x2018;exterior&#x2019;. As a corollary, the term &#x2018;outer&#x2019; (or outward) may be analogous with &#x2018;exterior&#x2019;. Likewise, the term &#x2018;second major surface&#x2019; is also analogous to &#x2018;exterior&#x2019;, while the term &#x2018;first major surface&#x2019; is analogous with &#x2018;interior&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one embodiment of the present invention may include a cover film system or barrier application system for handheld devices designated in its entirety by reference numeral <b>1000</b>. The system <b>1000</b> may be embodied in a barrier applicator assembly that includes a primary film layer <b>10</b>. A secondary film layer <b>20</b> may be removably joined, by way of adhesive, to an exterior surface of the primary film layer <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The primary film layer <b>10</b> may have an asymmetrical shape that is defined by a first flap <b>5</b> extending from the first end <b>25</b> and a second flap <b>15</b> extending from the opposite second end <b>30</b>. Perpendicular to the directional axis defined by the distance between the first end <b>25</b> and the second end <b>30</b> is a distal end <b>2</b> and an opposing proximal end <b>4</b> of the primary film layer <b>10</b>. Primary film layer <b>10</b> represents the permanent film that covers a handheld device <b>55</b> and provides a barrier between the device <b>55</b> and contact with the hand of a user of the device <b>55</b>. The detachable secondary film layer <b>20</b> protects the primary film layer <b>10</b> from contamination during the application process and prior to handling by the end user.

In particular, the present disclosure relates to a thin primary film layer <b>10</b> that is geometrically asymmetric, a thin secondary film layer <b>20</b> that is removably adhered to the primary film layer <b>10</b> and a carrier structure (support layer) <b>22</b>,<b>24</b>,<b>26</b>,<b>28</b> that is removably adhered to one or both the primary <b>10</b> and secondary <b>20</b> film layers.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one aspect, the primary film layer has a modified trapezoid shape with two extending flaps <b>5</b>, <b>15</b> to assist in the application of the cover film system to a device. Specific sections of the film wrap system are sequentially folded over the top, bottom, left and right sides of a handheld device and provide a facile means to wrap and encase such device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another aspect, the support layers <b>22</b>,<b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> is removably adhered to the primary film layer at four discrete support portions thereof. This design allows each discrete support section to be removed sequentially as the cover film system is sequentially folded over a handheld device, thereby, in effect, &#x201c;unveiling&#x201d; the entirety of the secondary film layer <b>20</b>, which in turn is adhered to the primary film layer <b>10</b>. Importantly, the secondary film layer <b>20</b> is offset from the center of the primary film layer <b>10</b> so that it entirely covers the encased handheld device after the wrapping process. This feature ensures that the primary film layer that will be exposed by the user upon removing the secondary layer film is protected from any contact that may have occurred during the wrapping process. The end-user can use a variety of methods to remove the secondary film layer <b>20</b> to minimize direct skin contact (e.g., sanitizing or wearing gloves). The secondary film layer <b>20</b> is preferably a colored or tinted film that is easily differentiated from the transparent primary film layer and is removed by the user to expose a previously untouched primary film layer <b>10</b> (i.e., first-time use).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The cover film system support layers that are attached to the primary film layer <b>10</b> and the detachable secondary film layer <b>20</b>. The support layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are present to add support to the thin film layers of the device and to prevent the adhesive film from folding over and adhering to itself after removal of the device release liner. The support layers are separated into four distinct articles either due to perforation <b>70</b> between the individual support layers and/or actual separate support layer sections that are adhered to the primary film layer and/or the detachable secondary film layer. The benefit of providing distinctly separate support layers is to assist in the application of the cover film system to a handheld device. Wrapping a handheld device with the primary film layer system is conducted in sequential steps. For example, the first flap <b>5</b> is folded over and adhered to the top portion of a handheld device and then support layer <b>22</b> is removed. Next, the second flap <b>15</b> is folded over and adhered to the bottom portion of a handheld device and then support layer <b>24</b> is removed. The handheld device is then wrapped from one side by folding over the side represented by distal end <b>2</b> followed by the removal of support layer <b>26</b>. The final step in the wrapping process is to fold over the film side represented by the proximal end <b>4</b> followed by the removal of respective support layer <b>28</b>. The end-user would then remove the detachable secondary film layer <b>20</b> to expose the contaminant-free primary film layer <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A method of manufacturing the present invention may include the following.
