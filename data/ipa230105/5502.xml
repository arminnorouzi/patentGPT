Examples of devices that incorporate magnetic storage systems include desktop computers, portable notebook computers, portable hard disk drives, digital versatile disc (DVD) players, high definition television (HDTV) receivers, vehicle control systems, cellular or mobile telephones, television set top boxes, digital cameras, digital video cameras, video game consoles, and portable media players.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical disk drive includes magnetic storage media in the form of one or more fiat disks. The disks are generally formed of two main substances, namely, a substrate material that gives it structure and rigidity, and a magnetic media coating that holds the magnetic impulses or moments that represent data in a recording layer within the coating. The typical disk drive also includes a read head and a write head, generally in the form of a magnetic transducer which can sense and/or change the magnetic fields stored on the recording layer of the disks.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Energy/Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (EAMR/HAMR) systems can increase the areal density of information recorded magnetically on various magnetic media. To achieve higher areal density for magnetic storage, smaller magnetic grain size (e.g., less than 6 nm) media may be required. In HAMR, high temperatures are applied to the media during writing to facilitate recording to small grains. However, the use of these high temperatures can present operational challenges and undesirable effects such as reliability issues in the HAMR components, including the media and head/slider.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of some aspects of the disclosure to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

The description of elements in each figure may refer to elements of proceeding figures. Like numbers may refer to like elements in the figures, including alternate aspects of like elements.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The disclosure relates in some aspects to various apparatuses, systems, methods, and media for providing heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media that can improve the reliability of a near field transducer (NFT) used in a slider of a HAMR disk drive. In a HAMR disk drive, a laser source and an optical waveguide with a NFT (typically implemented on or in a slider) are used to generate localized heating in the media while a writing element or writer writes data to the media.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some aspects, magnesium (Mg), often in the form of MgO, may be used in a seed layer of a HAMR medium or disk. However, Mg atoms or ions can dissociate from the seed layer and migrate to the disk surface, and further to the slider/head positioned just above the disk surface. The migrated Mg on the disk surface and on the slider may cause damage (e.g., severe damage) to the NFT that is within the slider disposed just above the disk. The Mg on the disk surface or on the slider can react with Si or Si compound (e.g., SiO<sub>2 </sub>(quartz)) that forms the cladding for the NFT and adversely affects the NFT. For example, the migrated Mg can react with NFT Si and form a SiMgO compound. The SiMgO compound has a lower thermal conductivity than Si or Si compound (e.g., quartz). Thermal stress can accumulate on the NFT because of the new compound has a lower thermal conductivity, and excess thermal stress (e.g., heat) can damage the NFT structure. Furthermore, SiMgO compounds (e.g., talc) can have a layered mineral structure. Thus, this layered SiMgO substance on the NFT can easily break off from the NFT during HDD operation and cause HAMR disk failure. Therefore, improving the reliability of the NFT can improve the lifespan of a HAMR disk drive.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top schematic view of a data storage device <b>100</b> (e.g., disk drive or magnetic recording device) configured for heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) comprising a slider <b>108</b> and a magnetic recording medium <b>102</b> with reduced Mg migration according to one or more aspects of the disclosure. The laser (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> but see <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is positioned with a head/slider <b>108</b>. Disk drive <b>100</b> may comprise one or more disks/media <b>102</b> to store data. Disk/media <b>102</b> resides on a spindle assembly <b>104</b> that is mounted to a drive housing <b>106</b>. Data may be stored along tracks in the magnetic recording layer of disk <b>102</b>. The reading and writing of data is accomplished with the head <b>108</b> (slider) that may have both read and write elements (<b>108</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>b</i>). The write element <b>108</b><i>a </i>is used to alter the properties of the magnetic recording layer of disk <b>102</b> and thereby write information thereto. In one aspect, head <b>108</b> may have magneto-resistive (MR) based elements, such as tunnel magneto resistive (TMR) elements for reading, and a write pole with coils that can be energized for writing. In operation, a spindle motor (not shown) rotates the spindle assembly <b>104</b>, and thereby rotates the disk <b>102</b> to position the head <b>108</b> at a particular location along a desired disk track <b>107</b>. The position of the head <b>108</b> relative to the disk <b>102</b> may be controlled by the control circuitry <b>110</b> (e.g., a microcontroller). It is noted that while an example HAMR system is shown, the various embodiments described may be used in other EAMR or non-EAMR magnetic data recording systems, including perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) disk drives or magnetic tape drives.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side schematic view of the slider <b>108</b> and magnetic recording medium <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The magnetic recording medium <b>102</b> may have one or more Mg trapping layers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>) to reduce Mg migration in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. The slider <b>108</b> may comprise a sub-mount <b>112</b> attached to a top surface of the slider <b>108</b>. The laser <b>114</b> may be attached to the sub-mount <b>112</b>, and possibly to the slider <b>108</b>. The slider <b>108</b> comprises a write element (e.g., writer) <b>108</b><i>a </i>and a read element (e.g., reader) <b>108</b><i>b </i>positioned along an air bearing surface (ABS) <b>108</b><i>c </i>of the slider for writing information to, and reading information from, respectively, the media <b>102</b>. In other aspects, the slider may also comprise a layer of Si or Si cladding <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In operation, the laser <b>114</b> is configured to generate and direct light energy to a. waveguide (e.g., along the dashed line) in the slider which directs the light to a near field transducer (NFT) <b>122</b> near the air bearing surface (e.g., bottom surface) <b>108</b><i>c </i>of the slider <b>108</b>. Upon receiving the light from the laser <b>114</b> via the waveguide, the NFT <b>122</b> generates localized heat energy that heats a portion of the media <b>102</b> within or near the write element <b>108</b><i>a, </i>and near the read element <b>108</b><i>b. </i>The anticipated recording temperature is in the range of about 350&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. In the aspect illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the laser directed light is disposed within the writer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and near a trailing edge of the slider. In other aspects, the laser directed light may instead be positioned between the writer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the reader <b>108</b><i>b. </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate a specific example of a HAMR system. In other examples, the magnetic recording medium <b>102</b> with reduce Mg migration according to aspects of the disclosure can be used in other suitable HAMR systems (e.g., with other sliders configured for HAMR).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some aspects, a HAMR medium can include an underlayer (e.g., a MgO seed layer) for growing one or more magnetic recording layers (e.g., FePt magnetic recording layers). However, as described above, Mg may migrate (dissociate) from the seed layer and escape from a surface of the HAMR medium during disk drive operations. The escaped Mg can have an adverse and unexpected effect in a HAMR HDD. For example, the dissociated Mg can adversely affect a head disk interface (e.g., NFT in a slider) when the Mg reacts with a Si compound (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>) on the NFT. The Mg escaped from the HAMR medium can break the Si&#x2014;O bond in SiO<sub>2 </sub>at the NFT, and forms MgO or SiMgO that can peel off from the NFT.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some aspects of the disclosure provide a HAMR medium configured to mitigate Mg migration so as to reduce the quantity of dissociated Mg available to react with the SiO<sub>2 </sub>of an NFT. To that end, the HAMR medium may include a Mg trapping layer to reduce Mg migration from a seed layer. In some aspects, the Mg trapping layer includes a substance or material (e.g., an oxide compound) that can react with the dissociated Mg. The Mg trapping substance or material may be selected to have a bond dissociation energy lower than that of the Si&#x2014;O bond in SiO<sub>2 </sub>of the NFT; therefore, the dissociated Mg reacts with the Mg trapping substance before it can escape from the HAMR medium to react with the SiO<sub>2 </sub>of the NFT. The bond dissociation energy of the Si&#x2014;O bond in SiO<sub>2 </sub>is about 798 kJ/mol. Therefore, the selected Mg trapping substance or material has a bond dissociation energy lower than 798 kJ/mol. In other words, the Mg trapping layer can work as an Mg absorbent. During laser irradiation of a portion of a HAMR medium (e.g., for writing), Mg can diffuse from a MgO seed layer. The diffused Mg ions or atoms can go above and below the MgO seed layer.

The HAMR medium <b>300</b> has a stacked structure with a substrate <b>302</b> at a bottom/base layer, a heat sink layer <b>304</b> on the substrate <b>302</b>, a MgO seed layer <b>306</b> on the heat sink layer <b>304</b>, a Mg trapping layer <b>308</b> on the seed layer <b>306</b>, a magnetic recording layer (MRL) <b>310</b> on the Mg trapping layer <b>308</b>, a capping layer <b>312</b> on the MRL <b>310</b>, an overcoat layer <b>314</b> on the capping layer <b>312</b>, and a lubricant layer <b>316</b> on the overcoat layer <b>314</b>. In some examples, the MRL <b>310</b> may include one or more magnetic recording layers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In some aspects, the substrate <b>302</b> may be made of one or more materials such as an Al alloy, NiP plated Al, glass, glass ceramic, and/or combinations thereof. In some aspects, the heat sink layer <b>304</b> can be made of one or more materials such as Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Cr, Mo, Ru, W, CuZr, MoCu, AgPd, CrRu, CrV, CrW, CrMo, CrNd, NiAl, NiTa, combinations thereof, and/or other suitable materials known in the art. In some aspects, the MgO seed layer <b>306</b> may be made of MgO or other suitable materials known in the art. In one embodiment, the MgO seed layer <b>306</b> has a certain lattice structure that determines or limits a lattice structure of a layer (e.g., Mg trapping layer <b>308</b>) grown/deposited on the MgO seed layer <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In some aspects, the Mg trapping layer <b>308</b> may be made of a Mg trapping compound, for example, TiO, SiO, BaO, HfO, ZrO, MgTiO, MgTiO<sub>2</sub>, MgSiO, MgBaO, MgHfO, MgZrO, or combinations thereof. The Mg trapping compound can react with the Mg ions or atoms dissociated from the MgO seed layer <b>306</b>. The Mg trapping compound may be selected to have a bond dissociation energy lower than that of the Si&#x2014;O bond in SiO<sub>2 </sub>of the NFT; therefore, the dissociated Mg may react with the Mg trapping compound before it can escape from the HAMR medium to react with the SiO<sub>2 </sub>of the NFT. In one embodiment, the Mg trapping compound has a bond dissociation energy lower than about 798 kJ/mol. In some aspects, the Mg trapping layer <b>308</b> may have a thickness that can facilitate coherent growth with a lattice structure substantially matching the MgO seed layer <b>306</b>. Therefore, when the MRL <b>310</b> is grown on the Mg trapping layer <b>308</b>, the lattice mismatch between the MRL <b>310</b> and the MgO seed layer can be reduced or minimized. For example, the MgO seed layer <b>306</b> may have a lattice constant of 4.2 Angstrom.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In one embodiment, the Mg trapping layer <b>308</b> may include a Mg compound (e.g., MgTiO, MgTiO<sub>2</sub>, MgSiO, MgBaO, MgHfO, MgZrO) that contains less than 90 atomic percent Mg (e.g., less than about 90 atomic percent). For example, the Mg compound may include Mg(x)A<sub>(100-x)</sub>O and/or Mg(x)A<sub>(100-x)</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, where A can be Ti, Si, Ba, Hf, and/or Zr, and X is atomic percent in the range of 0%&#x2264;90%. In one aspect, MgNiO, depending on a concentration of Mg contained therein, may be a suitable Mg trapping compound. In one specific example, MgNiO, with Mg concentration at 90 atomic percent or higher, may not be a suitable Mg trapping compound for use in the Mg trapping layer <b>308</b> even if MgNiO may have a bond dissociation energy lower than about 798 kJ/mol. While not bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the high concentration of Mg contained in this MgNiO (e.g., higher than 90 percent) causes the MgNiO layer to be ineffective (or largely ineffective) in trapping Mg, at least as compared to the other materials disclosed above as being suitable Mg trapping layer compounds. Possibly the high concentration of Mg in the MgNiO prevents or inhibits the disassociated Mg ions/atoms from bonding with the NiO within the MgNiO compound.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">In some aspects, the MRL <b>310</b> may be made of FePt or an alloy selected from FePtX, where X is a material selected from Cu, Ni, and combinations thereof. In some aspects, the MRL <b>310</b> may be made of a CoPt alloy. In some aspects, the capping layer <b>312</b> may be made of Co, Pt, or Pd. In one example, the capping layer <b>312</b> can be a bi-layer structure having a top layer including Co and a bottom layer including Pt or Pd. In addition to the Co/Pt and Co/Pd combinations of the top layer and the bottom layer, specific combinations of the top layer materials and the bottom layer materials may include, for example, Co/Au, Co/Ag, Co/Al, Co/Cu, Co/Ir, Co/Mo, Co/Ni, Co/Os, Co/Ru, Co/Ti, Co/V, Fe/Ag, Fe/Au, Fe/Cu, Fe/Mo, Fe/Pd, Ni/Au, Ni/Cu, Ni/Mo, Ni/Pd, Ni/Re, etc. In additional examples, top layer materials and bottom layer materials include any combination of Pt and Pd (e.g., alloys), or any of the following elements, alone or in combination: Au, Ag, Al, Cu, Ir, Mo, Ni, Os, Ru, Ti, V, Fe, Re, and the like. In some aspects, the overcoat layer <b>314</b> may be made of carbon. In one aspect, the lubricant layer <b>316</b> is made of a polymer-based lubricant.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side schematic view of a second HAMR medium <b>400</b> with a Mg trapping layer for reducing Mg migration in accordance with one aspect of the disclosure. The HAMR medium <b>400</b> has a stacked structure similar to the first HAMR medium <b>300</b>. For example, the HAMR medium <b>400</b> has a substrate <b>402</b> at a bottom/base layer, a heat sink layer <b>404</b> on the substrate <b>402</b>, a Mg trapping layer <b>406</b> on the heat sink layer <b>404</b>, a MgO seed layer <b>408</b> on the Mg trapping layer <b>406</b>, a MRL <b>410</b> on the MgO seed layer <b>408</b>, a capping layer <b>412</b> on the MRL <b>410</b>, an overcoat layer <b>414</b> on the capping layer <b>412</b>, and a lubricant layer <b>416</b> on the overcoat layer <b>414</b>. In some examples, the MRL <b>410</b> may include one or more magnetic recording layers. The materials used for the various layers of the HAMR medium <b>400</b> may be the same as or similar to those described above in relation to the HAMR medium <b>300</b>. In HAMR, laser or light irradiation of the HAMR medium <b>400</b> can cause Mg atoms or ions from the MgO seed layer <b>408</b> to diffuse randomly around (i.e., above and below) the MgO seed layer. When some of the diffusing or migrating Mg ions or atoms go below the MgO seed layer, materials in the Mg trapping layer can react with and thereby absorb the migrating Mg atoms or ions. In addition, placing the Mg trapping layer <b>406</b> below the MgO seed layer <b>408</b> may facilitate the ease of growing of the MRL <b>410</b> directly on the MgO seed layer <b>408</b>, for example, with a lattice structure matching the MgO seed layer <b>408</b>. To the contrary, and for reasons related to potential lattice mismatch, it may be more difficult to grow the MRL <b>310</b> directly on the Mg trapping layer <b>308</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In some aspects, the MgO seed layer and the Mg trapping layer of the HAMR medium <b>300</b>/<b>400</b> can be combined or manufactured as a single layer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side schematic view of a third HAMR medium <b>500</b> with a Mg trapping layer for reducing Mg migration in accordance with one aspect of the disclosure.

In some examples, the MRL <b>510</b> may include one or more magnetic recording layers. The materials used for the various layers of the third HAMR medium <b>500</b> may be the same as or similar to those described above in relation to the first and/or second HAMR medium <b>300</b>/<b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">In this example, placing the Mg trapping layer <b>510</b> on the MRL <b>508</b> allows the MRL <b>508</b> to be formed directly on the MgO seed layer <b>506</b> such that it is easier to match the lattice structure of the MRL <b>508</b> with that of the MgO seed layer <b>506</b>.

However, while this configuration provides some Mg trapping, the Mg trapping layer may be more effective when placed above the MgO seed layer (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>) to capture or absorb Mg ions or atoms migrating toward the surface of the HAMR medium.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">The terms &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,' on,&#x201d; and &#x201c;between&#x201d; as used herein refer to a relative position of one layer with respect to other layers.

In block <b>602</b>, the process provides a substrate. In some aspects, the substrate can be made of one or more materials such as an Al alloy, NiP plated Al, glass, glass ceramic, and/or combinations thereof. In block <b>604</b>, the process provides a seed layer on the substrate. In one example, the seed layer may include a MgO seed layer.

In one example, the magnetic recording layer may include one or more magnetic recording layers for storing data magnetically. In block <b>608</b>, the process provides a Mg trapping layer on the substrate. The Mg trapping layer is configured to mitigate Mg migration from the seed layer to a surface of the HAMR medium above the magnetic recording layer. In one example, the Mg trapping layer is between the MRL and the seed layer. In one example, the Mg trapping layer is the seed layer and the substrate or a heat sink layer on the substrate. In one example, the Mg trapping layer is between the MRL layer and a capping layer.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In one aspect, the Mg trapping layer can include an oxide selected from the group consisting of TiO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO, BaO, HfO, ZrO, MgTiO, MgTiO<sub>2</sub>, MgSiO, MgBaO, MgHfO, MgZrO, or combinations thereof. In one aspect, the Mg trapping layer can include a first compound having a first bond dissociation energy that is lower than a second bond dissociation energy of a compound included in a NFT of a slider (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>) for writing data to the HAMR medium.

In this example (which is similar in some aspects to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> where the Mg trapping layer is on the seed layer), the Mg trapping layer <b>700</b> can have a lattice structure matching the lattice structure of the seed layer <b>704</b> (e.g., MgO seed layer). Matching the lattice structure of the Mg trapping layer <b>700</b> and the seed layer <b>704</b> can facilitate the, growing of the recording layer <b>702</b> on the Mg trapping layer <b>700</b> during manufacturing of the HAMR medium.
