When the piezoelectric acceleration sensor senses a vibration signal, its output terminal will generate a charge in direct proportion to a vibration acceleration, which can not only measure the acceleration, speed and displacement of vibration, but also measure some vibration impact signals with larger amplitudes. Because of its small size, light weight, wide frequency band, high reliability, and large dynamic range, the piezoelectric acceleration sensor can be widely applied in the field of vibration measurement.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, for heavy-load, slow-speed rotating equipment, its fault signal is a transient, small-amplitude impact signal, as well as poor lubrication of bearings and other conditions, which cannot be detected by the use of the current vibration sensors and vibration meters, and the detection cannot be achieved by a vibration analysis method. For the detection of these transient signals, the defects of the vibration sensors are obvious, mainly in the following aspects:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. The conventional vibration sensor is of a resonance-reduced type. That is, in order to extract more frequency signals, the original intention for designing a sensor is to absorb the residual vibration, such that a vibration analyzer is mainly used to collect periodic signals, however it is difficult to capture transient fault signals with limited impact energy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. The frequency components of the fault signals are very complex, so they are difficultly limited by the frequency band of the vibration analyzer. Moreover, for analysis of a too wide frequency band, both hardware overhead and software overhead are very large.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">3. Early fault signals are often very small, and are likely to be drowned by external noise. For example, in an actual operating environment of industrial equipment with very noisy environmental noise, in the case, transient signals without characteristic frequencies are difficultly extracted from the environmental noise by the vibration analysis method.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Based on this, the present disclosure aims to provide a detector capable of detecting bearing faults in advance, which can enhance the signal strength and reduce the interference of environmental noise, and can effectively acquire an initial transient signal of a bearing fault and timely generate fault information.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the above objective, the present disclosure provides a detector capable of detecting bearing faults in advance.
