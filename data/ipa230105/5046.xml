id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system includes location indicators, a central computing system, and a mobile scanning device. The location indicators transmit location signals and are arranged in a store that includes stocked items. The central computing system stores an item association table that maps location values to the stocked items. The location values indicate locations of the stocked items in the store. The mobile scanning device receives ordered items from the central computing system, detects location signal(s), and determines a first location value based on the detected location signal(s). The mobile scanning device arranges the ordered items on a display based on the first location value, scans a first ordered item, and transmits data to the central computing system indicating that the first ordered item is associated with the first location value. The central computing system updates the item association table based on the data.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="112.69mm"

Stores may sell a variety of different products or be limited to particular types of products. Example products include dry goods, grocery products, or any other items a customer may purchase. Different stores may have a variety of different sizes and layouts. Some stores may sell tens of thousands of products over a floor space covering tens of thousands of square feet. Stores may be referred to by different names, depending on the types of products sold at the store, the size of the store, the location of the store, and other factors. For example, a store may be referred to as a retail store, a grocery store, a supermarket, a hypermarket, a warehouse, a distribution facility, an outdoor market, or by another name.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Customers may interact with stores in a variety of different ways. In some scenarios, a customer may travel to the store and select products from within the store. Typically, the customer selects the desired products within the store and purchases the products at a checkout section of the store. In other scenarios, a customer may place an order for products from a location remote from the store (e.g., via the Internet or phone). In these scenarios, the purchased products may be shipped from the store to the customer's home.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An order filling system of the present disclosure may be used to fill orders (e.g., customer orders) for a variety of different products.

description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">An order filling system of the present disclosure may be used to fill orders (e.g., customer orders) for a variety of different products. The order filling system may be implemented in a variety of different locations (e.g., a retail store, a warehouse, an outdoor market, etc.). Although the order filling system is generally described herein as being implemented in a store (e.g., a grocery store) to fill customer orders, the order filling system may be implemented in other locations to fill other types of orders. For example, the order filling system may be implemented in a warehouse or other building to fill warehouse orders. As used herein, a &#x201c;store&#x201d; may generally refer to any location (e.g., a retail store, grocery store, warehouse, outdoor market, etc.) in which the order filling system may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The order filling system of the present disclosure may include a central computing system, one or more mobile scanning devices, and a plurality of location indicators. The central computing system may receive electronic customer orders from customer computing devices via a computer network, such as the Internet. Customer computing devices may include any type of computing device used by customers to place orders with the central computing system. For example, customer computing devices may include cell phones, tablet computers, laptop computers, desktop computers, or other computing devices. Each of the customer orders may include one or more items. An item may generally refer to any type of product that may be picked from the store. For example, an item may be a food product, a personal hygiene product, an electronic product, or any other product in inventory in the store.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The central computing system, which may be located within the store, may wirelessly transmit the customer orders to the one or more mobile scanning devices. For example, the central computing system may include wireless communication functionality (e.g., Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, etc.) for wirelessly transmitting the customer orders to the mobile scanning devices. The mobile scanning devices, which may be transported throughout the store by users, may wirelessly receive the customer orders and display the customer orders to the users so that the users may fill the customer orders transmitted to the mobile scanning devices. In general, the users may be employees (e.g., store employees) that transport the mobile scanning devices around the store while filling the customer orders displayed on displays of the mobile scanning devices. In some examples, the mobile scanning devices may be configured to be held in the users' hands. In other examples, the mobile scanning devices may be placed in carts (e.g., a shopping cart, basket, or similar cart for carrying items) and may be pushed around the store by users while the users gather items to fill customer orders. In still other examples, the mobile scanning devices may be configured to attach to a user (e.g., around the forearm of a user or as a display worn on a user's head).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The users may begin filling the customer orders by gathering (i.e., picking) the items displayed on the mobile scanning devices. After gathering the items, one or more of the users may assemble (e.g., pack) the customer orders from the gathered items. Subsequently, the customer that placed the customer order with the central computing system may receive the filled customer order. In some examples, the customer may pick up the filled customer order at the store. In other examples, the filled customer order may be delivered to the customer (e.g., at the customer's home).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The location indicators may be arranged throughout the store. In general, the location indicators may be any object or device that indicates a location within the store. In some examples, the location indicators may generate location signals. For example, the location indicators may wirelessly transmit the location signals. The mobile scanning devices may receive the transmitted location signals and determine a location within the store based on the detected location signals. The location indicators may transmit location signals in a variety of different ways, and the mobile scanning devices may be configured to detect the transmitted location signals in a variety of different ways. Example location indicators, location signals, and detection of the location signals by a mobile scanning device are described hereinafter in more detail. Although location indicators may transmit location signals in some examples, in other examples, location indicators may be objects that may be read by the mobile scanning devices. For example, the location indicators may be barcodes attached to racks in the store. Although mobile scanning devices may determine a location within the store based on location signals generated by location indicators within the store, in other examples, the mobile scanning devices may determine a location within the store in response to signals generated outside of the store, e.g., in response to global positioning system (GPS) signals received from GPS satellites. In still other examples, mobile scanning devices may determine a location value within the store using other technologies. For example, mobile scanning devices may determine a location value using a WiFi signal transmitted within the store.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Mobile scanning devices may have a variety of different configurations. For example, mobile scanning devices may have a variety of different form factors and different functionalities, depending on how the order filling system is implemented in the store. As described above, the mobile scanning devices may have handheld form factors and/or be configured to be placed in carts and pushed by a user. Example form factors are illustrated and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-<b>26</b>I</figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The mobile scanning devices may include wireless communication functionality (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, etc.) for communicating with the central computing system, other mobile scanning devices, and other wireless devices. For example, the mobile scanning devices may receive customer orders wirelessly from the central computing system and indicate to the central computing system and/or other mobile scanning devices when items from the customer orders have been scanned.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A mobile scanning device may also include a display for displaying information to the user. In some examples, the display may be a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, an electrophoretic display, or other display technology. For example, a mobile scanning device having a handheld form factor may include an LCD display. In other examples, a mobile scanning device having a head-mounted form factor may include a head-mounted display.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The display of a mobile scanning device may display the items of the customer orders to the users. Additionally, the display of a mobile scanning device may display other information to the users other than the customer orders. The users may view the items displayed on the displays and subsequently pick the items from racks or other containers in the store. The users may then scan the items (e.g., scan barcodes on the items) and take the items to an area in the store (e.g., a collection area) where the orders may be bagged for customer pickup or delivery.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The mobile scanning devices may be configured to detect the location signals transmitted from the location indicators and perform various operations in response to detection of the location signals. In one sense, the location signals received by a mobile scanning device may be thought of as indicating a location within the store. For example, assuming that a first aisle of the store includes a first location indicator that transmits a first location signal and a second aisle includes a second location indicator that transmits a second location signal, a mobile scanning device located in the first/second aisle may determine that it is located in the first/second aisle when the mobile scanning device detects the first/second location signal. The location signals may also be thought of as signals that indicate which items of the store are in proximity to a mobile scanning device. For example, since each of the items in the store may be associated with one or more location signals (i.e., a location value), a mobile scanning device may, upon detection of a location signal, determine which items are in the vicinity of the mobile scanning device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A mobile scanning device may determine a location within, or outside of, the store. In some examples, a mobile scanning device may determine a location value based on detected location signals. A location value may generally refer to any value or plurality of values (e.g., alphanumeric values) determined by a mobile scanning device that indicate a location of the mobile scanning device within, or outside of, the store. The location values determined by a mobile scanning device may depend on the types of location indicators used in the store. A variety of example location indicators and example location signals are described herein. In examples where the location indicators do not transmit location signals, a mobile scanning device may determine location values in a different manner. For example, when location indicators are readable objects (e.g., barcodes), a mobile scanning device may determine a location value and a location within the store based on a code included on the readable object.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, a customer order may include one or more items. For example, an item included in a customer order may be any product that a customer may purchase at the store. In some examples, the customer order may include a plurality of grocery items such as cereal, canned food, chicken, milk, ice cream, eggs, fruits, vegetables, etc. In some examples, a customer order may include other items available at a retail store such as personal hygiene items (e.g., shampoo, razor blades, and soap). A customer order may also include items such as movies, videogames, and electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">An item identification code (hereinafter &#x201c;item ID code&#x201d;) may generally refer to any code (e.g., alphanumeric or other type of code) that may be associated with an item that serves to identify that item (e.g., uniquely identifies the item). Each item in the store may be identified by an item ID code. In some examples, an item ID code may be a barcode (e.g., 1 or 2 dimensional barcode) on an item. The barcode may be printed on packaging of the item or printed on a sticker attached to packaging of the item. In other examples, the item ID code may be a code retrieved from a radio-frequency identification (RFID) device (e.g., an RFID tag or other RFID form factor) attached to packaging of the item or included in packaging of the item. In still other examples, the item ID code may be a number (e.g., a product look-up code) attached to the item that may be entered manually by a user. Such a code may be used to identify produce items (e.g., fruits and vegetables), for example.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A mobile scanning device may acquire an item ID code in a variety of different ways, depending on the type of item ID code associated with the item. As described above, an item ID code may be acquired from a barcode, an RFID tag, or may be manually entered by a user. In some examples, a mobile scanning device may include a scanning module configured to scan barcodes to retrieve the item ID code. In some examples, a mobile scanning device may include a scanning module configured to acquire item ID codes from RFID tags. In some examples, a mobile scanning device may include a user interface (e.g., touchscreen and/or buttons) configured to receive user input, such as manually entered item ID codes. Although item ID codes may be a barcode, RFID, or a manually entered code in some examples, it is contemplated that other types of item ID codes may be implemented. It is also contemplated that a mobile scanning device may be configured to acquire other types of item ID codes.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A customer order may be identified by a customer order identification number (hereinafter &#x201c;order ID number&#x201d;). An order ID number may generally refer to any code (e.g., alphanumeric or other type of code) that may be associated with a customer order that serves to identify that customer order (e.g., uniquely identifies the customer order). In some examples, the central computing system may assign each customer order a different order ID number that may uniquely identify that customer order. Each of the items included in a customer order may also be associated with the order ID number.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A mobile scanning device may acquire location signals as the mobile scanning device is transported throughout the store by a user. The location indicators may be set up throughout the store in a variety of different configurations. In some examples, the location indicators may be set up in the store such that the mobile scanning device may pick up a location signal at any location within the store. In these examples, the location indicators may be set up such that the location signals generated by the location indicators overlap to varying degrees such that a mobile scanning device may acquire multiple location signals simultaneously in some locations. Additionally, or alternatively, the location indicators may be arranged such that the location signals do not quite overlap, but, instead, the location signals may abut one another or be separated by a short distance such that a mobile scanning device may detect a first location signal in a first location and then abruptly detect a second location signal upon moving out of range of the first location signal. In other examples, the location indicators may be set up such that a mobile scanning device may not pick up location signals at some locations within the store. In these examples, there may be &#x201c;dead zones&#x201d; in which a mobile scanning device may not acquire location signals because location signals may be absent in that location, or not be sufficiently strong in that location. Various configurations of location indicators within a store are illustrated and described herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A mobile scanning device may perform a variety of different operations based on the location value determined by the mobile scanning device. As described above, a mobile scanning device may receive customer orders from the central computing system as the mobile scanning device is being transported throughout the store. In some examples, a mobile scanning device may be configured to arrange the items of received customer orders on a display of the mobile scanning device based on the currently determined location value. For example, the mobile scanning device may be configured to place the items in proximity to the scanning device at the top of the display for the user to view.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The items in locations that are not in proximity to the user (i.e., more distant from the user) may be placed at a location lower down on the display (e.g., near the bottom of the display). In examples where a large number of items are ordered, the items that are more distant from the user may be omitted from the display. Accordingly, in some examples, the items that are in closer proximity to the user may be displayed at the top of the display while those items that are more distant from the user may be placed at the bottom of the display or not included on the display. Such an arrangement of items on a mobile scanning device display may prompt the user to pick items from the racks that are closest to the user. This may speed up the picking process by prompting a user to pick those items that may be picked the quickest and preventing the user from walking by items that are currently ordered by a customer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The display of a mobile scanning device may be updated in real-time as the mobile scanning device is moved throughout the store. For example, the arrangement of the items listed on the display may be updated as the user moves the mobile scanning device from a first location where a first location signal is detected by the mobile scanning device to a second location where a second location signal is detected by the mobile scanning device. In this example, the items on the display may be rearranged in real-time to reflect which items are currently in proximity to the user after the user has moved to the second location. Since the displayed items may vary based on the location of the mobile scanning device, it follows that, in some examples, different mobile scanning devices in different locations of the store may display different arrangements of items to the different users.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, the display of a mobile scanning device may also be updated in real-time when new customer orders are received. For example, if a newly received customer order includes items that are in the store at the current location of a mobile scanning device, the display of that mobile scanning device may be updated to include the items of the newly received order at or near the top of the display of the mobile scanning device. This may prevent a user from walking past an item that has just been ordered (e.g., ordered within the past few seconds).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some examples, the display of a mobile scanning device may also be updated in real-time when items are scanned by the mobile scanning device. For example, an item may be removed from the display of the mobile scanning device when the mobile scanning device scans the item. In some examples, the displays of multiple mobile scanning devices may be updated in real-time when items are scanned by any one of the multiple mobile scanning devices. For example, when an item is scanned by any one of the multiple mobile scanning devices, the item may be removed from the displays of all the mobile scanning devices in the store. In these examples, all the mobile scanning devices may be updated each time any of the mobile scanning devices in the store scans an ordered item. This may allow multiple users located throughout the store to scan and pick different items of a single customer order. In some circumstances this may allow customer orders to be picked more quickly than if a single user was picking the entire order.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example implementation of an order filling system implemented in a store <b>100</b>.

In some examples, location indicators <b>126</b> may include a light emitting device (e.g., an LED or other photonic devices) that transmit location signals. In some examples, location indicators <b>126</b> may include an acoustic device that transmits location signals (e.g., sound waves).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The distance over which location indicators <b>126</b> transmit location signals <b>128</b>, and the area covered by location signals <b>128</b>, may vary depending on a variety of different factors including, but not limited to, the amount of power used to generate location signals <b>128</b>, the location of location indicators <b>126</b> within store <b>100</b>, and the technology included in location indicators <b>126</b> (e.g., an antenna, an LED, or acoustic device). In some examples, location indicators <b>126</b> may be configured to transmit location signals <b>128</b> over a relatively short distance and a small area within store <b>100</b>. In other examples, location indicators <b>126</b> may be configured to transmit location signals <b>128</b> over longer distances and larger areas within store <b>100</b>. For example, location indicators <b>126</b> may be configured to transmit location signals <b>128</b> from a few centimeters up to distances of tens of meters (e.g., 100 meters). In some examples, location indicators <b>126</b> may transmit location signals <b>128</b> along the length of an aisle or even across the length of store <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Location indicators <b>126</b> may transmit location signals <b>128</b> in a variety of different patterns which are described hereinafter with respect to location indicator <b>126</b>-<b>1</b>.

For example, location indicator <b>126</b>-<b>1</b> may include an antenna that radiates location signals having lobes and nulls. In other examples, location indicator <b>126</b>-<b>1</b> may transmit location signal <b>128</b>-<b>1</b> in nearly all directions. For example, location indicator <b>126</b>-<b>1</b> may include an antenna that generally radiates in all directions, or an LED that emits light in nearly all directions. It is contemplated that the directionality and power of the location signals may be adjusted to adjust the area of store <b>100</b> covered by the location signals. For example, the amount of power used to generate a location signal may be increased in order to transmit the location signal a greater distance.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The location of location indicators <b>126</b> within store <b>100</b> may affect the distance and area covered by location signals <b>128</b>.

At <b>1002</b>, the central computing system receives a customer order from customer computing devices. At <b>1004</b>, the central computing system wirelessly transmits the customer order to one or more mobile scanning devices via the communication system. At <b>1006</b>, the mobile scanning devices are transported throughout the store <b>100</b> by users that scan items of the customer order. The users may pick the items from the racks before scanning the items. The users may place the items in a cart after scanning the items.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">If the customer order has not been picked at <b>1008</b>, the users may continue picking the customer order until the entire customer order is picked. At <b>1010</b>, the users may assemble the items from the customer order (e.g., in a collection area of the store <b>100</b>) and pack the items of the customer order, e.g., in grocery bags and/or boxes. At <b>1012</b>, the filled customer order is provided to the customer. For example, the filled customer order may be picked up by the customer at the store <b>100</b>. In other examples, the filled customer order may be delivered to the customer's home.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> is a method <b>1020</b> that describes operation of a mobile scanning device configured to receive location signals. At <b>1022</b>, the mobile scanning device receives one or more customer orders via a communication module. At <b>1024</b>, the mobile scanning device receives one or more location signals. For example, the location detection module detects one or more location signals. At <b>1026</b>, the mobile scanning device determines a location value based on the one or more received location signals. For example, the location detection module determines a location value based on the one or more received location signals.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">At <b>1028</b>, the mobile scanning device may determine the distance of each of the items from the mobile scanning device (i.e., the user). For example, the mobile scanning device may determine which items are nearest to the mobile scanning device and which items are farthest from the mobile scanning device. The mobile scanning device may determine the location of items relative to the mobile scanning device using a location map of the store and the associations between the items and location values.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">At <b>1030</b>, the mobile scanning device arranges the items on the display. In general, the mobile scanning device may arrange the displayed items such that the items in proximity to the mobile scanning device (i.e., in proximity to the user) are viewable by the user on the display. In one example, the mobile scanning device may arrange items on the display such that those items in proximity to the user are more prominently displayed than those items that are farther away from the mobile scanning device. For example, the mobile scanning device may display items in the current area at the top of the display. Additionally, or alternatively, the mobile scanning device may display the items in bold and/or colored text to indicate those items that are in proximity to the user. In some implementations, the mobile scanning device may arrange items on the display based on the number of junctions between the user and the items. For example, the mobile scanning device may display items more prominently that are separated from the user by a smaller number of junctions. In some implementations, the mobile scanning device may arrange items on the display based on the number of junctions between the user and the items along with the number of items in a particular area. For example, the mobile scanning device may tend to display items that are closer to the user more prominently, unless many items are located in another direction at a slightly longer distance. In this manner, the mobile scanning device may persuade the user to pick the largest amount of items in the smallest amount of time.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Method <b>1020</b> may continue at <b>1024</b> as the mobile scanning device is moved throughout the store. For example, while picking the one or more received customer orders, the mobile scanning device may be moved into areas of the store that receive different location signals.

In general, the mobile scanning device may arrange the displayed items such that the items in proximity to the mobile scanning device (i.e., in proximity to the user) are viewable by the user on the display. In one example, the mobile scanning device may arrange items on the display such that those items in proximity to the user are more prominently displayed than those items that are farther away from the mobile scanning device. Method <b>1040</b> may continue at <b>1044</b> as the mobile scanning device is moved throughout the store and new location indicators are scanned. For example, while picking the one or more received customer orders, the mobile scanning device may be moved into areas of the store in which the mobile scanning device scans different readable codes. The mobile scanning device may determine a new location value based on the different readable codes and update the display (e.g., in real-time) to reflect the distance of items from the mobile scanning device at the new location.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> is a method <b>1060</b> that describes operation of a mobile scanning device when items are picked by the mobile scanning device and other mobile scanning devices. The method <b>1060</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. At <b>1062</b>, the central computing system receives one or more customer orders from customer computing devices and transmits the one or more customer orders to the mobile scanning devices via the communication system. At <b>1064</b>, the first mobile scanning device scans an item ID code of one of the items included in the customer orders. At <b>1066</b>, the first mobile scanning device updates the status of the items in memory to indicate that the item has been scanned.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">At <b>1068</b>, the first mobile scanning device transmits an indication that the item has been scanned. For example, the first mobile scanning device may indicate to the central computing system that the item has been scanned. In turn, the central computing system may indicate to the second mobile scanning device that the item has been scanned so that the second mobile scanning device may update the status of items in memory of the second mobile scanning device. In other examples, the first mobile scanning device may transmit the indication directly to the second mobile scanning device.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">At <b>1070</b>, the first mobile scanning device determines whether other items have been scanned by the second mobile scanning device. The first mobile scanning device may determine that other items have been scanned by the second mobile scanning device when the first mobile scanning device receives an indication (e.g., from the central computing system) that the second mobile scanning device has scanned other items. If the second mobile scanning device has not scanned any other items, method <b>1060</b> may continue in block <b>1074</b>. If the second mobile scanning device has scanned other items, the first mobile scanning device may update the status of items in memory in block <b>1072</b> to indicate that the other items have been picked, e.g., based on indications received from the central computing system. At <b>1074</b>, the first mobile scanning device may update the display to indicate which items have been scanned. For example, the first mobile scanning device may remove the scanned item(s) from the display.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">As described above, each of the items in the store may be associated with a location value. The associations between items and location values may be represented herein as an item association table (e.g., item association tables <b>3710</b>, <b>3712</b>, <b>3714</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b>B, <b>37</b>C, <b>37</b>E</figref>). Item association tables (e.g., one or more of the same/similar versions of item association tables) may be stored in memory of the central computing system and/or one or more mobile scanning devices. In implementations where the central computing system stores an item association table, the central computing system can transmit the item association table to the one or more mobile scanning devices in order to update the item association tables used by the mobile scanning devices. In some implementations, the central computing system may transmit the item association tables to the mobile scanning devices at preselected time intervals (e.g., at periodic intervals). Additionally, or alternatively, the central computing system may transmit the item association tables to the mobile scanning devices in response to updates to the item association table stored at the central computing system. For example, if the central computing system updates an item association table (e.g., in response to updates from one or more mobile scanning devices), the central computing system may transmit the updated item association table to the mobile scanning devices in response to the recent update. In some implementations, the mobile scanning devices can request the updated item association table from the central computing system. For example, the mobile scanning devices may be configured to request an up-to-date item association table upon powering up (e.g., from a standby or off state).</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">In some implementations, a mobile scanning device can request the updated item association table from the central computing system. The mobile scanning device may be configured to receive manual input from the user that causes the mobile scanning device to request the item association table. For example, a mobile scanning device may receive a user input (e.g., on a touchscreen of the mobile scanning device) that instructs the mobile scanning device to request the updated item association table. In some examples, the mobile scanning device may present the user with an interactive GUI button or other user input (e.g., via a mechanical button) that causes the mobile scanning device to request an update of the item association table from the central computing system.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">In some implementations, the mobile scanning device may be configured to automatically request the item association table from the central computing system. For example, the mobile scanning device may be configured to request the item association table from the central computing system at preset times (e.g., periodically or after a threshold amount of time has passed since a most recent update of the item association table stored on the mobile scanning device). A mobile scanning device may automatically request the item association table in response to other events. For example, a mobile scanning device may automatically request an item association table in response to powering on after the mobile scanning device has been in an off state or a standby state.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">In some cases, the mobile scanning devices may not be devices that are owned by the store operator and/or stored at the store. For example, the mobile scanning devices used in the store may be brought into the store by third parties and used to pick items for customer orders with the third parties. The third parties may include businesses that provide item delivery services (e.g., grocery delivery services) to customers. These third parties may receive customer orders via the internet, store the customer orders on a third party computing system, and transfer the customer orders to the third party mobile scanning devices. Upon entering a store with a third party mobile scanning device, the mobile scanning device may be configured to request the item association table from the central computing system (e.g., via an internet connection with the central computing system and/or via a local wireless connection). In some cases, the central computing system is configured to communicate with a third party computing system and may transmit updated item association tables to the third party computing system (e.g., in response to requests from the third party computing system) so that the third party computing system may store an updated version of the store's item association table.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">A third party mobile scanning device may request an item association table from the third party computing system (e.g., via the internet). Additionally, or alternatively, the third party mobile scanning device may request an item association table from the central computing system. The central computing system may respond to the request from the third party mobile scanning device (e.g., via the internet, or wirelessly in the store) by transmitting an item association table to the third party mobile scanning device. A third party mobile scanning device can make a request for an updated item association table (e.g., from the central computing system and/or the third party computing system) in response to a variety of events. In some implementations, a third party mobile scanning device may make a request automatically in response to the current location of the third party mobile scanning device. For example, a third party mobile scanning device can be configured to request an item association table based on the proximity of the third party mobile scanning device relative to the store. In one example, a third party mobile scanning device may be configured to request an item association table in response to being located within a predetermined distance of the store, such as upon coming within a predetermined distance from the store or entering the store. The third party mobile scanning device may determine location and/or proximity to the store based on a GPS determined location (e.g., from a GPS receiver of the device), based on a wireless connection established in the store (e.g., a WIFI connection between the third party mobile scanning device and the central computing system), and/or based on some other form of location determination. In some implementations, the store may include store indicators (e.g., barcodes, QR codes, RFID tags, or other indicators) that may uniquely identify the store to a third party mobile scanning device. Such store indicators may be placed at one or more entry points of the store for example. In these implementations, the third party mobile scanning device can scan the store indicator and then request the item association table for the store corresponding to the store indicator.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">In some implementations, the third party users may manually request the item association table for the store (e.g., using a GUI of the third party mobile scanning device). As another example, a third party scanning device may automatically request an item association table for a store in response to the third party user selecting the store as the next store from which to pick (e.g., from a group of stores).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">In some cases, shoppers at a store (e.g., a grocery store) may use their own devices (referred to herein as &#x201c;personal scanning devices&#x201d;) to assist in routing them throughout the store. As described herein, the personal scanning devices can include similar functionality to the mobile scanning devices that allows the personal scanning devices to interact with the order filling system (e.g., the central computing system and the location indicators). For example, the personal scanning devices may include wireless communication functionality (e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth) for communicating with the central computing system, location signal detection functionality (e.g., Bluetooth receivers for detecting Bluetooth based location signals and/or light detection functionality such as a camera), and item ID scanning functionality (e.g., a camera). Example personal scanning devices may include computing devices having a variety of different form factors including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and any other handheld or wearable device. A personal scanning device may execute an application (e.g., a native application installed on the personal scanning device) or access a web application that performs similar functionality attributed to the mobile scanning devices herein (e.g., the personal scanning device may receive location signals, scan barcodes, determines location values, store a location map, and organize items on the display based on the location of the items relative to the user). The application executing on the personal scanning devices may be provided to the personal scanning devices by the operator of the store (e.g., via a download from an application distribution platform, such as Google Play or Apple iTunes).</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">As described above, different parties may use mobile scanning devices to pick customer orders. For example, employees of the store may use mobile scanning devices to pick customer orders. Additionally, or alternatively, third party users (e.g., employees of a third party) may use mobile scanning devices (e.g., owned by the third parties or the store owners) to pick customer orders. Customers may also use their own devices as personal scanning devices to pick their own orders. In some implementations of the order filling system, any of these parties may pick orders within the same store at the same time, or at different times. In other cases, the order filling system may be configured to only allow certain parties to pick items.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">As described above, mobile scanning devices can request updated item association tables from the central computing system. As described herein, the mobile scanning devices may also request other data from the central computing system, such as updated location maps (e.g., at preset times and/or in response to a user command). In some implementations, the central computing system may request location maps from the mobile scanning devices (e.g., at preset times).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">In some circumstances, items may not be associated with location values. In one example, items may not yet be associated with location values when the location indicators are initially placed in the store. This example may occur when a store is initially equipped with the order filling system, e.g., location indicators, mobile scanning devices, and the central computing system. In another example, items that have been newly added to the racks of the store may not yet be associated with location values.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">In other circumstances described herein, items may be associated with an incorrect association value. For example, an item may initially be associated with a first location value when the item is placed in a first location in the store. Later, the item may be moved to a different place in the store that is associated with a different location. In these circumstances, the location value associated with an item may be updated. Different ways to associate items with a location value and update the associations are described herein.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">Items may be associated with location values using a variety of different techniques. In some examples, associations between items and location values may be entered manually by a user. For example, a user may manually populate an item association table using a computing device, such as a desktop computer, laptop computer, a mobile scanning device, etc. Put another way, a computing device (e.g., a mobile scanning device or other computing device) may be configured to receive manual input from a user, generate associations between items and location values based on the manual input, and store the associations at the central computing system. In some implementations, a user may use a keyboard (e.g., on a mobile scanning device or other computing device), a touchscreen computing device, or similar device, to populate the item association table. For example, a user may place location indicators in a store and manually associate items with location values that will be determined in proximity to the items. In a more specific example, when a location indicator includes a readable code, a user may place the location indicator on a rack, and then manually associate each of the items on the rack with the location value that is determined based on the readable code of the location indicator. In another specific example, when a location indicator transmits a location signal, a user may place the location indicator on a rack, and then manually associate each of the items near the area where the location signal will be transmitted to the location value that will be determined based on detection of the location signal.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">Generating an item association table manually (e.g., manually entered into a user interface on a computing device), as described above, may be a somewhat cumbersome process because a store may include thousands of items. Additionally, a user may be prone to errors when manually generating an item association table. Manual generation of an item association table may also be somewhat inaccurate in examples where location indicators transmit signals because a user may not accurately predict exactly where location signals will be transmitted. Although it is contemplated that item association tables including a large number of items could be manually generated, other techniques for generating item association tables described herein may prove more effective. Although other techniques may prove more effective than manually entering item associations, manually entering some item associations may be effective in cases where a few item associations are to be made.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">An item association table may be generated automatically (e.g., using an item association mode and/or during normal picking). In some examples, a user may set the mobile scanning device into an &#x201c;item association mode&#x201d; causing the mobile scanning device to generate the item association table by determining location values and scanning items. In general, an &#x201c;item association mode&#x201d; may refer to a state (e.g., a mode of operation) of a mobile scanning device which may be selected by a user to generate one or more associations between items and location values. A user may set a mobile scanning device into the item association mode using the touchscreen display of the mobile scanning device and/or the user interface, for example.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">When operating in an item association mode, the mobile scanning device may determine a location value and associate that location value with a scanned item. In examples where a store includes location indicators having readable codes, the user may first use the mobile scanning device to scan the location indicator to determine a location value. Next, the user may begin using the mobile scanning device to scan item ID codes. For example, the user may scan a plurality of item ID codes after scanning the location indicator. The mobile scanning device may then associate each of the scanned item ID codes with the location value determined from the location indicator. Generating an item association table in this manner may be faster than manually generating an item association table because a user may quickly scan item ID codes after scanning a single location indicator. Instead of first scanning a location indicator and then scanning item ID codes, in other examples, a user may use the mobile scanning device to scan a plurality of item ID codes and then scan an associated location indicator in order to associate the scanned item ID codes with the later scanned location indicator.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">When operating in an item association mode in a store that includes location indicators that transmit location signals, the mobile scanning device may determine a location value based on one or more received location signals and associate scanned item ID codes with the currently determined location value. Since the mobile scanning device may acquire location signals without additional user action, the user may freely walk through the store and scan a plurality of item ID codes to generate an item association table. For example, the mobile scanning device may associate scanned item ID codes with a first location value determined in a first location. When the mobile scanning device is moved to a second location where the mobile scanning device determines a second location value, the mobile scanning device may associate scanned item ID codes with the second location value. Generating an item association table in this manner may be faster than manually generating an item association table because a user may quickly scan item ID codes without scanning a location indicator.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">In some examples, a mobile scanning device may generate and/or update an item association table without the user selecting a specific &#x201c;item association mode.&#x201d; Instead, the mobile scanning device may generate an item association table while the mobile scanning device is being used to pick items of customer orders. For example, if a mobile scanning device receives a customer order including a first item that is not associated with a location value (or associated with an incorrect location value), the mobile scanning device may generate an entry in an item association table for the first item when the mobile scanning device scans the item ID code of the first item. The generated entry in the item association table may include the scanned item ID code and the currently determined location value.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A-<b>39</b>C</figref> illustrate displays of mobile scanning devices which may be viewed by a user while generating an item association table. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A-<b>39</b>B</figref> illustrate displays of mobile scanning devices that are set in an item association mode.

Instead, the mobile scanning device may generate an item association table during normal item picking described herein. For example, a mobile scanning device may receive a customer order, display the customer order to the user, and generate the item association table as the user picks and scans items of a customer order. The image on the display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>C</figref> may be an image displayed by a mobile scanning device during normal picking of a customer order, as described above.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>C</figref>, it may be assumed that a customer order including items 1-6 has been placed with a central computing system and that the customer order has been received by the mobile scanning device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>C</figref>. The display displays items 1-6 of the customer order to indicate to the user that items 1-6 should be picked. The mobile scanning device may be configured to generate associations in an item association table when the user scans the item ID codes of items 1-6 of the customer order. For example, the mobile scanning device may generate an association between item 1 and the currently determined location value (e.g., based on a last scanned readable code or most recently received location signal) when the mobile scanning device scans the item ID code of item 1. Similarly, the mobile scanning device may generate an association between item 2 and the currently determined location value when the mobile scanning device scans the item ID code of item 2. Accordingly, the mobile scanning device may have generated associations between items 1-6 and their respective location values after the user has scanned all of items 1-6. The mobile scanning device may transmit the item associations to the central computing system so the central computing system can update the stored item association table.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Generating associations in an association table while picking items, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>C</figref>, may provide a positive user experience because the item association table may be generated without the user initiating any additional modes (e.g., an item association mode).

In some implementations, the order filling system may update the item association table for each scan of an item that indicates the item has been moved to a new location. For example, if an item ID code is initially associated with a first location value, then the order filling system determines that the item has been scanned in a new location, the system may update the item association table to reflect that the item is located at the new location. Similarly, if a new item is scanned that has not been previously included in the most recent item association table, the system may update the item association table to include the new item the first time the new item ID is scanned.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">In some implementations, instead of updating the item association table after a single item scan (e.g., a new item and/or a moved item), the order filling system may require that the items be scanned a number of times (e.g., a threshold number) before updating the item association table. For example, the system (e.g., mobile scanning device and/or central computing system) may be configured to update the location of an item in the item association table in response to determining that the item has been scanned at a location greater than a threshold number of times (e.g., greater than 3 times). In some implementations, the order filling system may require that the item be scanned a threshold number of times consecutively. In other implementations, the order filling system may update the item association table to include the most detected location value for the item (e.g., the location value in which the item ID code was most scanned). In a similar manner, the order filling system may require that a new item be scanned a threshold number of times before being entered into the system. Putting restrictions on updating the item association table (e.g., requiring a number of scans) may help maintain a stable and accurate order filling system that rejects outlying item scans (e.g., in scenarios where a user pick up an item and does not scan the item until the item has been moved a great distance throughout the store).</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> shows an example method <b>3800</b> for generating and updating an item association table.

In one example, area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> abuts area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;. In this example, areas <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> and &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; are not separated by any dead zone because location signals overlap at the intersection of the two areas. In another example, area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> abuts area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b>. In this example, areas <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> and <b>280</b>-<b>7</b> are separated by a short dead zone in which location signals may not be present at detectable levels.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">The size of a dead zone between two adjacent areas may vary. In one example, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b> are separated by a short dead zone. In another example, area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>280</b>-<b>2</b> are separated by a larger dead zone. As another example, the dead zone between area <b>280</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>280</b>-<b>10</b> is smaller than that between areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>2</b>, but larger than that between areas <b>280</b>-<b>6</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>7</b>. Accordingly, adjacent areas of a store may abut one another or be separated by a dead zone.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">As described above, the location adjacency criteria may be used to determine whether two areas are adjacent to one another. In general, two areas may be considered adjacent to one another when the areas abut one another or when the two areas are separated by a relatively short dead zone. Qualitatively, two areas may be considered adjacent when the dead zones between the areas are small or non-existent. Two areas are more likely to be considered non-adjacent by the order filling system when the two areas are separated by larger dead zones. The location adjacency criteria may be used by the order filling system to determine whether two areas are considered adjacent to one another.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">A first location adjacency criterion may be based on whether two areas include common location values (e.g., are covered by common location signals). For example, if two areas include a common location value, then those two areas may be adjacent. Such a scenario arises when an area is defined by two overlapping signals. In this scenario, three different areas may be defined by two different location signals that overlap. The area in which the location signals overlap may be adjacent to each of the areas defined only by the single non-overlapping portions of the location signals. An example of three such areas are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, areas <b>280</b>-<b>5</b>, &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;, <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> are defined by two different location signals that overlap. Area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; may be adjacent to area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> because location value <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> is common to both area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> and &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;. Similarly, area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; may be adjacent to area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> because location value <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> is common to both area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> and &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;. Accordingly, area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; may be adjacent to both areas <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>280</b>-<b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">Another location adjacency criterion may be an amount of time between detection of two different areas in the store. In general, a mobile scanning device may determine that first and second areas are adjacent when the amount of time between detecting the two areas is less than a threshold amount of time. In one example, the mobile scanning device may determine that first and second areas are adjacent when the mobile scanning device detects the second area within a threshold amount of time after detecting the first area. Similarly, the mobile scanning device may determine that first and second areas are adjacent when the mobile scanning device detects the first area within a threshold amount of time after detecting the second area.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">In examples where a mobile scanning device uses a threshold amount of time to determine whether two areas are adjacent, the threshold amount of time may be selectable (e.g., by an operator of the order filling system or another user). In general, a smaller threshold amount of time may require two areas to be closer to one another to be considered adjacent. A larger threshold amount of time may allow two areas that are farther apart to be considered adjacent.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">In the example of adjacent areas <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> and &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; described above, a mobile scanning device may detect area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> immediately after detecting area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;. Similarly, a mobile scanning device may detect area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; immediately after detecting area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b>. Accordingly, a mobile scanning device may determine that area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> and area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; are adjacent for even small thresholds of time because the mobile scanning device may detect area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> immediately after detecting area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;. Similarly, a mobile scanning device may determine that area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> and area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d; are adjacent for even small thresholds of time because the mobile scanning device may detect area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> immediately after detecting area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">Although areas may be immediately adjacent (e.g., not separated by a dead zone) as described with respect to areas <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> and &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>5</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>6</b>&#x201d;, in some examples, areas separated by dead zones may be considered adjacent. In examples where two areas are separated by a dead zone, the magnitude of the threshold amount of time may determine the amount of dead zone allowed between two areas that are considered adjacent.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">Dead zones of different sizes are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The size of the dead zone present between area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b> is negligible. The dead zone present between area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b> may be short enough that a mobile scanning device detects area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b> immediately upon exiting area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b>. Put another way, the dead zone present between area <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b> may be so small that areas <b>280</b>-<b>6</b> abuts area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b>. Similarly, the dead zone present between area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>8</b> may be short enough that a mobile scanning device detects area <b>280</b>-<b>8</b> immediately upon exiting area <b>280</b>-<b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">A relatively short dead zone <b>281</b>-<b>1</b> is located between area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>2</b>. Similarly, a relatively short dead zone <b>281</b>-<b>3</b> is located between area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> and area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>9</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>10</b>&#x201d;. A user may move a mobile scanning device from area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> to area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>9</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>10</b>&#x201d;, or from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>2</b>, on the order of one or more seconds (e.g., 1-3 seconds). Similarly, a user may move a mobile scanning device from area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> to area &#x201c;<b>280</b>-<b>9</b>+<b>280</b>-<b>10</b>&#x201d;, or from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>2</b>, on the order of one or more seconds (1-3 seconds). A slightly larger dead zone is illustrated between area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> (e.g., on the side of rack <b>268</b>-<b>1</b> that does not include a location indicator). A user may move a mobile scanning device from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> on the order of a 3 seconds or more.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">An even larger dead zone is illustrated between area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> and area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> (e.g., on the sides of racks <b>268</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>268</b>-<b>2</b> that do not include a location indicator). Movement of a mobile scanning device from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> may take a greater amount of time than movement from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b>. For example, moving a mobile scanning device from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> may take approximately twice the amount of time (e.g., 5-10 seconds) as moving from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">As described above, a mobile scanning device may be configured to determine that two areas are adjacent when the amount of time between detecting the two areas is less than a threshold amount of time. The threshold amount of time used by the mobile scanning device may be a selectable value. In one example, the threshold amount of time may be set to 3 seconds. In this example, the mobile scanning device may determine that areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>2</b> are adjacent to one another. Additionally, the mobile scanning device may determine that areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> are adjacent to one another. A mobile scanning device may not determine that areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> are adjacent because the mobile scanning device may not be moved between areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> within the 3 second threshold, assuming that movement from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>5</b> takes approximately 5-10 seconds.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">In another example, the threshold amount of time may be set to 1 second. In this example, the mobile scanning device may determine that areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>2</b> are adjacent to one another because a mobile scanning device may be moved between areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>2</b> within a second. However, in this example, a mobile scanning device may determine that areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> are not adjacent because the mobile scanning device may not be moved between areas <b>280</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> within the 1 second threshold, assuming movement from area <b>280</b>-<b>1</b> to area <b>280</b>-<b>4</b> takes approximately 3 seconds or more.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">The structure of a location map (e.g., the junctions) may depend on the placement of location indicators in the store and the number of location indicators in the store. In general, a greater density of location indicators within a store may result in a location map including more junctions (i.e., more adjacencies). For example, placing a greater number of location indicators within a given amount of floor space may generally result in a greater number of adjacent areas because there may be more overlapping signals and a smaller number of dead zones. With respect to the threshold amount of time used by a mobile scanning device, using a greater threshold amount of time may result in a location map having more adjacencies (i.e., more junctions) because areas separated by larger dead zones may be considered adjacent.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">In summary, a mobile scanning device may use location adjacency criteria to determine if two areas are adjacent. In some examples, a mobile scanning device may determine that two areas are adjacent when the two areas include common location values. In some examples, a mobile scanning device may determine that two areas are adjacent when the amount of time between detection of the two areas is less than a threshold amount of time. The adjacency of areas may depend on the placement of location indicators in the store and the number of location indicators arranged throughout the store. Although location adjacency criteria may include the use of common location values and/or a threshold amount of time, it is contemplated that a mobile scanning device may use other adjacency criteria to determine whether two areas are adjacent.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">Referring back to method <b>4000</b>, a mobile scanning device may determine whether two areas area adjacent (e.g., using the location adjacency criteria) in block <b>4010</b>. In block <b>4012</b>, the mobile scanning device indicates to the central computing system that the two areas are adjacent (e.g., by wirelessly transmitting data to the central computing system). The central computing system may then update the location map to indicate that the two areas are adjacent. The central system may transmit the updated location map to the one or more mobile scanning devices in the store. Over time, one or more mobile scanning devices in the store may identify additional adjacent areas. The central computing system can further update the location map based on these identified adjacent areas. Continuation of the method <b>4000</b> in block <b>4004</b> after block <b>4012</b> represents that the location map may be continually updated over time as new areas (e.g., new location signals) are detected and new adjacencies are determined by the mobile scanning device(s).</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b>A-<b>41</b>D</figref> illustrate generation of a location map using a single mobile scanning device <b>4102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b>A-<b>41</b>B</figref> illustrate generation of a partial location map including areas <b>464</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>464</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>464</b>-<b>3</b>.

In some implementations, the mobile scanning devices and/or the central computing system may be configured to remove an area from the store in response to detecting the absence of location signals that otherwise were detected in the past. For example, the mobile scanning devices and/or central computing system may remove the area from the location map after determining that the location signal has not been detected for a threshold amount of time. Upon removing an area from the location map, the mobile scanning devices and/or the central computing system may initially update the item association table by assigning item ID codes to adjacent areas. Subsequently, over time, the mobile scanning devices and/or the central computing system may update the item association table based on the updated location map, as described above.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">Although generation/update of location maps is described above with respect to location indicators that emit location signals, the order filling system may also generate/update location maps in stores that include location indicators having readable codes (e.g., barcodes). For example, mobile scanning devices can automatically scan for location indicators (e.g., using a barcode reader or camera) including readable codes and automatically update the location map in a manner similar to that described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b>A-<b>44</b>B</figref>.

In other examples, the user may set the mobile scanning device into a &#x201c;location mapping mode&#x201d; and walk through the store with the mobile scanning device while the mobile scanning device is acquiring location signals and automatically generating the location map based on the acquired location signals. In a store that includes location indicators having readable codes, the user may walk throughout the store and scan the location indicators to generate the location map. In other examples, the mobile scanning device may be configured to automatically read the readable codes. For example, the mobile scanning device may be configured to rest in a cart pushed throughout the store and scan the racks or other areas for the readable codes. In this example, the mobile scanning device may automatically pick up the readable codes as the cart is pushed throughout the store (e.g., using a camera or other barcode scanning device), as described herein with respect to using the mobile scanning devices for picking.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">Various examples have been described.
