More particularly, the present invention relates to methods and tools for the management and treatment of urethral strictures, comprising transurethral deployment and fixation of a graft.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Urethral strictures are a fibrotic narrowing of the urethra, which act like a band of scar tissue, resulting in painful and frequent urination, and difficulty voiding. This condition occurs primarily in men, and severely affects their quality of life. It affects men of all ages, but increases in incidence with age. In the United States, the reported utilization of urethral stricture treatment is 0.9% in the Medicare male population.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The bulbar urethra is the most common region of urethral stricture&#x2014;it lies between the bladder neck and the penile-scrotal junction, which leads to the pendulous (or penile) urethra. Diagnosis is done by cystoscopy or by x-ray with contrast fluid. The most common location of stricture is the bulbar urethra (internal). While the cause is unknown for some (idiopathic), others are caused by saddle injury, infection, catheterization or trauma. In addition to idiopathic stricture (cause unknown) urethral catheterization, saddle injury, urinary tract infection, and radiation can cause the urothelium and the underlying corpus spongiosum to scar. This scarring is characterized by a reduction in lumen diameter, which occurs when the spongy elastic tissue surrounding the urethra is transformed into a hard and inflexible tissue through the deposition of collagen&#x2014;ultimately resulting in a urethral stricture.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Existing treatment options fall into two categories. The first is a category of minimally invasive approaches to widen the urethra which are relatively simple to perform, such as dilation and urethrotony. These involve stretching the stricture, or cutting the scar with a laser, cold knife, or hot knife. Unfortunately these procedures are highly ineffective, with success rates as low as 9%. The second is a category of highly effective surgical urethral reconstruction (anastomotic urethroplasty and substitution urethroplasty). The substitution urethroplasty currently consists of an open surgery with a perineal incision, excision of scar tissue, and placement of an autologous graft harvested. This technique provides new epithelium which promotes healthy healing and increases the lumen diameter of the urethra. While a highly effective treatment option, with success rates of around 86%, the invasive nature of this surgery increases the potential for complications such as erectile dysfunction and fistula formation. Moreover, only 4.2% of urologists feel comfortable performing a substitution urethroplasty due its complexity, which are performed almost exclusively by fellowship trained reconstructive urologists.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The clinical care pathway typically begins with a minimally invasive treatment, and suggests substitution urethroplasty if patients experience a recurrence. However, many undergo repeat ineffective minimally invasive treatments to avoid the extended recovery period, and the risks associated with these long complex open surgical procedures. This repetitive treatment cycle aggravates the patient's condition and is economically inefficient for both the patient and the healthcare system. General urologists have no durable treatment option to offer patients, aside from referral to a reconstructive urologist for surgery. There is a gap that exists between minimally invasive and minimally effective treatments, and effective surgical intervention, and the need for an innovation to bridge this gap.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Prior attempts at minimally invasive (endoscopic) urethroplasty were clinically successful; however, the design of these initial techniques encompassed several barriers to adoption that prevented them from achieving widespread utilization and impacting patient care. Endoscopic urethroplasties outlined in literature required multiple people to perform as a result of inadequate and complex tooling, which made it significantly more complicated than current minimally invasive procedures. These complex techniques were piloted by reconstructive urologists, and there is a lack of specialized tools which make such approaches accessible to general urologists the frontline care providers for patients with urethral strictures.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a tool for transurethral deployment and fixation of a graft for the management and treatment of urethral strictures, which can be used with the tools and skills accessible to both general urologists and reconstructive urologists.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in one aspect a device for the treatment of urethral strictures includes a graft carrier component.

Therefore, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An embodiment in accordance with the present invention provides a method and device for the treatment of urethral stricture. The present invention places and holds a graft at an incised urethral stricture site for 5-21 days, while the graft adherences to the incised urethral stricture site. A device of the present invention includes a delivery component, a graft carrier component, and a removal component. In some embodiments, the delivery and removal components may be combined into the same system. The delivery component, the graft carrier component, and the removal component are all configured to enter and exit the urethra without urethral trauma. A method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes harvesting a graft, loading the graft onto the graft carrier component, introducing the delivery component into the urethra with the graft carrier component and graft loaded, and delivering of the graft to the incised urethral stricture site.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F</figref> illustrate a schematic view of steps of a method for placing a graft at an incised urethral stricture site, according to an embodiment of the present invention. A method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes placing a graft at an incised urethral stricture site. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the urethral stricture site <b>10</b> is located, diagnosed, and defined. The graft <b>12</b> is harvested and loaded onto a graft carrier component <b>14</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The graft <b>12</b> can be harvested from the buccal mucosa or any other graft donor site known to or conceivable to one of skill in the art. When the graft <b>12</b> is loaded onto the graft carrier component <b>14</b> it can be fenestrated or un-fenestrated. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the stricture site <b>10</b> is incised with a tool <b>18</b>, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, the graft <b>12</b> is delivered to the incised stricture site <b>16</b> on the graft carrier component <b>14</b>. All of these steps are achieved with only one entry into the urethra. The incision of the stricture site <b>10</b> can be completed using the delivery component <b>22</b> or using traditional tools for stricture incision. The graft <b>12</b> can be delivered to the incised stricture site <b>16</b> with or without a sheath. It is also possible, that the present invention provides visualization of the stricture site <b>10</b> and/or the incised stricture site <b>16</b> throughout the procedure, including incision of the stricture site. After delivery of the graft <b>12</b> and deployment from the delivery device <b>22</b>, the graft carrier component <b>14</b> can be expanded in order to create a wide enough lumen through the urethra at the stricture site <b>10</b>. The graft carrier component <b>14</b> and/or any expansion and/or fixation systems may or may not be left at or near the urethral stricture site. Urine can be diverted through the graft carrier component <b>14</b> through a Foley catheter <b>20</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>. Alternately, fixation of the graft carrier component <b>14</b> can be with a fixation component such as barbs that extend from the graft carrier component after placement or sutures that hold the graft carrier component in place, as will be described further herein. After a graft adherence period, the graft carrier component is removed, leaving behind the graft <b>12</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>. The graft adherence period is often between 5 and 10 days, but can be any suitable amount of time known to or conceivable by one of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>I</figref> illustrate a schematic view of steps of a method for placing a graft at an incised urethral stricture site, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an overview of the components of the device for the execution of the method described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>I</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a graft membrane<b>12</b>, which may be harvested from the patient, and a carrier component <b>14</b> for delivery of that graft membrane <b>12</b> to the desired location.

Then, the distal second part <b>30</b> is rotated using the control mechanisms of the delivery device <b>22</b>, such that the second piece <b>30</b> is disposed just proximal to the first piece <b>28</b>, and in such a way, that if the second piece <b>30</b> is advanced distally, the generally cylindrical shape is completed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. The second part <b>30</b> is then advanced and locked together with the first part <b>28</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>. The advancement results in a larger lumen expansion when the two parts <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are alongside each other, than when they entered the lumen serially. Once the two parts <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, are locked together, in some embodiments the graft carrier component <b>14</b> can be expanded to create a wide enough lumen at the stricture site <b>10</b>. In another embodiment, the two parts <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> are disposed serially and rotationally offset, so as to enter the urethra in an s-shape, and the distal second part <b>30</b> is advanced to align with the first part <b>28</b> completing a generally cylindrical shape. In other embodiments, the carrier component <b>14</b> may consist of more than two parts, and parts may be connected. In some embodiments, an inner sheath may be a third carrier component part.

To summarize, the graft carrier component can be disposed in serial or a serial offset within the delivery component. Alternately, the graft carrier component can be disposed in concentric parts, inscribed or nested, or jointed, hinged or interleaved. These possible configurations are not meant to be considered limiting, and it should be noted that any graft carrier component configuration known to or conceivable to one of skill in the art could be used. Fundamentally, the graft carrier component should hold the graft, provide for necrosis of graft tissue to facilitate removal of the graft carrier component after adherence, provide fixation of the graft within the urethra during adherence, and allow for a Foley catheter. The graft carrier components parts can be joined to reach expanded position by sliding, rotation, or joint/hinge actuation. A locking mechanism can also be engaged to hold the parts together in the desired configuration. The graft carrier component can also include surface features that prevent fluid accumulation, perforate the graft, and/or reduce movement of the graft carrier component within the urethra. A graft loading device can also be included. The graft is loaded on a loader component and rolled onto the graft carrier component. Lines or markers can be included to aid in positioning the graft. Fixation of the graft carrier component within the urethra can be achieved in a number of ways.

While many possible embodiments and applications exist from outlined novelties, the following specific examples describe applications to perform a minimally invasive treatment for urethral stricture disease, for strictures located in the bulbar area of the urethra, with a length 4 cm or less; however, it can be utilized for strictures with all areas of the urethra and for all lengths. The procedure that incorporates the device can be done in 4 main steps. The first step is transurethrally incising the stricture. Next, a variable sized membrane is obtained (example: graft is harvested from the inside of the cheek or from the hairless region of the penis, with an approximate size of 1.5&#xd7;4 cm, length (4 cm here) may vary depending on the length of the stricture). The device may come in embodiments of varying lengths.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">An aspect of this disclosure involves a method of placing a membrane onto the device and securely attaching it. Embodiments of this device include using a platen/clamp that holds the edges of the graft; in some embodiments the platen/clamp also perforate the edges of the graft. Some embodiments use pins from the device that poke through the graft to secure it in place. Some embodiments use surface characteristics such as textured nubs, which pass through perforations in a fenestrated graft. Some embodiments include a separate tool for loading the graft onto the device. When using some potential embodiments of this disclosure, a device encompassing sheath may be inserted into the lumen until reaching the desired site. The device will then be passed through the sheath, until the site is reached. The device encompassing sheath will then be pulled back to allow the carrier component and graft to come in contact with the incised area, as the lumen collapses onto the device.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">One possible embodiment uses pressure fixation alone. The graft is fixed to a primary half cylinder carrier (tapered at the ends), with a secondary tapered half cylinder in series behind the first. The graft is delivered transurethrally to be in contact with the incised area of the urethra. The delivery mechanism then rotates the second tapered cylinder 180 degrees, and pushes it forward so that it sits above the primary tapered cylinder, where they connect together. The carrier may be textured provide increased friction to be able to limit translational movement in the urethra in response to externally applied forces. Textures include depressed lines, wavy lines, cones, squares/rectangles, cylinders, ellipsoids, or other raised/depressed shapes. It may also have holes, grooves and/or channels to allow for the flow of exudate away from the site of stricture. Another exemplary embodiment uses pressure fixation in combination with mechanical pin fixation. At the time that the sheath is removed, a balloon offset from the center of the device is inflated to push the device in contact with the incised area. Once the device is in place, two hooks are pulled back, which causes a set of pins to be inserted across the graft into the corpus spongiosum. These pins are at an appropriate length so to firmly insert into the urethra without significantly damaging the tissue, and can help limit longitudinal motion within the urethra. For both example devices, the device will remain in place in the lumen for a range of 5-21 days before being removed. Materials used in the manufacture of these devices will be standard biocompatible materials used in device manufacture including but are not limited to: thermoplastics such as silicones, PDMS, PEBAX, PTFE, PEEK, polyurethane, nylon, stainless steel, titanium, and shape memory alloys such as nitinol.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Display of visual images or data related to the device and procedure of the present invention can be carried out using a computer, non-transitory computer readable medium, or alternately a computing device or non-transitory computer readable medium incorporated into the robotic device or the imaging device.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A non-transitory computer readable medium is understood to mean any article of manufacture that can be read by a computer.
