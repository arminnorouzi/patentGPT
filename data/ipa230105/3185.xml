A generator converts the wind energy captured by a rotor having one or more rotor blades into electrical energy that is usually supplied to a utility grid. The generator is housed in a nacelle together with the various components required to operate and optimize the performance of the wind turbine. A tower supports the load presented by the nacelle and the rotor. In a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) the rotor blades extend radially outwardly from a central hub which rotates about a longitudinal axis aligned generally horizontally. In operation, the blades are configured to interact with the passing air flow to produce lift that causes the rotor to rotate within a plane substantially perpendicular to the direction of the wind.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional rotor blade is made from an outer shell and a spar structure. The spar structure serves to transfer loads from the rotating blade to the hub of the wind turbine. Such loads include tensile and compressive loads directed along the length of the blade arising from the circular motion of the blade and loads arising from the wind which are directed along the thickness of the blade, i.e. from the windward side of the blade to the leeward side. The spar structure comprises one or more shear webs extending between spar caps. The spar caps may be incorporated into the outer shell or may be attached to the outer shell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The spar cap may include pultruded fibrous strips of material. Pultrusion is a continuous process similar to extrusion, wherein fibres are pulled through a supply of liquid resin and then heated in an open chamber where the resin is cured. The resulting cured fibrous material is of constant cross section but, since the process is continuous, the material once formed may be cut to any arbitrary length.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2013/087078 describes a wind turbine blade with an elongate reinforcing structure comprising a stack of pultruded fibrous composite strips. The pultruded fibres are carbon fibres and extend almost the full length of the blade from root to tip.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The general trend in the wind turbine industry over the past several years has been for wind turbine blades to be made longer. The longer the blades, the larger the rotor and the more wind energy can be captured, improving the efficiency of an individual wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wind turbines are susceptible to lightning strikes. It is common for a wind turbine to include a lighting protection system, which electrically couples the wind turbine components to the ground. The blades, and in particular the blade tips, are particularly susceptible to lighting strikes. The blades may include a metallic foil, or surface protection layer (SPL), incorporated into the outer shell near the outer surface of the blade. The metallic foil may cover only a portion or substantially the entire blade outer surface. Additionally, or alternatively, the lightning protection system may include one or more discrete lightning receptors. The metallic foil and/or the lightning receptors on the blade are all electrically connected through the tower and nacelle to ground.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although lightning strikes have a natural tendency, due to their high frequency, to follow along the outside surface of a structure, such as the rotor blade, the presence of conductive fibres in the blade shell may cause unwanted discharges when a lightning strike occurs that could cause damage to the blade shell. This problem may be exacerbated where the conductive fibres are continuous and extend along a substantial length of the rotor blade, especially for a long blade.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A wind turbine rotor blade having a blade shell with a generally chordwise layup of fibre plies and a generally spanwise spar cap.

The equipotential bonding element extends between an outboard edge of one stack of the fibre plies and an inboard edge of an adjacent stack of the fibre plies, which edges overlap to define an overlapping edge region.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, a first aspect of the invention provides a wind turbine rotor blade having a root end and a tip end, comprising: a wind turbine blade shell that defines a suction side, pressure side, leading edge, and a trailing edge of the blade; at least one spar cap associated with the blade shell and including a conductive material; a lightning conductor; and an equipotential bonding element electrically bonding the lightning conductor to the spar cap, wherein the blade shell includes a plurality of stacks of fibre plies, each stack of fibre plies has an inboard edge towards the root end of the blade, an outboard edge towards the tip end of the blade, a forward edge towards the leading edge of the blade, and a rear edge towards the trailing edge of the blade, wherein the equipotential bonding element extends between an outboard edge of one stack and an inboard edge of an adjacent stack which overlap to define an overlapping edge region extending across the spar cap.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention may take the benefit of a chordwise layup of the stacks of fibre plies to provide a route through for the equipotential bonding element from the lightning conductor to the spar cap.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The equipotential bonding element may have a first end attached to and in electrical contact with the lightning conductor, and a second end attached to and in electrical contact with the spar cap.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The spar cap may have an outer side, and an inner side nearest an interior of the blade.

While these terms are well known and understood to a person skilled in the art, definitions are given below for the avoidance of doubt.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The term leading edge is used to refer to an edge of the blade which will be at the front of the blade as the blade rotates in the normal rotation direction of the wind turbine rotor.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The term trailing edge is used to refer to an edge of a wind turbine blade which will be at the back of the blade as the blade rotates in the normal rotation direction of the wind turbine rotor.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The chord of a blade is the straight line distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge in a given cross section perpendicular to the blade spanwise direction.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A pressure surface (or windward surface) of a wind turbine blade is a surface between the leading edge and the trailing edge, which, when in use, has a higher pressure than a suction surface of the blade.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A suction surface (or leeward surface) of a wind turbine blade is a surface between the leading edge and the trailing edge, which will have a lower pressure acting upon it than that of a pressure surface, when in use.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The thickness of a wind turbine blade is measured perpendicularly to the chord of the blade and is the greatest distance between the pressure surface and the suction surface in a given cross section perpendicular to the blade spanwise direction.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The term spanwise is used to refer to a direction from a root end of a wind turbine blade to a tip end of the blade, or vice versa. When a wind turbine blade is mounted on a wind turbine hub, the spanwise and radial directions will be substantially the same.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A view which is perpendicular to both of the spanwise and chordwise directions is known as a planform view. This view looks along the thickness dimension of the blade.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The term spar cap is used to refer to a longitudinal, generally spanwise extending, reinforcing member of the blade. The spar cap may be embedded in the blade shell, or may be attached to the blade shell. The spar caps of the windward and leeward sides of the blade may be joined by one or more shear webs extending through the interior hollow space of the blade. The blade may have more than one spar cap on each of the windward and leeward sides of the blade. The spar cap may form part of a longitudinal reinforcing spar or support member of the blade. In particular, the first and second spar caps may form part of the load bearing structure extending in the longitudinal direction that carries the flap-wise bending loads of the blade.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The term shear web is used to refer to a longitudinal, generally spanwise extending, reinforcing member of the blade that can transfer load from one of the windward and leeward sides of the blade to the other of the windward and leeward sides of the blade.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a wind turbine <b>10</b> including a tower <b>12</b> mounted on a foundation and a nacelle <b>14</b> disposed at the apex of the tower <b>12</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the layers <b>52</b> of glass fibre reinforced fabric are laid up in a mould <b>60</b> as stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b>. The stack of fibre plies <b>70</b> may include a plurality of fibre plies stitched or otherwise attached together as a kit. The stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b> may be pre-cut to fit the shape of the mould <b>60</b> such that the stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b> readily conform to the shape of the mould <b>60</b> and a number of plies may be laid up in the mould <b>60</b> easily and in a short time, preferably without the need for any cutting or detailed shaping of the plies once in the mould <b>60</b>.

In the following the stacks of fibre plies, laid up outside the mould on any surface, are referred to as &#x201c;preforms&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Particular to this invention, the stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b> each have an inboard edge <b>71</b> towards the root end <b>22</b> of the blade <b>20</b>, an outboard edge <b>72</b> towards the tip end <b>24</b> of the blade, a forward edge <b>73</b> towards the leading edge <b>26</b> of the blade, and a rear edge <b>74</b> towards the trailing edge <b>28</b> of the blade.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b> are arranged such that an outboard edge <b>71</b> of one of the stacks <b>70</b> and an inboard edge <b>72</b> of an adjacent stack <b>70</b> overlap to define an overlapping region <b>75</b> extending across the spar cap. The overlapping region <b>75</b> extends generally transverse across the location of the spar cap <b>46</b>. This is generally known as a &#x201c;chordwise layup&#x201d; of the preforms or stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b>. Each of the stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b> may extend across the full chordwise width of the mould <b>60</b> such that the forward edge <b>73</b> of each stack of fibre plies <b>70</b> is at the leading edge <b>26</b> of the blade, and the rear edge <b>74</b> of each stack of fibre plies <b>70</b> is at the trailing edge <b>28</b> of the blade. Typically, the length of each stack of fibre plies <b>70</b> between the forward edge <b>73</b> and the rear edge <b>74</b> is greater than the width of the stack between the inboard edge <b>71</b> and the outboard edge <b>72</b>.

By electrically bonding the lightning conductor <b>32</b> to the spar cap <b>46</b>, the spar cap <b>46</b> may be held at the same potential as the lightning conductor such that in the event of a lightning strike undesirable discharges or arcs between the lightning conductor <b>32</b> and the spar cap <b>46</b> can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The overlapping edges of the adjacent stacks of fibre plies <b>70</b> are formed by consecutively terminating individual plies in the stack to form a staircase or ramp.

That is to say, the equipotential bonding element <b>58</b> does not double back on itself in a U-shape. This may prevent arcing from one part of the equipotential bonding element to another part of the equipotential bonding element.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The equipotential bonding element <b>58</b> may comprise a strip of ribbon including electrically conductive material, or a conductive ply incorporated into the stack of plies, or a cable or series of cables or wires. For example, the equipotential bonding element <b>58</b> may comprise strands of electrically conductive material, such as metal wire, woven into a fabric material, such as glass fibre fabric. In an example the conductive material of the equipotential bonding element <b>58</b> may be copper coated with tin. The material may be chosen to avoid any galvanic reaction with either the lightning conductor <b>32</b> or the conductive material of the spar cap <b>46</b>.

The spar cap <b>46</b> has a thickness in the stacking direction of the layers of conductive material <b>80</b> which may vary along the length of the spar cap <b>46</b>.
