Pain severity and duration correlates with reduced measures of daily functioning, and overall health status. The sphenopalatine ganglion (&#x201c;SPG,&#x201d; also known as the pterygopalatine ganglion) has been implicated in a variety of cephalalgias.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The SPG is the largest group of neurons outside the cranial cavity and lies in the pterygopalatine fossa (&#x201c;PPF&#x201d;). The SPG has been implicated in treating head and face pain for over a century. Because of its anatomical connections and role in the trigemino-autonomic reflex, it is widely accepted that disruption, or blockade of neural signals generated by the SPG can modulate the output of the autonomic nerve fibers involved in headaches.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Stimulation of the SPG can be used to treat ischemic stroke. However, the currently available approaches for inserting an electrical stimulator at or near the SPG are invasive (involving penetration of the mucosa on the lateral nasal wall) or expensive (requiring fluoroscopic guidance). Conventionally, blockade of the SPG is accomplished by attempting to administer local anesthetics to areas near the SPG. An SPG block using local anesthesia is non-invasive and relatively inexpensive.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">The SPG is housed in the PPF which is located inside the nasal cavity near the lateral insertion of the posterior middle turbinate. The middle turbinate is open at its anterior and posterior ends. The PPF is approximately 1-cm wide and approximately 2-cm high. The PPF is bordered anteriorly by the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus, posteriorly by the medial plate of the pterygoid process, medially by the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, and superiorly by the sphenoid sinus. Laterally, the pterygopalatine fossa communicates with the infratemporal fossa.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Because of the SPG's anatomical position, the SPG is hard to access from outside the body and block with a local anesthetic solution. The PPF is deep inside the nasal cavity. The SPG is tucked within the PPF and there is no easy, direct, &#x201c;line-of-sight&#x201d; access to the SPG through the nostrils or other body orifices. Unfortunately, many current methods and apparatus for administering a SPG block are cumbersome, invasive, and expensive.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">The PPF is close to vital and delicate structures emanating from the mid brain, such as delicate orbital branches, which pass directly to the apex of the orbit and eventually the lacrimal gland. Therefore, although under fluoroscopic guidance a syringe may be used to inject medicant directly to the SPG, practitioners will typically not attempt this procedure due to danger of an erroneous needle placement.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">Access to the SPG can be gained via a small area of mucosa just posterior and superior to a posterior end of the middle turbinate on a lateral wall of the nasal cavity. At this aspect, there is no bony boundary to the SPG. Various intranasal devices and associated techniques have been developed for administering a SPG blockade intranasally. Currently, available intranasal devices include the SphenoCath&#xae; catheters and the Tx360&#xae; nasal applicator.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The SphenoCath&#xae; includes a flexible outer sheath and an inner, extendible catheter with a curved tip. To administer a SPG block using the SphenoCath&#xae;, a patient is placed in a supine position with cervical spine extension. The outer sheath is inserted into a nostril and advanced though an anterior portion of the nasal cavity using tactile judgment for proper placement.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">The practitioner attempts to navigate the outer sheath of the SphenoCath&#xae; from the anterior nasal passage to a position superior to a middle nasal turbinate and anterior to the SPG. After the outer sheath is successfully advanced through the anterior portion of the nasal cavity and positioned superior to the middle turbinate, the outer sheath is retracted, and a distal tip of the inner catheter is exposed. An anesthetic agent is then released from the distal tip of the inner catheter. Commonly, 1 to 2 mL of 2% lidocaine is used as the anesthetic agent when administering a SPG block using the SphenoCath&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">Following release of the anesthetic agent, the SphenoCath&#xae; is removed from the nasal cavity and the procedure is repeated on the opposite side if needed. The patient is maintained in a supine position for 8-10 minutes during the procedure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">However, the aforementioned and approved method for using the SphenoCath&#xae; is difficult for the practitioner and uncomfortable for the patient. Advancing the outer sheath through the anterior portion of the nasal cavity requires navigating the SphenoCath&#xae; through the anterior area of the nasal cavity which is rich in vascular and neuronal structures. The practitioner must skillfully navigate the SphenoCath&#xae; to avoid contact with these sensitive structures. Because contact with these sensitive structures is inevitable, even by the most skilled practitioner, patients experience discomfort during conventional procedures using the SphenoCath&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Furthermore, because the SPG is anatomically positioned closer to a posterior wall of the nasal cavity, all the anesthetic agent released by the SphenoCath&#xae; does not reach the SPG, reducing efficacy of the treatment. Because of the varied anatomy of patients, sometimes a practitioner can only advance the SphenoCath&#xae; about 3-4 centimeters (&#x201c;cm&#x201d;) into the nasal cavity. When attempting to access the SPG by inserting a catheter though the anterior nasal cavity, practitioners may find it difficult or impossible to insert the catheter even 5 cm into the nostril. Advancing the catheter only 5 cm or less keeps a distal tip of the catheter relatively far from the SPG. However, the patient may not be able to tolerate any further discomfort and the practitioner typically will release the anesthetic agent at that point and hope at least some of the anesthetic agent will be applied to the SPG.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">In contrast to the methods associated with the SphenoCath&#xae;, a SPG blockade performed using the Tx360&#xae; device is administered with the patient seated and upright. The Tx360&#xae; device is advanced parallel to the floor of the nasal cavity (e.g., hard palate). The Tx360&#xae; is advanced until a distal catheter tip is positioned inferior to the SPG.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">The Tx360&#xae; includes a straight but flexible catheter which is capable navigating curvatures along the floor of the nasal cavity. The flexibility of the catheter allows a distal tip of the catheter to extend to a position that is posterior to the inferior turbinate. However, the distal tip of the flexible does not extend superior to the inferior turbinate and does not reach a posterior end of the middle turbinate.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">After the flexible catheter is fully extended past the inferior turbinate, medicament is then released through the distal catheter tip. The medicament is delivered by the Tx360&#xae; laterally, superiorly, and anteriorly towards the SPG. The Tx360&#xae; is designed to release 1 cc or less of an anesthetic mixture. The lower dosage is due to the assumption that the Tx360&#xae; may position the distal catheter tip closer to the SPG and therefore less medicament is required to effectively blockade the SPG.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The Tx360&#xae; cannot be used to release medicament from regions of the nasal cavity that are superior to the inferior or middle turbinates. The flexible catheter of the Tx360&#xae; is too short to extend at least 8 cm into the nasal cavity. The flexible catheter associated with the Tx360&#xae; is less than 1 mm in diameter. The flexible catheter of the Tx360&#xae; is too flimsy and would not be able to bend and advance superiorly from its insertion position inferior to the inferior turbinate.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">Although, methods for delivering of medicament to the SPG using the Tx360&#xae; show some efficacy, the improvement in headache pain was not significant compared to placebo groups. See, e.g., Matthew S. Robbins, M D, et al., The Sphenopalatine Ganglion: Anatomy, Pathophysiology, and Therapeutic Targeting in Headache, Headache 2016; 56:240-258, American Headache Society. Evidence suggests a potential for more acute benefits with repetitive SPG blocks over time. However, this is cumbersome for practitioners and ensuring patient compliance may be challenging.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">It would be desirable to provide improved methods for administering an SPG block that is more effective than other methods.

Data for 250 patients demonstrating efficacy of the methods for administering a SPG block in accordance with this disclosure is shown in Appendix A (pre-procedure status) and Appendix B (post-procedure status).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Methods may be used to treat acute migraine headaches, chronic migraine headaches, post-traumatic headaches, tension headaches, vascular headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, depression, posttraumatic syndrome disorder (&#x201c;PTSD&#x201d;), schizophrenia, obsession compulsion disorder (&#x201c;OCD&#x201d;), cerebrovascular accidents (&#x201c;CVA&#x201d;), any type of epilepsy, or any other suitable diagnoses or conditions.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The methods may be used for adult patients, geriatric patients, pediatric patients, neonatal patients, or any other suitable patients. The methods may be performed in both nostrils of a patient.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Methods may include advancing a catheter at least 8 centimeters (&#x201c;cm&#x201d;) into a nostril of a patient. The catheter may be advanced through the inferior meatus. In practice, when inserting the catheter though the inferior meatus, a distal tip of the catheter has been 100% successfully advanced at least 8 cm past the nostril for 600 patients and 1,200 nostrils. &#x201c;Distal,&#x201d; relative to &#x201c;proximal,&#x201d; generally means the leading end of an apparatus that is inserted, or is to be inserted, in the body. Proximal general means the end of the apparatus that is held by a practitioner when inserting the apparatus into the body.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The catheter may be a flexible catheter. A flexible catheter may include a catheter that bends in response to contact with tissue or other anatomical structures within the nasal cavity. A flexible catheter may be sufficiently rigid to advance past tissue or other anatomical structures that may obstruct or divert a path of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">For example, a flexible catheter inserted through a nostril in a posterior direction will bend in a superior direction in response to contacting a torus tubarius or other structures at or near a posterior wall of the nasal cavity. Further advancement of the flexible catheter though the nostril in the posterior direction will cause the catheter to advance further in a superior direction.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">A flexible catheter may be constructed from Tecothane&#xae;, an aromatic polyurethane available from Lubrizol Advanced Materials, Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio. An illustrative flexible catheter may have a hardness that ranges from 20 A-80 A on the Shore hardness scale.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Methods may include positioning a distal tip of the catheter posterior and superior to a middle turbinate of the patient. Methods may include releasing the medicament from the distal tip of the catheter. Releasing medicament may include ejecting medicament from the distal tip. A proximal end of the catheter may be affixed to a syringe filled with the medicament. Actuating a plunger of the syringe may move the medicament out of a syringe barrel, through the catheter and out of the distal tip of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In a preferred embodiment, a single lumen catheter is sufficient for performing SPG blockade procedures described herein and a device (e.g., SphenoCath&#xae; catheter part number DT1001GP-3, available from Dolor Technologies LLC, Clearfield, Utah) that includes an outer sheath and inner catheter are not needed. A single lumen catheter may be manufactured more economically and with less moving parts. The single lumen device may be manufactured with a flexibility that is comparable to flexibility of a SphenoCath&#xae; catheter when an inner catheter of the SphenoCath&#xae; is recessing within an outer sheath of the SphenoCath&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In some embodiments, an inner catheter may be slidable within an outer sheath. In such embodiments, the outer sheath may be more rigid than the inner catheter. In embodiments that include an outer sheath and an inner catheter, the inner catheter may not be rigid enough to advance past tissue or other anatomical structures that may obstruct or divert a path of the catheter. The outer sheath may bend in response to contact with tissue or other anatomical structures within the nasal cavity and be sufficiently rigid to advance past tissue or other anatomical structures that may obstruct or divert a path of the outer sheath.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Methods may include positioning a distal tip of the inner catheter within the outer sheath. Methods may include inserting a distal tip of the outer sheath into a nostril of a patient. Methods may include inserting a distal tip of the outer sheath at least 8 cm into a nostril of a patient. Methods may include retracting the outer sheath. Retracting the outer sheath may expose the distal tip of the inner catheter.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">The distal tip of the inner catheter may be biased to have a pre-defined curvature. When the distal tip of the inner catheter is covered by the outer sheath, the outer sheath may overcome the bias of the inner catheter's distal tip and align the distal tip of the inner catheter with the outer sheath. Retracting the outer sheath may expose the distal tip of the inner catheter and allow the distal tip of the inner catheter to revert to its biased curved state. When in the biased, curved state, the distal tip of the inner catheter may be oriented in a direction that deviates from a longitudinal axis of the outer sheath.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Releasing medicament may include ejecting the medicament from the distal catheter tip toward the SPG. Releasing medicament may include flooding the SPG with 3 cc of medicament, rather than spraying 1.5 cc or less of medicament. Releasing the medicament may include ejecting the medicament from the distal catheter tip along a trajectory that extends from the distal catheter tip inferiorly (e.g., downward) towards the SPG. For example, methods may position the distal catheter tip superior to the SPG. The distal catheter tip may then apply medicament to the SPG in an inferior direction.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Releasing the medicament may include ejecting the medicament from the distal catheter tip along a trajectory that begins at the distal catheter tip and extends superiorly within the nasal cavity towards the SPG.

Methods may include advancing the catheter within the nasal cavity between the superior surface of the hard palate and an inferior turbinate of the patient. Methods may include advancing the catheter through an inferior meatus of the patient.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Methods may include advancing the distal catheter tip to a position that is superior and posterior to a middle turbinate of the patient. For example, the catheter may be advanced within the nasal cavity until the distal catheter tip contacts a posterior wall of the nasal cavity. Further advancement of the catheter through the inferior meatus may cause the catheter to bend.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">Advancing the catheter through the inferior meatus may bring the catheter into contact a torus tubarius and/or the posterior nasal cavity. The torus tubarius is a mucosal protrusion in the lateral wall of the nasopharynx marking the pharyngeal end of the cartilaginous part of the eustachian tube. The torus tubarius is anterior to the salpingopharyngeal fold and is formed by the underlying pharyngeal end of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube. The opening of the Eustachian tube is anterior and inferior to the torus tobarius.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Contact with the torus tubarius while advancing the catheter through the inferior meatus may deflect the catheter in a superior direction, toward the posterior end of the middle turbinate. Contact with the torus tubarius may cause the catheter to bend at least 10 degrees. Contact with the torus tubarius may cause the catheter to bend at least 30 degrees.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">After contact with the posterior wall of the nasal cavity, the path of least resistance for the catheter may be upwards in a superior direction. After deflecting superiorly, the distal catheter tip may ascend posteriorly to the inferior turbinate in a superior direction. The distal catheter tip may ascend superiorly past a posterior end of the middle turbinate.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">Methods may include advancing the catheter through a nostril into the nasal cavity until the distal catheter tip contacts the body of the sphenoid bone. Contact with the sphenoid bone may direct the distal catheter tip in anterior or inferior direction. Contact with the sphenoid bone may bend the catheter. Contact with the sphenoid bone may bend the catheter at least 45 degrees. Contact with the sphenoid bone may bend the catheter at least 90 degrees.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Methods may include continuing to advance the catheter into the nostril such that a distal catheter tip is positioned posterior and superior to a superior turbinate of the patient. Methods may include advancing the catheter through a nostril into the nasal cavity until the distal catheter tip ascends into a sphenoethmoid recess. The sphenoethmoidal recess is a small space in the nasal cavity into which the sphenoidal sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus open. The sphenoethmoidal recess is posterior and superior to the superior turbinate. The sphenoethmoidal recess drains the posterior ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses into the superior meatus of the nasal cavity.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Methods may include positioning the catheter inside a nasal cavity of the patient such that a first length of the catheter bends 90 degrees relative to a second length of the catheter. The bend may demarcate the first and second lengths of the catheter. The bend may be positioned posterior to the inferior turbinate. The bend may be positioned posterior to the middle turbinate. The bend may be positioned superior to the inferior turbinate. The bend may be positioned superior to the middle turbinate. The bend may be positioned touching the torus tobarius.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The second length of the catheter may extend superiorly relative to the first length. The first length may be substantially parallel to a hard palate of the patient. The first length may be oriented at an angle of at least 10 degrees relative to a superior surface of a hard palate of the patient. The first length may be positioned in an inferior meatus of the patient.

Methods may include introducing a catheter into a nostril of the patient. The catheter may be advanced through an inferior meatus of the patient. Advancing the catheter through the inferior meatus may cause the catheter to bend at a first position inside a nasal cavity.

The SPG <b>115</b> is typically located between posterior ends of superior and middle turbinates <b>111</b> and <b>109</b>. SPG <b>115</b> plays a unique role in headache disorders. SPG <b>115</b> is a key structure responsible for the expression of cranial autonomic symptoms, most seen in cephalalgias. Blockade of SPG <b>115</b> is thought to relieve headaches or other cephalalgias by targeting these specific neurological pathways central to headache pathophysiology. For example, SPG <b>115</b> includes a direct connection to the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve which may explain why blockade of SPG <b>115</b> may contribute to its efficacy in relieving migraines.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">As opposed to blockade of SPG <b>115</b>, stimulation of SPG <b>115</b> has been shown to activate cerebral vasodilatation and increase cerebral blood flow. Activation of SPG <b>115</b> may result in the release of acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide and nitric oxide in dural blood vessels. This may increase plasma protein extravasation with resultant neurogenic inflammation and activation of trigeminal nociceptors contributing to pain and triggering headache. However, timely increasing cerebral blood flow through stimulation of SPG <b>115</b> may relieve potentially debilitating symptoms associated with acute ischaemic strokes.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">Animal studies have shown that stimulation of SPG <b>115</b> leads to arterial vasodilatation and a profound increase in ipsilateral cerebral blood flow, as well as augmentation of tissue perfusion. Stimulation of SPG <b>115</b> may preserve penumbra and reduce cerebral infarct volume, increase neuronal survival, preserve the blood-brain barrier leading to reduced cerebral oedema, and improve neurological outcomes for acute ischaemic stroke patients.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an illustrative prior-art method <b>200</b> for blockading SPG <b>115</b>.

Typically, outer sheath <b>205</b> is inserted 5-6 cm into nasal cavity <b>123</b>. After outer sheath <b>205</b> is positioned inside nasal cavity <b>123</b>, outer sheath <b>205</b> is retracted out of nostril <b>105</b>, exposing distal tip <b>207</b>. Distal tip <b>207</b> is biased with pre-determined bend <b>209</b>.

Rotation of handle <b>203</b> points distal tip <b>207</b> towards an expected position of SPG <b>115</b>. The practitioner then releases medicament <b>211</b> from distal tip <b>207</b>. To achieve an effective block of SPG <b>115</b>, medicament <b>211</b> must travel from distal tip <b>207</b> through middle meatus <b>110</b> to reach SPG <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">However, method <b>200</b> does not allow distal tip <b>207</b> to be positioned directly on SPG <b>115</b>. Using method <b>200</b>, some of medicament <b>211</b> may be absorbed by superior turbinate <b>111</b>, reducing efficacy of the procedure. Using method <b>200</b>, medicament <b>211</b> must travel through middle meatus <b>110</b>, reducing efficacy of the procedure. Turbinates <b>107</b>, <b>109</b> and <b>111</b> are thick and moist tissue structures, designed to warm and humidify air drawn into nasal cavity <b>123</b>. The distance medicament <b>211</b> must travel causes medicament <b>211</b> to be absorbed and diverted by other structures within nasal cavity <b>123</b>, and reducing an amount of medicament <b>211</b>, if any, applied to SPG <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">Additional, method <b>200</b> requires insertion of outer sheath <b>205</b> through an anterior portion of nasal cavity <b>123</b>, which is typically uncomfortable for a patient.
