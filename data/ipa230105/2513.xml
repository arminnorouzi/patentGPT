Polyolefins are typically prepared using a catalyst to promote polymerization of one or more olefinic monomers, frequently in the presence of a cocatalyst or activator. Catalysts suitable for promoting olefin polymerization include various transition metal complexes, such as Ziegler-Natta catalysts or metallocenes. Transition metal complexes of these types are usually activated with group 13 metallate activators, such as alumoxanes and non-coordinating anion activators. In many instances, it may be desirable to conduct olefin polymerization in the gas phase or under slurry phase conditions to facilitate polymerization throughput.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to solubility limitations, aromatic solvents have commonly been employed for manipulating both the transition metal complexes and activators used for promoting olefin polymerization. Recent efforts have sought to eliminate or significantly lower amounts of aromatic solvents, such as toluene, used in polymerization processes, both as a delivery vehicle or as a reaction solvent, in response to potential toxicity concerns and to eliminate residual aromatic solvent in the resulting polymer product, which may be problematic for some applications. In addition, from production standpoint, eliminating aromatic solvents from polymerization processes may allow post-polymerization devolatilization operations to be minimized, thereby decreasing process costs and complexity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For gas phase and slurry phase polymerization reactions, the catalyst and activator may need to be deposited upon a support material, from which polymer growth may occur. Alumoxane activators may be formed in situ upon a support material without using aromatic solvents, as described in U.S. Patent Publication 2019/0127499. Due to the negligible solubility of conventional non-coordinating anion activators in aliphatic solvents, however, it can be very difficult to deposit these types of activators upon a support material without using at least some aromatic solvent. Even when no aromatic solvent is otherwise employed during polymerization, toluene and other aromatic solvents used to promote activator deposition upon a support material can still be problematic, since measurable solvent quantities can remain with the support material and become incorporated within the resulting polymer product. Moreover, reactive surface functionalities may decompose or otherwise inhibit the ability of non-coordinating anion activators to promote activation of a transition metal complex in some instances.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other references of interest include Severn, J.

Eliminating or significantly minimizing aromatic solvent usage in polymerization processes may improve the quality of the resulting polymer products, decrease potential toxicity concerns, and/or limit expensive and time-consuming solvent devolatilization operations that may otherwise be needed when employing even small quantities of aromatic solvents during various stages of a polymerization process.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The negligible solubility of many transition metal complexes and activators effective for promoting olefin polymerization in non-aromatic solvents may be particularly problematic with respect to realizing the goal of eliminating aromatic solvents from polymerization processes. Due to their ionic character, conventional non-coordinating anion activators, in particular, have very limited solubility in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, thereby making elimination of aromatic solvents very difficult. In particular, the limited solubility of non-coordinating anion activators, particularly ammonium and phosphonium borate activators, in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents may be especially problematic with respect to depositing these activators upon a support material without using toluene or other aromatic solvents.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure provides various non-coordinating anion activators deposited upon a support material without using toluene or other aromatic solvents to promote deposition, or significantly minimizing use of these solvents during deposition. Namely, the non-coordinating anion activators employed in the present disclosure have been modified with long chain alkyl or alkoxy groups to promote sufficient solubility in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents to allow manipulation of these activators to take place, specifically such that the activators may be deposited upon a support material to promote use thereof in gas phase and slurry phase polymerization reactions. The surface of the support material may, in some instances, be suitably passivated to allow the non-coordinating anion activator to maintain its activating capabilities. Advantageously, deposition of the non-coordinating anion activators may take place by simply contacting an aliphatic hydrocarbon solution of the activator with a suitable support material, followed by solvent removal, such as through evaporation. Thus, the supported activators disclosed herein may be readily formed and maintain activator effectiveness upon deposition without using aromatic solvents, thereby affording supported activators, catalyst systems, polymerization reactions, and polyolefin products that remain substantially free of toluene and other aromatic solvents.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">All numerical values within the detailed description and the claims herein are modified by &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; with respect to the indicated value, and take into account experimental error and variations that would be expected by a person having ordinary skill in the art. Unless otherwise indicated, room temperature is about 23&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used in the present disclosure and claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For the purposes of the present disclosure, the new numbering scheme for groups of the Periodic Table is used. In said numbering scheme, the groups (columns) are numbered sequentially from left to right from 1 through 18, excluding the f-block elements (lanthanides and actinides). Under this scheme, the term &#x201c;transition metal&#x201d; refers to any atom from groups 3-12 of the Periodic Table, inclusive of the lanthanides and actinide elements. Ti, Zr, and Hf are group 4 transition metals, for example.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, Mn is number average molecular weight, Mw is weight average molecular weight, and Mz is z average molecular weight, wt % is weight percent, and mol % is mole percent. Molecular weight distribution (MWD), also referred to as polydispersity index (PDI), is defined to be Mw divided by Mn. Unless otherwise noted, all molecular weight units (e.g., Mw, Mn, and Mz) are in units of g/mol (g&#xb7;mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For purposes of this disclosure, when a polymer, copolymer, or oligomer, particularly a polyolefin, is referred to as comprising an olefin, the olefin present in such polymer, copolymer, or oligomer is the polymerized form of the olefin. For example, when a copolymer is said to have a &#x201c;propylene&#x201d; content of 0 wt % to 5 wt %, it is to be understood that the mer unit in the copolymer is derived from the monomer propylene in the polymerization reaction and said derived units are present at 0 wt % (i.e., absent) to 5 wt %, based upon the weight of the copolymer. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; and oligomer&#x201d; (and grammatical variations thereof) are used interchangeably to refer to a molecule having two or more of the same or different mer units. As used herein, the term &#x201c;polymerize&#x201d; (and grammatical variations thereof e.g., polymerization) is used to refer to a process of generating a molecule having two or more of the same or different mer units from two or more of the same or different monomers. A &#x201c;homopolymer&#x201d; is a polymer (or oligomer) having mer units that are the same. A &#x201c;copolymer&#x201d; is a polymer (or oligomer) having two or more mer units that are different from each other. A &#x201c;terpolymer&#x201d; is a polymer (or oligomer) having three mer units that are different from each other. &#x201c;Different,&#x201d; as used to refer to mer units, indicates that the mer units differ from each other by at least one atom or are different isomerically. Accordingly, the definition of copolymer, as used herein, includes terpolymers and like higher polymers. A &#x201c;decene polymer&#x201d; or &#x201c;decene copolymer,&#x201d; for example, is a polymer or copolymer comprising at least 50 mol % decene-derived units.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;independently,&#x201d; when referenced to selection of multiple items from within a given group, means that the selected choice for a first item does not necessarily influence the choice of any second or subsequent item. That is, independent selection of multiple items within a given group means that the individual items may be the same or different from one another.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The terms &#x201c;group,&#x201d; &#x201c;radical,&#x201d; and &#x201c;substituent&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference to a group without specifying a particular isomer thereof (e.g., butyl) expressly discloses all isomers (e.g., n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl and cyclobutyl), unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;hydrocarbon&#x201d; refers to a class of compounds having hydrogen bound to carbon, and encompasses saturated hydrocarbon compounds, unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds, and mixtures of hydrocarbon compounds (saturated and/or unsaturated), including mixtures of hydrocarbon compounds having different numbers of carbon atoms. The term &#x201c;C<sub>n</sub>&#x201d; refers to hydrocarbon(s) or a hydrocarbyl group having n carbon atom(s) per molecule or group, wherein n is a positive integer. Such hydrocarbon compounds may be one or more of linear, branched, cyclic, acyclic, saturated, unsaturated, aliphatic, or aromatic. As used herein, a cyclic hydrocarbon may be referred to as &#x201c;carbocyclic,&#x201d; which includes saturated, unsaturated, and partially unsaturated carbocyclic compounds, as well as aromatic carbocyclic compounds. The term &#x201c;heterocyclic&#x201d; refers to a carbocyclic ring containing at least one ring heteroatom.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In particular, the term &#x201c;heterocyclic&#x201d; refers to a cyclic group where a ring carbon atom (or two or three ring carbon atoms) has been replaced with a heteroatom, such as N, O, or S. A heterocyclic ring is a ring having a heteroatom in the ring structure as opposed to a heteroatom substituted ring where a hydrogen on a ring atom is replaced with a heteroatom. For example, tetrahydrofuran is a heterocyclic ring, and 4-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl is a heteroatom-substituted ring substituent.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Substituted heterocyclic also means a heterocyclic group where at least one hydrogen atom of the heterocyclic radical has been substituted with at least a non-hydrogen group, such as a hydrocarbyl group, a heteroatom, or a heteroatom containing group, such as halogen (such as Br, Cl, F or I) or at least one functional group such as &#x2014;NR*<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;OR*, &#x2014;SeR*, &#x2014;TeR*, &#x2014;PR*<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;AsR*<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;SbR*<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;SR*, &#x2014;BR*<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;SiR*, &#x2014;SiR*<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;GeR*, &#x2014;GeR*<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;SnR*, &#x2014;SnR*<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;PbR*<sub>3</sub>, and the like, where each R* is independently a hydrocarbyl or halocarbyl radical.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The terms &#x201c;hydrocarbyl radical,&#x201d; &#x201c;hydrocarbyl group,&#x201d; or &#x201c;hydrocarbyl&#x201d; may be used interchangeably and are defined to mean a group consisting of hydrogen and carbon atoms only and bearing at least one unfilled valence position when removed from a parent compound. A hydrocarbyl group can be saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, cyclic or acyclic, aromatic or non-aromatic. Preferred hydrocarbyls are C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>100 </sub>radicals that may be linear or branched. Examples of such radicals include, but are not limited to, alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-amyl (isopentyl), hexyl, octyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, and the like. The term &#x201c;hydrocarbyl group having 1 to about 100 carbon atoms&#x201d; refers to a moiety selected from a linear, cyclic or branched C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>100 </sub>hydrocarbyl group.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x201c;optionally substituted&#x201d; means that a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbyl group may be unsubstituted or substituted. For example, the term &#x201c;optionally substituted hydrocarbyl&#x201d; refers to replacement of at least one hydrogen atom or carbon atom in a hydrocarbyl group with a heteroatom or heteroatom functional group.

In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of the catalyst system is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which monomer and comonomers are introduced. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent used in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, such as a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used, the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure.

The temperature in the particle form polymerization process can be from about 85&#xb0; C. to about 110&#xb0; C.

Reaction heat is removed through the loop wall since much of the reactor is in the form of a double-jacketed pipe. The slurry is allowed to exit the reactor at regular intervals or continuously to a heated low pressure flash vessel, rotary dryer and a nitrogen purge column in sequence for removal of the isohexane diluent and all unreacted monomer and comonomer.

multiple-channel band-filter based Infrared detector IR5, an 18-angle light scattering detector and a viscometer. Three Agilent PLgel 10 &#x3bc;m Mixed-B LS columns are used to provide polymer separation. Aldrich reagent grade 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) with 300 ppm antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is used as the mobile phase. The TCB mixture is filtered through a 0.1 m Teflon filter and degassed with an online degasser before entering the GPC instrument. The nominal flow rate is 1.0 mL/min and the nominal injection volume is 200 &#x3bc;L.
