The invention relates to metrology devices, and more specifically metrology devices used for measuring position such as alignment sensors and lithography apparatuses having such an alignment sensor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A lithographic apparatus is a machine that applies a desired pattern onto a substrate, usually onto a target portion of the substrate. A lithographic apparatus can be used, for example, in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs). In that instance, a patterning device, which is alternatively referred to as a mask or a reticle, may be used to generate a circuit pattern to be formed on an individual layer of the IC. This pattern can be transferred onto a target portion (e.g. including part of a die, one die, or several dies) on a substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer). Transfer of the pattern is typically via imaging onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist) provided on the substrate. In general, a single substrate will contain a network of adjacent target portions that are successively patterned. These target portions are commonly referred to as &#x201c;fields&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the manufacture of complex devices, typically many lithographic patterning steps are performed, thereby forming functional features in successive layers on the substrate. A critical aspect of performance of the lithographic apparatus is therefore the ability to place the applied pattern correctly and accurately in relation to features laid down (by the same apparatus or a different lithographic apparatus) in previous layers. For this purpose, the substrate is provided with one or more sets of alignment marks. Each mark is a structure whose position can be measured at a later time using a position sensor or alignment sensor (both terms are used synonymously), typically an optical position sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The lithographic apparatus includes one or more alignment sensors by which positions of marks on a substrate can be measured accurately. Different types of marks and different types of alignment sensors are known from different manufacturers and different products of the same manufacturer. A type of sensor widely used in current lithographic apparatus is based on a self-referencing interferometer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,961,116 (den Boef et al). Various enhancements and modifications of the position sensor have been developed, for example as disclosed in US2015261097A1. The contents of all of these publications are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would be desirable to improve on the alignment marks measured by the alignment sensor, in particular to improve one or more of: the size of the mark (e.g., decrease their size), the scan length over the mark, the speed of measurement of the mark and signal processing of the signal from the mark.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention in a first aspect provides a method of performing a position measurement on an alignment mark comprising at least a first periodic structure having a direction of periodicity along a first direction; the method comprising: performing At least one alignment scan of said alignment mark in a direction other than said first direction or a second direction perpendicular said first direction, to obtain simultaneously: a first measurement signal detected in a first measurement channel and a second measurement signal detected in a second measurement channel, the first measurement signal and second measurement signal each relating to scattered radiation, having been scattered by said alignment mark; processing the first measurement signal and second measurement signal, said processing comprising subtracting a first direction component of the first measurement signal from a first direction component of the second measurement signal to obtain a first processed signal, the first direction components relating to said first direction; and determining a position of an alignment mark with respect to the first direction from the first processed signal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention in a second aspect provides a substrate comprising a plurality of alignment marks, each comprising a first periodic structure having a direction of periodicity along a first direction superimposed with a second periodic structure having a direction of periodicity along a second direction so as to form a two dimensional grid structure; and wherein repeating elements of said first periodic structure and/or second periodic structure are subsegmented to form sub-periodic structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also disclosed is a computer program, metrology apparatus and a lithographic apparatus being operable to perform the method of the second aspect.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above and other aspects of the invention will be understood from a consideration of the examples described below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a lithographic apparatus;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates schematically measurement and exposure processes in the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a first alignment sensor adaptable according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts (a) a dual direction alignment mark and (b) measurement thereof;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts three examples of subsegmented dual direction alignment marks according to embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a further example of a subsegmented dual direction alignment mark according to an embodiment of the invention; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows: (a) and (c) example alignment measurement signals captured in respective measurement channels and (b) and (d) component signals thereof.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Before describing embodiments of the invention in detail, it is instructive to present an example environment in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically depicts a lithographic apparatus LA. The apparatus includes an illumination system (illuminator) IL configured to condition a radiation beam B (e.g., UV radiation or DUV radiation), a patterning device support or support structure (e.g., a mask table) MT constructed to support a patterning device (e.g., a mask) MA and connected to a first positioner PM configured to accurately position the patterning device in accordance with certain parameters; two substrate tables (e.g., a wafer table) WTa and WTb each constructed to hold a substrate (e.g., a resist coated wafer) W and each connected to a second positioner PW configured to accurately position the substrate in accordance with certain parameters; and a projection system (e.g., a refractive projection lens system) PS configured to project a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B by patterning device MA onto a target portion C (e.g., including one or more dies) of the substrate W. A reference frame RF connects the various components, and serves as a reference for setting and measuring positions of the patterning device and substrate and of features on them.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The illumination system may include various types of optical components, such as refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic, electrostatic or other types of optical components, or any combination thereof, for directing, shaping, or controlling radiation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The patterning device support MT holds the patterning device in a manner that depends on the orientation of the patterning device, the design of the lithographic apparatus, and other conditions, such as for example whether or not the patterning device is held in a vacuum environment. The patterning device support can use mechanical, vacuum, electrostatic or other clamping techniques to hold the patterning device. The patterning device support MT may be a frame or a table, for example, which may be fixed or movable as required. The patterning device support may ensure that the patterning device is at a desired position, for example with respect to the projection system.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;patterning device&#x201d; used herein should be broadly interpreted as referring to any device that can be used to impart a radiation beam with a pattern in its cross-section such as to create a pattern in a target portion of the substrate. It should be noted that the pattern imparted to the radiation beam may not exactly correspond to the desired pattern in the target portion of the substrate, for example if the pattern includes phase-shifting features or so called assist features. Generally, the pattern imparted to the radiation beam will correspond to a particular functional layer in a device being created in the target portion, such as an integrated circuit.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As here depicted, the apparatus is of a transmissive type (e.g., employing a transmissive patterning device). Alternatively, the apparatus may be of a reflective type (e.g., employing a programmable mirror array of a type as referred to above, or employing a reflective mask). Examples of patterning devices include masks, programmable mirror arrays, and programmable LCD panels. Any use of the terms &#x201c;reticle&#x201d; or &#x201c;mask&#x201d; herein may be considered synonymous with the more general term &#x201c;patterning device.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;patterning device&#x201d; can also be interpreted as referring to a device storing in digital form pattern information for use in controlling such a programmable patterning device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d; used herein should be broadly interpreted as encompassing any type of projection system, including refractive, reflective, catadioptric, magnetic, electromagnetic and electrostatic optical systems, or any combination thereof, as appropriate for the exposure radiation being used, or for other factors such as the use of an immersion liquid or the use of a vacuum. Any use of the term &#x201c;projection lens&#x201d; herein may be considered as synonymous with the more general term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The lithographic apparatus may also be of a type wherein at least a portion of the substrate may be covered by a liquid having a relatively high refractive index, e.g., water, so as to fill a space between the projection system and the substrate. An immersion liquid may also be applied to other spaces in the lithographic apparatus, for example, between the mask and the projection system. Immersion techniques are well known in the art for increasing the numerical aperture of projection systems.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, the illuminator IL receives a radiation beam from a radiation source SO. The source and the lithographic apparatus may be separate entities, for example when the source is an excimer laser. In such cases, the source is not considered to form part of the lithographic apparatus and the radiation beam is passed from the source SO to the illuminator IL with the aid of a beam delivery system BD including, for example, suitable directing mirrors and/or a beam expander. In other cases the source may be an integral part of the lithographic apparatus, for example when the source is a mercury lamp. The source SO and the illuminator IL, together with the beam delivery system BD if required, may be referred to as a radiation system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The illuminator IL may for example include an adjuster AD for adjusting the angular intensity distribution of the radiation beam, an integrator IN and a condenser CO. The illuminator may be used to condition the radiation beam, to have a desired uniformity and intensity distribution in its cross section.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device MA, which is held on the patterning device support MT, and is patterned by the patterning device. Having traversed the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the beam onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF (e.g., an interferometric device, linear encoder, 2-D encoder or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WTa or WTb can be moved accurately, e.g., so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B. Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor (which is not explicitly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can be used to accurately position the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B, e.g., after mechanical retrieval from a mask library, or during a scan.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Patterning device (e.g., mask) MA and substrate W may be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. Although the substrate alignment marks as illustrated occupy dedicated target portions, they may be located in spaces between target portions (these are known as scribe-lane alignment marks). Similarly, in situations in which more than one die is provided on the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA, the mask alignment marks may be located between the dies. Small alignment marks may also be included within dies, in amongst the device features, in which case it is desirable that the markers be as small as possible and not require any different imaging or process conditions than adjacent features. The alignment system, which detects the alignment markers is described further below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The depicted apparatus could be used in a variety of modes. In a scan mode, the patterning device support (e.g., mask table) MT and the substrate table WT are scanned synchronously while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam is projected onto a target portion C (i.e., a single dynamic exposure). The speed and direction of the substrate table WT relative to the patterning device support (e.g., mask table) MT may be determined by the (de-)magnification and image reversal characteristics of the projection system PS. In scan mode, the maximum size of the exposure field limits the width (in the non-scanning direction) of the target portion in a single dynamic exposure, whereas the length of the scanning motion determines the height (in the scanning direction) of the target portion. Other types of lithographic apparatus and modes of operation are possible, as is well-known in the art. For example, a step mode is known. In so-called &#x201c;maskless&#x201d; lithography, a programmable patterning device is held stationary but with a changing pattern, and the substrate table WT is moved or scanned.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Combinations and/or variations on the above described modes of use or entirely different modes of use may also be employed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Lithographic apparatus LA is of a so-called dual stage type which has two substrate tables WTa, WTb and two stations&#x2014;an exposure station EXP and a measurement station MEA&#x2014;between which the substrate tables can be exchanged. While one substrate on one substrate table is being exposed at the exposure station, another substrate can be loaded onto the other substrate table at the measurement station and various preparatory steps carried out. This enables a substantial increase in the throughput of the apparatus. The preparatory steps may include mapping the surface height contours of the substrate using a level sensor LS and measuring the position of alignment markers on the substrate using an alignment sensor AS. If the position sensor IF is not capable of measuring the position of the substrate table while it is at the measurement station as well as at the exposure station, a second position sensor may be provided to enable the positions of the substrate table to be tracked at both stations, relative to reference frame RF. Other arrangements are known and usable instead of the dual-stage arrangement shown. For example, other lithographic apparatuses are known in which a substrate table and a measurement table are provided. These are docked together when performing preparatory measurements, and then undocked while the substrate table undergoes exposure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the steps to expose target portions (e.g. dies) on a substrate W in the dual stage apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. On the left hand side within a dotted box are steps performed at a measurement station MEA, while the right hand side shows steps performed at the exposure station EXP. From time to time, one of the substrate tables WTa, WTb will be at the exposure station, while the other is at the measurement station, as described above. For the purposes of this description, it is assumed that a substrate W has already been loaded into the exposure station. At step <b>200</b>, a new substrate W&#x2032; is loaded to the apparatus by a mechanism not shown. These two substrates are processed in parallel in order to increase the throughput of the lithographic apparatus.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring initially to the newly-loaded substrate W&#x2032;, this may be a previously unprocessed substrate, prepared with a new photo resist for first time exposure in the apparatus. In general, however, the lithography process described will be merely one step in a series of exposure and processing steps, so that substrate W&#x2032; has been through this apparatus and/or other lithography apparatuses, several times already, and may have subsequent processes to undergo as well. Particularly for the problem of improving overlay performance, the task is to ensure that new patterns are applied in exactly the correct position on a substrate that has already been subjected to one or more cycles of patterning and processing. These processing steps progressively introduce distortions in the substrate that must be measured and corrected for, to achieve satisfactory overlay performance.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The previous and/or subsequent patterning step may be performed in other lithography apparatuses, as just mentioned, and may even be performed in different types of lithography apparatus. For example, some layers in the device manufacturing process which are very demanding in parameters such as resolution and overlay may be performed in a more advanced lithography tool than other layers that are less demanding. Therefore some layers may be exposed in an immersion type lithography tool, while others are exposed in a &#x2018;dry&#x2019; tool. Some layers may be exposed in a tool working at DUV wavelengths, while others are exposed using EUV wavelength radiation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At <b>202</b>, alignment measurements using the substrate marks P<b>1</b> etc. and image sensors (not shown) are used to measure and record alignment of the substrate relative to substrate table WTa/WTb. In addition, several alignment marks across the substrate W&#x2032; will be measured using alignment sensor AS. These measurements are used in one embodiment to establish a &#x201c;wafer grid&#x201d;, which maps very accurately the distribution of marks across the substrate, including any distortion relative to a nominal rectangular grid.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>204</b>, a map of wafer height (Z) against X-Y position is measured also using the level sensor LS. Conventionally, the height map is used only to achieve accurate focusing of the exposed pattern. It may be used for other purposes in addition.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When substrate W&#x2032; was loaded, recipe data <b>206</b> were received, defining the exposures to be performed, and also properties of the wafer and the patterns previously made and to be made upon it. To these recipe data are added the measurements of wafer position, wafer grid and height map that were made at <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, so that a complete set of recipe and measurement data <b>208</b> can be passed to the exposure station EXP. The measurements of alignment data for example comprise X and Y positions of alignment targets formed in a fixed or nominally fixed relationship to the product patterns that are the product of the lithographic process. These alignment data, taken just before exposure, are used to generate an alignment model with parameters that fit the model to the data. These parameters and the alignment model will be used during the exposure operation to correct positions of patterns applied in the current lithographic step. The model in use interpolates positional deviations between the measured positions. A conventional alignment model might comprise four, five or six parameters, together defining translation, rotation and scaling of the &#x2018;ideal&#x2019; grid, in different dimensions.

In the example apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this swapping is performed by exchanging the supports WTa and WTb within the apparatus, so that the substrates W, W&#x2032; remain accurately clamped and positioned on those supports, to preserve relative alignment between the substrate tables and substrates themselves. Accordingly, once the tables have been swapped, determining the relative position between projection system PS and substrate table WTb (formerly WTa) is all that is necessary to make use of the measurement information <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> for the substrate W (formerly W&#x2032;) in control of the exposure steps. At step <b>212</b>, reticle alignment is performed using the mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>. In steps <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, scanning motions and radiation pulses are applied at successive target locations across the substrate W, in order to complete the exposure of a number of patterns.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">By using the alignment data and height map obtained at the measuring station in the performance of the exposure steps, these patterns are accurately aligned with respect to the desired locations, and, in particular, with respect to features previously laid down on the same substrate. The exposed substrate, now labeled W&#x2033; is unloaded from the apparatus at step <b>220</b>, to undergo etching or other processes, in accordance with the exposed pattern.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The skilled person will know that the above description is a simplified overview of a number of very detailed steps involved in one example of a real manufacturing situation. For example rather than measuring alignment in a single pass, often there will be separate phases of coarse and fine measurement, using the same or different marks. The coarse and/or fine alignment measurement steps can be performed before or after the height measurement, or interleaved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Measuring the position of the marks may also provide information on a deformation of the substrate on which the marks are provided, for example in the form of a wafer grid. Deformation of the substrate may occur by, for example, electrostatic clamping of the substrate to the substrate table and/or heating of the substrate when the substrate is exposed to radiation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a known alignment sensor AS. Radiation source RSO provides a beam RB of radiation of one or more wavelengths, which is diverted by diverting optics onto a mark, such as mark AM located on substrate W, as an illumination spot SP. In this example the diverting optics comprises a spot mirror SM and an objective lens OL. The illumination spot SP, by which the mark AM is illuminated, may be slightly smaller in diameter than the width of the mark itself.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Radiation diffracted by the mark AM is collimated (in this example via the objective lens OL) into an information-carrying beam IB. The term &#x201c;diffracted&#x201d; is intended to include zero-order diffraction from the mark (which may be referred to as reflection). A self-referencing interferometer SRI, e.g. of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,961,116 mentioned above, interferes the beam IB with itself after which the beam is received by a photodetector PD. Additional optics (not shown) may be included to provide separate beams in case more than one wavelength is created by the radiation source RSO. The photodetector may be a single element, or it may comprise a number of pixels, if desired. The photodetector may comprise a sensor array.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The diverting optics, which in this example comprises the spot mirror SM, may also serve to block zero order radiation reflected from the mark, so that the information-carrying beam IB comprises only higher order diffracted radiation from the mark AM (this is not essential to the measurement, but improves signal to noise ratios).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Intensity signals SI are supplied to a processing unit PU. By a combination of optical processing in the block SRI and computational processing in the unit PU, values for X- and Y-position on the substrate relative to a reference frame are output.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A single measurement of the type illustrated only fixes the position of the mark within a certain range corresponding to one pitch of the mark. Coarser measurement techniques are used in conjunction with this to identify which period of a sine wave is the one containing the marked position. The same process at coarser and/or finer levels are repeated at different wavelengths for increased accuracy and/or for robust detection of the mark irrespective of the materials from which the mark is made, and materials on and/or below which the mark is provided.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A mark, or alignment mark, may comprise a series of bars formed on or in a layer provided on the substrate or formed (directly) in the substrate. The bars may be regularly spaced and act as grating lines so that the mark can be regarded as a diffraction grating with a well-known spatial period (pitch). Depending on the orientation of these grating lines, a mark may be designed to allow measurement of a position along the X axis, or along the Y axis (which is oriented substantially perpendicular to the X axis). A mark comprising bars that are arranged at +45 degrees and/or &#x2212;45 degrees with respect to both the X- and Y-axes allows for a combined X- and Y-measurement using techniques as described in US2009/195768A, which is incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The alignment sensor scans each mark optically with a spot of radiation to obtain a periodically varying signal, such as a sine wave. The phase of this signal is analyzed, to determine the position of the mark and, hence, of the substrate relative to the alignment sensor, which, in turn, is fixated relative to a reference frame of a lithographic apparatus. So-called coarse and fine marks may be provided, related to different (coarse and fine) mark dimensions, so that the alignment sensor can distinguish between different cycles of the periodic signal, as well as the exact position (phase) within a cycle. Marks of different pitches may also be used for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In performing alignment by measuring the position of alignment marks on the substrate using an alignment sensor, it would be desirable to reduce the area (footprint) of the alignment marks, so that many of them could be accommodated all over the wafer; including in-die, between product structures, where wafer space is &#x201c;expensive&#x201d;. It is therefore desirable, in a scanning-type alignment sensor (e.g., which scans an underfilled spot over the mark to generate a signal for the SRI), to reduce the length of the required scan length over the mark to maintain sufficient accuracy and reproducibility. In addition, it remains desirable to perform alignment detection simultaneously in X and Y directions (e.g., both directions parallel to the substrate plane), to decrease alignment time and increase throughput.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates one proposal for a small alignment mark with X and Y detectability. This comprises a dual direction mark <b>400</b> comprising an X oriented grating <b>410</b> effectively superimposed (e.g., overlapped in a single layer) with a Y oriented grating <b>420</b>. Effectively superimposed in this context describes that the X and Y oriented gratings are not formed separately on the substrate, but will be patterned from a single (grid) pattern on a reticle, in a single exposure step. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> shows how such a mark may be scanned. A radiation spot of alignment radiation is shown in a first position <b>430</b> and a second position <b>430</b>&#x2032; during a scan in the direction of the arrow. The physical pitch of the X oriented grating <b>410</b> and Y oriented grating <b>420</b> are the same in this embodiment, however they could also be different. Whatever the physical pitches, the angle &#x3b1; of the scan (with respect to x) is oblique to enable separation of the X and Y signals, such that each has a different effective detection pitch in the scan direction. Here, the angle &#x3b1; is such that 12 lines are scanned of the X oriented grating <b>410</b> during the same time as 8 lines of the Y oriented grating <b>420</b> are scanned (e.g., &#x3b1;=33.7 degrees), and therefore the detection pitch ratio X:Y in the scan direction is 2:3.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, the reproducibility of a dual direction alignment mark <b>400</b> is significantly worse than single pitch gratings, mainly due to mixing (cross-talk) between the two effective pitches of the X signal and Y signal. This is particularly the case for a short scan length (e.g., less than 20 &#x3bc;m, less than 15 &#x3bc;m or less than 12 &#x3bc;m) over the alignment mark.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">To address this, processing of measurement signals of a measurement scan on an alignment mark in two channels is proposed, the processed signal comprising the difference of corresponding direction components of the two channels. The aligned position can be determined from the processed signal. To provide a difference in signal strength of the corresponding direction components of the two channels, it is optionally proposed to subsegment the alignment mark.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, a dual pitch or dual direction (2 dimensional) alignment mark is proposed which comprises subsegmentation. Subsegmentation in this context comprises segmenting the lines of the gratings of each component grating (X grating and Y grating) of the dual direction mark. The subsegmentation may be in both direction of the dual direction mark. In one embodiment, the subsegmentation of a line may be substantially in the same direction as the grating it segments (e.g., in the regions between crossing points where lines of each grating cross). For example, each line of the X direction grating may be segmented in the X direction and each line of the Y direction grating may be segmented in the Y direction. In another embodiment, the subsegmentation may be in the opposite direction as the grating it segments. Crossing points may alternate between X and Y subsegmentation, or each crossing point may include both (e.g., forming a square or X/Y oriented cross or plus + shape). The subsegmentation may have a subsegmentation pitch smaller than 1 &#x3bc;m, smaller than 500 nm, smaller than 300 nm or smaller than 250 nm for example. In another embodiment, it may be that only one direction is subsegmented, with the other direction not subsegmented.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a number of subsegmentation arrangements according to an embodiment.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> the subsegmentation of each of the composite X/Y gratings is in the same direction as the grating. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows an arrangement where the crossing points CP of the X/Y gratings from a + or cross shape and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> the direction of the subsegmentation alternates (in one direction, here the Y direction) between being X oriented or Y oriented, resembling a &#x201c;lattice&#x201d; type arrangement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> shows an arrangement where the subsegmentation (between crossing points CP) is in the opposite direction as the grating it segments. Here, the crossing points CP have a subsegmentation which form a square pattern.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The pitch of the subsegmentation (sub-periodic structures) and the number of subsegmented lines formed may vary from the examples shown. In each example, the subsegmentation (each of the sub-periodic structures) comprises 4 to 5 subsegmented lines per main grating line; this may be any number between 2 and 10, for example. Combinations of the arrangements shown are also possible, for example the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> arrangement may have its subsegmentation in the direction opposite the main gratings in the manner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is proposed that the alignment marks of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are measured using an oblique scan (i.e., at an angle not oriented with X or Y).

This can be used to determine from a single X or Y scan, the position of one oblique pitch in one channel (e.g., a H polarization channel), the other oblique pitch in the other channel (e.g., a V polarization channel) and combine both signals into an X and a Y signal.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a measurement strategy using alignment marks as disclosed herein or otherwise, more specifically any of the marks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, scanned in the direction indicated by angle &#x3b1;.
