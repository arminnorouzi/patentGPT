GVHD most commonly occurs in the background of bone marrow transplantation. CMV can be diagnosed by the identification of cells with morphologic features of Cytomegalovirus (CMV Inclusions) on a pathological specimen. CMV infections generally occur in immunocompromised patients. Pathological specimens can be used for this diagnosis can be obtained from a tissue biopsy; or from a cytology specimen. Both of these types of samples are usually obtained via an endoscopic procedure. Candida infection can be diagnosed by the identification of fungal organisms with morphologic features of Candida on a pathological specimen. Candida infections generally occur in immunocompromised patients.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for improvements for collecting biological samples.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">An illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure relates to device suitable for collecting biological samples for diagnostic purposes. The device can be designed to collect different types and quantities of biological samples using a combination of expandable textured surfaces. In some embodiments, the sampling device can be the device discussed with respect to U.S. application Ser. No. 15/103,638 and U.S. application Ser. No. 16/610,115, 63/030,547 all incorporated by reference in their entirety. The device of the present disclosure can also be designed to target specific types of biological samples for particular types of medical conditions and/or subsequent diagnosis. For example, the device can be used to target cell collection for diagnosis of GVHD, CMV, Candidiasis, Chagas Disease, or other diseases.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) commonly occurs in transplant patients when white blood cells of the donor's immune system remain within the donated tissue and target the body of the recipient host as being foreign and attacking that system. GVHD can occur within different parts of the body, such as for example, in the esophageal and/or gastrointestinal tract. When GVHD occurs in the GI tract it can be diagnosed by a biopsy of cells to measure for the presence of epithelial degeneration and apoptotic bodies within the collected cells. GVHD samples can also be collected by the device to facilitate this diagnosis whether by cytological/pathological examination, including cell blocks, or for molecular analysis. The device and system of the present disclosure can be used to position a collection surface within the esophageal and/or gastrointestinal tract and can be used to safely collect and remove the esophageal and/or gastrointestinal tract cells for diagnostic purposes. To diagnose GVHD, the device will be inflated after it has passed into the stomach and remain dilated throughout the course of the esophagus. When present in the proximal esophagus the device will be deflated and removed from the patient.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Cytomegalovirus Esophagitis (CMV) is a form of esophagitis caused by the cytomegalovirus. CMV can be diagnosed by a biopsy of cells within the esophagus to collected cells (or portions of lesions) for histological evaluation to identify enlarged cells in the epithelial and sub-epithelial layer containing the appropriate inclusion bodies. For CMV, other diagnostic methods can be used, such as for example, immunohistochemical staining. The device and system of the present disclosure can be used to position a collection surface within the esophagus and can be used to safely collect and remove the esophageal cells for diagnostic purposes, whether by cytological examination, including cell blocks, or for molecular analysis. To diagnose CMV, the device can be inflated after it has passed into the stomach and remain dilated throughout the course of being pulled through the esophagus. When located in the proximal esophagus the device can be deflated and removed from the patient.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Candidiasis or thrush is a fungal infection that can affect different areas of the body, such as the mouth, throat, vagina, etc. To diagnose Candidiasis, a sample of the infected area can be collected to be analyzed for the presence of organisms causing the infection. For example, for diagnosis of a yeast infection (e.g., within the vagina), a sample can be combined with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to isolate and identify Candida cells causing the infection. The device and system of the present disclosure can be used to position a collection surface within the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or esophageal systems and can be used to safely collect and remove the buccal, squamous, vaginal, and/or Candida cells for diagnostic purposes, whether by cytological examination, including cell blocks, including use of special stains&#x2014;such as Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain or for molecular analysis. To diagnose Candidiasis, the device can be inflated after it has passed into the stomach and remain dilated throughout being pulled through the esophagus. When present in the proximal esophagus the device can be deflated and removed from the patient.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Chagas Disease is a parasitic disease caused by <i>Trypanosoma cruzi </i>(or <i>T. cruzi</i>) and is commonly spread by insects. To diagnose Chagas Disease, a blood sample can be obtained to be analyzed for the presence of <i>T. cruzi. </i>The device and system of the present disclosure can be used to position a collection surface within a location where <i>T. cruzi </i>are frequently and can be used to safely collect and remove the cells for diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>6</b></figref>, wherein like parts are designated by like reference numerals throughout, illustrate an example embodiment or embodiments of improved operation for biological cell collection, according to the present disclosure.

Therefore, the collection portion <b>12</b> can have a smooth outer surface. The distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may be connected to the proximal end portion <b>14</b> in any desired manner. The proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> and the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may be made of a flexible polymer, such as silicone or polyurethane. In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can have a lower durometer than the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b>. The distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may have a durometer between 5-90 Shore A. The durometer of the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> is preferably between 20-70 Shore A, and more specifically, approximately 30 Shore A. Any combination of elements and/or characteristics of the collection device <b>10</b> can be modified and/or specifically designed for capturing target cells/substances for any of the above-noted diseases.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> may expand and contract. In some embodiments, the first or proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> is relatively rigid. Therefore, the proximal end portion <b>14</b> can have a fixed radial extent. The first axial end portion <b>14</b> and the second axial end portion <b>16</b> may be formed as separate pieces that are connected together in any desired manner or may be integrally formed as one-piece. Although the proximal end portion <b>14</b> is illustrated as having a cylindrical shape, the proximal end portion may have any desired shape.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> can be connected to a support member <b>20</b>, such as a tubular member or catheter, as discussed in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The support member <b>20</b> may be a tubular member in fluid communication with the interior of the collection portion <b>12</b>. The proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> can conduct fluid, such as air, from the support member <b>20</b> to the distal axial end portion <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, the support <b>20</b> can resist collapsing when a vacuum can be applied to the support member and resists stretching during withdrawal of the collection device <b>10</b> from the collection site.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the second or distal end portion <b>16</b> of the collection portion <b>12</b> can have an expanded or inflated position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and a collapsed or deflated position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>). The expanded position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be one of many expanded positions for the distal end portion <b>16</b>. It is contemplated that the distal end portion <b>16</b> may expand more than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> so that the distal end portion obtains a more spherical shape and looks similar to a hot air balloon. In some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have a convex shape, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when in the expanded or inflated position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> may extend radially outward a greater distance than the proximal end portion <b>14</b> when in the expanded position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be modified for a particular biological sample collection and/or collection at a particular location. For example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be specifically designed to capture the cells and/or substances needed to diagnose any of the GVHD, CMV, Candidiasis, Chagas Disease or other diseases. In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be designed to expand more in a longitudinal direction for contacting sidewalls for collecting samples including white eosinophil blood cells at the esophagus, stomach, and the small intestine. For example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can expand in in a longitudinal direction that is greater in length than the proximal end portion <b>14</b>. The greater length of the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be preferred for contacting surfaces for capturing an adequate amount of sample that is sufficient to accurately count target cells within a sample for diagnosing different diseases.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be sized and dimensioned for collecting a sample at a particular target location and/or subject. For example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be designed to expand to a larger diameter for an adult and a small diameter for a pediatric or adolescent. Similarly, different diameter sizes for the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be used for collecting samples at different locations, for example, collecting samples within the stomach may use a different diameter distal axial end portion <b>16</b> than when collecting samples within the esophagus. In another example, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can have a particular length dimension and shape for patients of different ages, weight, height, etc. Additionally, the distal axial end portion <b>16</b> can be expanded to different levels of pressure/stiffness to target particular samples to be collected.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can extend into the first or proximal axial end portion <b>14</b> and can have a concave shape, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, when in the collapsed or deflated position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> may be inverted when in the collapsed position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> can extend axially into the interior of the proximal end portion <b>14</b> when in the collapsed or deflated position. Therefore, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can move axially or longitudinally relative to the proximal end portion <b>14</b> when moving between the deflated and inflated positions. In some embodiments, a relatively lower durometer of the distal end portion <b>16</b> allows the distal end portion to extend axially into the interior of the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and have a concave shape when in the collapsed position. The distal end portion <b>16</b> may be biased into the collapsed or deflated position in any desired manner.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the proximal end portion <b>14</b> can have a relatively high durometer so that the proximal end portion does not collapse when a vacuum is applied to the proximal end portion through the support <b>20</b>. The shape of the proximal end portion <b>14</b> does not change when the distal end portion <b>16</b> moves between the deflated and inflated positions. The proximal end portion <b>14</b> does not move radially when the distal end portion <b>16</b> moves between the deflated and inflated positions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the durometer or the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be modified for collection of a particular biological sample type and/or collection at a particular location. For example, the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be modified to traverse and/or operate differently when sampling in the esophagus compare to the GI tract. In some embodiments, the durometer and/or the proximal end portion <b>14</b> and the distal end portion <b>16</b> can be specifically selected for collecting samples located at different locations, such as for example the esophagus, stomach, and the small intestine. For example, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have a sufficient durometer level to allow the distal end portion <b>16</b> to sufficiently maintain its expanded shape during sampling. In other words, the durometer of the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have a sufficiently high durometer to prevent the distal end portion <b>16</b> from collapsing when interacting with a tissue wall of the patient such that projections or bristles <b>40</b> thereon can collect an adequate level of sample material to test for any of GVHD, CMV, Candidiasis, Chagas Disease or other diseases. Although the example discusses the use of a high level of durometer, depending on the shape of the distal end portion <b>16</b>, the projections or bristles <b>40</b> thereon, and the sampling location the durometer level can be higher or lower to most efficiently collect an adequate level of sample material having the target sample material for diagnosing particular diseases or conditions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the distal end portion <b>16</b> can have an outer surface <b>32</b> for collecting tissue when the distal portion is in the expanded position.

For example, a pathologist can visually inspect the biological samples and count the number of target cells to determine if any of the GVHD, CMV, Candidiasis, Chagas Disease or other diseases is likely. The cells can be diagnosed using any combination of methods which can be designed for specific diseases or conditions.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, GVHD diagnosis can be performed by biopsy of cells to measure for the presence of epithelial degeneration and apoptotic bodies within the collected cells or by cytological/pathological examination, including cell blocks, or for molecular analysis. CMV diagnosis can be performed by evaluation to identify enlarged cells in the epithelial and sub-epithelial layer containing the appropriate inclusion bodies and/or immunohistochemical staining. Candidiasis diagnosis can be performed by cytological examination, including cell blocks, including use of special stains&#x2014;such as Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain or for molecular analysis. In some embodiments, the analysis can be performed using a combination of users and computer analysis. For example, a user can use specialized software or artificial intelligence systems to perform black box diagnostics, visual inspection, point of care diagnostics, or other analyses. For example, a computer implemented system can be used to visually inspect the biological samples to determine if they fall within a threshold indicative of any of GVHD, CMV, Candidiasis, or other diseases.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The distinguishing features, characterization, and/or diagnosis of a particular disease or disorder provided herein can be determined by the skilled practitioner following the collection of a sample by the methods and device provided herein.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, in one aspect, provided herein is a method of collecting a sample from a subject that is at risk of having or a subject that is suspected of having a disease provided herein (e.g., GVHD, CMV, and Candidiasis).
