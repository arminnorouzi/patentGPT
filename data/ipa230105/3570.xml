This typically requires a tank feed-through, through a hole made in the tank wall for the filling level determination. At least in some applications, such as for filling level determination in tanks with extreme temperatures and/or aggressive products, this may add cost and complexity and/or be technically difficult.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been proposed to attach strain gauges to the outside of a tank, and estimate the filling level based on signals from the strain gauges. For instance, it has been suggested to deduce a mass of the tank (including the product in the tank) by sensing deformation of a supporting structure. According to another approach, described in DE 10109058, the filling level in a fuel tank of a car is determined using one or more strain gauges arranged at the bottom of the fuel tank.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the use of strain gauges alleviates the need for a tank feed-through, there appear to be remaining issues related to, for example, reliability and accuracy of the filling level determination.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above, a general object of the present invention is to provide an improved system and method for filling level determination without a tank feed-through.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention, it is therefore provided a filling level determination system, for determining a filling level of a product in a tank having a tank wall separating an inside of the tank from an outside of the tank, the filling level determination system comprising: a first measurement unit for arrangement at a first measurement position on the outside of the tank, the first measurement unit including a transceiver for generating, transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals; and an antenna arrangement coupled to the transceiver for radiating an electromagnetic first transmit signal generated by the transceiver from the first measurement position towards a first target position on the tank wall, and for returning an electromagnetic first reflection signal resulting from reflection of the first transmit signal at the first target position back towards the transceiver; memory for storing tank deformation data indicative of a known relation between the level of the product in the tank and deformation of the tank at the first target position, and reference data indicative of a reference distance between the first measurement position and the first target position for a known level of the product in the tank; and processing circuitry coupled to the transceiver of the first measurement unit and to the memory, the processing circuitry being configured to: acquire the tank deformation data and the reference data from the memory; and determine the filling level based on the tank deformation data, the reference data, and a timing relation between the first transmit signal and the first reflection signal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The &#x201c;transceiver&#x201d; may be one functional unit capable of transmitting and receiving microwave signals, or may be a system comprising separate transmitter and receiver units. It should also be noted that the processing circuitry may be provided as one device or several devices working together.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is based on the realization that contactless measurement of a distance, or a distance change, between a fixed measurement position and a target position on the outside of the tank wall can provide the advantages of non-intrusive filling level measurement without drawbacks associated with use of strain gauges or similar that require good and stable mechanical connection with the tank wall and that are subjected to potentially harsh conditions at the tank wall. Such harsh conditions may include extreme temperatures, condensation or ice, and vibration.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The measurement is based on an analysis of a timing relation between at least one electromagnetic transmit signal radiated towards the outside of the tank wall, and at least one corresponding electromagnetic reflection signal resulting from reflection of the transmit signal at the outside of the tank wall.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to embodiments, the transceiver of the first measurement unit may be configured to form a measurement signal based on the first transmit signal and the first reflection signal, the measurement signal being indicative of at least a phase difference between the first transmit signal and the first reflection signal; and the processing circuitry may be configured to determine the filling level based on the tank deformation data, the reference data, and the measurement signal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Analysis of the phase difference between the reflection signal and the transmit signal can provide considerably higher accuracy (in the order of 10 &#x3bc;m or better for typical frequency ranges and measurement sweep configurations) than analysis of the frequency difference between the reflection signal and the transmit signal (in the order of 1 mm for typical frequency ranges and measurement sweep configurations).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For this measurement technique, CW (continuous wave) or FMCW (frequency modulated continuous wave) radar systems may be used. Such radar systems are, per se, well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In conventional contactless filling level determination systems using FMCW-techniques, phase information is generally not used because the relation between the phase information and distance is not unambiguous for typical distance ranges.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present inventors have now surprisingly found that the more accurate phase difference measurement can yield unambiguous measurement results for the non-intrusive contactless measurement system according to embodiments of the present invention, due to the much smaller measurement range required. For instance, depending on the properties of the tank and the arrangement of the measurement unit(s), a change in tank wall deformation of about 1 mm may correspond to a change in filling level of about 1 m.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to various embodiments, the filling level determination system may be configured to acquire a measure indicative of an orientation of the tank; and the processing circuitry may be configured to determine the filling level additionally based on the acquired measure indicative of the orientation of the tank. This may provide for improved, such as more reliable, filling level determination, since possible tank leaning can be detected and compensated for.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, the filling level determination system may further comprise a second measurement unit for arrangement at a second measurement position on the outside of the tank, different from the first measurement position, the second measurement unit including a transceiver for generating, transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals; and an antenna arrangement coupled to the transceiver for radiating an electromagnetic second transmit signal generated by the transceiver from the second measurement position towards a second target position on the tank wall, and for returning an electromagnetic second reflection signal resulting from reflection of the transmit signal at the second target position back towards the transceiver. The tank deformation data may be additionally indicative of a known relation between the level of the product in the tank and deformation of the tank at the second target position; the reference data may be additionally indicative of a reference distance between the second measurement position and the second target position for a known level of the product in the tank; and the processing circuitry may be configured to determine the filling level additionally based on a timing relation between the second transmit signal and the second reflection signal.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a second aspect of the present invention, it is provided a method of determining a filling level of a product in a tank having a tank wall separating an inside of the tank from an outside of the tank, the method comprising the steps of: radiating an electromagnetic first transmit signal from a first measurement position towards a first target position on the tank wall; receiving an electromagnetic first reflection signal resulting from reflection of the first transmit signal at the first target position; acquiring tank deformation data indicative of a known relation between the level of the product in the tank and deformation of the tank at the first target position, and reference data indicative of a reference distance between the first measurement position and the first target position for a known level of the product in the tank; and determining the filling level based on the tank deformation data, the reference data, and a timing relation between the first transmit signal and the first reflection signal.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In summary, the present invention thus relates to a filling level determination system, for determining a filling level of a product in a tank, comprising a measurement unit for arrangement at a measurement position, the measurement unit including a transceiver; and an antenna arrangement coupled to the transceiver for radiating an electromagnetic transmit signal generated by the transceiver from the measurement position towards a target position on the tank wall, and for returning an electromagnetic first reflection signal resulting from reflection of the transmit signal at the target position back towards the transceiver; and processing circuitry coupled to the transceiver of the measurement unit and being configured to determine the filling level based on tank deformation data indicative of a known relation between the level of the product in the tank and deformation of the tank at the first target position, and a timing relation between the first transmit signal and the first reflection signal.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other aspects of the present invention will now be described in more detail, with reference to the appended drawings showing a currently preferred embodiment of the invention, wherein:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref> schematically show a first example embodiment of the filling level determination system according to the present invention in one example arrangement for non-intrusive contactless determination of the filling level of a product in a tank;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a representative relation between the filling level of the product in the tank and the distance between the measurement unit and the outside of the tank wall in the example arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of the filling level determination system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of the measurement unit comprised in the filling level determination system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-C</figref> are diagrams schematically illustrating the use of the phase difference between the reflection signal and the transmit signal for filling level determination, in example embodiments of the filling level determination system according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of a filling level determination carried out using the phase difference between the reflection signal and the transmit signal;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> schematically shows a second example embodiment of the filling level determination system according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> schematically shows a third example embodiment of the filling level determination system according to the present invention;

It is straight-forward to translate the known volumes to known levels. Alternatively or in combination, conventional &#x201c;intrusive&#x201d; filling level measurements may be correlated with deformation measurements during mapping of the tank-product combination.

Based on the phase data, and optional auxiliary data, stored in the internal memory <b>37</b>, and the above-mentioned tank deformation data and reference data stored in the memory <b>15</b>, the level determining block <b>39</b> determines the filling level L in the tank <b>5</b>, and provides a signal indicative thereof.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the elements of the transceiver <b>19</b> are typically implemented in hardware, and may form part of an integrated unit normally referred to as a microwave unit, at least some portions of the processing circuitry <b>17</b> may be embodied by software modules executed by an embedded processor. The invention is not restricted to this particular realization, and any implementation found suitable to realize the herein described functionality may be contemplated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">An exemplary way of determining the deformation of the tank wall <b>11</b> based on the acquired phase of the intermediate frequency signal will now be described with reference to the illustrations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-C</figref>. The transmit signal S<sub>T </sub>and the reflection signal S<sub>R </sub>are first combined to form the so-called intermediate frequency signal S<sub>IF</sub>, using techniques that are per se well-known in the art of FMCW-type radar level gauge systems. An exemplary intermediate frequency signal S<sub>IF</sub>, is shown, in the time domain, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thereafter, a phase &#x3d5; of the intermediate frequency signal S<sub>IF </sub>is determined. According to embodiments of the invention, this may be done by transforming the intermediate frequency signal S<sub>IF </sub>to the frequency domain, for example by means of the FFT-block <b>33</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, identifying the frequency corresponding to reflection at the tank wall <b>11</b> (the frequency at which the intermediate frequency signal carries the largest amount of energy), and determining the phase &#x3d5; of the intermediate frequency signal S<sub>IF </sub>for this frequency. This procedure is schematically illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, showing the energy carried by the intermediate frequency signal S<sub>IF </sub>as a function of frequency, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, showing the phase as a function of frequency. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> are zoomed in on a rather narrow frequency interval around the frequency of the intermediate frequency signal corresponding to reflection of the transmit signal at the tank wall <b>11</b>. The phase &#x3d5; is stored in the internal memory <b>37</b>. For small changes in distance, the change of the phase can be used to unambiguously determine the change in distance with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the phase of the intermediate frequency signal associated with the previous measurement operation may be retrieved from the internal memory <b>37</b>, and a phase change may be determined. Based on the phase change, a change in the deformation of the tank wall <b>11</b> at the target position can be determined with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Substantially same procedure may be used for a CW-radar system, in which the frequency is not modulated. In such a case, there is obviously no need to identify the frequency corresponding to reflection at the tank wall, as there is only one frequency. Also for the FMCW-case described above, this step may be omitted, depending on the system configuration, such as the frequency range of the frequency sweep.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of a filling level determination carried using the phase difference between the reflection signal S<sub>R </sub>and the transmit signal S<sub>T</sub>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The test results presented below were obtained using a steel tank containing water. The tank had a conventional radar level gauge system arranged to measure the filling level based on reflection of electromagnetic signals on the surface of the product in the tank.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Until a first time t<sub>1</sub>, the water level was kept stationary with a filling level of 1016 mm as measured using the conventional radar level gauge system.

At the second time, the filling level was measured to be 2030 mm using the conventional radar level gauge system. At the same time, the change in the distance &#x394;d from the measurement position <b>7</b> to the target position <b>9</b> was measured using the non-intrusive contactless filling level determination system <b>1</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a linear distance change of about 0.8 mm could be measured when the level in the tank was changed from 1016 mm to 2030 mm.
