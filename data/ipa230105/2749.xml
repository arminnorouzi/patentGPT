In addition, adipose tissues are more easily collected than blood, bone marrow, and the like and the utility value thereof is high. In fact, many research groups and research institutions are attempting to utilize mesenchymal stem cells and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) derived from adipose tissue for regenerative medicine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vascular endothelial cells (endothelial cell: EC)/vascular endothelial progenitor cells (endothelial progenitor cell: EPC) are themselves useful as transplant materials in regenerative medicine. In addition, they are also useful as a therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine because they can be expected to improve the therapeutic effect in transplantation treatment and the like when used in combination. Enzymes are generally used to prepare SVF containing vascular endothelial cells/vascular endothelial progenitor cells from an adipose tissue. For dispersing adipose tissue, that is, enzymatic disintegration of adipose tissue, for example, an enzyme preparation in which a protease is mixed with collagenase (crude collagenase preparation, for example, collagenase contaminated with Clostripain, Neutral protease, etc.) is used. In addition, collagenase and thermolysin may be used in combination, and an enzyme preparation for such enzymatic disintegration (containing collagenase and thermolysin) is also commercially available (e.g., Liberase manufactured by Roche and Celase manufactured by Cytori therapeutics).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">[PTL 1]</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">JP-A-2019-88279</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thermolysin used for the preparation of SVF is known to greatly damage to cells and affects the activity of cells in SVF. While an efficient preparation method has been proposed (see, for example, Patent Literature 1), it is difficult to easily and efficiently prepare high-purity vascular endothelial cells/vascular endothelial progenitor cells (for convenience of explanation, &#x201c;vascular endothelium-related cell&#x201d; is used below as a term encompassing vascular endothelial cells and vascular endothelial progenitor cells) from an adipose tissue. In view of the future development of regenerative medicine, it is desired to more efficiently prepare SVF containing vascular endothelium-related cells derived from adipose tissue. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an effective means for efficient preparation of SVF (in other words, improvement of yield). It is also an object of the present invention to increase the number of vascular endothelium-related cells in SVF and to prepare high-purity vascular endothelium-related cells easily and efficiently.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the course of studies in view of the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors considered that the conditions for enzymatic disintegration of adipose tissue are the most important for the efficient preparation of SVF, focused on the enzymes to be used, and studied them in detail. As a result, it was found that the combined use of collagenase and neutral protease is particularly effective, and that the ratio of the both enzymes is important. As a result, they have successfully improved the yield of SVF and increased the number of vascular endothelium-related cells in SVF.

Method for Preparing Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF)</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0009">The first aspect of the present invention relates to a method for preparing a stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from an adipose tissue (hereinafter to be referred to as the &#x201c;SVF preparation method&#x201d;). In the SVF preparation method of the present invention, the following step (1) is performed:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">(1) a step of treating an adipose tissue with an enzyme solution comprising a collagenase and a neutral protease, and showing not less than 1 U neutral protease activity with respect to 10,000 U collagenase activity, and recovering cells.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">Adipose tissue can be collected from human, mammals other than human (including pet animals, domestic animals, experiment animals, specifically, for example, mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, monkey, bovine, swine, goat, sheep, dog, cat, etc.), birds (chicken, quail, etc.), and the like by a means such as excising, aspiration, or the like. Examples of the adipose tissue include subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, intramuscular fat, and intermuscular fat. Adipose tissue can also be obtained by aspiration from a cannula intubated into the abdomen, femoral, breech, or systemic subcutaneous adipose tissue. The amount of the obtained adipose tissue is, for example, 1 g to 1000 g, preferably 1 g to 500 g, more preferably 1 g to 100 g, further preferably 2 g to 50 g, and further more preferably 2 g to 40 g, but the amount is not limited to these. Subcutaneous fat is particularly preferred since it can be collected very easily under, for example, topical anesthesia, and causes only a small burden on the donor at the time of collection. Generally, one kind of adipose tissue is used, but two or more kinds of adipose tissue can also be used in combination. In addition, adipose tissue (may not be allogenic adipose tissue) collected multiple times may be mixed and used in the following operations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">The collected adipose tissue is subjected where necessary to removal of the blood components attached thereto (e.g., removal of blood components by washing adipose tissue with suitable buffer or culture medium) and mincing, and used for the following enzyme treatments. When an aspirated adipose tissue is used, the aspirated adipose tissue is preferably allowed to stand to separate the fat layer from the aqueous layer. In addition, the fat layer and the aqueous layer can also be separated by processing the aspirated adipose tissue with a centrifuge. After separation of the fat layer and the aqueous layer, the aqueous layer is recovered and removed, whereby the fat layer can be isolated. The obtained adipose tissue may be subjected to an enzyme treatment after washing with, for example, saline or the like. It is preferable to warm the adipose tissue before being subjected to an enzyme treatment, in a water bath at room temperature or around 37&#xb0; C. for about 5 to 15 min.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">Adipose tissue is subjected to an enzymatic treatment (enzymatic reaction). In the present invention, the yield of SVF is improved by using collagenase and neutral protease in combination in the enzyme treatment, and increasing the content percentage of the neutral protease in the enzyme solution (activity ratio with collagenase). Specifically, an enzyme solution containing collagenase and a neutral protease and having a neutral protease activity of 1 U or more with respect to 10,000 U collagenase activity is prepared, and adipose tissue is treated with the enzyme solution. The enzyme solution used in the present invention may be prepared, for example, by dissolving or diluting an enzyme preparation prepared so that collagenase and neutral protease each have desired activities.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0014">Preferably, in order to increase the yield of SVF, an enzyme solution having a higher neutral protease activity with respect to collagenase activity (hereinafter to be referred to as &#x201c;activity ratio&#x201d; for convenience of explanation) is used. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment, an enzyme solution having a neutral protease activity of not less than 2 U (e.g., in the range of 2 U to 50 U) with respect to collagenase activity 10000 U is used, in a more preferred embodiment, an enzyme solution having a neutral protease activity of not less than 2.5 U (e.g., in the range of 2.5 U to 50 U) with respect to collagenase activity 10000 U is used, in a further preferred embodiment, an enzyme solution having a neutral protease activity of not less than 3 U (e.g., in the range of 3 U to 50 U) with respect to collagenase activity 10000 U is used, and in a further more preferred embodiment, an enzyme solution having a neutral protease activity of not less than 5 U (e.g., in the range of 5 U to 50 U) with respect to collagenase activity 10000 U is used. Specific examples of particularly preferred activity ratio can include 34,000:9 to 34,000:45. The activities of collagenase and neutral protease are calculated by the measurement method shown in the section of Examples described later.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0015">In order to treat the adipose tissue with the enzyme solution, for example, the enzyme solution is added to the adipose tissue or the adipose tissue is immersed in the enzyme solution to form a state in which the enzyme in the enzyme solution can contact (act on) the adipose tissue. Under this state, the tissue is treated in the enzyme solution under conditions where the enzyme can react, that is, the enzyme is allowed to react. The conditions of the enzyme reaction are not particularly limited as long as collagenase and neutral protease show activity and the cells are separated from the adipose tissue. For example, the pH is set to 5 to 10, preferably 6 to 9, the temperature is set to, for example, 25&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C., preferably 30&#xb0; C. to 45&#xb0; C., further preferably 35&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C. (specific example is 37&#xb0; C.), and the reaction time is set to, for example, 10 min to 3 hr, preferably 15 min to 1 hr (specific examples are 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min). For efficient progress of the enzyme reaction, it is advisable to shake the reaction vessel (linear shaking, rotational shaking, etc.).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0016">The enzyme solution used in the present invention shows a higher content percentage of neutral protease than when using a crude collagenase preparation (e.g., &#x201c;collagenase&#x201d;, Wako). While collagenase plays an important role in dispersing adipose tissue in the present invention, the high content percentage of neutral protease affects the yield of SVF and the number of vascular endothelium-related cells (vascular endothelial cell/vascular endothelial progenitor cell) in SVF. According to the present invention, the yield of SVF is improved. Typically, the number of vascular endothelium-related cells in SVF is also increased. Therefore, the present invention is extremely effective as a means for efficiently obtaining vascular endothelium-related cells derived from adipose tissue (the method for preparing vascular endothelium-related cells is described in the second aspect below).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">The amounts of the collagenase and neutral protease in the enzyme solution are not particularly limited as long as the cells can be separated from the adipose tissue. For example, they are contained in such amounts that afford the activity value of not less than 500 U (e.g., 500 to 30,000 U) for collagenase and not less than 0.05 U (e.g., 0.05 to 20 U) for neutral protease, preferably 1,000 to 20,000 U for collagenase and 0.1 to 15 U for neutral protease, more preferably 3,000 to 10,000 U for collagenase and 0.15 to 10 U for neutral protease, each per 1 g of the adipose tissue (activity ratio of collagenase and neutral protease in the enzyme solution is as mentioned above).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">The origin of collagenase or neutral protease is not particularly limited as long as they are useful for the separation of cells from the adipose tissue. For example, a collagenase derived from <i>Clostridium histolyticum </i>and a neutral protease derived from <i>Clostridium histolyticum </i>can be used. These collagenases and neutral proteases derived from the microorganisms can be prepared by separating and purifying the culture medium or bacterial cells of the microorganisms that produce them (producing strains). A host microorganism into which a collagenase gene (or a gene obtained by modifying the gene) obtained from a collagenase-producing strain has been introduced can also be used as a collagenase-producing strain. The same applies to the neutral protease. For separation and purification of collagenase and neutral protease, various chromatographies (ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, affinity chromatography, etc.), salting out and the like can be used. For preparation of neutral protease, a literature &#x201c;Dendo M, et al. Synergistic effect of neutral protease and clostripain on pancreatic islet isolation. Transplantation. In press, 2015&#x201d; can be referred to. Note that Amano Enzyme Inc. (e.g., Collagenase &#x201c;Amano&#x201d; GMP), Worthington Biochemical Corporation (e.g., Collagenase, Purified), Vitacyte LLC (e.g., Collagenase HA, Collagenase MA, rCollagenase HI), Roche (e.g., Collagenase A), and the like provide purified collagenases, and collagenase to be used in the present invention can be easily obtained.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0019">Preferably, a collagenase derived from <i>Clostridium histolyticum </i>and a neutral protease derived from <i>Clostridium histolyticum </i>are used. The collagenase derived from <i>Clostridium histolyticum </i>has a wide range of substrate specificities, characteristically acts on almost all types of collagen, and is particularly useful for dispersing adipose tissue. Similarly, the neutral protease derived from <i>Clostridium histolyticum </i>is specific to the FAGFYA substrate, characteristically has weak cytotoxicity, and is particularly useful for dispersing adipose tissue.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0020">For stabilization and activation of collagenase, it is preferable to contain Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the enzyme solution. Therefore, it is preferable to add, for example, CaCl<sub>2 </sub>to the enzyme solution. When CaCl<sub>2 </sub>is added, its concentration in the enzyme solution is, for example, 1 mM to 10 mM, preferably 2 mM to 5 mM, further preferably 2 mM to 4 mM.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the enzyme solution is free of clostripain and thermolysin. That is, only collagenase and neutral protease are substantially contained as enzymes for disintegrating adipose tissue. This embodiment is also advantageous in that the composition of the enzyme solution is simplified and the preparation of the enzyme solution is easy. In addition, the absence of clostripain in the enzyme solution is preferable particularly because the number of vascular endothelium-related cells in SVF increases.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0022">On the other hand, clostripain or thermolysin, or both of them may be contained in an enzyme solution, and the action of these enzymes may be utilized to further improve the dispersion efficiency of adipose tissue and the yield of SVF. In this case, as a content of clostripain, for example, the clostripain activity is, for example, more than 0 U to 2,000 U, preferably 1 U to 1,500 U, more preferably 10 U to 1,100 U, with respect to 10,000 U collagenase activity. Too much clostripain content affects the SVF yield. On the other hand, as a content of thermolysin, for example, the thermolysin activity is, for example, more than 0 U to 10,000 U, preferably 1 U to 7,000 U, more preferably 10 U to 5,000 U, with respect to 10,000 U collagenase activity. Too much thermolysin content affects the SVF yield. The origin of clostripain or thermolysin is not particularly limited and, for example, clostripain derived from <i>Clostridium histolyticum</i>, and thermolysin derived from <i>Bacillus thermoproteolyticus </i>or <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus </i>can be used. The clostripain and thermolysin derived from these microorganisms can be prepared by separation and purification of the culture medium or bacterial cells of the microorganisms (producing strains) that produce them, or by genetic engineering techniques, as in the case of collagenase. The methods of the separation and purification are also the same as those in the case of collagenase. For the preparation of clostripain, the above-mentioned document &#x201c;Dendo M, et al.

Generally, the sediment (cell pellets) obtained by a centrifugation treatment is recovered as SVF. The conditions for the centrifugation treatment vary depending on the type and amount of cells, and are, for example, 1 to 20 minutes, 500 G to 1000 G. It is preferable to perform a filter treatment (a cell strainer or the like can be used) or the like to remove the enzyme-undigested tissue and the like prior to the centrifugation treatment. In addition, the cells obtained by the centrifugation treatment may be subjected to a filter treatment or the like to remove unnecessary components.

Method for Preparing Vascular Endothelium-Related Cells</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0026">In the second aspect, the present invention provides, a method for preparing a cell population containing vascular endothelium-related cells (i.e., vascular endothelial cells and vascular endothelial progenitor cells) derived from adipose tissue, from SVF obtained by the SVF preparation method of the present invention (hereinafter to be referred to as &#x201c;vascular endothelium-related cell preparation method&#x201d;). In the vascular endothelium-related cell preparation method of the present invention, the SVF obtained by the SVF preparation method of the present invention is used to obtain a population with high percentage (purity) of the vascular endothelium-related cells, i.e., the vascular endothelium-related cell population with high purity. In a high purity vascular endothelium-related cell population, the percentage of the number of vascular endothelium-related cells in the cell population, namely, &#x201c;(vascular endothelium-related cells/cell number of whole cell population)&#xd7;100(%)&#x201d;, is, for example, not less than 50%, preferably not less than 60%, more preferably not less than 70%, further preferably not less than 80%, further more preferably not less than 90%, still more preferably not less than 95%. The number of vascular endothelial cells in SVF is generally about one to several %. Therefore, according to the vascular endothelium-related cell preparation method of the present invention, the purity of the vascular endothelium-related cells is strikingly increased, and a cell population containing vascular endothelium-related cells at a far higher concentration (high purity) than in SVF can be obtained. The vascular endothelium-related cell can be identified as a CD45-negative and CD31-positive cell. In addition, markers such as CD144 and CD146 can also be used to identify vascular endothelium-related cells.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">Vascular endothelium-related cells can be used for the treatment of ischemic diseases of all organs through angiogenesis of blood vessels, and are necessary for regenerating organs outside or inside the body, together with organ-constituting cells, organ-specific progenitor cells, stem cells (including embryonic stem cells and iPS cells), and cells induced from stem cells, for the regenerative medicine for organs (organs, tissues). The cell population obtained by the vascular endothelium-related cell preparation method of the present invention is useful as a valuable cell pharmaceutical product that can be used to treat a wide range of diseases.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">In the vascular endothelium-related cell preparation method of the present invention, a cell population containing high purity vascular endothelium-related cells is obtained by selective recovery, proliferation, and the like of the vascular endothelium-related cells in SVF. Typically, the following step (2) is performed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0000">(2) a step of enriching and/or proliferating the vascular endothelial cells and the vascular endothelial progenitor cells in the stromal vascular fraction obtained by the SVF preparation method of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0029">Generally, vascular endothelium-related cells in SVF are collectively enriched or proliferated, but vascular endothelial cells or vascular endothelial progenitor cells may be targeted for enrichment or proliferation. Various methods can be adopted for enrichment or proliferation. Not only a known method but also a method developed hereafter may be used. A typical operation for enrichment is sorting (selection and recovery) by cell markers. For example, cell markers such as CD45 and CD31, which are useful for selecting vascular endothelium-related cells, can be used. The enrichment operation may be performed a plurality of times. For example, cells enriched with a specific marker are cultured and proliferated, and then enriched with another marker. Such a series of operations may be repeated, in which case the markers used for each operation may be the same or different. In addition, the cell markers may be used alone or two or more markers may be used in combination. For example, the cell markers CD45 and CD31 are used for the first sorting, and after sorting and recovering CD45-negative and CD31-positive cells, the recovered cells are cultured and proliferated, and then the CD31-positive cells are sorted and recovered using the cell marker CD31.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0030">For example, magnetic cell separation method (MACS), FACS, or the like can be used for cell sorting and recovery using a cell marker. According to MACS, antibodies against marker proteins can be immobilized on magnetic beads and powerful magnets can be used to separate the cells of interest on the inner wall of a cylindrical container (column) or simply in a tube. As the magnetic bead reagent to be immobilized, general ones such as MACS (manufactured by Miltenyi Biotec) and IMag (manufactured by BD Japan) can be used. In FACS, if a flow cytometer having a cell sorter function is used, only specific cells that emit a specified fluorescence can be separated. Examples of such a device include FACSAriaII (manufactured by Japan BD), JSAN (manufactured by Bay bioscience Co., Ltd.), MoFlo XDP (manufactured by BECKMAN COULTER), and the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0031">Vascular endothelium-related cells can be proliferated by a conventional method. That is, vascular endothelium-related cells may be incubated in a medium suitable for culturing thereof under appropriate conditions (e.g., 37&#xb0; C., in CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator). The culture period is not particularly limited, and is, for example, 1 to 21 days. The cells may be passaged in the middle of culturing. The number of passages is not particularly limited. In addition, the medium may be exchanged, for example, every 1 to 2 days. As the medium, for example, EGM-2 (Lonza), &#x3b1;MEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/Ham F-12 mixed medium (DMEM/F12), RPMI1640, and the like can be used. Preferred media are, for example, EGM-2 medium (Lonza) and EGM-2 MV (Lonza). Various additives used in general cell culture, such as serum, various vitamins, various antibiotics, various hormones, and various growth factors, may be added to the medium.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0032">As step (2), two methods (referred to as the first method and the second method) disclosed in JP-A-2019-88279 may be used. In the first method, a cell population containing CD31-positive cells is obtained by sorting CD31-positive cells from SVF (CD45-negative and CD31-positive cells may be sorted, or only CD31-positive cells may be sorted), and then the cell population is cultured for 1 hr to 7 days, and CD31-positive cells are sorted from the cell population obtained by the culture, whereby a cell population containing CD31-positive cells is obtained. On the other hand, in the second method, a cell population containing CD45-negative and CD31-positive cells is obtained by sorting CD45-negative and CD31-positive cells from SVF, the cell population is cultured for 2 to 6 days (or 3 to 6 days), and CD31-positive cells are sorted from the cell population obtained by the culture, whereby a cell population containing CD31-positive cells is obtained. The SVF may be cultured for 1 hr to 5 days (or 1 to 4 days) and then subjected to the first method or the second method.
