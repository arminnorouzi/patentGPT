Accordingly, the following specific embodiments are not intended to limit, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a rotary power tool <b>10</b> including a tool bit holder, illustrated as a chuck <b>14</b>, for securing a working tool bit <b>28</b>. The illustrated rotary power tool <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>16</b> supporting an electric motor (not shown) and a battery pack (not shown). The battery pack selectively provides power to the electric motor to drive the electric motor which, in turn, drives an output spindle <b>22</b>. The output spindle <b>22</b> extends through a nose portion <b>24</b> of the housing <b>16</b> to be coupled to the chuck <b>14</b>. The chuck <b>14</b> is secured to the output spindle <b>22</b> for co-rotation therewith, and the chuck <b>14</b> selectively secures the working tool bit <b>28</b> (e.g., a grinding wheel) so that rotation of the electric motor results in rotation of the working tool bit <b>28</b>. The chuck <b>14</b> further includes a mechanism for providing feedback to an operator to indicate that the working tool bit <b>28</b> has been properly secured within the chuck <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the chuck <b>14</b> includes a base <b>18</b> threaded to the spindle <b>22</b>. The base <b>18</b> includes a central aperture <b>20</b> in which a collet <b>26</b> is disposed. In some embodiments, the base <b>18</b> is integrally formed with the spindle <b>22</b>. Surrounding the collet <b>26</b> and a portion of the base <b>18</b> is an inner sleeve <b>30</b>. The inner sleeve <b>30</b> includes a central aperture <b>32</b> having a threaded portion <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to allow the inner sleeve <b>30</b> to be threaded to the base <b>18</b> and a tapered (e.g., frustoconical) portion <b>38</b> engageable with the collet <b>26</b>. When the tapered portion <b>38</b> engages the collet <b>26</b>, the collet <b>26</b> is driven radially inwards to apply a clamping force to the working tool bit <b>28</b> and tighten the collet <b>26</b>. To remove the working tool bit <b>28</b> from the chuck <b>14</b>, the tapered portion <b>38</b> is disengaged from the collet <b>26</b>, untightening the collet <b>26</b> and removing the clamping force from the working tool bit <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inner sleeve <b>30</b> further includes a first toothed portion <b>46</b> (e.g., a face gear) oriented perpendicular to an axis of rotation of the chuck <b>14</b>. Circumferentially surrounding the inner sleeve <b>30</b> is a detent member, illustrated as a ring <b>34</b>. The detent ring <b>34</b> includes a second toothed portion <b>50</b> (e.g., another face gear) that corresponds to the first toothed portion <b>46</b> of the inner sleeve <b>30</b>. The first and second toothed portions <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> selectively rotationally couple the inner sleeve <b>30</b> and the detent ring <b>34</b>. More particularly, the first and second toothed portions <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> are each shaped as a plurality of saw teeth. A biasing member, illustrated as a compression spring <b>60</b>, applies a biasing force on the detent ring <b>34</b> to engage the detent ring <b>34</b> with the inner sleeve <b>30</b>. The chuck <b>14</b> further includes an outer sleeve <b>42</b> coupled to the detent ring <b>34</b>. The outer sleeve <b>42</b> is at least partially rotationally fixed to the detent ring <b>34</b> such that rotation of the outer sleeve <b>42</b> causes rotation of the detent ring <b>34</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer sleeve <b>42</b> includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced keys <b>64</b> which interact with a plurality of circumferentially spaced slots <b>68</b> on the detent ring <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The keys <b>64</b> and slots <b>68</b> are axially aligned such that the detent ring <b>34</b> is secured for co-rotation with the outer sleeve <b>42</b> and is capable of axial motion with respect to the outer sleeve <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, the outer sleeve <b>42</b> is capable of limited rotation relative to the detent ring <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation, a user rotates the outer sleeve <b>42</b> to tighten or loosen the chuck <b>14</b>. When rotated in a tightening direction, the detent ring <b>34</b> co-rotates with the outer sleeve <b>42</b> and imparts a rotational torque on the inner sleeve <b>30</b> due to the interaction of the first and second toothed portions <b>46</b>, <b>50</b>. Rotation of the inner sleeve <b>30</b> drives the inner sleeve <b>30</b> axially along the base <b>18</b> due to the threaded connection with the base <b>18</b>. The axial motion results in the tapered portion <b>38</b> engaging the collet <b>26</b> and applying a radial clamping force to tighten the collet <b>26</b>. When the chuck <b>14</b> reaches a threshold clamping force of the collet <b>26</b> on the working tool bit <b>28</b> (e.g., is fully tightened), the first and second toothed portions <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> will slip relative to one another. The slip occurs because the inner sleeve <b>30</b> is rotationally secured due to the tightness of the collet <b>26</b> and the detent ring <b>34</b> is rotating with the outer sleeve <b>42</b>. The sawtooth shape of the first toothed portion <b>46</b> and the second toothed portion <b>50</b> drives the second toothed portion <b>50</b>, and ultimately the detent ring <b>34</b>, axially rearwards against the biasing force of the spring <b>60</b>. Movement of the detent ring <b>34</b> axially rearwards disengages the first and second toothed portions <b>46</b>, <b>50</b>. As the detent ring <b>34</b> continues to rotate with the outer sleeve <b>42</b>, the spring <b>60</b> drives the detent ring <b>34</b> toward the inner sleeve <b>30</b> to re-engage the first and second toothed portions <b>46</b>, <b>50</b>, causing a tactile feedback (e.g., a noise or impact sensed by the user) to indicate that the collet <b>26</b> is properly tightened.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To loosen or untighten the collet <b>26</b>, the outer sleeve <b>42</b> is rotated in a loosening direction, opposite the tightening direction. Torque from the outer sleeve <b>42</b> is transmitted to the inner sleeve <b>30</b> via the detent member <b>34</b>. In particular, the sawtooth shape of the first and second toothed portions <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> transmits torque from the detent ring <b>34</b> to the inner sleeve <b>30</b> until the detent ring <b>34</b> slips relative to the inner sleeve <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts another embodiment of the chuck <b>14</b><i>b</i>, with like parts having like reference numerals plus the letter &#x201c;b&#x201d;, and the following differences explained below. The outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>b </i>includes an integrally formed toothed portion <b>50</b><i>b </i>configured to interface with the toothed portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The spring <b>60</b><i>b </i>is configured to bias the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>b </i>such that the toothed portion <b>50</b><i>b </i>engages the toothed portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>on the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> does not include a separate detent ring <b>34</b>, thereby reducing the number of components. Operation of the chuck <b>14</b><i>b </i>is like the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. Specifically, to tighten the chuck <b>14</b><i>b</i>, a user rotates the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>b </i>in a tightening direction to impart a torque on the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>b </i>to drive the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>b </i>axially due to its threaded connection to the base <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The axial motion results in the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>b </i>imparting a radial clamping force on the collet <b>26</b><i>b</i>. When the clamping force reaches a predetermined value, the reaction torque of the toothed portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>b </i>on the toothed portion <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>b </i>will overcome the biasing force of the spring <b>60</b><i>b</i>, thereby driving the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>b </i>axially rearwards. As the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>b </i>continues to rotate, the spring <b>60</b><i>b </i>drives the toothed portion <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>b </i>back into engagement with the toothed portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the inner sleeve causing a tactile feedback sensed by the user.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>16</b></figref> depict yet another embodiment of a chuck <b>14</b><i>c</i>, with like parts having like reference numerals plus the letter &#x201c;c&#x201d; appended thereon, and the following differences explained below. Like the chuck <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the chuck <b>14</b><i>c </i>includes a base <b>18</b><i>c</i>, an inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>coupled to the base <b>18</b><i>c</i>, a collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>disposed within the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>and the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>, a detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>surrounding a portion of the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>, and an outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>disposed about the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the base <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>is selectively rotationally coupled to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>via the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c</i>. When the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>is rotated in a tightening direction, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>transmits torque to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>until the collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>is tightened. Once the collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>is tightened, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>slips relative to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>to cause a tactile feedback and indicate to a user that the working tool bit <b>28</b><i>c </i>is secured within the chuck <b>14</b><i>c</i>. Various elements of the chuck <b>14</b><i>c </i>are described in further detail below. However, it should be understood that these are merely exemplary embodiments of the base <b>18</b><i>c</i>, the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>, the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c</i>, and the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, some of the details and features described herein are considered non-essential and may not be included in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>12</b></figref> depict the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>in further detail. The base <b>18</b><i>c </i>is connectable to a spindle <b>22</b><i>c </i>(e.g., output) of a rotary power tool <b>10</b><i>c </i>to transmit rotation from the spindle <b>22</b><i>c </i>to a working tool bit <b>28</b><i>c </i>that is secured within the chuck <b>14</b><i>c</i>. The base <b>18</b><i>c </i>includes a central aperture <b>20</b><i>c </i>having an internally threaded end <b>72</b> configured to couple the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>to the output spindle <b>22</b><i>c</i>. The base <b>18</b><i>c </i>further includes an externally threaded end <b>76</b>, opposite the internally threaded end <b>72</b>, configured to couple the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>to the base <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The central aperture <b>20</b><i>c </i>extends along a longitudinal axis of the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>and receives the collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>therein. In the illustrated embodiment, the central aperture <b>20</b><i>c </i>has a larger radius at the internally threaded end <b>72</b> than at the externally threaded end <b>76</b>. However, in other embodiments the radius may be uniform. An annular shoulder <b>80</b> is formed at the point of change between the larger and smaller radii. In the illustrated embodiment, the change occurs approximately centrally between longitudinal extents of the base <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The annular shoulder <b>80</b> functions as a stop mechanism when threading the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>onto the output spindle <b>22</b><i>c</i>. In other words, the annular shoulder <b>80</b> contacts the output spindle <b>22</b><i>c </i>when the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>is fully threaded onto the output spindle <b>22</b><i>c</i>. A radial protrusion or seat <b>84</b> extends outside the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>approximately aligned with the annular shoulder <b>80</b>.

The outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>is generally cylindrical in shape. A radially outer surface <b>124</b> is knurled to facilitate a user rotating the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c</i>.

Each key <b>64</b><i>c </i>is a rectangular projection that extends parallel to a longitudinal axis of the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c</i>. As the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>moves axially while slipping, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>remains rotationally fixed to the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c</i>. In some embodiments, the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>is only partially rotationally fixed to the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>and capable of limited rotational movement (e.g., 5-30 degrees) relative to the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>19</b></figref> depict a tightening operation of the chuck <b>14</b><i>c</i>. In operation, the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>is threaded to the base <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>is rotatably disposed about the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>so that the toothed portion <b>50</b><i>c </i>of the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>is engageable with the toothed portion <b>46</b><i>c </i>of the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>. As such, when the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>rotates in a tightening direction (e.g., fastening a tool bit) due to rotation of the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c</i>, the inclined teeth <b>100</b> of the first tooth portion <b>46</b><i>c </i>and the inclined teeth <b>120</b> of the second tooth portion <b>50</b><i>c </i>are engaged to transmit torque to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>, thereby causing rotation of the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>. Such rotation of the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>cases the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>to move axially along the base <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The axial movement of the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>causes the inwardly tapered portion <b>38</b><i>c </i>to apply a radial clamping force to the collet <b>26</b><i>c</i>, tightening the collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>about the working tool bit <b>28</b><i>c</i>. Once the collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>is fully tightened, continued rotation of the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>will drive the second tooth portion <b>50</b><i>c </i>to slip relative to the first tooth portion <b>46</b><i>c</i>. In particular, the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>stops rotating relative to the base <b>18</b><i>c </i>when the collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>is tightened. The angle of the inclined teeth <b>100</b>, <b>120</b> drives the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>axially rearwards when the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>is rotated while the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>is stationary. The detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>is driven rearwards until the inclined teeth <b>100</b>, <b>120</b> are disengaged. At this point, further rotation of the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>aligns the inclined teeth <b>120</b> with an adjacent one of the inclined teeth <b>100</b>, and the biasing member <b>60</b><i>c </i>drives the second toothed portion <b>50</b><i>c </i>back into engagement with the first toothed portion <b>46</b><i>c</i>. During this process, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>has rotated relative to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>; however, the vertical teeth <b>116</b> maintain their position within the gaps <b>92</b>. In other words, after the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>slips relative to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>, the vertical teeth <b>96</b>, <b>116</b> are engaged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>). This engagement allows for continued rotation of the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c</i>, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c</i>, and the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>to further tighten the collet <b>26</b><i>c</i>. The slipping of the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>relative to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>produces a click-like sound and tactile feedback to a user as the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>re-engages the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>indicating that the tool bit <b>28</b><i>c </i>is properly secured within the chuck <b>14</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>22</b></figref> a loosening operation of the chuck <b>14</b><i>c</i>. To loosen the collet <b>26</b><i>c </i>and remove a working tool bit <b>28</b><i>c</i>, the outer sleeve <b>42</b><i>c </i>is rotated in a loosening direction opposite the tightening direction. When rotated in the loosening direction, the inclined teeth <b>120</b> slip relative to the inclined teeth <b>100</b> of the inner sleeve <b>30</b>, so that the vertical teeth <b>116</b> of the second toothed portion <b>50</b><i>c </i>engage the vertical teeth <b>96</b> of the first toothed portion <b>46</b><i>c </i>to transmit torque to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>. Once the vertical teeth <b>116</b>, <b>96</b> are engaged, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>cannot slip in the loosening direction relative to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>transmits a tightening torque to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>when rotated in the tightening direction and a loosening torque to the inner sleeve <b>30</b><i>c </i>when rotated the loosening direction. Due to the shape of the first and second toothed portions <b>46</b><i>c</i>, <b>50</b><i>c</i>, the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c </i>is able to transmit a greater amount of tightening torque than loosening torque prior to slipping of the detent ring <b>34</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or more independent aspects of the invention as described.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Various features and aspects of the present invention are set forth in the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
