level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a pipe end protector for protecting pipe threads provided on a pipe end of a pipe component for exploration and production of a hydrocarbon well, and to an assembly comprising such a pipe end protector and pipe component. The invention also relates to a method for producing such pipe end protector.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">After a pipe component for exploration and production of a hydrocarbon well has been produced, it must be shipped to the location when the exploration and production of the hydrocarbon well takes place. During this transport, there is a high risk that the pipe threads of the pipe end will get damaged. In order to reduce this risk, a pipe end protector is screwed onto the pipe end to cover the pipe threads. To avoid that moisture or small solid particles, e.g. dust, accumulates at the pipe threads, the pipe end protector is provided with at least one seal. In general, the pipe end protector has an internal seal and an external seal and the pipe threads are located between the internal seal and the external seal.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known pipe end protectors comprise a main body having a longitudinal axis and a tubular portion provided with protector threads configured to cooperate with the pipe threads of the pipe end. Grooves are provided in the main body and an internal seal and an external seal are manually placed in said grooves.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This pipe end protector has the disadvantage that the production costs are relatively high. This is amongst others caused by the fact that the seals are manually placed in the grooves.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the seal may move out of its grooves when the pipe end protector is re-used. As result of this, the average sealing capacity of the pipe end protector reduces relatively fast when it is re-used. The pipe end protector can therefore in general only be re-used for a relatively limited number of times.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Pipe end protectors can be divided into two different groups, namely pipe protectors for male pipe ends and pipe end protectors for female pipe ends. Due to the differences in the design of the male pipe ends and the female pipe ends, each of the two groups of different pipe end protectors may have its own unique challenges.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention has the objective to provide an improved, or at least alternative, pipe end protector for protecting pipe threads provided on a pipe end of a pipe component for exploration and production of a hydrocarbon well.

The pipe end protector <b>1</b> is configured to be screwed on the female pipe end <b>3</b> of the pipe component <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Only the upper half of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> is shown, but it will be clear to the skilled person that the pipe end protector <b>1</b> is radial symmetric. This also applies to the other figures in which only an upper half is shown. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref> show enlarged views of the part B and C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0162">The pipe end protector <b>1</b> is configured to protect pipe threads <b>2</b> provided on a female pipe end <b>3</b> of a pipe component <b>4</b> for exploration and production of a hydrocarbon well. The pipe end protector <b>1</b> comprises a main body <b>5</b> having a longitudinal axis <b>6</b>, a support portion <b>10</b> having an at least partly radially extending annular seal support surface <b>7</b>, and a tubular portion <b>8</b> provided with protector threads <b>9</b> configured to cooperate with the pipe threads <b>2</b> of the pipe end <b>3</b> (see the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>4</b>A</figref>). An annular flexible axial lip seal <b>11</b> is provided on the seal support surface <b>7</b>. As will be explained in detail, the pipe end protector <b>1</b> also comprises a further lip seal <b>150</b> being a further axial lip seal <b>111</b>. The further lip seal <b>150</b> is provided on an at least partly radially extending annular further seal support surface <b>107</b> of a further support portion <b>110</b>. The axial lip seal <b>11</b> is an external lip seal <b>36</b>. The further lip seal <b>150</b> is an internal lip seal <b>37</b>. The pipe threads <b>2</b> and the protector threads <b>9</b> are wedge threads <b>79</b>. In another example, the pipe threads <b>2</b> and the protector threads <b>9</b> are free running threads.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0163">The used terms &#x201c;axial&#x201d; and &#x201c;radial&#x201d; relate to the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> of the main body <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0164">The used terms &#x201c;radially extending&#x201d; and &#x201c;extends radially&#x201d; refer to a situation in which an item extends away from the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0165">For example, the at least partly radially extending annular seal support surface <b>7</b> of the embodiment of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> extends substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>6</b>. In other embodiments of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> according to the invention, the seal support surface <b>7</b> is at least partly extending under an angle smaller than 90 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis <b>6</b>. This applies amongst others in a similar manner to the at least partly radially extending annular further seal support surface <b>107</b> on which the further lip seal <b>150</b> is provided.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0166">The term &#x201c;annular&#x201d; as used herein refers to an item having a ring-like configuration.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0167">Merely as an example, it will be clear to the skilled person that the at least partly radially extending annular seal support surface <b>7</b> may have a part which extends in axial direction. This may be similar to the situations shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>B and <b>11</b>B</figref> in which the at least partly radially extending annular further seal support surface <b>107</b> have a part extending in axial direction.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0168">The main body <b>5</b> is made from a first polymeric material <b>12</b> having a first elastic modulus <b>13</b>. The axial lip seal <b>11</b> is made from a second polymeric material <b>14</b> having a second elastic modulus <b>15</b> which is lower than the first elastic modulus <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0169">The axial lip seal <b>11</b> comprises an annular lip base portion <b>16</b> which extends radially along at least part of the seal support surface <b>7</b> and is attached to the seal support surface <b>7</b> by overmoulding. The axial lip seal <b>11</b> comprises an annular lip <b>21</b> which extends from the lip base portion <b>16</b> to a free rim <b>23</b> of the lip <b>21</b>, which free rim <b>23</b> is axially spaced from the lip base portion <b>16</b>. The lip <b>21</b> is configured to be bent towards the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> by the female pipe end <b>3</b> when the support portion <b>10</b> and the female pipe end <b>3</b> are moved axially towards each other during rotational make-up of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> on the female pipe end <b>3</b> in order to position the free rim <b>23</b> between the female free end <b>3</b> and the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> when (in use) a final make-up position <b>70</b> of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> on the female pipe end <b>3</b> is reached (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). The term between relates to the situation when seen in a radial direction <b>18</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0170">The position of the free rim <b>23</b> between the female pipe end <b>3</b> and the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> ensures that the lip <b>21</b> is pushed against the female pipe end <b>3</b> to increase the sealing effect of the axial lip seal <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0171">The first polymeric material <b>12</b> of the main body <b>5</b> is a polyolefin, more specifically a polyethylene. The second polymeric material <b>14</b> of the axial lip seal <b>11</b> is an elastomer, more specifically an olefin block copolymer, even more specifically a block copolymer of blocks of polyethylene alternating with blocks of ethylene/octene copolymer.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0172">The first polymeric material <b>12</b> and the second polymeric material <b>14</b> are selected to adhesively attach to each other by overmoulding. Adhesive attachment between the axial lip seal <b>11</b> and the seal support surface <b>7</b> of the main body <b>5</b> is caused by chemical, dispersive and/or diffusive adhesion of the first polymeric material <b>12</b> and the second polymeric material <b>14</b> created by overmoulding.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0173">Chemical adhesion occurs when surface atoms of a material form ionic, covalent or hydrogen bonds with surface atoms of another material. In dispersive adhesion two materials are held together by van der Waals forces. Diffusive adhesion occurs with polymer chains where an end of a molecule of a polymeric material has diffused into another polymeric material. When both polymeric materials are crystalline, cocrystallization of polymer chains may occur. Preferably the adhesive attachment is caused by diffusive adhesion of polymer chains, optionally including cocrystallization.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0174">The axial lip seal <b>11</b> will remain at its position on the seal support surface <b>7</b> when the pipe end protector <b>1</b> is re-used, because the axial lip seal <b>11</b> is attached to the seal support surface <b>7</b> by overmoulding. As a result, the sealing capacity of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> will reduce less when it is re-used. The pipe end protector <b>1</b> can therefore be re-used more often.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0175">The free rim <b>23</b> is directed towards the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> when the axial lip seal <b>11</b> is free from forces applied by the female pipe end <b>3</b>. This facilitates the bending of the lip <b>21</b> towards the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> when the support portion <b>10</b> and the female pipe end <b>3</b> are moved axially towards each other during rotational make-up of the pipe end protector <b>1</b> on the female pipe end <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0176">The lip <b>21</b> extends at the free rim <b>23</b> towards the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> when the axial lip seal <b>11</b> is free from forces applied by the female pipe end <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0177">The free rim <b>23</b> is in radial direction located closer to the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> than the lip base portion <b>16</b> when the axial lip seal <b>11</b> is free from forces applied by the female pipe end <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0178">The free rim <b>23</b> is directed towards the tubular portion <b>8</b> when the axial lip seal <b>11</b> is free from forces applied by the female pipe end <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0179">The lip <b>21</b> extends at the free <b>23</b> rim towards the tubular portion <b>8</b> when the axial lip seal <b>11</b> is free from forces applied by the female pipe end <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0180">The tubular portion <b>8</b> is in radial direction located between the longitudinal axis <b>6</b> and the axial lip seal <b>11</b>.
