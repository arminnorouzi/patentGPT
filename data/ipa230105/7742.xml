devices of this disclosure may include one or more innovative aspects, where the innovative aspects may individually or in combination contribute to the desirable attributes disclosed herein. Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the description below and the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For purposes of illustrating the procedures for providing proper current levels to pixels for realizing an image as described herein, it might be useful to understand phenomena that may come into play in a headlamp. The following foundational information may be viewed as a basis from which the present disclosure may be properly explained. Such information is offered for purposes of explanation only and, accordingly, should not be construed in any way to limit the broad scope of the present disclosure and its potential applications.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For and &#x3bc;LED array, image data may be provided that defines an image to be displayed by the &#x3bc;LED array. To display and realize the image, the current levels of the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array may be adjusted accordingly to the image to be produced and/or a light profile. One approach for adjusting the current levels is to utilize pulse width modulation (PWM) dimming. In particular, for PWM dimming the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array may be turned on and off at a certain frequency and a ratio between the conduction time and the period or cycle time may be adjusted to produce duty cycles for the pixels. For PWM dimming, the average DC current through a pixel of the &#x3bc;LED array may be a product of the current amplitude provided to the pixel and the duty cycle for the pixel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">PWM dimming for adjusting the current levels of pixels in the &#x3bc;LED array may present square-wave shaped pixel current with rich harmonic components. The summed total current of all pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array may also include the harmonic components, which can cause high root-mean-square (RMS) current and resistive losses. Further, electromagnetic interference (EMI) and harmonic noise levels may be high based on the harmonic components. A legacy approach to attempt to address the rich harmonic includes having turn-on delays for the pixels based on the total number of pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array and the position of the pixels within an &#x3bc;LED array. In particular, a period of a cycle of the PWM dimming approach may be divided by a total number of the pixels within the array to determine an amount of delay time between the turn-on of each of the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array. Each pixel within the &#x3bc;LED array is then turned on in an order defined by the positions of the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array, where each subsequent turn-on of a pixel in the order is the delay time after the turn-on of the prior pixel in the order. However, this legacy approach may still present rich harmonic components with high RMS current, resistive losses, EMI, and/or harmonic noise levels, especially when pixels with the same or similar duty cycles are located adjacent in the turn-on order of the &#x3bc;LED array. In addition, the increased number of pixels in a &#x3bc;LED array compared to that of a non-&#x3bc;LED array may only serve to exacerbate these issues.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an approach for controlling pixel turn on (activation) and turn off (deactivation) within an &#x3bc;LED array. The systems and procedures disclosed herein can define turn-on delays for the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array based on the duty cycles of the pixels. The pixels can be grouped based on corresponding duty cycles and turn-on delays can be determined for the pixels based on the group that includes each of the pixels.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present disclosure, in particular aspects of pixel turn-on control of &#x3bc;LED arrays, described herein, may be embodied in various manners&#x2014;e.g, as a method, a system, a computer program product, or a computer-readable storage medium. Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit,&#x201d; &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;system.&#x201d; Functions described in this disclosure may be implemented as an algorithm executed by one or more hardware processing units, e.g one or more microprocessors, of one or more computers. Although a processor is referred to herein, any logic capable of performing the functions indicated may be used. In various embodiments, different steps and portions of the steps of each of the methods described herein may be performed by different processing units. Furthermore, aspects of the present disclosure may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer-readable medium(s), preferably non-transitory, having computer-readable program code embodied, e.g., stored, thereon. In various embodiments, such a computer program may, for example, be downloaded (updated) to the existing devices and systems (e.g. to the existing lighting systems, etc.) or be stored upon manufacturing of these devices and systems.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the following detailed description, various aspects of the illustrative implementations may be described using terms commonly employed by those skilled in the art to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. For example, the term &#x201c;connected&#x201d; means a direct electrical or magnetic connection between the things that are connected, without any intermediary devices, while the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; means either a direct electrical or magnetic connection between the things that are connected, or an indirect connection through one or more passive or active intermediary devices. The term &#x201c;circuit&#x201d; means one or more passive and/or active components that are arranged to cooperate with one another to provide a desired function.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d; means (A), (B), or (A and B). For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase &#x201c;A, B, and/or C&#x201d; means (A), (B), (C), (A and B), (A and C), (B and C), or (A, B, and. C). The term &#x201c;between,&#x201d; when used with reference to measurement ranges, is inclusive of the ends of the measurement ranges.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The description uses the phrases &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;in embodiments,&#x201d; which may each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore, the terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; and the like, as used with respect to embodiments of the present disclosure, are synonymous. The disclosure may use perspective-based descriptions such as &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; and &#x201c;side&#x201d;; such descriptions are used to facilitate the discussion and are not intended to restrict the application of disclosed embodiments. Unless otherwise specified, the use of the ordinal adjectives &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and &#x201c;third,&#x201d; etc., to describe a common object, merely indicate that different instances of like objects are being referred to, and are not intended to imply that the objects so described must be in a given sequence, either temporally, spatially, in ranking or in any other manner.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, showing, by way of illustration, some of the embodiments that may be practiced. In the drawings, same reference numerals refer to the same or analogous elements/materials so that, unless stated otherwise, explanations of an element/material with a given reference numeral provided in context of one of the drawings are applicable to other drawings where elements/materials with the same reference numerals may be illustrated. The accompanying drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Moreover, it will be understood that certain embodiments can include more elements than illustrated in a drawing, certain embodiments can include a subset of the elements illustrated in a drawing, and certain embodiments can incorporate any suitable combination of features from two or more drawings.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Various operations may be described as multiple discrete actions or operations in turn in a manner that is most helpful in understanding the claimed subject matter. However, the order of description should not be construed as to imply that these operations are necessarily order dependent. In particular, these operations may not be performed in the order of presentation. Operations described may be performed in a different order from the described embodiment. Various additional operations may be performed, and/or described operations may be omitted in additional embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples provided herein, interaction may be described in terms of two, three, four, or more electrical components. However, this has been done for purposes of clarity and example only. It should be appreciated that the devices and systems described herein can be consolidated in any suitable manner. Along similar design alternatives, any of the illustrated components, modules, and elements of the accompanying drawings may be combined in various possible configurations, all of which are clearly within the broad scope of the present disclosure. In certain cases, it may be easier to describe one or more of the functionalities of a given set of flows by only referencing a limited number of electrical elements.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the states of switches may be referred to as &#x201c;open&#x201d; and &#x201c;closed.&#x201d; In some embodiments, a switch may comprise a physical throw, where the term &#x201c;open&#x201d; may refer to the throw opening the circuit in which the switch is implemented preventing the flow of current and the term &#x201c;closed&#x201d; may refer to the throw completing the circuit in which the switch is implemented allowing the flow of current.

Further, when referring to a switch comprising a transistor allowing current flow or preventing current flow, it should be understood that current flow when the switch is allowing current flow may be an amount of current flow through the transistor when &#x201c;closed&#x201d; and the current flow when the switch is preventing current flow may be an amount of current flow through the transistor when &#x201c;open&#x201d; (which may be non-zero in some instances). It should be understood that the amount of current allowed to the flow through the transistor when &#x201c;open&#x201d; and when &#x201c;closed&#x201d; can be dependent on the characteristics of the transistor, and the terms &#x201c;open&#x201d; and &#x201c;closed&#x201d; are to be interpreted as one having ordinary skill in the art would understand when referring to a transistor being utilized as a switch.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), micro-light-emitting diodes (&#x3bc;LEDs), and pixels of &#x3bc;LED arrays may be referred to as being &#x201c;turned on&#x201d; and being &#x201c;turned off.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;turned on&#x201d; may refer to the state, or the transition to the state, where current is allowed to flow through the LEDs, the &#x3bc;LEDs, and/or the pixels of the &#x3bc;LED arrays.

Further, the pixel unit <b>104</b> may receive a signal that can cause the PWM switch <b>108</b> to turn on and turn off in accordance with the PWM duty cycle. For example, the PWM duty cycle may comprise a percentage of a cycle that the PWM switch <b>108</b> is to be turn on, where the signal causes the PWM switch <b>108</b> to be turned on for the percentage of the PWM duty and turned off for the rest of the cycle. When the PWM switch <b>108</b> is turned on, the current produced by the current source may cause current to flow through the LED <b>106</b> causing the LED <b>106</b> to emit light.

In the illustrated embodiment, the cycle <b>502</b> extends for a period from a first time <b>504</b> to a second time <b>506</b>. The cycle <b>502</b> may be utilized for determining when each of the pixels of an array is to be on to produce an image indicated by image data (such as the image data <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) in accordance with the embodiments described herein. For example, the duty cycles of the pixels may indicate a percentage of the cycle <b>502</b> that each of the pixels is to be on. Further, turn-on delays that may be determined for each of the pixels may indicate an amount of time after the first time <b>504</b> of the cycle <b>502</b> that each of the pixels is to be turned on.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The timing chart <b>500</b> shows turn-on times for pixels within the five groups produced in accordance with the grouping <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In particular, the timing chart <b>500</b> shows five different rows where each row corresponds to a corresponding group. A first group <b>508</b> is illustrated by a first row, a second group <b>510</b> is illustrated by a second row, a third group <b>512</b> is illustrated by a third row, a fourth group <b>514</b> is illustrated by a fourth row, and a fifth group <b>516</b> is illustrated by a fifth row. Each of the groups correspond to the groups indicated by the grouping <b>400</b>. In particular, the first group <b>508</b> corresponds to the first group <b>406</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), the second group <b>510</b> corresponds to second group <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), and so forth. It should be understood that the different groups are shown in different rows for clarity and that the time axis of the timing chart <b>500</b> applies to each of the rows. For example, the first time <b>504</b> and the second time <b>506</b> may be applied at the same position of the time axis as indicated by the corresponding dashed lines in the timing chart.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Each pixel within the &#x3bc;LED array may have an associated turn-on delay, where the turn-on delay may define amount of time after a beginning of a cycle that the pixel is to be turned on. For example, the turn-on delay may define an amount of time that a pixel is to be turned on after the first time <b>504</b> of the cycle <b>502</b> in the illustrated embodiment. The turn-on delay for each of the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array may be determined based on the group in which the pixel is assigned, the amount of pixels assigned to the group of which the pixel is included, an order number of the pixel within the group of which the pixel is included, a period of the cycle <b>502</b>, or some combination thereof. For example, the first group <b>508</b> may include five pixels as indicated by the first group <b>406</b> of the grouping <b>400</b>. In particular, the first group <b>508</b> may include the pixel labeled with the pixel number of &#x2018;1&#x2019;, the pixel labeled with the pixel number of &#x2018;2&#x2019;, the pixel labeled with the pixel number of &#x2018;3&#x2019;, the pixel labeled with the pixel number of &#x2018;18&#x2019;, and the pixel labeled with the pixel number of &#x2018;19&#x2019;. The pixels may be included in the group based on the duty cycles of the pixels, as described throughout this disclosure. The period of the cycle <b>502</b> may be divided by the amount of pixels within a group to determine a delay increment for the group, where the delay increment can be used for determining the turn-on delay of each of the pixels within the group. For example, the period of the cycle <b>502</b> may be divided by five to determine the delay increment for the first group <b>508</b>. The procedure may be repeated for each group to determine delay increments for each group. For example, the delay increment for each group may be determined by the equation td=Tpwm,Np&#xd7;tot, where td is the delay increment for the group, Tpwm is the period of the cycle <b>502</b>, and Np&#xd7;tot is the amount of pixels within the group.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Order numbers of the pixels within a group may be determined based on the pixels within the group and the positions of the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array. In particular, the order numbers of the pixels within a group may be determined based on the positions of the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array relative to the position of the other pixels within the group. Further, the order numbers may be determined based on a pixel numbering approach, such as the pixel numbering approach <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The pixel numbers assigned to the pixels in the pixel numbering approach may indicate positions of the pixels within the &#x3bc;LED array. Determining the order numbers for pixels within a group may include ordering the pixels by the corresponding pixel numbers in an ascending order. For example, the pixels within the first group <b>406</b> may be ordered in an ascending order to produce the order of the pixel labeled with the pixel number of &#x2018;1&#x2019;, the pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;2&#x2019;, the pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;3&#x2019;, the pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;18&#x2019;, and the pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;19&#x2019;. With the pixels ordered in the ascending order, order numbers may he assigned to the pixels starting with the order number &#x2018;0&#x2019; assigned to the first pixel in the ordered pixels of the group and incrementing the order number for next pixel in the ordered pixels of the group. For example, pixel with the pixel number of &#x2018;1&#x2019; may be assigned the order number of &#x2018;0&#x2019;, the pixel with the pixel number of &#x2018;2&#x2019; may be assigned the order number of &#x2018;1&#x2019;, the pixel with the pixel number of &#x2018;3&#x2019; may be assigned the order number of &#x2018;2&#x2019;, the pixel with the pixel number of &#x2018;18&#x2019; may be assigned the order number of &#x2018;3&#x2019;, and the pixel with the pixel number of &#x2018;19&#x2019; may be assigned the order number of &#x2018;4&#x2019; for the first group <b>508</b> in the illustrated embodiment. The procedure may be repeated for each group to assign the pixels in each group with order numbers.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The turn-on delays for each pixel may be determined based on the delay increment for the group in which the pixel is included and the order number assigned to the pixel. In particular, the turn-on delay for a pixel may be determined by multiplying the delay increment by the order number assigned to the pixel. For example, the turn-on delay for the pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;1&#x2019; may be determined by multiplying the delay increment for the first group by 0 for the order number, pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;2&#x2019; may be determined by multiplying the delay increment for the first group by 1 for the order number, pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;3&#x2019; may be determined by multiplying the delay increment for the first group by 2 for the order number, pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;18&#x2019; may be determined by multiplying the delay increment for the first group by <b>3</b> for the order number, and pixel labeled with the pixel number &#x2018;19&#x2019; may be determined by multiplying the delay increment for the first group by <b>4</b> for the order number. For example, the turn-on delay for each of the pixels may be determined by the equation tod=td*(Npx&#x2212;1), where tod is the turn-on delay the pixel, td is the delay increment for the group in which the pixel is included. Npx is the position of the pixel in the ordered pixels of the group in which the pixel is included, and (Npx&#x2212;1) is the order number. The procedure may be repeated for each pixel to determine the turn-on delays for each of the pixels.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The timing chart <b>500</b> illustrates the turn on of the pixels based on the determined turn-on delays for the pixels in accordance with some embodiments. In particular, a leading edge of the steps shown in the timing chart illustrate a turn-on time of the pixel, and the numbers located within the steps indicate the pixel number for the pixel that is being turned on. For example, the first group <b>508</b> includes a first step <b>518</b> showing the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;1&#x2019;, a second step <b>520</b> showing the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;2&#x2019;, a third step <b>322</b> showing the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;3&#x2019;, a fourth step <b>324</b> showing the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;18&#x2019;, and a fifth step <b>326</b> showing the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;19&#x2019;. The positions of the steps may be determined based on the turn-on delays determined for the pixels. For example, the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;1&#x2019; may be determined to have a turn-on delay of zero and, accordingly, may turn on at the first time <b>504</b>. The pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;2&#x2019; may be determined to have a first turn-on delay <b>528</b> and, accordingly, may turn on at the first turn-on delay <b>528</b> after the first time <b>504</b>. Further, the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;3&#x2019; may be determined to have a second turn-on delay <b>530</b> and, accordingly, may turn on at the second turn-on delay <b>530</b> after the first time <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As can be seen from the timing chart <b>500</b>, the turn-on times for the pixels within different groups may be different based on the delay increments being different, The delay increments may be different due to there being different numbers of pixels included in different groups. For example, a turn-on time for a pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;20&#x2019;, as illustrated by step <b>534</b>, may be defined by a turn-on delay <b>532</b>, where the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;20&#x2019; is the second pixel to be turned on within the second group <b>510</b>. The turn-on delay <b>532</b> for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;20&#x2019; is longer than the first turn-on delay <b>528</b> for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;2&#x2019;, where the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;2&#x2019; is the second pixel to be turned on within the first group <b>508</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The turn-on times for the pixels within a group may be uniformly distributed within the cycle <b>50</b>. In particular, the difference between the turn-on time of a pixel within a group and a subsequent turn-on time for the next pixel turned on within the group may be equal for all the pixels within the group. For example, a difference <b>536</b> between the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;2&#x2019; and the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;3&#x2019; may be equal to the difference <b>538</b> between the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;3&#x2019; and the turn-on time for the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;18&#x2019;. The differences between the turn-on times may be defined based on the delay increment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">While the timing chart <b>500</b> illustrates the turn-on times for the pixels, it should be understood that the time that the pixels remain on is defined by the duty cycles for the pixels as shown in the pixel numbering approach <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. For example, the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;1&#x2019; may have the first duty cycle <b>202</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of 10%. After being turned on as shown by the first step <b>518</b>, the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;1&#x2019; may be maintained on for 10% of the cycle <b>502</b>. Once the pixel with the pixel number &#x2018;1&#x2019; has been on for 10% of the cycle <b>502</b>, the pixel may be turned off and remain off until the next cycle.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The approach, including the turn-on delays, shown in the timing chart <b>500</b> may result in pixels having similar duty cycles having delays between turn-on times and turn-off times, where the pixels having similar duty cycles may be defined as the pixels included in the same group. The delay between the turn-on times and turn-off times may cause the difference in total currents provided by a power supply (such as the power supply <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) to the &#x3bc;LED array during operation to be less than the difference in total currents in legacy PWM dimming approaches for producing a same image. The reduced differences may result in less RMS current, less resistive losses, less EMI, and/or less harmonic noise levels for the approach shown in the timing chart <b>500</b> as compared to the legacy PWM dimming approaches. For example, uniformly distributing the turn-on times for each group for the cycle <b>502</b> (as implemented by the approach) may cause summed harmonic currents to be canceled out, which may result in the current provided by the power supply to be less peaky and more like a direct current (DC) than legacy PWM dimming approaches.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example current diagram <b>600</b> for current output by a. power supply, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

In the illustrated embodiment, the current may reach a maximum current of 100 milliamps (mA), such as at a first position <b>602</b>. Further, the current may reach a minimum current of 60 mA, such as at a second position <b>604</b>.
