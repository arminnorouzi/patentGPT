The contents of that application are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bag-making and packaging machine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A bag-making and packaging machine is known which, as disclosed in JP-A No. 2016-107997, drops articles into a film that has been formed into a tubular shape and seals the film to thereby make bags. The bag-making and packaging machine of JP-A No. 2016-107997 includes determining means that determines seal defects. When a seal defect is determined by the determining means, a packaging control unit performs predetermined processes such as suspending activation of a cutter of transverse sealing means to make a chain of packaged products including a part in which foreign matter is entrapped (jammed), and/or temporarily stopping some operating mechanisms such as the transverse sealing means or an entire bag-making and filling machine and issuing an alert, and/or discharging, on the downstream side to the outside of the system, the packaged product determined to have foreign matter entrapped in it.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the present inventor discovered the problem that there are cases where there is a reduction in the quality of the bags manufactured by the bag-making and packaging machine of patent document 1 and cases where there is a reduction in the operating rate of the bag-making and packaging machine.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is a goal of the present invention to provide a bag-making and packaging machine that inhibits a reduction in the quality of the bag it manufactures and inhibits a reduction in its operating rate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to a first aspect of the present invention forms a sheet-like film into a tubular shape and transversely seals the film to thereby manufacture a bag containing an article, the bag-making and packaging machine including a transverse sealing mechanism and a control unit. The transverse sealing mechanism pinches and transversely seals the tubular film that has been formed into a tubular shape to form a transverse seal portion. The control unit determines whether or not there is jamming in the transverse seal portion and, in a case where it has determined that there is jamming, switches between a first bag-making process to continue bag-making operation and a second bag-making process to stop bag-making operation based on the state of jamming.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventor discovered that the problem that there are cases where there is a reduction in the quality of the bag manufactured by the bag-making and packaging machine of patent document 1 and cases where there is a reduction in the operating rate of the bag-making and packaging machine is based on the following primary cause. Specifically, in a case where a bag is determined to have a seal defect and is made into a chain bag, if the bag tears and an article comes out from the bag the article sticks to a member that perform transverse sealing. If the manufacturing of the bag is continued in this state, the article sticks to the bag that is subsequently manufactured and the quality of the bag is reduced. If, to prevent this, bag-making operation by the bag-making and packaging machine are stopped when a bag is determined to have a seal defect, the operating rate ends up being reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, as a result of diligent consideration to achieve a balance between inhibiting a reduction in quality and inhibiting a reduction in the operating rate, the present inventor came upon the idea of changing, in a case where it has been determined that there is jamming of an article when transverse sealing has been performed, the bag-making process based on the state of jamming, and thus completed the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bag-making and packaging machine of the first aspect includes the control unit that switches between the first bag-making process to continue bag-making operation and the second bag-making process to stop bag-making operation based on the state of jamming. For this reason, the control unit can perform the first bag-making process for inhibiting a reduction in the operating rate and the second bag-making process for inhibiting a reduction in quality based on the state of jamming. Consequently, there can be provided a bag-making and packaging machine that inhibits a reduction in the quality of the bags it manufactures and inhibits a reduction in its operating rate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to a second aspect of the present invention is the bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to the first aspect, wherein the control unit switches between the first bag-making process and the second bag-making process based on at least two determination values.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to the second aspect, the control unit has determination values relating to the state of jamming. For this reason, by setting a determination value for when something relatively large is entrapped and a determination value for when something relatively small is entrapped (jammed), the state of jamming can be easily determined based on the plural determination values.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to a third aspect of the present invention is the bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to the first aspect or the second aspect, further including a cutting mechanism that cuts the transverse seal portion. The control unit performs, as the first bag-making process, a process to cease the cutting of the transverse seal portion by the cutting mechanism and manufacture a chain bag in which a plurality of bags are interconnected.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to the third aspect, when the state of jamming is one where something relatively small is entrapped, the control unit manufactures a chain bag without stopping bag-making operation. In this way, in the case of small jamming, a reduction in the operating rate can be inhibited because the control unit continues bag-making operation. Furthermore, by making into a chain bag with a bag having something entrapped in its transverse seal portion, the bag can be easily discriminated as a defective product.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to a fourth aspect of the present invention is the bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to the first aspect to the third aspect, wherein at least one of the first bag-making process and the second bag-making process includes a process to change the bag-making capacity.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to the fourth aspect, the control unit performs a process to automatically change the bag-making capacity after it has performed a process to manufacture a chain bag, for example, as the first bag-making process, and/or after it has performed a process to stop bag-making operation, for example, as the second bag-making process. Because of this, occurrences of jamming can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to a fifth aspect of the present invention is the bag-making and packaging machine pertaining to the second aspect, wherein the first bag-making process displays an indication that a first determination value has been exceeded.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the bag-making and packaging machine of the fifth aspect, a display of an indication that the first determination value has been exceeded can be performed while bag-making operation is continued based on the state of jamming. For this reason, the user can be made aware of the state of jamming.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present invention, there can be provided a bag-making and packaging machine that inhibits a reduction in the quality of the bags it manufactures and inhibits a reduction in its operating rate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a packaging machine including a bag-making and packaging machine of an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the packaging machine including the bag-making and packaging machine of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing bags manufactured in the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of the bag-making and packaging machine of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side view of a transverse sealing mechanism of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side view of paths traced by sealing jaws of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart showing control steps executed by a control unit of the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a drawing for describing switching between a first bag-making process and a second bag-making process by the control unit of the embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram of the bag-making and packaging machine of an example modification.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A bag-making and packaging machine <b>100</b> pertaining to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below.
