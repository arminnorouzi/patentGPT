While plant walls can improve the appearance and air quality of an indoor and/or outdoor space, they can be difficult to maintain. Delivering water to each of the plants in a plant wall can be labor intensive, and automated water delivery systems can be unreliable, inefficient, and/or unbalanced (e.g., leading to overwatering of some plants and underwatering of others). A lack of water or excess water delivery to a plant in a plant wall can often go undetected until all or part of the plants starts to die. For example, some known plant walls operate by watering a top row of the plant wall and allowing excess water to trickle down to lower rows. Such plant walls will tend to overwater the top row and underwater the bottom row. Other known plant walls may water individual rows of plants that are partially isolated from each other, for example, by allowing excess water to flow into a permeable drain layer. Such plant walls may nonetheless allow excess water from higher rows to backflow into lower rows, which can result in overwatering of lower rows. This can create inefficiencies, as replacement of dead plants can be costly, both from an economic perspective and from a time perspective. Monitoring water delivery to individual plants or groups of plants can substantially prevent plant death and reduce maintenance costs of a plant wall.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, systems for watering plants in a plant wall can be prone to failure, for example watering lines and/or drip holes can become clogged. When watering systems of known systems fail, identifying the point of failure can be complex and/or repair may require replacement of functional portions of the watering system. Therefore, maintaining and repairing known plant walls can be time consuming and expensive. Accordingly, a need exists for systems and methods that enable the monitoring of water delivery to individual plants or groups of plants and systems and methods that allow for failures of watering systems to be rapidly identified for targeted repair or replacement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments described herein relate to plant support systems and methods of operating the same.

Monitoring and controlling the watering of individual plants or individual sections of plants can be a challenging process. Some embodiments of plant walls can be architecturally integrated into a building. Such plant walls may be custom built and plumbed to the building's high-pressure water lines and/or waste water lines. Such high-pressure custom-built systems can have costly installations, as they often rely on a room in a building near the plant wall to house an irrigation control system. The irrigation control system can receive incoming water, reduce the pressure, and inject a small amount of fertilizer. Any water not used by the plants is often drained and not used again. Other embodiments of plant walls can be &#x201c;stand alone&#x201d; units. Such units may include a recirculating design that need less frequent addition of fresh water and/or less frequent disposal of used water. Such walls may also be easier to install and may not require tapping into building plumbing, as the water supply can be filled at various rates (e.g., every 2-3 weeks) with a watering can and/or a hose, depending on tank size and consumption rate. However, according to known designs, emitter clogging can become very difficult to manage in a recirculating tank wall design because, by recirculating the same water repeatedly, precipitates and/or sediments can build up in the emitters and cause clogs.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, plant walls can include moisture sensors and/or other types of localized sensors that can detect problems if the sensor happens to be placed in a problematic area. However, the initial cost and maintenance (e.g., battery changes, recalibration, etc.) of such sensors can be prohibitive. Some known plant walls implement a few (e.g., one or two) sensors, in areas where it is suspected that less water will be delivered. Such an approach may be insufficient to detect unexpected and slower to develop blockages. Plant support systems described herein include precise, cost-efficient water management techniques to reduce the amount of maintenance needed in the plant support system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Metering and/or monitoring water delivery to individual plants or rows of plants can aid in preventing plant death and improve the efficiency of the plant support system. In some embodiments, the plant support system can be divided into an array of panels. The panels can be organized vertically in rows and horizontally in columns. In other words, the rows of panels can be vertically stacked upon one another. A water delivery system can deliver water to each of the panels of the plant support system. Delivery of water into each panel and/or each column can be monitored, such that a clog or other impedance in the water delivery system can be quickly pinpointed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Plant support systems that monitor the delivery of water to each panel and/or column can be advantageous over plant support systems without such a monitoring ability, as a failure to deliver water (e.g., due to a clog or mechanical failure) can be identified long before the plants dry out and start to die. This contrasts to known plant support systems in which users typically rely on visual cues to determine whether a section of a plant support system is not receiving the right amount of water. By the time the plants show visual signs of dehydration, they have already begun to die, and are often beyond the point of revitalization. Replacement of dead plants may be necessary to maintain the visual appeal of the plant support system. This can be costly and labor intensive, particularly in large plant support systems. For example, if a plant support system is disposed on the side of a tall building and covers an entire side of the building, replacement of one or more plants in the plant support system may require ladders or scaffolding. By monitoring the water delivery to such a plant support system with specificity, the average plant life can be extended, such that maintenance costs are reduced and the visual appeal of the plant support system is maintained more consistently.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a plant support system <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment.

It should be understood, however, that in some embodiments, panels <b>120</b> may include soil.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The plant carrier system <b>110</b> can include one or more sensors to detect delivery of water to the panels <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the sensors can be incorporated into the housing that holds the panels <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the sensors can be incorporated into the panels <b>120</b> to detect delivery of water to the panels <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the panels <b>120</b> can include moisture sensors disposed therein to monitor the moisture levels of each of the panels <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the moisture sensors can be Wi-Fi-enabled. In some embodiments, the moisture sensors can be connected to Wi-Fi. In some embodiments, the panels <b>120</b> can include one or more devices to measure delivery of water to the panels <b>120</b> in real time. In some embodiments, the housing and/or the panels <b>120</b> can include a strain gauge to measure water delivery. In some embodiments, a single strain gauge can measure water delivery to a column of the panels <b>120</b> and/or water exiting from the column of the panels <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, one or several or all of the panels <b>120</b> can include a strain gauge that registers a strain change each time an amount of water is delivered to one of the panels <b>120</b>. For example, when water is delivered to one of the panels <b>120</b>, it can saturate the matrix and excess water can exit via a drain opening, for example in a stream and/or a series of droplets. The strain gauge can detect a deflection and/or change in strain as water exiting the panel strikes or otherwise affects the sensor. As water is added to a panel <b>120</b>, the flow exiting the panel will typically increase until the matrix is fully saturated, reach a steady state, and then once the watering has ceased, decrease. Therefore, by detecting the rate at which water exits the panel <b>120</b> (or column of panels) and/or the pattern of droplet strikes, the sensor can be operable to monitor the watering state of a panel and/or detect malfunctions (e.g., clogs). For example, if a pump is operating and attempting to deliver water to a panel, but no water is detected exiting the panel (e.g., within a predetermined period of time), this can be an indication that the panel <b>120</b> is not receiving water. In addition or alternatively, by detecting when and/or at what rate water exits the panel <b>120</b> (or column of panels), the sensor can be operable to monitor when a panel is fully saturated. When the monitoring system determines that a panel is fully saturated, one or more of the pumps can be shut off (e.g., manually or automatically). Such control of deployment of water can improve water efficiency as well as energy efficiency. The strain gauges can communicate with a monitoring system. The monitoring system can include a user interface operable to present information about the delivery of water to each of the panels <b>120</b>. Based on the data appearing on the user interface, a user can determine which panels (if any) are not receiving adequate water and can accordingly pinpoint a location of a clog or other impedance to water delivery. For example, the monitoring system can include an alert protocol. For example, an alarm can sound, indicating that adequate water is not being delivered to one or more of the panels <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, excess water dripped from the panels <b>120</b> can be detected via an electrical conductivity (EC) sensor (not shown). For example, the excess water can be collected in a reservoir (e.g., a vee-shaped reservoir that is tilted so water can drain out as it is collected). As the water drains, the water can complete a circuit for two or more probes placed in the reservoir. The EC sensor can detect a change in resistance between the probes. In addition to water sensing, an EC sensor can sense nutrient concentrations and alert the user when there is an excess or deficiency of nutrient solution, for example, based on conductivity of water as it drains past two or more probes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The water delivery system <b>140</b> can include a series of pumps, tubes, and orifices for delivery of water to the plant carrier system <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the water delivery system <b>140</b> can include multiple pumps, each pump delivering water to a specified row of panels <b>120</b>. In other words, each pump can be configured to have an outlet pressure corresponding to a height of a row of panels. Each pump can be fluidically coupled to a series of tubes to deliver water to a specified row of the panels <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By having a 1:1 pump to row ratio, water delivery problems can be more accurately pinpointed, and the percentage of the panels <b>120</b> that are out of use during repairs can be minimized. For example, if each of the panels <b>120</b> on the third row of panels are not receiving adequate water, there may be an issue with the pump that delivers water to the third row of panels. There may also be a clog on a riser line that delivers water to the third row of panels. In either case, only the third row of panels is out of order during repair. In contrast, in a system with a single pump delivering all of the water to the system, delivery of water to the entire system can be halted while the problem is pinpointed, particularly if the pump needs repair or replacement. In some embodiments, the pumps included in the water delivery system <b>140</b> can be fluidically coupled to a reservoir (not shown). In some embodiments, excess water can exit the panels <b>120</b> and re-enter the reservoir via a series of drainage channels and gutters.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the water delivery system <b>140</b> can include a single pump that selectively delivers water to the rows of panels <b>120</b> via one or more valves. For example, a valve can be fluidically coupled to the pump and can allow fluidic communication between the pump and a first row of the panels <b>120</b> in a first configuration. The valve can allow fluidic communication between the pump and a second row of the panels in a second configuration. In some embodiments, the valve can allow fluidic communication between the pump and a third row of panels in a third configuration.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The illumination system <b>170</b> is an optional component of the plant support system <b>100</b>.

In some instances, seeds, bulbs, and/or plants can be planted in the seeding cavities <b>224</b>. The seeding holes <b>222</b> penetrate the full depth of the panels <b>220</b> while the seeding cavities only partially indent the panels <b>220</b>. In some instances, the plants can be rooted in the seeding holes <b>222</b> while the seeding cavities <b>224</b> provide aeration for the plants. The seeding cavities <b>224</b> can provide aeration to space the growing medium away from the surface of the panels <b>220</b>. This can ensure that there is air on substantially all sides around the growing medium, such that roots can grow out into the growing medium in substantially all directions. In other embodiments, the seeding holes <b>222</b> can be configured to accept larger plants, while the seeding cavities are configured to accept smaller plants.

For example, the feeder line <b>250</b><i>a </i>can feed from a first reservoir and the feeder line <b>250</b><i>b </i>can feed from a second reservoir. This can be beneficial if each row of the panels <b>220</b> includes plants with differing nutrient needs. Water with a first nutrient recipe can be contained in the first reservoir, while water with a second nutrient recipe can be contained in the second reservoir.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some instances, each of the pumps <b>242</b> can be configured deliver the same or substantially the same amount of water to their respective rows of panels <b>220</b>. In other instances, the pumps <b>242</b> can deliver different amounts of (metered) water to their respective rows of panels <b>220</b>. For example, the pump <b>242</b><i>a </i>can deliver a first volume of water to a first row of the panels <b>220</b> while the pump <b>242</b><i>b </i>delivers a second volume of water to a second row of the panels <b>220</b>, the second volume of water different from the first volume of water. In some instances, each of the pumps <b>242</b> can be calibrated to deliver water to a particular height. For example, the pump <b>242</b><i>a </i>can be calibrated to deliver metered (e.g., known) quantities of water against a first fluid head, and the pump <b>242</b><i>b </i>can be calibrated to deliver metered (e.g., known) quantities of water against a second fluid head, the second fluid head greater than the first fluid head.

In some instances, the pumps <b>242</b> can deliver more water to higher levels of the panels <b>220</b> than to lower levels of the panels <b>220</b>. For example, the pump <b>242</b><i>d </i>can deliver more water to a fourth row of panels <b>220</b> than the pump <b>242</b><i>a </i>delivers to the first row of panels <b>220</b>. This can be due to the higher rows of panels <b>220</b> being closer to a light source and/or a ceiling duct, such that more water is consumed from the higher rows of the panels <b>220</b>. In other instances, pumps <b>242</b> can deliver more water to lower levels of the panels <b>220</b> than to higher levels of the panels.

As an additional example, if the water is flowing from right to left through the emitter lines <b>246</b> and the third and fourth panels (when counting from the right side) on the third row of the panels <b>220</b> are not receiving water, there is likely a clog or stoppage between the second and third panels on the third row of the panels <b>220</b>. In such a situation, the user can simply shut down the pump <b>242</b><i>c </i>that delivers water to the third row rather than shutting down all of the pumps <b>242</b>. The user can then service the emitter line <b>246</b><i>c </i>that delivers water to the third row of the panels <b>220</b> without disturbing other portions of the plant support system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown, the riser lines <b>244</b>, the emitter lines <b>246</b>, and the feeder lines <b>250</b> are visible on the outside of the plant carrier system <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the riser lines <b>244</b>, the emitter lines <b>246</b>, and/or the feeder lines <b>250</b> can be routed internally (i.e., inside the panels <b>220</b>), such that they are not visible to an outside observer. This can reduce or eliminate risk of the riser lines <b>244</b>, the emitter lines <b>246</b>, and/or the feeder lines <b>250</b> becoming pulled or tangled.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the drip holes <b>248</b> can have a diameter of at least 50 &#x3bc;m, at least 100 &#x3bc;m, at least 150 &#x3bc;m, at least 200 &#x3bc;m, at least 250 &#x3bc;m, at least 300 &#x3bc;m, at least 350 &#x3bc;m, at least 400 &#x3bc;m, at least 450 &#x3bc;m, at least 500 &#x3bc;m, at least 550 &#x3bc;m, at least 600 &#x3bc;m, at least 650 &#x3bc;m, at least 700 &#x3bc;m, at least 750 &#x3bc;m, at least 800 &#x3bc;m, at least 850 &#x3bc;m, at least 900 &#x3bc;m, at least 950 &#x3bc;m, at least 1 mm, at least 1.5 mm, at least 2 mm, at least 2.5 mm, at least 3 mm, at least 3.5 mm, at least 4 mm, or at least 4.5 mm.

For example, when &#x201c;plants&#x201d; are described herein, it should be understood to include fungi grown as crops or for their aesthetic properties (e.g., mushrooms), lichens, algae, or other suitable organisms. Unless explicitly described otherwise, &#x201c;plant(s)&#x201d; and &#x201c;plant life&#x201d; generally refer to stationary organisms (or colonies of organisms) that at least partially grow in air and are fixed in a hydrated matrix (e.g., soil, rockwool, etc.).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used in this specification, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the term &#x201c;a member&#x201d; is intended to mean a single member or a combination of members, &#x201c;a material&#x201d; is intended to mean one or more materials, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, &#x201c;water&#x201d; can include, but is not limited to pure water. For example, when &#x201c;water&#x201d; is described herein, it should be understood to include water mixed with nutrients, plant growth supplements, or any other additives associated with plant support.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; when used in connection with &#x201c;cylindrical,&#x201d; &#x201c;linear,&#x201d; and/or other geometric relationships is intended to convey that the structure so defined is nominally cylindrical, linear or the like. As one example, a portion of a support member that is described as being &#x201c;substantially linear&#x201d; is intended to convey that, although linearity of the portion is desirable, some non-linearity can occur in a &#x201c;substantially linear&#x201d; portion. Such non-linearity can result from manufacturing tolerances, or other practical considerations (such as, for example, the pressure or force applied to the support member). Thus, a geometric construction modified by the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; includes such geometric properties within a tolerance of plus or minus 5% of the stated geometric construction. For example, a &#x201c;substantially linear&#x201d; portion is a portion that defines an axis or center line that is within plus or minus 5% of being linear.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As used herein, the term &#x201c;set&#x201d; and &#x201c;plurality&#x201d; can refer to multiple features or a singular feature with multiple parts. For example, when referring to a set of panels, the set of panels can be considered as one panel with multiple portions, or the set of panels can be considered as multiple, distinct panels. Thus, a set of portions or a plurality of portions may include multiple portions that are either continuous or discontinuous from each other. A plurality of particles or a plurality of materials can also be fabricated from multiple items that are produced separately and are later joined together (e.g., via mixing, an adhesive, or any suitable method).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Various concepts may be embodied as one or more methods, of which at least one example has been provided.

Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the disclosure. That the upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges can independently be included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the disclosure, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range.

Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d;, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As used herein in the specification and in the embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, &#x201c;at least one of A and B&#x201d; (or, equivalently, &#x201c;at least one of A or B,&#x201d; or, equivalently &#x201c;at least one of A and/or B&#x201d;) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">While specific embodiments of the present disclosure have been outlined above, many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the embodiments set forth herein are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. For example, although plant carrier systems are generally described with panels arranged in rows and columns, it should be understood that any sort of organization panels is possible. For example, panels can be arranged in offset rows (e.g., a running bond), a hexagonal pattern, a pattern of concentric circles, a spiral pattern, etc. As another example, panels are generally shown and described as containing holes for the growth of multiple plants. It should be understood that panels can accommodate any number of plants, including one plant each.
