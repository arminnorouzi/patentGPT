Here the thickness of the disc from a central part to an arc-shaped edge or rim gradually changes from small to large. The disc is soft and has good safety as well as flight performance.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some cases it is of interest to provide the throwing object with effects such as sounds and lights. In order to do this, electrically powered elements such as diodes and speakers may be added. In order to operate these also a power source such as a battery is required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">CN106166390 discloses a disc where such elements have been added.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, it is problematic to attach such elements to a soft disc. It is for instance unsuitable to use screws. It is additionally important that the flight performance should remain as unaffected as possible.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention addresses the problem of safely attaching electrically powered elements to a soft disc while retaining good aerodynamic properties.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of the invention is concerned with a disc shaped throwing object comprising a soft disc having a central section, a bridging section and a rim, where the central section forms a disc centre through which a central axis is defined and which central section is joined to the rim via the bridging section. The disc further comprises a holding structure placed radially around the central axis, which holding structure is joined with and stretches out in a direction along the axis away from an inner surface of the central section and is adapted to hold a module in abutment with the inner surface, which module is a module with electrically operated elements, such as light sources and speakers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The module may be removable, such that it can get attached, detached and reattached to the disc. This may be of interest if the attachment is not permanent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disc may have a Shore D hardness of 40-90 and preferably of 50-70. The material of the disc may be an elastomer, such as silicone, rubber, a thermoplastic elastomer or a thermoplastic rubber.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The holding structure may be shaped as a flexible wall projecting out from the inner surface along the axis at a radial distance from the axis and encircling a holding area where the module is to be held. The disc centre may have a first thickness at the central axis. The wall may have a second thickness that is 8-16 times higher, with advantage 10 times higher than the first thickness. The first thickness at the disc centre point may as an example be in the range of 0.3-0.5 mm, preferably 0.44 mm, while the wall may have a thickness in the range of 4.0-4.6 mm, preferably of 4.3 mm.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The shape of the holding structure may be adapted to the shape of the module, where the wall may have a diameter that diminishes in the direction away from the inner surface of the central section.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The wall of the holding structure may stretch in a range of 5.2-5.6 mm, preferably 5.4 mm from an interface between the central and bridging sections towards the central axis and may be dimensioned for holding the module having a weight in the range 4.2-4.8 g, and preferably weighing 4.5 g.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The throwing object may also comprise the module that may thus weigh in the range 4.0-5.0 g, and preferably weigh 4.5 g. The module may, as was described, be removable. The module may additionally have a diameter of 29-35 mm, preferably of 32 mm. The module may also have an actuator, for instance in the form of a button, that may rest on or against the inner surface of the central section when the module is held by the holding structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The thickness of the bridging section may also decrease from the rim towards the central section.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, the rim may comprise an inner surface radially displaced from the central axis and a sequence of curved contour sections. The inner surface of the rim may at one end be joined to an inner surface of the bridging section and at a second end to an outer surface of the bridging section via the contour sections, where the contour sections interconnect the inner surface of the rim with the outer surface of the bridging section via a first extreme radius placed at a maximum horizontal distance from the inner surface of the rim. The inner surface of the bridging section may have a first curvature and a last contour section in the sequence together with at least a part of the outer surface of the bridging section may have a second, different curvature. The curvatures may cause the thickness of the bridging section to decrease towards the central axis.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first curvature may be an exponential curvature starting from a starting radius on the inner surface of the rim and the second curvature may be a parabolic curvature starting from the first extreme radius.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is in this case furthermore possible that the first curvature is formed as an exponential curve so that radial position changes on the first curvature starting from the starting radius on the inner surface of the rim are exponential for changes along the central axis in a direction towards an outer surface of the disc centre and that the second curvature is formed as a second degree polynomial curve, so that radial position changes on the second curvature starting from the first extreme radius are parabolic in the direction along the central axis towards the outer surface of the disc centre.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is in the above-mentioned case also possible that the starting radius on the inner surface of the rim is axially aligned with the first extreme radius.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another variation it is possible that the rim comprises a second extreme radius placed at a maximum distance along the central axis from the outer surface of the disc centre.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second extreme radius is thus no radius that is closest to or furthest away from the central axis, but a radius of the object that is axially furthest away from the outer surface of the disc centre.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is possible that the first extreme radius is placed closer to an axially highest radius of the rim than it is to the second extreme radius, where the axially highest radius of the rim may be the rim radius that is axially closest to the outer surface of the disc centre.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is additionally possible that the second extreme radius is radially closer to the inner surface of the rim than it is to the first extreme radius.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The contour sections may comprise a first curved contour section stretching from the inner surface of the rim to the second extreme radius, a second curved contour section stretching from the second extreme radius to an intermediate radius between the inner surface of the rim and the first extreme radius, a third curved contour section stretching from the intermediate radius to the first extreme radius and a fourth curved contour section that is the last curved contour section of the sequence.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this case it is additionally possible that the first and second curved contour sections are parabolic starting from the second extreme radius so that axial position changes on these curvatures starting from the second extreme radius are parabolic for radial changes away from the second extreme radius. It is also possible that the third and fourth curved contour sections are parabolic starting from the first extreme radius so that radial position changes on these curvatures starting from the first extreme radius are parabolic for axial changes away from the first extreme radius. The curvatures of the first, second, third and fourth curved contour sections may for instance be curvatures with shapes as second-degree polynomial curves.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rim may thereby also have an essentially ear shaped cross-section.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is furthermore possible that the curvature of the second curved contour section gradually transitions into the curvature of the third curved contour section around the intermediate radius.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another possible variation, the curvature of the second contour section is the same as the curvature of the first curved contour section in the vicinity of the second extreme radius and the curvature of the third contour section is the same as the curvature of the fourth contour section in the vicinity of the first extreme radius.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The central section may additionally have a first radius in relation to the central axis. It is additionally possible that the central section has a uniform thickness.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this case it is possible that the diameter of the object is at least 10 times bigger than the radius of the central section, and with advantage in the range 20-30 times bigger.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is additionally or instead possible that the bridging section has an inner radius coinciding with the radius of the central section at which it is joined to the central section and an outer radius at which it is joined to the rim, wherein the outer radius is in the range 8-14 times the inner radius.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another possibility is that the width of the rim in the radial direction, i.e.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">between first extreme radius and the inner surface of the rim, is in the range 4-8 mm.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Yet another possibility is that the object has a thickness in the range of 10-14 mm. This thickness may be the thickness at the centre point when also the rim is considered.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The disc may additionally have a weight that is in the range 45-55 g and preferably 48.8 g. Thereby the disc may be significantly heavier than the module. The disc may be in the range 9-14 and with advantage about 11 times heavier than the module.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The invention has a number of advantages. It allows the simultaneous reaching of several different objectives. It allows a module with electrically powered element to be used with the soft disc. Thereby the user experience of the throwing object may be enhanced. In use, the module is safely held to the disc. This is also achieved with a minimal influence by the module on the flying ability of the throwing object.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Generally, all terms used in the claims are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the technical field, unless explicitly defined otherwise herein.

The central section <b>12</b> may be considered to be a first air cushion section and the bridging section <b>14</b> may be considered to be a second air cushion section. The sections are termed this way since in use both of them are supposed to be lifted by an air cushion.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The central section <b>12</b> is cylindrical and may have a uniform thickness T<b>1</b> corresponding to the height of the cylinder, that is furthermore solid. The thickness is in this case in the range of 0.3-0.5 mm, where a preferred thickness may be 0.44 mm. As the central section <b>12</b> is shaped as a cylinder, there is also defined a central axis AX through the middle, i.e. through a centre point of this central section <b>12</b>, and the section has a first radius R<b>1</b> in relation to the central axis AX. This centre point is also a disc centre. Thereby the central section <b>12</b> may form a disc centre through which the central axis is defined.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The central section <b>12</b> has an inner surface and an outer surface, where the inner surface is also termed a central section inner surface CSIS and the outer surface is termed a central section outer surface CSOS. The central section inner surface CSIS forms a bowl like cavity together with an inner surface of the rim <b>16</b> and an inner surface of the bridging section <b>14</b>, which cavity in use is to be lifted by the previously mentioned air cushion.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It can also be seen that the bridging section <b>14</b> has an inner radius coinciding with the first radius R<b>1</b> of the central section <b>12</b> and an outer radius R<b>2</b> at which it is joined to the rim <b>16</b>. As can be seen in the figures this bridging section <b>14</b> does not have a uniform thickness, but instead a thickness that increases towards the rim <b>16</b> or decreases towards the central section <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The rim <b>16</b> in turn has a cross-section shaped as an ear.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As can best be seen <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the central section <b>12</b> is provided with a holding structure <b>18</b> in order to hold the module <b>20</b> against the central section inner surface CSIS.

The holding structure <b>18</b> is shaped as a flexible wall projecting out from the central section inner surface CSIS in the axial direction and encircling a holding area where the module <b>20</b> is to be held. The wall is placed at the radial distance R<b>1</b> from the axis AX. The wall also has a diameter that diminishes in the direction along the axis AX away from the central section inner surface CSIS. The diameter variation may depend on the shape of the module <b>20</b>. The diameter variation may as an example be a step-wise diameter reduction corresponding to the shape of the module <b>20</b>. The shape of the holding structure <b>18</b> may thus be shaped after the shape of the module <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The holding structure may for this reason have a first radius R<b>3</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the first diameter of the base section <b>22</b>, a second radius R<b>3</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the second diameter of the shoulder section <b>24</b> and a third radius R<b>3</b><i>c </i>corresponding to the third diameter of the main section <b>26</b>. Thereby a first part of the holding structure <b>18</b>, when holding the module <b>20</b>, encircles the base section <b>22</b> at the first radius R<b>3</b><i>a, </i>a second part of the holding structure <b>18</b> encircles the shoulder section <b>24</b> at the second radius R<b>3</b><i>b </i>and covers and holds the base section <b>22</b> against the central section inner surface CSIS and a third part encircles the main section <b>26</b> at the third radius R<b>3</b><i>c </i>and covers and holds the shoulder section <b>24</b> towards the inner surface CSIS.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The thickness T<b>2</b> of the wall may be in the range of 4.0-4.6 mm, preferably 4.3 mm. A wall with a diminishing diameter may furthermore have an extension in the radial direction from an interface between the central section <b>12</b> and the bridging section <b>14</b> towards the axis AX in a range of 5.2-5.6 mm and preferably 5.4 mm.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The disc <b>11</b> is typically made in one piece and it is with advantage also flexible, so that it can be folded, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. It can thereby be easily stowed away and carried around, such as in a pocket. It will because of this also be soft, which is good for avoiding injuries. The material of which the disc is made may for this reason be an elastomer, such as silicone, Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE), Thermoplastic Rubber (TPR) or rubber. It may additionally have a Shore D hardness of 40-90 preferably of 50-70.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A soft disc having the above-mentioned properties is soft and has excellent aerodynamic or air flight properties. A soft and thin object has another advantage. When this object is flying in the air, central parts around the central axis, such as the central section and parts of the bridging section, will be lifted higher by an air cushion than peripheral parts, such as the parts of the bridging section close to the rim. A bulge is thereby formed around the central axis. In this way the aerodynamic properties are further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Through the realization of the holding structure, it is furthermore possible to effectively and safely hold the electronic module without jeopardizing the aerodynamic properties. It is thereby possible to provide the throwing object with various effects that might enhance the experience of throwing the object, such as light sources that may be blinking and speakers emitting audible sounds, with minimal negative influence on the flying capability. In order to provide such effects, the module <b>20</b> may be equipped with diodes <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, which as an example may be placed in cavities of the shoulder section <b>24</b>. In order to power these elements a power source, such as a battery, may also be included. Due to the soft material holding structure realization, the module may be easily removed, which may be desirable in case the battery needs to be replaced. A replacement may also be of benefit in case different types of effects are to be combined with the disc. Some types of light sources may for instance be preferred during day time and others during night time. The module <b>20</b> may thus be removable. The user is thereby allowed to easily remove and replace the module. However, it is also possible that the module is fixedly attached to the central section <b>12</b> and/or the holding structure <b>18</b>, for instance using glue. It may even be possible to change the power source of such a fixedly attached module in case this power source is easily accessible via the main module section <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The module <b>20</b> may also have an actuator <b>34</b>, for instance in the form of a button, which may be used to turn on and off the elements of the module <b>20</b>, such as to turn on and off components such as diodes. The actuator <b>34</b> may also be used for changing modes of the diodes, such as changing between permanent, pulsating and blinking lights. In the example given here, the actuator <b>34</b> is placed in the bottom <b>32</b> of the base section <b>22</b>. It is thus placed in a surface of the electronic module <b>20</b> that is held against the central section inner surface CSIS of the disc ii. Thereby the actuator <b>34</b> rests on the central section inner surface CSIS when the module <b>20</b> is held by the holding structure <b>18</b>. This has the advantage of allowing a user to actuate the module from the central section outer surface CSOS. The actuation can thereby be made with only a slight change of grip through for instance changing the position of the thumb. This simplifies the actuation, such as a change of mode, when a user is at the same time about to throw the object.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The electrically powered elements are not limited to LEDs and speakers, but also other types of elements may be used. It is for instance possible with sensors such as accelerometers or magnetometers.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The aerodynamic properties of the throwing object will now be described with reference being made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b></figref><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a second enlargement of a part of the cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> showing a rim and parts of a bridging section and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a third enlargement with further details of the rim and bridging section.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As may be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the rim has an inner surface RIS at a distance from the central axis AX corresponding to the second radius R<b>2</b> and a sequence of curved contour sections CS<b>1</b>, CS<b>2</b>, CS<b>3</b>, CS<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The inner surface RIS of the rim <b>16</b> has the same distance R<b>2</b> to the central axis AX. It is thereby curved around and surrounds and faces the central axis AX. The inner surface RIS thereby surrounds a cylindrical volume with radius R<b>2</b> centred around the central axis AX. Moreover, the inner surface RIS is at a first end joined to an inner surface BSIS of the bridging section <b>14</b> and at a second end is joined to an outer surface BSOS of the bridging section <b>14</b> via the contour sections CS<b>1</b>, CS<b>2</b>, CS<b>3</b> and CS<b>4</b> and. Thereby, the first end is also joined to a flat inner surface CSIS of the central section <b>12</b> via the inner surface BSIS of the bridging section <b>14</b> and the second end is also joined to an outer surface CSOS of the central section <b>12</b> via the contour sections CS<b>1</b>, CS<b>2</b>, CS<b>3</b> and CS<b>4</b> and the outer surface BSOS of the bridging section <b>14</b>. The inner surface of the bridging section will in the following be termed bridging section inner surface the outer surface of the bridging section will be termed bridging section outer surface and the inner surface of the rim will be termed the rim inner surface.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, the contour sections CS<b>1</b>, CS<b>2</b>, CS<b>3</b> and CS<b>4</b> interconnect the rim inner surface RIS with the bridging section outer surface BSOS via a first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> placed at a maximum radial distance from the rim inner surface RIS. The first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> can thereby be considered to be an edge in the contour of the rim <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, the bridging section inner surface BSIS has a first curvature and the last contour section CS<b>4</b> in the sequence of contour sections together with at least a part of the bridging section outer surface BSOS has a second, different curvature, where the combination of these curvatures cause the thickness of the bridging section <b>14</b> to decrease towards the disc centre, which in this case is also towards the central section <b>12</b>. Through having two curvatures in this way it is possible to optimize different aspects of the flying object independently of each other. The first curvature may as an example be designed in order to decrease very rapidly from the rim <b>16</b> towards the central section <b>12</b> in the neighbourhood of the rim and thereafter to decrease slowly, which may be important if the weight of the throwing object <b>10</b> is to be lowered. At the same time the second curvature can be designed for other purposes, such as in order to achieve various aerodynamic goals.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">One way in which two such curvatures are obtained in the figures will now be described.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">One example of a first curve C<b>1</b> that is an exponential curve and that may be employed for forming the first curvature is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a</i></figref>. One example of a second curve C<b>2</b> that is a second-degree polynomial curve that may be employed for forming the second curvature is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>. This second curve has an extreme point EP which is a minimum.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to the variation of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the first curvature of the bridging section inner surface BSIS is formed as an exponential curve, such as the curve C<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref><i>a, </i>so that radial position changes on the first curvature starting from a starting radius on the rim inner surface RIS are exponential for changes in the direction of the central axis AX towards the outer surface of the disc centre, which in this case is also towards the central section outer surface CSOS. This means that as the axial distance on the rim inner surface in the axial direction decreases from the starting radius SR towards the central section outer radius, the radial distance to the central axis AX decreases exponentially. The radius of the bridging section inner surface BSIS thus decreases exponentially with decreasing axial distances from the starting radius towards the central section outer radius CSOS. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, it is additionally possible that the starting radius SR is axially aligned with the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b>. They may thus be placed at essentially the same position along the axis AX.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The second curvature may instead be formed like a second degree polynomial curve, such as the curve C<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>, so that radial position changes on the second curvature starting from the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> are parabolic for changes in the direction along the central axis AX towards the outer surface of the disc centre, which in this case is also towards the central section outer surface CSOS. This means that as an axial distance on the surface of the last contour section CS<b>4</b> and the bridging section outer surface BSOS is decreased from the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> towards the outer surface of the disc centre, which in this case is also towards the central section outer radius CSOS, the radial distance to the central axis AX decreases parabolically. The radius of the contour section CS<b>4</b> and at least some parts of the bridging section outer surface BSOS thus decrease parabolically with decreasing axial distances from the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> towards the outer surface of the disc centre, which in this case is also towards the central section outer surface CSOS. The curve may thus be a parabolic curve, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>, where the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> corresponds to an extreme point EP of such a curve C<b>2</b>, such as a maximum or a minimum. Moreover, the radius at which the transition from the last contour section CS<b>4</b> of the rim <b>16</b> to the bridging section outer surface BSOS is made is an axially highest HR radius of the rim <b>16</b>. The axially highest radius HR is thus the radius of the rim <b>16</b> that is axially closest to the outer surface of the disc centre, which in this case is also the central section outer surface CSOS.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the rim <b>16</b> may also comprise a second extreme radius ER<b>2</b>. This extreme radius may be placed at a maximum distance in the direction of the central axis AX away from the outer surface of the disc centre, which in this case is also away from the central section outer surface CSOS. The radius is thus no radius that is closest to or furthest away from the central axis AX, but a radius of the object that is axially furthest away from the outer surface of the disc centre, which is here the central section outer surface CSOS.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As mentioned earlier the rim <b>16</b> comprises a sequence of contour sections. This sequence is a sequence according to which the contour sections are joined to each other. It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> that the sequence comprises a first curved contour section CS<b>1</b>, a second curved contour section CS<b>2</b>, a third curved contour section CS<b>3</b> and a fourth curved contour section CS<b>4</b>, which fourth curved contour section is the last curved contour section in the sequence. Alternatively, the fourth curved contour section may be considered to be the first in the sequence and the fourth to be the last.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The first curved contour section CS<b>1</b> stretches from the rim inner surface RIS to the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b>, the second curved contour section CS<b>2</b> stretches from the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b> to an intermediate radius IR between the rim inner surface RIS and the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b>, the third curved contour section CS<b>3</b> stretches from the intermediate radius IR to the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> and the fourth curved contour section stretches from the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> to the axially highest radius HR of the rim <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">It can here be seen that the first and second curved contour sections CS<b>1</b> and CS<b>2</b> have curvatures shaped as second-degree polynomial curves so that axial changes on these curvatures starting from the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b> are parabolic for changes in the radial direction away from the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b>. The axial distance from the curved contour sections CS<b>1</b> and CS<b>2</b> to the axially highest radius HR thereby decrease parabolically for changes in the radial direction away from the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b>. The curved sections may more particularly, at least initially, be curved according to the same parabolic curve. The first and second curved contour sections CS<b>1</b> and CS<b>2</b> may thus be shaped according to the same second-degree polynomial curve. The curve may thus be a parabolic curve, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>, where the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b> corresponds to the extreme point EP, such as a maximum or a minimum, and the first curved contour section may be shaped as a part of the curve on one side of the extreme point, while the second curved contour section may be at least partly shaped as a part of the curve on the other side of the extreme point ES.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The third and fourth curved contour sections CS<b>3</b> and CS<b>4</b> may likewise be formed as second-degree polynomial curves so that radial changes on these curvatures starting from the first extreme radius ES<b>1</b> are parabolic for axial changes away from the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b>. The radial distance from the curved contour sections CS<b>3</b> and CS<b>4</b> to the axis AX thereby decrease parabolically for changes in the axial direction away from the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b>. The curved contour sections may also here, at least initially, be curved according to the same parabolic curve. The third and fourth curved contour sections CS<b>3</b> and CS<b>4</b> may thus be shaped according to the same second-degree polynomial curve. The curve may thus be a parabolic curve, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>, where the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> corresponds to the extreme point EP, such as a maximum or a minimum, and the third curved contour section may be at least partly shaped as a part of the curve C<b>2</b> on one side of the extreme point ES, while the fourth curved contour section may be shaped as a part of the curve on the other side of the extreme point ES.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the curvature of the second curved contour section CS<b>2</b> may gradually transition into the curvature of the third curved contour section CS<b>3</b> around the intermediate radius IR. The second curved contour section CS<b>2</b> may therefore only have the same curvature as the first curved contour section CS<b>1</b> in the vicinity of the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b>, while the third curved contour section CS<b>3</b> may only have the same curvature as the fourth curved contour section CS in the vicinity of the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">One other observation that can be made in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is that the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b> is placed closer to the axially highest radius HR of the rim <b>16</b> than it is to the second extreme radius ES<b>2</b>. It can also be seen that the second extreme radius ER<b>2</b> is radially closer to the rim inner surface RIS than it is to the first extreme radius ER<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The diameter D of the disc may be at least ten times bigger than the radius R<b>1</b> of the central section <b>12</b>, and with advantage 20-30 times bigger. The outer radius R<b>2</b> of the bridging section <b>14</b> may in turn be in the range 8-14 times bigger than the inner radius R<b>1</b>. The width W of the rim in the radial direction, i.e. between first extreme point ES<b>1</b> and the rim inner surface RIS may be in the range 4-8 mm. The disc may finally have a thickness T<b>3</b> in the range of 10-14 mm, which thickness may essentially be the thickness of the rim <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The disc of the throwing object realized in this way has a very thin central section <b>12</b> and a bridging section <b>14</b> that quickly becomes very thin. Thereby it is possible to make the object lightweight. This improves the ability of the object <b>10</b> to stay long in the air. Through the design of the rim <b>16</b>, the object can at the same time be firmly gripped and accurately thrown. The curved contour sections of the rim also gives the object good aerodynamic properties allowing a stable flight and makes the object less inclined to wobble in the air.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The weight of the disc may be in the range 45-55 g and preferably 48.8 g. As the module may have a weight in the range 4.0-5.0 g, and preferably weigh 4.5 g, the disc is significantly heavier than the module. The disc may be in the range 9-14 and with advantage about 11 times heavier than the module. This is another reason for the impact of the module on the flying ability of the throwing object being limited.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">There are a number of variations that may be made to the invention apart from those already disclosed. It is for instance possible that the central section does not have any uniform thickness but also has a thickness that diminishes towards the disc centre. It should also be realized that the use of different described curvatures on the rim and bridging section is also optional. The rim may have any type of conventional realization.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The invention has mainly been described above with reference to a few embodiments.
