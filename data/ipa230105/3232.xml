Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a series fan frame body structure, and more particularly to a fan frame body structure in which two fans are serially connected in a nonparallel form.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A fan can provide forced cooling effect. Therefore, the fan is irreplaceably applied to the server of a large-scale storage device to play a decisive role in heat dissipation. A high-performance fan not only can save power, but also can enhance the stability of the operation of the device. Moreover, it has become one of the competitive issues of fan manufacturers how to design low-noise fan products.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, due to the change of the market and the trend to develop future cloud system, the cloud system has a requirement for the fans that is different from the other fields. First, the performance of the fans applied to the cloud system is required to be 10% or even 15% higher than the other fields. This is because in the cloud and network communication system, the unit operation density is extremely high and the operation conditions of the chassis and the power supply are much stricter than any other environment. Moreover, the operation of the cloud system always 24-hour continues without interruption. Therefore, the requirements of the cloud system for stability, heat dissipation ability and noise control are much higher than a common system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With respect to a high-density large-scale server, it is necessary to use a fan tray to provide strong airflow for achieving the object of heat dissipation. Therefore, in practice, there is a system of serially connected fan trays. Multiple sets of serially connected fans are further combined in parallel to form a large-scale fan tray system so as to achieve the object of heat dissipation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the internal space of the server, the hard disk device such as HDD is generally positioned right in front of the fan tray. The other heat generation components such as the CPU/GPU, DIMMs, memory card or the control panel are positioned right behind the fan tray. In this case, the direction of the flow field is nearly lined up with the respective components. Accordingly, the airflow will flow through the space of the hard disk on the front side into the blades of the heat dissipation fan and then exhaust to the rear side. As a result, the blades of the heat dissipation fan will periodically bear the pulse effect of the non-uniform airflows at the inlet and the outlet. This will make regular dipole noise to create louder periodical noise. The higher the requirement for the performance and heat dissipation effect is, the greater the extent to which the fan is affected by the development of the dipole is and the louder the periodical noise is.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to the dipole development of noise, after combined in parallel, the pairs of conventional fans generally will interact on each other to synergize the noise. Therefore, the periodical noise will become more serious. It is therefore tried by the applicant to provide a fan frame body structure and a fan with the fan frame body structure to solve the problem of noise or vibration caused after the fans are serially connected or combined in parallel.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a series fan frame body structure, in which a first axis of a first fan frame body extends from a first opening of a serial connection frame body into a closed communication passage of the serial connection frame body and a second axis of a second fan frame body extends from a second opening of the serial connection frame body into the closed communication passage of the serial connection frame body. The first axis and the second axis intersect each other to contain an obtuse angle so as to destroy the structure of the audio frequency dipole produced by the noise and reduce vibration.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide the above series fan frame body structure, which has a serial connection frame body having a trapezoidal closed peripheral frame serially connected between the first and second fan frame bodies in nonparallel to each other so as to destroy the structure of the audio frequency dipole produced by the noise and reduce vibration.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve the above and other objects, the series fan frame body structure of the present invention includes: a first fan frame body having a first passage and a first bearing cup seat, the first bearing cup seat having a first axis extending from a center of the first bearing cup seat; a second fan frame body having a second passage and a second bearing cup seat, the second bearing cup seat having a second axis extending from a center of the second bearing cup seat; and a serial connection frame body disposed between the first fan frame body and the second fan frame body. The serial connection frame body has a surrounding closed peripheral frame. The closed peripheral frame defines therein a closed communication passage. Two ends of the closed communication passage respectively have a first opening and a second opening arranged in nonparallel to each other. The first and second fan frame bodies are respectively disposed at the first and second openings. The closed communication passage is in communication with the first and second passages to together form a nonlinear closed airflow passage. The first and second axes extend into the closed communication passage of the serial connection frame body to intersect each other and contain an obtuse angle, whereby the first fan frame body and the second fan frame body are serially connected in nonparallel to each other. By means of the nonlinear closed airflow passage, the incoming and outgoing directions of the airflow are changed so as to change the audio frequency property and reduce the periodical interference effect.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present invention, the first and second bearing cup seats are arranged in a nonparallel form. Therefore, in the system, due to the resistance of the structure with such configuration, the audio frequency dipole structure is destructed so that the periodical noise and vibration characteristic are lowered.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective exploded view of the fan frame body structure of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional assembled view of the fan frame body structure of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional assembled view of the fan frame body structure of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sectional assembled view showing that the fan frame body structure of the present invention is applied to a fan.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective exploded view of the fan frame body structure of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional assembled view of the fan frame body structure of the present invention.
