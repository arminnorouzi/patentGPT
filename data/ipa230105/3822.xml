No. 16/426,670 by ZLOGAR et al., entitled &#x201c;SATELLITE ANTENNA WITH SENSOR FOR LINE-OF-SIGHT DETECTION&#x201d; filed May 30, 2019, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/822,581 by ZLOGAR, et al., entitled &#x201c;SATELLITE ANTENNA WITH SENSOR FOR LINE-OF-SIGHT DETECTION,&#x201d; filed Aug. 10, 2015, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A satellite antenna is typically aligned upon deployment to the location the satellite antenna is to be used. The alignment process may include pointing the satellite antenna in a general area of the target (e.g., a geosynchronous satellite) and partially fixing the satellite antenna to the object (e.g., a building or other structure) or ground on which it is to be mounted. Next, a series of feedback steps may be used to make fine adjustments to the pointing direction of the satellite antenna until it is determined that the satellite antenna is actually aligned with the target. Once a good alignment is determined, an installer may fix the mounted position of the satellite antenna.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common problem after aligning and mounting a satellite antenna is that its line-of-sight (LOS) conditions may change over time. This may result in degraded performance. Changes in LOS conditions may be the result of changes in pointing direction of the satellite antenna. Causes of changed LOS conditions may include, for example, a weakening of a support structure (e.g., a sagging building), a slipping of a wall mount, an impact to the satellite antenna (e.g., a ball striking the satellite antenna), or an obstruction between the satellite antenna and the satellite (e.g., foliage growing or a new building). Diagnosing degraded performance at the satellite antenna may require rolling a truck to the location so a technician can determine the cause of the degraded performance and attempt to correct it. In some cases, the technician may arrive at the antenna location only to verify that the antenna is still correctly aligned but the antenna is temporarily obstructed by something at the customer site which could have been relatively easily correctable by the customer themselves. Unnecessary truck rolls may lead to increase costs. In other cases, intermittently degraded performance may be due to wind or other temporary condition which may not occur when the technician arrives at the antenna location. This can make it challenging to identify the cause of the degraded performance. If the satellite antenna is misaligned or obstructed, determining a cause of the misalignment or obstruction may be important to allocate costs of realigning the satellite antenna. In addition, early detection of misalignment or obstruction of the satellite antenna may enable a quicker resolution, which may improve the customer experience and reduce the effects of degraded antenna performance on the overall system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods, systems, and devices are described for line-of-sight (LOS) pointing diagnostics of a satellite antenna. The satellite antenna may include a LOS sensor that captures a field of view (FOV) that includes a beam of the satellite antenna. Data from the LOS sensor may be used as a diagnostic tool for determining if the position of the satellite antenna has changed or an obstruction has occurred. The data may also be used to determine if there is some other reason for degraded performance. The sensor data may be reviewed locally via a satellite terminal or remotely after successful installation and setup having known good LOS conditions of the satellite antenna. The sensor data may be compared with initial data from the LOS sensor that was captured and stored at the outset of the initial good alignment. A misalignment or obstruction may be detected if there is a difference between the sensor data and the stored sensor data associated with good LOS conditions. The sensor data may also be used to, among other things, determine a pointing direction of the satellite antenna, detect an ongoing weather event, and assist in achieving the initial good LOS conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Described examples include a method for use in a satellite communication system. The method may include storing first sensor data captured by an LOS sensor of a satellite antenna at a first time. The first sensor data may indicate a first LOS condition of the satellite antenna. The first LOS condition may correspond to the satellite antenna having a LOS with a satellite of the satellite communication system that is aligned and unobstructed. The method may further include receiving second sensor data captured by the LOS sensor at a second time. The second time may be after the first time. The second sensor data may indicate a second LOS condition of the satellite antenna. The method may also include determining an LOS condition change for the satellite antenna between the first time and the second time based on a comparison of the second sensor data with the first sensor data.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other described examples include a satellite communication system. The satellite communication system may include a satellite antenna that includes an adjustable mounting device, a satellite transceiver module that transmits and receives data via the satellite antenna, and an LOS sensor coupled with the satellite transceiver module. The satellite communication system may also include an alignment device that receives first sensor data captured by the LOS sensor at a first time. The first sensor data may indicate a first LOS condition of the satellite antenna corresponding to the satellite antenna having a LOS with a satellite of the satellite communication system that is aligned and unobstructed. The alignment device may also receive second sensor data captured by the LOS sensor at a second time after the first time, the second sensor data indicating a second LOS condition of the satellite antenna. The alignment device may also determine an LOS condition change for the satellite antenna between the first time and the second time based on a comparison of the second sensor data with the first sensor data.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Yet other described examples include a satellite communication system that includes a satellite network controller. The satellite network controller may store first sensor data captured by an LOS sensor of a satellite antenna at a first time, the first sensor data indicating a first LOS condition of the satellite antenna corresponding to the satellite antenna having a LOS with a satellite of the satellite communication system that is aligned and unobstructed. The satellite network controller may also receive second sensor data captured by the LOS sensor at a second time after the first time, the second sensor data indicating a second LOS condition of the satellite antenna. The satellite network controller may determine an LOS condition change for the satellite antenna between the first time and the second time based on a comparison of the second sensor data with the first sensor data.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of examples according to the disclosure in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood.

The satellite antenna may include a line-of-sight (LOS) sensor that captures data in a field-of-view (FOV) that includes a beam of the satellite antenna desired to be pointed in a direction at a satellite of the satellite communication system. The LOS sensor data may be used to monitor and verify LOS conditions for the satellite antenna. The LOS sensor may also be used, for example, to detect a weather event, verify unobstructed LOS conditions for an installation location, determine if the pointing direction of the satellite antenna has changed from a known good alignment direction, detect an obstruction or a potential obstruction in the beam of the satellite antenna, and for overlaying feedback for positioning the satellite antenna.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">This description provides examples, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of embodiments of the principles described herein. Rather, the ensuing description will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing embodiments of the principles described herein. Various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, various embodiments may omit, substitute, or add various procedures or components as appropriate. For instance, it should be appreciated that the methods may be performed in an order different than that described, and that various steps may be added, omitted or combined. Also, aspects and elements described with respect to certain embodiments may be combined in various other embodiments. It should also be appreciated that the following systems, methods, devices, and software may individually or collectively be components of a larger system, wherein other procedures may take precedence over or otherwise modify their application.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For satellite antennas, particular those used on customer premises, it may be beneficial to be able to remotely or autonomously diagnose problems related to LOS conditions of a satellite antenna. A satellite antenna with good or desired LOS conditions may be aligned and unobstructed, while problems related to poor LOS conditions include misalignment or obstruction of the satellite antenna beam. Various techniques described herein utilize at least one LOS sensor as a diagnostic tool for detecting changes in pointing direction (e.g., misalignment, etc.) and/or obstruction (e.g., tree branch, new building, etc.). The techniques may be used to detect slow degradation of the LOS conditions (e.g., foliage growth, drift of the satellite mount, etc.) and/or for detecting major events (e.g., an object hits the satellite antenna, tree branch falls in front of the beam, etc.).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The LOS sensor may be a camera (e.g., a charged couple device (CCD)), radar, or LIDAR sensor, for example. The LOS sensor may use optical, radio frequency, or infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example. LOS sensor data for a particular time after installation can be compared with previously stored LOS sensor data corresponding to known good LOS conditions (e.g., aligned and unobstructed). The comparison can be used to determine a change in an LOS condition of the satellite antenna (e.g., from aligned to misaligned). In some embodiments, prior to storage, the LOS sensor data is automatically processed to identify one or more reference features in the surrounding environment. The processed sensor data corresponding to a representation of these reference features can then be stored while the remaining sensor data is discarded.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The methods, systems, and devices described herein may reduce the cost of installation and maintenance for satellite antennas, especially for non-professional or do-it-yourself installers. The LOS conditions of the satellite antenna may be viewed locally at the satellite or remotely after an initial successful installation. The LOS sensor data may be used to determine if the pointing direction of the satellite antenna has changed since the initial installation. In some cases, the LOS sensor data may be used to rule out misalignment or obstruction of the satellite antenna as the reason for poor signal performance. Further, repositioning or performing an initial installation may be aided by the LOS sensor data. The LOS sensor may also be used, for example, to detect a weather event, determine if the pointing direction of the satellite antenna is drifting, determine how the pointing direction of the satellite antenna has changed, detect an obstruction or a potential obstruction in the beam of the satellite antenna, and for overlaying feedback for aligning the satellite antenna.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a diagram of a satellite communication system <b>100</b> in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.

As illustrated, the satellite communication assembly <b>210</b> includes circuitry to support satellite communications assembled into a housing with the feed horn <b>215</b> opening towards the reflector <b>205</b>. Electromagnetic signals, such as signals <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may be transmitted by and received at the satellite communication assembly <b>210</b> via downlink and uplink beams.

One or more of the foot <b>250</b> and the mounting brackets <b>245</b> may function as an adjustable mounting device. The mast <b>255</b> may be installed and adjusted (e.g., using adjustments on legs <b>240</b>) such that the top portion is plumb (i.e., relatively perpendicular to the horizon), allowing the elevation and azimuth of the reflector <b>205</b> to be adjusted independently via the mounting bracket assembly <b>235</b>. The installer may then position the reflector <b>205</b> to the proper azimuth, elevation, and skew. As described in more detail below, the installer positions the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>to point the beam (e.g., boresight <b>260</b>) at a target (e.g., a satellite). The installer may position the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>by moving the entire satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>by hand.

The initial azimuth, elevation, and skew angles for pointing the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>can be determined by the installer based on the known location of the satellite and the known geographic location where the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>is being installed. In the illustrated embodiment, the surface of the reflector <b>205</b> is non-parabolic and includes a major axis (the longest line through the center of the reflector <b>205</b>) and a minor axis (the shortest line through the center of the reflector <b>205</b>). The installer can adjust the skew angle of the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>via the skew plate <b>230</b> until the major axis of the reflector is aligned with the geostationary arc.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>is coarsely positioned to the general directional coordinates of the first satellite, the elevation and/or azimuth angles can be further adjusted by the installer to fine tune the pointing until the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>is sufficiently pointed at the satellite group.

Alternatively, a measurement device may be used to measure some other metric indicating the signal strength of the received signal. The measurement device may for example be an external device that the installer temporarily attaches to the electrical feed. As another example, the measurement device may be integrated into the transceiver. In such a case, the measurement device may for example produce audible tones indicating signal strength to assist the installer in pointing the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The installer can then iteratively adjust the elevation and/or azimuth angle of the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>until the received signal strength, as measured by the measurement device, reaches a predetermined value. In some embodiments, the installer adjusts the position of the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>until the received signal strength is maximized. In other words, the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>is positioned such that the peak of the beam (e.g., boresight <b>260</b>) is pointed directly at the satellite.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once the beam is sufficiently pointed at the satellite, the installer can immobilize the mounting bracket assembly <b>235</b> to preclude further movement of the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The satellite communication assembly <b>210</b> may also include at least one LOS sensor <b>220</b>.

The LOS sensor <b>220</b> may be positioned on the satellite communication assembly <b>210</b> such that the axis <b>270</b> is generally parallel with boresight <b>260</b>.

This movement may be due to an azimuth drift of the satellite antenna, such as a drift in the mounting or a slipping of the mounting bracket assembly <b>235</b>. In this example, the satellite antenna is not aligned with the satellite <b>105</b>-<i>b</i>, since the beam contour <b>410</b>-<i>a </i>does not include the satellite <b>105</b>-<i>b</i>.

In some examples, the alignment device may detect the position change of the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a </i>based on one or more reference features in the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a</i>, which may include determining that the building <b>420</b>, the tree <b>415</b>, or the tree <b>425</b> have changed positions within the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a </i>with respect to their positions in the FOV <b>405</b>. For example, the alignment device may select a feature in the FOV <b>405</b>, such as the building <b>420</b>, as a reference feature and determine its position in the FOV <b>405</b>. The alignment device may use a pixel map of the image of the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a </i>to determine a position of the reference feature, for example. The alignment device may then identify the same reference feature in the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a</i>, which may be done using the same or different techniques. Next, the alignment device may determine the position of the reference feature in the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a</i>. The alignment device may then compare the position of the reference feature in the FOV <b>405</b> with the position of the reference feature in the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a</i>. If the reference feature has moved in FOV <b>405</b>-<i>a </i>relative to FOV <b>405</b>, the alignment device may determine that the LOS condition for the satellite antenna has changed. Based on the amount of change of position of the reference feature, the alignment device may determine if the satellite <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>is likely to be outside of contour <b>410</b>-<i>a</i>. Thus, the alignment device may detect a misalignment or obstruction of the satellite antenna based on a comparison of the LOS sensor data from the second time to the LOS sensor data from the first time.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In other examples, the alignment device may receive a series of captured sensor data indicating a series of LOS conditions for the satellite antenna and detect a change in alignment or obstruction of the satellite antenna. For example, a series of FOV images may indicate slight movement in reference features, and while the beam contour <b>410</b> may still be aligned with the satellite <b>105</b>-<i>b</i>, the alignment device may predict that continued change in pointing direction may cause a performance degradation of the satellite antenna at a future time. Based on this prediction, the alignment device may issue a warning message based on the predicted performance degradation of the satellite antenna. The warning message may indicate the satellite antenna may become misaligned or obstructed. This may prevent a disruption in service to re-align the satellite antenna or fix the cause of the change in pointing direction.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some examples, the satellite antenna may be configured to autonomously track one or more moving satellites. For example, in a LEO system, the satellite antenna may track a first satellite while it passes over the satellite location, and then switch to a tracking a second, different satellite once the first satellite passes out of view. The satellite antenna may use a series of FOV images from the LOS sensor to predictively switch service prior to service interruptions. For example, based on a series of FOV images, the satellite antenna may determine that the first satellite is about to pass behind a building and switch service to the second satellite before losing service from the first satellite.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> shows a diagram <b>400</b>-<i>b </i>illustrating a third image of an FOV <b>405</b>-<i>b </i>from an LOS sensor of a satellite antenna in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.

In such a case, the installer may first point the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>b </i>using signal strength (e.g., transmit signal, receive signal, or both).

The time the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>b </i>determines to capture the second sensor data may be based on one or more events.

Based on position changes of reference features, the alignment device <b>505</b> can determine that the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>b </i>may have become misaligned or obstructed. The comparison may be based on multiple reference features, and determining whether the satellite antenna or a reference feature has moved may be based on a comparison of multiple reference features or the type of reference feature.

For example, the satellite antenna may be moving back and forth due to strong wind. The alignment device <b>505</b> may determine that the satellite antenna has fluctuating pointing direction by comparing the series of captured images to each other and detecting the small changes in the FOV between the images (e.g., based on reference features in the FOV, etc.). The alignment device <b>505</b> may use fast pixel map processing techniques to detect the jittering motion of the satellite antenna.

The installer may have access to the output device <b>705</b> during the alignment process. Using the reposition feedback <b>730</b>, the output device <b>705</b> may display an image with a reference marker overlayed on the image (<b>735</b>). The image may correspond to a current image of the FOV of the LOS sensor data, for example. The reference marker may be, for example, an x indicating the position of satellite <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D and <b>4</b>F</figref>. The reference marker may indicate to the installer where to position the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d</i>. In some examples, the output device <b>705</b> outputs a series of images from the LOS sensor with at least one reference marker overlayed on the series of images.

For example, the installer may move the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>in a direction or way indicated by the reference marker. In some examples, the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>has mechanical features, such as servomechanisms, that enable the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>to automatically reposition itself based on the feedback <b>730</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Once repositioned, the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>captures second sensor data corresponding to the new position of the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>(<b>740</b>). The satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>may send the second sensor data <b>745</b> to the alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>b</i>. The alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>b </i>may compare a position of the main beam of the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>in the second sensor data to the position of the main beam in the first LOS sensor data (<b>750</b>). In some examples, the alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>a </i>may use reference features (e.g., buildings, trees, etc.) in the FOV from the LOS sensor to determine the current position of the target satellite in the second sensor data. If the beam LOS deviates from the target satellite position more than a threshold amount, the alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>b </i>may continue to provide feedback to the output device <b>705</b> and receive additional sensor data until the alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>b </i>determines that the beam LOS of the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>is properly aligned with the target satellite. If, however, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the main beam of the satellite antenna is determined to be aligned with the satellite position within a threshold amount, the alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>b </i>may determine that good LOS conditions for the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>has been achieved (<b>755</b>). The alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>b </i>may output an alignment signal (<b>760</b>). The output device may output the alignment indication so that the installer or the satellite device <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>knows that the satellite device <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>is properly aligned (<b>765</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">If a weather event is detected during installation or repositioning of the satellite antenna, the alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>b </i>may adjust a pass/fail criteria for approval of an installation of the satellite antenna at the customer location based on the determined weather event. For example, an installation may be deemed to be acceptable based on signal quality (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), etc.) between the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>and the satellite. If a storm is occurring between the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>and the satellite, the signal quality may be degraded even when the satellite antenna <b>130</b>-<i>d </i>has an aligned and unobstructed (by local objects) beam LOS. Thus, an otherwise good antenna positioning may fail installation criteria because of the storm. Detection of the storm may be made by automatic detection of sky color or sky temperature in the LOS sensor data, and the pass/fail criteria may be adjusted to account for the degradation in signal quality as a result of the storm.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a block diagram <b>800</b> of an alignment device <b>505</b>-<i>c </i>in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure.

For example, the sensor data comparison module <b>830</b> may compare LOS sensor data from good LOS conditions with second LOS sensor data, or with a series of LOS sensor data. If the sensor data comparison module <b>830</b> determines that there is a change above a threshold amount in position of a reference feature identified by the image feature detection module <b>820</b>, the alignment device may determine that there is a misalignment or obstruction.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The trending module <b>840</b> may detect any trend in the satellite antenna becoming misaligned or obstructed. For example, the trending module <b>840</b> may determine, based on comparison information from the sensor data comparison module <b>830</b>, that a tree is steadily growing towards the main beam of the satellite antenna. In another example, the trending module <b>840</b> may detect that satellite antenna elevation is beginning to sag, which may eventually bring the satellite antenna out of alignment. For example, the trending module <b>840</b> may compare first LOS sensor data of the FOV <b>405</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and the second LOS sensor data of the FOV <b>405</b>-<i>e </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>. Based on a comparison of the LOS sensor data, the trending module <b>840</b> may determine that the beam contour <b>410</b>-<i>e </i>may eventually be obstructed, as the tree <b>415</b>-<i>b </i>grows. Based on the rate of growth of tree <b>415</b>-<i>b</i>, the trending module <b>840</b> may determine a time period before the beam contour <b>410</b>-<i>e </i>becomes obstructed.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some examples, the satellite antenna may already be determined to be misaligned, but because it so far has not resulted in significant performance degradation, the satellite antenna has not yet been repositioned.
