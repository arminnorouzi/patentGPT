With more than 160,000 men diagnosed with PCa in 2017, of which 30,000 succumbed to their evolving treatment-resistant disease. Following surgery or radiation, the standard treatment for biochemically recurrent PCa is continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) with or without concurrent docetaxel until the tumor becomes castration resistant. Second line treatment usually includes continuous MTD abiraterone acetate (AA) therapy, although AA was recently approved to be included in first line therapy. Importantly, advanced PCa is not curable because PCa cells are capable of evolving resistance to any current therapy. Thus, here is investigated the molecular and evolutionary dynamics governing resistance and identify strategies that can use this understanding to maximally prolong tumor control.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior theoretical, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have questioned the utilization of MTD treatment in non-curative settings. That is, continuous MTD treatment fails to consider the evolutionary dynamics of treatment presponse, where competition, adaptation and selection between treatment sensitive and resistant cells contribute to therapy failure. In fact, this strategy, by maximally selecting for resistant phenotypes and eliminating other competing populations, may actually accelerate the emergence of resistant populations&#x2014;a well-studied evolutionary phenomenon termed &#x201c;competitive release.&#x201d; In part to address this issue, prior trials have used an intermittent on- and off-ADT (IADT) to reduce toxicity and delay time to progression (TTP). However, these trials were typically not designed with a detailed understanding of the underlying evolutionary dynamics. For example, a prospective Phase II trial of IADT for advanced PCa included an 8 months induction period in which the patients were treated at MTD prior to beginning intermittent therapy. Modeling studies found that only a small number of ADT-sensitive cells would typically remain after the induction period significantly reducing the efficacy of subsequent intermittent treatment. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated non-inferiority to continuous ADT despite significantly fewer days on treatment, and 38.5% of patients were still responding after 6 years. Even more striking responses are being observed in the ongoing clinical trial of second-line intermittent AA therapy for castration-resistant PCa (median TTP not reached; at least 33 vs. 13 months at continuous MTD AA, p&#x3c;0.001). Although highly promising, successful implementation of intermittent PCa therapy requires (i) identifying resistance mechanisms, (ii) predicting responses and (iii) determining potentially highly patient-specific, clinically actionable triggers for pausing and resuming IADT cycles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed are methods related to using patient specific prostate cancer dynamic model to adjust a patient's intermittent androgen deprivation therapy to determine when to pause IADT, when to resume IADT, the amount of treatment, and the rate of treatment and thereby increasing the time to progression of the tumor and thus prolonging post cancer treatment survival.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, disclosed herein are methods of personalized treatment/inhibition/prevention/reduction of prostate cancer recurrence in a subject following primary treatment comprising: a) measuring prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (such as, for example blood PSA levels) in the patient; b) applying the measured PSA levels to a prostate cancer dynamic model; c) calculating a patient-specific responder parameters; wherein intermittent on-an off-androgen deprivation therapy (IADT) is paused when PSA levels are below patient-specific pre-treatment levels (for example less than 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50% of patient specific pretreatment levels); and wherein IADT is resumed when PSA levels are above patient-specific pre-treatment levels (for example, greater than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100% more than patient specific pre-treatment levels).

The subject can be a vertebrate, for example, a mammal. Thus, the subject can be a human or veterinary patient. The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; refers to a subject under the treatment of a clinician, e.g., physician.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Administration&#x201d; to a subject includes any route of introducing or delivering to a subject an agent. Administration can be carried out by any suitable route, including oral, topical, intravenous, subcutaneous, transcutaneous, transdermal, intramuscular, intra-joint, parenteral, intra-arteriole, intradermal, intraventricular, intracranial, intraperitoneal, intralesional, intranasal, rectal, vaginal, by inhalation, via an implanted reservoir, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intrahepatic, intralesional, and intracranial injections or infusion techniques), and the like. &#x201c;Concurrent administration&#x201d;, &#x201c;administration in combination&#x201d;, &#x201c;simultaneous administration&#x201d; or &#x201c;administered simultaneously&#x201d; as used herein, means that the compounds are administered at the same point in time or essentially immediately following one another. In the latter case, the two compounds are administered at times sufficiently close that the results observed are indistinguishable from those achieved when the compounds are administered at the same point in time. &#x201c;Systemic administration&#x201d; refers to the introducing or delivering to a subject an agent via a route which introduces or delivers the agent to extensive areas of the subject's body (e.g. greater than 50% of the body), for example through entrance into the circulatory or lymph systems. By contrast, &#x201c;local administration&#x201d; refers to the introducing or delivery to a subject an agent via a route which introduces or delivers the agent to the area or area immediately adjacent to the point of administration and does not introduce the agent systemically in a therapeutically significant amount. For example, locally administered agents are easily detectable in the local vicinity of the point of administration, but are undetectable or detectable at negligible amounts in distal parts of the subject's body. Administration includes self-administration and the administration by another.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x201c;Biocompatible&#x201d; generally refers to a material and any metabolites or degradation products thereof that are generally non-toxic to the recipient and do not cause significant adverse effects to the subject.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">&#x201c;Comprising&#x201d; is intended to mean that the compositions, methods, etc. include the recited elements, but do not exclude others. &#x201c;Consisting essentially of&#x201d; when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean including the recited elements, but excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination. Thus, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude trace contaminants from the isolation and purification method and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as phosphate buffered saline, preservatives, and the like. &#x201c;Consisting of&#x201d; shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients and substantial method steps for administering the compositions of this invention.

An aspect of &#x201c;controlled release&#x201d; agent delivery is the ability to manipulate the formulation and/or dosage form in order to establish the desired kinetics of agent release.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">&#x201c;Effective amount&#x201d; of an agent refers to a sufficient amount of an agent to provide a desired effect. The amount of agent that is &#x201c;effective&#x201d; will vary from subject to subject, depending on many factors such as the age and general condition of the subject, the particular agent or agents, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify a quantified &#x201c;effective amount.&#x201d; However, an appropriate &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; in any subject case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation. Also, as used herein, and unless specifically stated otherwise, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of an agent can also refer to an amount covering both therapeutically effective amounts and prophylactically effective amounts. An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of an agent necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect may vary according to factors such as the age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">&#x201c;Pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; component can refer to a component that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the component may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical formulation of the invention and administered to a subject as described herein without causing significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the formulation in which it is contained.

Non-limiting examples of polymers include polyethylene, rubber, cellulose. Synthetic polymers are typically formed by addition or condensation polymerization of monomers. The term &#x201c;copolymer&#x201d; refers to a polymer formed from two or more different repeating units (monomer residues). By way of example and without limitation, a copolymer can be an alternating copolymer, a random copolymer, a block copolymer, or a graft copolymer. It is also contemplated that, in certain aspects, various block segments of a block copolymer can themselves comprise copolymers. The term &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; encompasses all forms of polymers including, but not limited to, natural polymers, synthetic polymers, homopolymers, heteropolymers or copolymers, addition polymers, etc.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x201c;Therapeutic agent&#x201d; refers to any composition that has a beneficial biological effect. Beneficial biological effects include both therapeutic effects, e.g., treatment of a disorder or other undesirable physiological condition, and prophylactic effects, e.g., prevention of a disorder or other undesirable physiological condition (e.g., a non-immunogenic cancer). The terms also encompass pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active derivatives of beneficial agents specifically mentioned herein, including, but not limited to, salts, esters, amides, proagents, active metabolites, isomers, fragments, analogs, and the like. When the terms &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; is used, then, or when a particular agent is specifically identified, it is to be understood that the term includes the agent per se as well as pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active salts, esters, amides, proagents, conjugates, active metabolites, isomers, fragments, analogs, etc.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">&#x201c;Therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;therapeutically effective dose&#x201d; of a composition (e.g. a composition comprising an agent) refers to an amount that is effective to achieve a desired therapeutic result. In some embodiments, a desired therapeutic result is the control of type I diabetes. In some embodiments, a desired therapeutic result is the control of obesity. Therapeutically effective amounts of a given therapeutic agent will typically vary with respect to factors such as the type and severity of the disorder or disease being treated and the age, gender, and weight of the subject. The term can also refer to an amount of a therapeutic agent, or a rate of delivery of a therapeutic agent (e.g., amount over time), effective to facilitate a desired therapeutic effect, such as pain relief. The precise desired therapeutic effect will vary according to the condition to be treated, the tolerance of the subject, the agent and/or agent formulation to be administered (e.g., the potency of the therapeutic agent, the concentration of agent in the formulation, and the like), and a variety of other factors that are appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. In some instances, a desired biological or medical response is achieved following administration of multiple dosages of the composition to the subject over a period of days, weeks, or years.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Throughout this application, various publications are referenced.

Methods of Personalized Prostate Treatment</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer in men in the US. About 1 in 9 American men will be diagnosed with PCa in his lifetime (&#x3e;190,000 estimated in 2020) and 1 in 41 will die from it. Consequently, PCa remains the second leading cause of death in American men. Following surgery or radiation treatment, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the mainstay treatment for hormone sensitive PCa for over 70 years. ADT suppresses the production of testicular androgen, which both the normal and cancerous cells depend on for survival and proliferation. Despite new strategies in &#x201c;precision medicine&#x201d; in which the specific therapy is guided by molecular biomarkers, treatment protocols are typically based on the conventional strategy of &#x201c;maximum tolerated dose until progression&#x201d;. This often results in the competitive release of the resistant phenotype, leading to early treatment progression. In an effort to delay progression, intermittent androgen deprivation treatment (IADT) has been shown to be a promising alternative that reduces toxicity and delays progression in many patients. Despite this advance, patients inevitably develop castration resistant prostate cancer, which often progresses to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Second-line hormone therapy abiraterone acetate, which inhibits the production of androgens from other cells by blocking the protein CYP17, has been shown to prolong overall survival when compared to prednisone or placebo. The PSA response rate to abiraterone plus gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog was 62% with a median time to progression of 11.1 months in the AA-302 trial. It has been proposed that adaptively administering abiraterone in mCRPC, allowing for treatment holidays when a patient has sufficiently responded, may be able to increase overall response and delay progression. However, maximizing the benefit of adaptive therapy requires understanding the dominant drivers of resistance, predicting individual patient responses, and identifying when and how to modulate treatment to maximize response time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">We have developed a quantitative model of prostate cancer stem cell (PCaSC), non-stem cells, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) dynamics to describe the response to IADT in biochemically recurrent PCa patients. Model analysis identified stem cell enrichment as a plausible driver of resistance. With this finding, we used early treatment evolutionary dynamics to predict how patients would respond to subsequent cycles of treatment with an overall accuracy of 89%. For this study, we sought to extend the model to the mCRPC setting and determine whether or not this simple model can describe and predict treatment dynamics. To do so, we calibrated and validated the model against longitudinal PSA data from 16 mCRPC patients receiving adaptive abiraterone in a trial (NCT02415621). We then used early treatment dynamics to predict how individual patient respond to treatment. As these patients are metastatic, we also investigated how metastatic burden can be utilized to maximally predict patient response.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">1. Enrichment in Androgen-Independent PCa Stem Cells (PCaSC) Contribute to IADT Resistance, and Simulating PCaSC Dynamics in Early IADT Treatment Cycles to Computationally Forecast Patient-Specific Disease Dynamics and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Serum Levels Reliably Predict IADT Response or Resistance in Subsequent Treatment Cycles.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">To solve this complex problem an innovative framework can be used to simulate and predict the dynamics of androgen-independent PCaSC, androgen-dependent non-stem PCa cells (PCaC), and blood PSA concentration during IADT. Mathematical model simulations of PCaSC enrichment can be fitted to retrospective longitudinal PSA measurements in individual patients to identify disease dynamics of patients whose tumors became treatment resistant. These analyses identify optimal individual patient PSA cutoff values to trigger treatment on/off decisions to maximally delay onset of resistance and TTP. With this dynamic framework PCaSC and PSA dynamics can be determined as putative triggers to personalize IADT and maximize TTP, ultimately to improve PCa outcomes. While this developmental project focuses on PCa, the concept and methodologies are translatable to multiple other cancers that become resistant to continuous MTD therapy.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">a) Establish an Innovative in Silico Framework to Simulate PCaSC Dynamics and Predict PCa Response to IADT.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">53. An in silico model of PCaSC enrichment and PSA dynamics during IADT can be developed. Model parameters can be derived from a retrospective training set of longitudinal PSA data of patients who either remained responsive (N=17) or became resistant (N=10) to IADT. Model calibrations can be assessed in a validation data set (17 responsive, 11 resistant).

Significance.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men in the US, and continuous ADT at MTD has been the standard of care for many decades. Despite this, as noted by the NIH (NIH cancer.gov website), &#x201c;doctors cannot predict how long hormone therapy can be effective in suppressing the growth of any individual man's prostate cancer.&#x201d; The ability to forecast PCa treatment response and the onset of resistance is the key to dynamically adapting therapy before resistance emerges. IADT with on- and off-treatment cycles is an alternative to continuous ADT at MTD. IADT has two major advantages. It (1) reduces drug use by more than 50%, reducing deleterious side effects, including psychological trauma, hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, loss of libido, and reductions in bone density; and (2) introduces treatment holidays that counteract evolutionary dynamics by allowing treatment-sensitive populations to relapse and successfully compete with growing treatment-resistant clones. In prospective clinical trials, IADT was shown to be no poorer than continuous ADT; but superiority has yet to be confirmed. This is due, at least in part, to the long &#x201c;induction periods&#x201d; in which continuous ADT at MTD is administered for 7-8 months thus preventing evolutionary competition between treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant populations during intermittent treatments. The second-line intermittent AA therapy trial in which treatment is cyclical but based on mathematical models of the underlying evolutionary dynamics (cycle length ranging from 4 to 14 months) showed significant improvements in TTP (median not reached; at least 33 vs. 14 months [in a comparable contemporaneous cohort treated with continuous MTD, ADT] p&#x3c;0.001).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Here this work is extended through the explicit integration of cancer stem cell (CSC) biology in the dynamics of therapy response and resistance. CSCs have been identified in a number of human tumors including PCa. PCaSC are long-lived, treatment resistant, can initiate and propagate tumors, and give rise to heterogeneous tumor populations after treatment. An increase in CSC self-renewal rates is a mechanism of CSC enrichment during prolonged cancer radiotherapy. Similar mechanisms may be at play during continuous PCa therapy, and treatment-induced selection for androgen-independent PCaSC may be causal for therapy resistance, as proposed at the 2017 AACR Prostate Cancer conference. PCaSC dynamics can be investigated as resistance mechanisms and integrate these into quantitative models that predict and optimize responses to IADT for individual patients with a specific goal of identifying clinically actionable cues for pausing and resuming IADT cycles. These platforms significantly improve PCa outcomes through personalizing treatment that maximally delays TTP while lowering cumulative dose and thereby limiting treatment side effects.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">3. Innovation</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Even highly effective cancer therapy almost invariably fails due to evolution of resistance. Current cancer treatment with continuous application of drugs at MTD actually accelerates evolution of resistance. Furthermore, despite new strategies in &#x201c;precision medicine&#x201d; in which the specific therapy is guided by molecular biomarkers, treatment protocols rarely vary between patients. To date there is no attempt to identify and counteract the patient-specific dynamics of intratumoral evolution of resistance during therapy. For example, despite the advance of IADT to reduce PCa treatment dose and delay TTP, therapy is currently paused and resumed based on fixed PSA values that are determined before therapy and are not patient specific. Cancer is a complex, dynamic system best understood by analyzing the response to external perturbation and selection forces&#x2014;such as therapy. Shown herein is a novel and innovative framework to identify PCaSC dynamics underlying the evolution of PCa resistance and rising blood serum PSA levels, and use PCa dynamics and treatment response patterns as clinically actionable cues to inform treatment cycles.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Because of its complexity, this approach must be multidisciplinary. This research program is the first attempt to calibrate and validate a mathematical model of PCaSC dynamics during therapy to forecast patient-specific responses to subsequent treatment cycles, and to use this to identify optimal longitudinally collected PSA values to aid treatment decisions. After the successful trial of intermittent AA for castration-resistant PCa (NCT02415621), the next logical steps for clinical trials include the investigation of different PSA values (patient-specific; 80% of pre-treatment PSA value; IRB pending) to further delay TTP. These clinical studies provide additional, independent data for validating the project. This study's framework provides the rationale, proof-of-principle and required sample size for both non-inferiority and superiority of subsequent first-in-kind clinical trials of patient-specific treatment triggers based on dynamic properties derived from a mathematical model (for which additional funding can be sought). This holds key to significantly improve cancer outcomes, first in PCa and then in other cancers currently incurable with continuous MTD therapy.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">4.

In silico trials of alternative clinical decision triggers based on individual response dynamics informing individual on/off IADT cutoffs can be simulated.

Pharmaceutical Carriers/Delivery of Pharmaceutical Products</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, the compositions can also be administered in vivo in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be administered to a subject, along with the nucleic acid or vector, without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained. The carrier would naturally be selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject, as would be well known to one of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The compositions may be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., intravenously), by intramuscular injection, by intraperitoneal injection, transdermally, extracorporeally, topically or the like, including topical intranasal administration or administration by inhalant. As used herein, &#x201c;topical intranasal administration&#x201d; means delivery of the compositions into the nose and nasal passages through one or both of the nares and can comprise delivery by a spraying mechanism or droplet mechanism, or through aerosolization of the nucleic acid or vector. Administration of the compositions by inhalant can be through the nose or mouth via delivery by a spraying or droplet mechanism. Delivery can also be directly to any area of the respiratory system (e.g., lungs) via intubation. The exact amount of the compositions required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, weight and general condition of the subject, the severity of the allergic disorder being treated, the particular nucleic acid or vector used, its mode of administration and the like. Thus, it is not possible to specify an exact amount for every composition. However, an appropriate amount can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Parenteral administration of the composition, if used, is generally characterized by injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. A more recently revised approach for parenteral administration involves use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant dosage is maintained. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,610,795, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The materials may be in solution, suspension (for example, incorporated into microparticles, liposomes, or cells). These may be targeted to a particular cell type via antibodies, receptors, or receptor ligands. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Senter, et al., <i>Bioconjugate Chem., </i>2:447-451, (1991); Bagshawe, K. D., <i>Br.

Vehicles such as &#x201c;stealth&#x201d; and other antibody conjugated liposomes (including lipid mediated drug targeting to colonic carcinoma), receptor mediated targeting of DNA through cell specific ligands, lymphocyte directed tumor targeting, and highly specific therapeutic retroviral targeting of murine glioma cells in vivo.

In general, receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis, either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin-coated pits, enter the cell via clathrin-coated vesicles, pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted, and then either recycle to the cell surface, become stored intracellularly, or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions, such as nutrient uptake, removal of activated proteins, clearance of macromolecules, opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins, dissociation and degradation of ligand, and receptor-level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway, depending on the cell type, receptor concentration, type of ligand, ligand valency, and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis has been reviewed (Brown and Greene, <i>DNA and Cell Biology </i>10:6, 399-409 (1991)).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">a) Pharmaceutically Acceptable Carriers</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The compositions, including antibodies, can be used therapeutically in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy </i>(19th ed.) ed.

The model is fit to the first treatment cycle (then first two, first three, etc.) to derive patient-specific parameters. The parameter variations observed are applied in the training cohort to the patient-derived parameter set and forecast model dynamics in the subsequent treatment cycle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). This is repeated 100 times to derive the proportion of simulations that resistance in the subsequent on-treatment cycle. From this the probability of resistance, p(&#x3a9;) is derived. Resistance is defined as sequential increases of PSA above normal range (4 ng/mL) during IADT.

An optimal cutoff value for p(&#x3a9;) to stratify prediction into response/resistance with highest accuracy can be determined by maximizing Youden's J Index (=sensitivity+specificity&#x2212;1) in the training data.

Analysis of each 5 responders and resistant patients led to statistical significance in difference in PCaSC self-renewal rates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). To assess the robustness of estimated prediction performance in the primary analysis, a sensitivity analysis can randomize varying numbers of patients into model training, up to leave-one-out studies.

Survival benefits have not been confirmed clinically, which can be due to the conservative trial designs of long on-treatment cycles (7-8 months) and short off-cycles. Such long treatment periods would eliminate nearly all sensitive cells, thereby promoting competitive release of more resistant cells. To better counteract evolutionary dynamics, the ongoing trial of intermittent second-line abiraterone therapy stopped on-treatment cycles when PSA fell below 50% of its pre-treatment value until PSA returned to its initial level. This yielded significantly shorter treatment cycles (median 4.5 months) and significant improvement in TTP (median not reached, at least 33 vs. 16.6 months at continuous ADT, p&#x3c;0.001). These results motivate the hypothesis that shorter on-treatment phases can also improve first-line therapy IADT outcomes with patient-specific PSA values to trigger treatment on/off cycles. Treatment response to different IADT protocols was simulated using the individual parameters for Patient 36 who became resistant in the 4<sup>th </sup>IADT cycle in the Canadian trial. PSA values can be monitored every four weeks as done in the clinic. The data indicate that TTP is highly dependent on IADT on/off triggers, with continuous ADT yielding the shortest TTP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). For Patient 36, relative PSA values of 50% or 90% of pre-treatment PSA levels as triggers to pause IADT and pre-treatment PSA levels to resume IADT yield longer TTP than the static triggers (PSA monitored every 4 weeks, IADT is paused if PSA&#x3c;4 ng/mL for consecutive 36 weeks, and IADT resumes if PSA&#x3e;10 ng/mL). In the trial, TTP for patient 36 was 1664 days with 1117 days (67%) on treatment; predicted TTP is 1820 days with 860 days (47%) on treatment with IADT off at 50% initial PSA; and predicted TTP is 1988 days with 870 days (44%) on treatment with IADT off at 90% initial PSA. These data indicate that different relative PSA values as triggers for on/off therapy yield different IADT cycle lengths and significantly different TTP. An optimal trigger for IADT on/off decisions exists, and can maximally delay response and prolong TTP, which can be dependent on patient-specific PCaSC dynamics.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">(1) Specific Approach:</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The validated mathematical model can be simulated using different IADT cycle on/off triggers for each patient with their individually derived model dynamics and parameters. Fixed PSA values (0.5-10 ng/mL) as well as relative PSA values (0-100% of pre-treatment PSA value) to initiate and pause IADT can be simulated. For each treatment simulation the number of treatment cycles and TTP (sequential increases of PSA&#x2265;4 ng/mL on-therapy) are analyzed. Treatment protocols that transition responding patients under the clinical trial protocol to become resistant under the investigational protocol can be rejected. Simulated treatment protocols that shorten TTP for at least one patient can also be rejected. For each patient, the optimal cutoff for PSA values to trigger IADT on/off cycles can be determined by identifying the strategy that results in maximum simulated TTP. To investigate how to personalize and optimize treatment after initial treatment response assessment (i.e., treat for one cycle with standard triggers and fit the model to this first treatment cycle alone), optimal PSA cutoff values to trigger IADT on/off in subsequent treatment cycles can be derived and correlated with the first treatment cycle response and model parameter for PCaSC dynamics on a per-patient basis. Progression-free survival after static PSA cutoffs from the Canadian trial as well as simulated TTP under the project-derived optimal PSA cutoffs can be visualized via Kaplan-Meier curves.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">(2) Bayesian Adaptive Approach:</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The increase of the androgen-independent PCaSC contributes to treatment resistance. As the total number and relative proportion of the PCaSC population is changing during on and off IADT cycles, treatment decision triggers can also change. Dynamically adapting PSA values can be anyzed as a function of PCaSC parameter evolution with each treatment cycle and determine optimal treatment triggers to maximize TTP. In brief, following an Bayesian adaptive prediction approach the mathematical model can be applied to the first treatment cycle alone and derive the optimal PSA cutoff to trigger IADT on/off cycles. After each subsequent treatment cycle, the model can be fit o all treatment cycles to this point (2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, etc.) and derive the optimal PSA cutoff to trigger IADT on/off in the next cycle. The model-predicted TTP following this adaptive approach can be compared to the non-adaptive optimal PSA cutoffs uniformly through the treatment. TTP for Bayesian adaptive and non-adaptive PSA cutoffs can be visualized via Kaplan-Meier curves.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As the data demonstrates, the necessary technical expertise is in place to successfully execute the modeling parts of the study. Patient-specific triggers for IADT on/off decision exist, and that these triggers can be correlated with PCaSC dynamics obtained in the initial cycle(s) of IADT. When PCaSC self-renewal dynamics cannot be correlated with treatment response and corresponding triggers, other model mechanisms (PCaC androgen-deprivation sensitivity, rate &#x3b4;, PSA production rate &#x3b1; and treatment-induced PSA depletion rate &#x3b2;) can be evaluated either alone or in combination with PCaSC dynamics. When the inter-patient variation in optimal treatment triggers is low, the analysis can be repeated for different absolute or relative PSA triggers for optimal therapy simultaneously for all patients to derive the best possible protocol for the entire patient population. Selecting optimal PSA cutoffs on the sole consideration of maximal TTP may not be ideal for all patients, as undesirably long treatment windows may be chosen in some cases.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">d) Evaluate the Timing-Dependent Benefit of Concurrent Docetaxel with IADT.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Docetaxel (DOC) is a chemotherapy drug that is administered every three weeks over ten or more cycles. DOC combined with ADT showed improved patient survival with survival benefit dependent on timing. Compared to ADT alone, adding docetaxel at the beginning of long-term PCa hormone therapy increased overall survival time by 10-13 months (81 vs. 71 months), 57.6 vs. 44 months) with evidence of prolonged TTP (20.2 months vs. 11.7 months). Adding docetaxel at the end of ADT when PCa becomes resistant (hormone-refractory PCa) increased survival by only 2.4 months (18.9 vs. 16.5 months). These data demonstrate that docetaxel added to ADT at different times can yield different outcome benefits.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">(1) Specific Approach.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Docetaxel promotes and stabilizes microtubule assembly, thereby decreasing free tubulin needed during cell division and leading to cell apoptosis independent of androgen availability. Thus, androgen-independent PCaSC are sensitive to docetaxel, albeit to a lesser degree than non-stem PCa cells. A [DOC] compartment can be introduced into the model, which receives a bolus increase and times when DOC is administered, and [DOC] concentration decays with DOC-associated PK/PD parameters. Docetaxel cytotoxicity is simulated proportional to the current docetaxel concentration and current PCaSC and PCaC populations, i.e., &#x3b4;<sub>S</sub>*[DOC]*[PCaSC] and &#x3b4;<sub>C</sub>*[DOC]*[PCaC] (c.f. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), where &#x3b4;<sub>S</sub>&#x3c;0 and &#x3b4;<sub>C</sub>&#x3c;0 represent respectively PCaSC and PCaC DOC cytotoxicity. Total tumor regression rate (&#x3b4;<sub>S</sub>+&#x3b4;<sub>C</sub>, median 0.015 day, range 0.006-0.032) has been estimated for patients with advanced prostate cancer in a retrospective analysis of 2,353 patients from eight clinical trials, but without resolution of intratumoral heterogeneity. With PCaSC docetaxel sensitivity being about 25% of PCaC sensitivity, the individual rates of &#x3b4;<sub>S </sub>and &#x3b4;<sub>C </sub>can be determined as a function of the mathematically-predicted PCaSC proportion in the tumor at the different treatment time points to satisfy the overall tumor regression rates. DOC therapy (one bolus injection on day 1 every three weeks) can be simulated beginning at different IADT cycles (first, second, etc.). Concurrent treatment with IADT and DOC can be simulated as well as alternating therapy with DOC given in IADT off-treatment cycles. Docetaxel timing-dependent TTP can be determined for each individual patient and the patient population as a whole. Progression free survival after IADT alone and TTP simulated for IADT+DOC at different times of IADT can be visualized via Kaplan-Meier curves</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">(2) Summary.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">This study integrates mathematical, biological, clinical and statistical expertise to test the hypothesis that PCaSC dynamics underlie response to therapy and evolution of resistance in IADT.

Stratified random sampling was used to divide the data into training and testing cohorts. Assuming that uninhibited PCaSCs divide approximately once per day, 2 (day<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was set to ln(2) and parameter estimation was used to find the remaining parameters. The model was calibrated to the training cohort data with two population-uniform parameters (PSA production rate &#x3c1;=1.87E-04 (&#x3bc;g/L day<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1), decay rate &#x3c6;=0.0856 (day<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1)) and two patient-specific parameters (median PCaSC self-renewal rate p<sub>s</sub>=0.0278 [2.22E-14,0.2583] (non-dimensional), ADT cytotoxicity rate &#x3b1;=0.0360 [0.0067,1] (day<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1)).

The corresponding PCaSC dynamics demonstrated a rapid increase in the PCaSC population in patients that became castration resistant compared to patients that remained sensitive throughout the trial. Model simulations also showed that emergence of resistance is a result of selection for the PCaSCs during on-treatment phases. Coinciding with this transition to castration resistance, analysis of model parameters revealed that resistant patients had significantly higher PCaSC self-renewal rates than responsive patients (median p<sub>s</sub>=0.0249 [1.18E-13,0.0882] for responsive patients vs. p<sub>s</sub>=0.0820 [2.2E-14,0.2583] for resistant patients, p&#x3c;0.001, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>).

The self-renewal and ADT cytotoxicity rates maintained the exponential relationship, previously obtained when optimizing over all IADT cycles. The distributions of the self-renewal rate p<sub>s </sub>and the corresponding ADT cytotoxicity rate &#x3b1;, as well as their relative change from cycle to cycle, were used to predict responses in subsequent cycles of patients in the training cohort (see Materials and Methods). An appropriate resistance threshold was obtained for each cycle based on the forecast simulations of the training set. Using these thresholds, model forecasting was completed on the testing set and the patient was classified as either responsive or resistant in the subsequent treatment cycle. Representative examples of second and third cycle predictions for one responsive patient and one resistant patient from the testing cohort are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E-F</figref>. Patient 017 was a continuous responder who underwent three cycles of IADT before the end of the trial. The model correctly predicted responsiveness in cycles two and three based on the parameters fitted in cycles one and two, respectively. Patient 054 became resistant in the third IADT cycle and the model was able to correctly predict response in cycle two and resistance in the third cycle based on the thresholds learned in the training set. The model yielded a sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 94% over all subsequent IADT cycles for patients in the test cohort. The overall accuracy of the model was 90%.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">(3) IADT without Induction Period Significantly Increases TTP</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In a study by Crook et al., continuous ADT was compared to IADT in localized PCa patients and they found that IADT was non-inferior to ADT using overall survival as the clinical endpoint. A similar study by Hussain et al. conducted in metastatic, hormone sensitive PCa patients found that neither regimen proved superior. These findings are likely the result of the 7-8 months induction period, which resulted in the competitive release of the resistant phenotype once the androgen sensitive subpopulation was eliminated. Administering IADT without such an induction period would allow sufficient time for the sensitive subpopulation to efficiently compete with the resistant subpopulation and prolong time to progression and ultimately, overall survival.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">To test these hypotheses, we simulated continuous ADT and IADT without the 36-week induction period and compared predicted TTP against the trial by Bruchovsky et al. For IADT simulations, treatment was administered until PSA fell below 4 &#x3bc;g/L and resumed again once it rose above 10 &#x3bc;g/L at simulated measurements every 4 weeks. Both protocols were simulated until PSA progression or for 10 years (end of simulation, EOS), with progression defined as three sequential increases in PSA during treatment. For the IADT protocol, progression was also defined as PSA&#x3e;4 &#x3bc;g/L at both 24 and 32 weeks on treatment, as used in the Bruchovsky trial. Comparing the TTP from the trial results against simulated continuous ADT showed that IADT with an induction period resulted in significantly longer TTP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). Though median TTP was not reached for either IADT protocol, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows that the average TTP was approximately 5 months longer for IADT without the induction period when compared to the actual trial data and the continuous ADT simulations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> shows TTP could be increased by more than 7 months in selected patients.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">(4) Alternative Treatment Decision Thresholds can Further Increase TTP</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the ongoing pilot study (NCT02415621) of IADT in metastatic, castration resistant PCa patients, IADT is paused after a decline in PSA to below 50% of pre-treatment PSA levels and is resumed once PSA returns to the pre-treatment level. At the time of writing, of the 18 patients currently enrolled for more than 12 months, four have developed PSA and radiographic progression. The median time to progression has not been reached, but is at least 20 months greater than a contemporaneous cohort treated continuously with MTD until progression, as well as published cohorts. The treatment group has received an average cumulative dose of less than half that of standard of care treatment.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">To test the validity of the model, we simulated IADT using a 50% threshold, as well as 10% and 70% and compared the results against those obtained in the Bruchovsky trial. Pausing treatment once PSA falls below 70% and 10% of the pre-treatment PSA, checking every two weeks, results in significantly longer TTP when compared to the Bruchovsky trial protocol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Additionally, the average cumulative dose could be significantly reduced depending on the threshold used. With a 10% threshold, the average cumulative dose is &#x2dc;50% of that of the Bruchovsky study. A 50% threshold results in &#x2dc;22% of the cumulative dose used in the Bruchovsky study, while 70% results in &#x2dc;20%. Controlling for the total time that each patient participated in the trial results in about 30%, 15%, and 13% of the comulative dose used in the Bruchovsky study for thresholds of 10%, 50%, and 70%, respectively.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">(5) Concurrent Docetaxel Administration Provides Favorable TTP</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">We sought to investigate the effect of docetaxel (DOC) in IADT in biochemically recurrent PCa patients by simulating six cycles of DOC with concurrent ADT, followed by IADT (as defined in the Materials and Methods section). Model analysis showed that patients with higher stem cell self-renewal rates would benefit the most from DOC in a castration na&#xef;ve setting (prior to progression, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). Comparing progression free survival showed that castration na&#xef;ve docetaxel could increase TTP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). We also tested the ability of DOC to increase survival after the development of resistance to IADT. To do this, we simulated IADT, following the Bruchovsky trial protocol, and then added ten cycles of DOC plus continuous ADT after resistance developed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, this increased mean TTP from 41.18 months observed in the Bruchovsky trial to model-predicted 50.14 months.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">(6) First Cycle PCaSC Self-Renewal Rate Stratifies Patients Who can Benefit from Docetaxel</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As shown above, the stem cell self-renewal rate plays a significant role in IADT and could accurately predict a patient's response in subsequent cycles after just the first cycle.

There was a significant difference in TTP between patients with a high p<sub>s </sub>and those with a low p<sub>s </sub>both when simulating IADT with and without DOC after the first cycle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). Though the difference in TTP was not significantly higher with DOC given after the first cycle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>), median TTP increased from 35 to 41.5 months in those patients with p<sub>s</sub>&#x2265;med(p<sub>s</sub>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">b) Discussion</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Androgen deprivation therapy is not curative for advanced prostate cancer, as patients often develop resistance. IADT is a promising approach to counteract evolutionary dynamics by reducing competitive release of the resistant subpopulation during treatment holidays. Since IADT is highly dynamic, maximum efficacy requires continuous, accurate estimates of sensitive and resistant subpopulations.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Here we present a simple mathematical model of evolutionary dynamics within biochemically recurrent prostate cancer during IADT. The model has been trained with two parameters that are uniform across all patients and only two patient-specific parameters, which are interconnected, allowing the ability to further reduce them to a single, measurable parameter for each patient. Model simulations support the central hypothesis that the evolution of PCaSCs is highly correlated with the development of resistance to IADT. Resistant patients are likely to have higher PCaSC self-renewal rates than responsive patients, leading to increased production of PCaSCs and ultimately differentiated cells, thereby accelerating PSA dynamics with each treatment cycle. The results show that that cancer stem cell self-renewal is likely to increase during prolonged treatment.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Using longitudinal PSA measurements and observed clinical outcomes from the IADT trial by Bruchovsky et al., the model was calibrated to clinical data and predicted the development of resistance with a 90% accuracy. The theoretical study produced three important clinical findings: (1) IADT outcomes in prior studies were adversely affected by the 8-month induction period, which reduced IADT overall survival comparable to that of continuous ADT. (2) With IADT, applying a PSA treatment threshold that depends on pre-treatment PSA levels (rather than a fixed value for all patients) can significantly increase TTP. (3) Early treatment response dynamics during IADT can identify patients that may potentially benefit from concurrent docetaxel treatment, particularly patients with a large stem cell self-renewal rate after one cycle of IADT.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The study also demonstrated the value of ongoing model simulations in predicting outcomes from each treatment cycle throughout the course of therapy. By accumulating data from each cycle to continuously estimate the current tumor population dynamics, model simulations could predict the response to the next cycle with a sensitivity and specificity of 57% and 94%, respectively and an overall accuracy of 90%. This ability to learn from prior treatments and predict future outcomes adds an important degree of flexibility to a cancer treatment protocol&#x2014;a game theoretic strategy termed &#x201c;Bellman's Principle of Optimality&#x201d; that greatly increases the physician's advantage.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">For those predicted to become resistant in the next cycle of IADT, an ideal model also predicts alternative treatments that could produce better clinical outcomes. The role of docetaxel in metastatic, hormone-sensitive PCa has been investigated in three studies in the past five years. The GETUG-AFU15 study found a non-significant 20% increase in overall survival in high volume disease (HVD) patients who received DOC concurrently with continuous ADT, but no survival benefit in those with low volume disease (LVD). Subsequently, the results of the STAMPEDE trial found that DOC administration resulted in a more than 12 months overall survival benefit with a median follow-up of 43 months. Finally, the CHAARTED trial showed a statistically significant overall survival benefit from adding DOC in patients with HVD; however, no statistically significant survival benefit was found in LVD patients.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Here we explored the option of adding docetaxel in the treatment of biochemically recurrent PCa. We found that estimating the PCaSC self-renewal rate p<sub>s </sub>using data from the first cycle of IADT could stratify patients who would receive the most benefit from concurrent administration of docetaxel. These results emphasize the critical heterogeneity within patients that affect response to therapy and the important role of quantitative models in identifying patient-specific parameters and defining appropriate treatment protocols based on model predictions.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The study has some limitations in both the clinical data set and quantitative models. Since only 21% of the 70 patients progressed before the conclusion of the trial, the clinical data included more responsive than resistant patients in both the training and testing</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">cohorts. Additionally, the majority of patients progressed within their second or third cycle, with only 24 patients entering the fourth cycle. The scarcity of available data during the fourth cycle made finding an appropriate resistance threshold challenging. A larger training data set increases the sensitivity and overall accuracy of the model.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">A limitation of the quantitative model is the use of dynamic PSA values as the sole biomarker of PCa progression. PCa can become aggressive and metastatic despite low levels of serum PSA with development of androgen independent prostate cancer, most notably neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Additional serum biomarkers such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may prove useful in estimating intratumoral evolutionary dynamics in subsequent trials. With the CellSearch platform, higher CTCs enumeration &#x3e;5 cells per 7.5 mL of peripheral blood has been shown to be prognostic and portend worse overall survival in metastatic CRPC patients; however detecting CTCs in biochemically recurrent patients has been labor-intensive with low yield.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In conclusion, the study demonstrates that a simple mathematical model based on cellular dynamics in prostate cancer can have a high predictive power in a retrospective data set from patients with biochemically recurrent PCa undergoing IADT. In particular, we demonstrate the model can use data from each treatment cycle to estimate intratumoral subpopulations and accurately predict the outcome of subsequent cycles. Furthermore, in patients who are predicted to fail therapy in the next cycle, alternative treatments for which a response is more likely can be predicted. We conclude that PSA dynamics can prospectively predict treatment response to IADT, indicating ways to adapt treatment to delay TTP.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">c) Materials and Methods</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">(1) IADT Clinical Trial Data</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The Bruchovsky prospective Phase II study trial was conducted in 109 men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.

Patients whose PSA had not normalized after both 24 and 32 weeks of being on treatment were classified as resistant and taken off of the study. We analyzed the data of 79 patients who had completed more than one IADT cycle. One patient was omitted for inconsistent treatment, seven were omitted due to the development of metastasis and/or local progression, and one was omitted due to taking multiple medications throughout the trial, resulting in 70 patients included in the analysis. To calibrate and assess the accuracy of our model, the data was divided into training (n=35, 27 responsive, 8 resistant) and testing (n=35, 28 responsive, 7 resistant) cohorts, respectively matched for clinical response to treatment.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">(2) Mathematical Model of IADT Response</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">We developed a mathematical model of PCaSC (S), non-stem (differentiated) cells (D), and serum PSA concentration (P).

Model predictions correctly classifying clinically observed responders as responders (Pr(&#x3a9;)&#x3c;&#x3ba;<sub>i</sub>) were denoted true negative, while correctly classified clinically resistors (Pr(&#x3a9;)&#x3e;&#x3ba;<sub>i</sub>) were denoted as true positive. The remaining classifications are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0174">The model predictions for a continuous responder and a patient who progressed in the third cycle are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B-C</figref>. The model was fit over one cycle using the &#x3c1; and &#x3c6; values obtained from the training set. Using the relative change in p<sub>z </sub>from cycle i to cycle i+1 as well as the exponential relationship between p<sub>z </sub>and &#x3b1;, we obtained 100 parameter pairs of (p<sub>s</sub>&#xb7;&#x3b1;) that were used to forecast the patient's response in the subsequent cycle. The model accurately predicted that Patient 1011 would continue to respond in both the second and third cycles. That is, the P<sub>I</sub>(&#x3a9;) is less than the determined &#x3ba;<sub>z </sub>and &#x3ba;<sub>&#x3c3;</sub> for cycles 2 and 3, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>). Patient 1014 developed PSA progression in his third cycle of treatment. Though Pr(&#x3a9;)=0.49 in cycle 2, this is below the threshold &#x3ba;<sub>Z </sub>and consequently the model correctly predicts that this patient will continue to respond. In cycle 3, Pr(&#x3a9;)=0.70 which is larger than &#x3ba;<sub>3</sub>. This is a correct prediction as Patient 1014 develops resistance in cycle 3. Overall, the model is able to correctly predict patient response with 78% accuracy (specificity=92%, sensitivity=38%).</p><p id="p-0180" num="0175">(3) Incorporating Metastatic Burden</p><p id="p-0181" num="0176">Despite treatment, several patients continued to develop metastases during the trial. Though rising PSA has been shown to be correlated with metastatic burden, it is not predictive of the development of new metastatic growths. We sought to investigate whether correlating metastatic growth with the driver of treatment resistance, the stem cell self-renewal rate p<sub>s</sub>, can be used to improve the accuracy of the model.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0177">As described, (p<sub>z</sub>,&#x3b1;) pairs for cycle i+1 were obtained by uniformly sampling from the cumulative probability distribution of relative changes in p<sub>z </sub>from cycle i to i+1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> shows that in general, the relative change ranged between &#x2212;75% and 150%, with about 30% of the patients experiencing larger relative changes in p. To incorporate the metastatic burden, we used a skewed sampling to sample from the cumulative probability distribution, with the degree of the skew dependent on the number of new metastatic growths. This resulted in larger relative changes in p<sub>s</sub>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, larger p<sub>s </sub>values translated into earlier treatment progression. Consequently, the skewed sampling results in more resistant simulations, thereby increasing the Pr(&#x3a9;) It should be noted that this also resulted in &#x3ba;<sub>i </sub>changing in response to larger Pr(&#x3a9;) for particular patients.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0178">A comparison between the model predictions using a uniform and skewed sampling for an individual patient are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. Patient 1010 developed a new metastatic growth during his first cycle of treatment. With a uniform sampling, the model predicted that the Pr(&#x3a9;)=0.47. As this was below the threshold &#x3ba;<sub>2</sub>, the model incorrectly predicted that this patient would continue to respond in the second cycle (false negative). Using a skewed sampling, the Pr(&#x3a9;) increased to 0.53, which was larger than &#x3ba;<sub>2 </sub>resulting in a correct resistant prediction (true positive). Overall, incorporating each patient's metastatic increased the accuracy to 81% (specificity=92%, sensitivity=50%).</p><p id="p-0184" num="0179">c) Discussion</p><p id="p-0185" num="0180">In this study, we have extended the simple model of PCaSC and PSA dynamics to predict mCRPC patient responses to adaptive abiraterone. The model has been calibrated and validated against clinical data from 16 mCRPC patients from a trial.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0181">With just two patient-specific parameters, the results show that the model is able to accurately describe individual patient dynamics We found that stem cell enrichment is a likely driver of treatment resistance, despite abiraterone working through an alternative pathway than ADT. Despite that using the established prediction process, the model was able to use early treatment evolutionary dynamics to predict subsequent response with 78% accuracy.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0182">Incorporating the metastatic burden improved the overall accuracy to 82%, with a specificity of 92% and a sensitivity of 50%. We note that though this increased the sensitivity of the model, this is significantly lower than the 73% sensitivity obtained in another study. This is likely due to the few progression events within this patient cohort. This limitation made it difficult to determine the optimal threshold value for cycle predictions where few patients progressed, resulting in a higher proportion of false positive results. We are confident that the model accuracy, as well as sensitivity and specificity, has the potential to increase with a larger patient cohort. Nevertheless, the patients who were incorrectly predicted to develop resistance during the second cycle instead progressed during the third cycle. As such, the model serves as an early indicator of treatment resistance for a subset of patients.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0183">To conclude, this validation study demonstrates the utility of mathematical modeling in clinical decisions. Using a simple dynamic model of PCaSC, non-stem cells, and PSA, we are able to predict who may or may not respond to subsequent treatment. This offers clinicians with an additional decision support tool to use when deciding how to effectively treat patients, while minimizing adverse events and toxicity and maximizing survival.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">4. Example 4</heading><p id="p-0189" num="0184">We also used the mathematical to investigate the optimal time to administer chemotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Unlike androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), chemotherapy can induce cell death in both PCaSCs and differentiated cells, though to a lesser degree in PCaSCs compared to differentiated cells. To model this, we extended the model to include death of each cell type at rates &#x3b4;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230005594A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> and &#x3b4;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230005594A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0185">The model was calibrated to PSA data from 56 castration na&#xef;ve patients, that is they received up to six cycles of concurrent chemotherapy and ADT at the start of therapy, followed by ADT alone and 38 castration resistant patients who received up to 10 cycles of concurrent therapy after developing resistance to ADT alone. The castration resistant patients received follow-up ADT after concurrent treatment. The model was able to fit each set of patients equally well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0186">After calibrating and validating the model, we used the optimal parameter values to simulate administering concurrent therapy either before or after ADT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). Model simulations show that the optimal time of concurrent therapy is patient-specific and can be determined using early treatment dynamics, offering another tool for clinicians to use when determining how and when to treat patients.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">D.
