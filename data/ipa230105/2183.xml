disclosure relates to a sheet bonding apparatus that bonds a sheet by powder adhesive by using an electrophotographic system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, an image forming apparatus that, in the case of producing a document including a confidential content and needs to be sealed, such as a payment slip or a pressure-bonded postcard, outputs a product in which confidential information is sealed by an electrophotographic system using printing toner and powder adhesive is proposed as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2007-193004 and 2008-162029. In this apparatus, printing (transfer) of information using printing toner and application (transfer) of powder adhesive on a bonding-planned region are performed on a sheet, then a bonding (sealing) process is performed by performing a fixing process on the sheet, folding the sheet, and further heating and pressurizing the sheet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, accompanied by development of personal computers and printers and rise of the sense of personal information protection, a demand for easy production of a small lot of payment slips or pressure-bonded postcards has increased in small business sites and personal offices. However, if both the information printing function and the sheet bonding (sealing) function are provided in one apparatus as in the image forming apparatus of the document described above, the apparatus becomes large and expensive. Such a large apparatus occupies a large area in the office or the like where the apparatus is installed, and also the installation cost thereof is high. Therefore, a sheet bonding apparatus that is small and of a low cost has been desired.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, when the temperature of the apparatus body of the sheet bonding apparatus is raised by heat discharged from a heating device for the bonding process, the state of powder adhesive accommodated in the apparatus body changes due to the heat, and sufficient adhesion cannot be obtained in the bonding process in some cases. In addition, in the case of reducing the size of the sheet bonding apparatus, reducing increase in the temperature of the powder adhesive caused by heat from a bonding device and a fixing device serving as heat sources has been desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a sheet bonding apparatus capable of realizing miniaturization of the apparatus or reduction of the temperature rise of the powder adhesive.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the invention, a sheet bonding apparatus includes an electrophotographic unit configured to apply powder adhesive on a sheet by an electrophotographic process, a folding portion configured to fold the sheet on which the powder adhesive has been applied by the electrophotographic unit, and a bonding portion configured to heat the sheet folded by the folding portion to bond the sheet by the powder adhesive, wherein the bonding portion and the folding portion are disposed over the electrophotographic unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the invention, a sheet bonding apparatus includes an electrophotographic unit configured to apply powder adhesive on a sheet by an electrophotographic process, a folding portion configured to fold the sheet on which the powder adhesive has been applied by the electrophotographic unit, a bonding portion configured to heat the sheet folded by the folding portion to bond the sheet by the powder adhesive, and a discharge tray onto which the sheet bonded

of a sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a sectional configuration of the sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>including a sheet bonding apparatus body (hereinafter referred to as an apparatus body <b>10</b>) according to the first embodiment, and a post-processing unit <b>30</b> connected to the apparatus body <b>10</b>. The sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>is constituted by the apparatus body <b>10</b> including a powder adhesive application mechanism of an electrophotographic system, and the post-processing unit <b>30</b> serving as a sheet processing apparatus. As will be described below, the apparatus body <b>10</b> includes a similar configuration to an image forming apparatus of an electrophotographic system except that powder adhesive is used as developer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">First, an internal configuration of the apparatus body <b>10</b> will be described. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the apparatus body <b>10</b> includes a sheet cassette <b>8</b> serving as a sheet accommodating portion that accommodates a sheet P to be bonded, an electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> that applies powder adhesive on the sheet P, a fixing device <b>6</b> serving as a fixing portion and a first heating device, and a casing <b>19</b> that accommodates these. The apparatus body <b>10</b> has a function of applying powder adhesive Tn by the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> on the sheet P fed from the sheet cassette <b>8</b> and performing a fixing process of fixing the powder adhesive Tn to the sheet P by the fixing device <b>6</b>. Here, as the sheet P, a pre-printed sheet on which information has been printed in advance by an any one of various printing systems such as an electrophotographic system, an inkjet system, and offset printing is set. The sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the present embodiment is an apparatus that manufactures a product obtained by applying only the powder adhesive Tn on the pre-printed sheet and bonding the pre-printed sheet, and can be also referred to as a pressure-bonding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> of the present embodiment is mainly used for applying the powder adhesive Tn for bonding the sheet P. That is, the sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>does not include an image forming portion that forms an image on the sheet by an electrophotographic system or a different system. In addition, although an attachment portion (attachment space) for attaching the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> is provided on the casing <b>19</b> of the sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a, </i>only one electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> can be attached to the attachment portion, and a space for attaching a different electrophotographic unit is not provided. Therefore, the sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>can be configured to be smaller and of a lower cost than in a configuration in which both an electrophotographic unit for forming an image, that is, for printing information on a sheet, and an electrophotographic unit for applying powder adhesive on the sheet are both provided in one apparatus.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sheet cassette <b>8</b> is inserted in a lower portion of the apparatus body <b>10</b> such that the sheet cassette <b>8</b> can be pulled out from the casing <b>19</b>, and accommodates a plurality of sheets P. The sheets P accommodated in the sheet cassette <b>8</b> are fed one by one from the sheet cassette <b>8</b> by a feeding roller <b>8</b><i>f </i>in a state of being separated from each other by an unillustrated separation roller pair, and are conveyed by a conveyance roller <b>8</b><i>a. </i>The feeding roller <b>8</b><i>f </i>is an example of a feeding member that feeds the sheet P, and for example, a feeding mechanism that attracts the sheet P by suction on the surface of an endless belt in which air holes are formed, by a negative pressure generated by an air suction unit may be used. The separation roller pair includes a conveyance roller that conveys the sheet P, and a separation roller that is supported by a fixed shaft via a torque limiter and abuts the conveyance roller. The separation roller applies a frictional force to the sheet in a nip portion between the conveyance roller and the separation roller serving as a separation nip, and thus sheets other than the sheet P in contact with the conveyance roller are prevented from being fed together. To be noted, the mechanism that separates the sheet P is not limited to the separation roller, and for example, a friction member of a pad shape may be used.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> is an electrophotographic mechanism including a process cartridge P<b>1</b>, a scanner unit <b>2</b>, and a transfer roller <b>3</b>. The electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> functions as an adhesive application unit that applies the powder adhesive on the sheet P by an electrophotographic process using the powder adhesive as a developer. The process cartridge is a unit of a plurality of parts that perform the electrophotographic process and is configured such that the plurality of parts can be collectively replaced. The apparatus body <b>10</b> is provided with an unillustrated cartridge support portion that is supported by the casing <b>19</b>, and the process cartridge P<b>1</b> is detachably attached to the apparatus body <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The process cartridge P<b>1</b> includes a photosensitive member unit CC including a photosensitive drum <b>101</b> serving as an image bearing member and the like, and a developing unit DT including a powder accommodating portion <b>104</b>, a developing roller <b>105</b> that performs development using a powder, and the like. Details will be described below. To be noted, in the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;development&#x201d; is used for referring to not only a process of visualizing an electrostatic latent image on an image bearing member by using printing toner that is a color toner, but also a process of attaching the powder adhesive Tn that is transparent to the electrostatic latent image on the image bearing member. The powder accommodating portion <b>104</b> accommodates the powder adhesive Tn that is a powder for performing a bonding process of the sheet P that also serves as a bonding toner.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The scanner unit <b>2</b> functions as an exposing portion that irradiates the photosensitive drum <b>101</b> of the process cartridge P<b>1</b> with laser light Z to draw an electrostatic latent image. The transfer roller <b>3</b> opposes the photosensitive drum <b>101</b> of the process cartridge P<b>1</b>, and forms a transfer nip <b>3</b><i>n </i>serving as a transfer portion together with the photosensitive drum <b>101</b>. The transfer roller <b>3</b> functions as a transfer portion that transfers the powder adhesive Tn from the photosensitive drum <b>101</b> onto the sheet P fed from the sheet cassette <b>8</b> in the transfer nip <b>3</b><i>n. </i></p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The fixing device <b>6</b> is disposed above the transfer roller <b>3</b>. The fixing device <b>6</b> is a fixing unit of a thermal fixation system including a heating roller <b>6</b><i>a </i>serving as a fixing member and a pressurizing roller <b>6</b><i>b </i>serving as a pressurizing member.

The electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> that is an electrophotographic unit includes at least an image bearing member, a charging portion, an exposing portion, a developing portion, and a transfer portion. Therefore, in a sheet bonding apparatus that applies powder adhesive by using an electrophotographic system, a relatively large space above the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> can be used for accommodating the bonding device <b>32</b> serving as a heating device and the folder <b>31</b>. As a result of this, the sheet bonding apparatus can be miniaturized. To be noted, the miniaturization of the sheet bonding apparatus in the present disclosure refers to reduction of the occupation range, that is, reduction of the projection area of the sheet bonding apparatus in top view unless otherwise described. In addition, disposing the folder <b>31</b> and the bonding device <b>32</b> over the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> refers to disposing the folder <b>31</b> and the bonding device <b>32</b> such that at least one of the folder <b>31</b> and the bonding device <b>32</b> at least partially overlaps the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> as viewed in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, in the present embodiment, the powder adhesive Tn applied by the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> is (provisionally) fixed to the sheet by the fixing device <b>6</b> serving as a first heating device, and then the sheet is bonded by the bonding device <b>32</b> serving as a second heating device different from the first heating device.

To be noted, the configuration is not limited to the conveyance path of the inverse C shape, and as a modification example, for example, a conveyance path of an S shape may be configured. In the case of the conveyance path of an S shape, a sheet is fed toward a first side in the horizontal direction from a cassette or the like, transfer is performed while the sheet is conveyed toward a second side in the horizontal direction via a turning point of the conveyance path, and the sheet is discharged to the first side in the horizontal direction via a turning point of the conveyance path again.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, how providing a conveyance path of an inverse C shape in the apparatus body <b>10</b> is advantageous for reduction of the temperature rise of the powder adhesive Tn because providing the powder accommodating portion <b>104</b> in a lower portion of the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> is natural will be described. In the case of the conveyance path of the inverse C shape, the rotation direction of the photosensitive drum <b>101</b> is set to a counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> such that the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>101</b> moves upward, which is the conveyance direction of the sheet P, in the transfer nip <b>3</b><i>n. </i>In this case, since the cleaning position, the charging position, the exposing position, and the developing position are arranged in this order from the transfer nip <b>3</b><i>n </i>toward the downstream side in the rotation direction of the photosensitive drum <b>101</b>, the developing position is normally lower than the rotation axis of the photosensitive drum <b>101</b>. Therefore, if a conveyance path of an inverse C shape is employed, it is easier to dispose the powder accommodating portion <b>104</b> in a lower portion of the electrophotographic unit G<b>1</b> to secure a distance (particularly, distance in the vertical direction) from the fixing device <b>6</b> and the bonding device <b>32</b> to the powder accommodating portion <b>104</b>. In contrast, if a conveyance path of an S shape is employed, the electrophotographic unit is disposed above the conveyance path where transfer onto the sheet is performed, and therefore the distance (particularly, distance in the vertical direction) from the fixing device <b>6</b> and the bonding device <b>32</b> to the powder accommodating portion <b>104</b> is difficult to secure in some cases. Therefore, by providing the conveyance path of the inverse C shape, the temperature rise of the powder adhesive Tn in the powder accommodating portion <b>104</b> can be easily reduced.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As a result of the configuration described above, according to the present embodiment, miniaturization of the sheet bonding apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>and reduction of the temperature rise of the powder adhesive Tn can be achieved simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the post-processing unit <b>30</b> is provided with a positioning portion for positioning the casing <b>39</b> with respect to the casing <b>19</b> of the apparatus body <b>10</b>.
