For example, for a terminal device that is far away from the network device, due to a large transmission delay, such terminal device has to transmit its uplink data earlier than a terminal device that is close to the network device. Therefore, the network device determines a timing advance (TA) value of each terminal device by measuring the uplink transmission of the terminal device, and transmits the TA value to the terminal device, such that the terminal device adjusts the transmission time of its uplink data according to the TA value, so as to control the arrival times at which the uplink signals transmitted from different terminal devices arrive at the network device to be aligned.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the NTN system, for a non-GEO scenario, the TA value between the terminal device and the network device changes rapidly and greatly. Through the above method, the network device may not be able to control the TA value of the terminal device to be updated in real time. As a result, the TA value of the terminal device is not updated in time, resulting in frequent uplink out-of-synchronization.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a communication method, apparatus, and device, so as to avoid frequent uplink out-of-synchronization.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a communication method, including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">receiving, by a terminal device, configuration information from a network device; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">transmitting, by the terminal device, timing advance TA information to the network device, according to the configuration information, where the TA information is configured to indicate a TA value determined by the terminal device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">In a second aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a communication method, including:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0011">transmitting, by a network device, configuration information to a terminal device; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0012">receiving, by the network device, timing advance TA information from the terminal device, where the TA information is configured to indicate a TA value determined by the terminal device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">In a third aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a communication apparatus, including:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0014">a receiving module, configured to receive configuration information from a network device; and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0015">a transmitting module, configured to transmit timing advance TA information to the network device according to the configuration information, where the TA information is configured to indicate a TA value determined by the terminal device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0016">In a fourth aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a communication apparatus, including:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0017">a transmitting module, configured to transmit configuration information to a terminal device; and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0018">a receiving module, configured to receive timing advance TA information from the terminal device, where the TA information is configured to indicate a TA value determined by the terminal device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0019">In a fifth aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a terminal device, including a transceiver, a processor, and a memory,<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0020">the memory is configured to store computer-executable instructions; and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0021">the processor is configured to execute the computer-executable instructions stored in the memory, to cause the processor to perform the communication method according to the first aspect.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0022">In a sixth aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a network device, including a transceiver, a processor, and a memory,<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0023">the memory is configured to store computer-executable instructions; and</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0024">the processor is configured to execute the computer-executable instructions stored in the memory, to cause the processor to perform the communication method according to the second aspect.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0025">In a seventh aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a computer-readable storage medium, where computer-executable instructions are stored in the computer-readable storage medium.

The terminal device may be deployed on the ground, including indoor or outdoor, handheld, wearable or in-vehicle terminal devices; it may also be deployed on water (such as on ships, etc.); it may also be deployed in the air (for example, on the aircraft, balloon and satellite, etc.). The terminal device may be a mobile phone, a tablet computer (Pad), a computer capable of performing wireless transmitting and receiving, a virtual reality (VR) terminal device, an augmented reality (AR) terminal device, a wireless terminal in industrial control, an in-vehicle terminal device, a wireless terminal in self-driving, a wireless terminal device in remote medical, a wireless terminal device in smart grid, a wireless terminal device in transportation safety, a wireless terminal device in smart city, a wireless terminal device in smart home, a wearable terminal device, etc. The terminal device involved in the embodiments of the present disclosure may also be referred to as a terminal, user equipment (UE), access terminal device, in-vehicle terminal, industrial control terminal, UE unit, UE station, mobile station, mobile unit, remote station, remote terminal device, mobile device, UE terminal device, wireless communication device, UE proxy or UE device, etc. The terminal device may also be stationary or mobile.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0045">Network device: it is usually capable of performing wireless transmitting and receiving. The network device may have mobile characteristics, for example, the network device may be a mobile device. In some implementations, the network device may be a satellite or a balloon station. For example, the satellite may be a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite, a medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite, a geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite, a High Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellite, etc. For example, an orbital altitude of the LEO satellite usually ranges from 500 km to 1500 km, and an orbital period (a period of rotating around the earth) thereof is about 1.5 hours to 2 hours. The signal propagation delay of single-hop communication between users is about 20 ms. The single-hop communication delay between users refers to a delay of transmission from the terminal device to the network device, or a delay of transmission from the network device to a transmission device. A maximum visibility time of the satellite is about 20 minutes. The maximum visibility time refers to a maximum duration during which the beam of the satellite covers a certain area of the ground. The LEO satellite moves relative to the ground. As the satellite moves, the ground area covered by the satellite changes. The LEO satellite has a short signal propagation distance, a low link loss, and little requirements for the transmit power of the terminal device. The orbital altitude of the GEO satellite is usually 35786 km, and the orbital period thereof is 24 hours. The signal propagation delay of single-hop communication between users is about 250 ms. In order to ensure the coverage of the satellite and improve the system capacity of the communication network, the satellite may use multiple beams to cover the ground. For example, one satellite may provide tens or hundreds of beams to cover the ground, and one beam may cover a ground area having a diameter of tens to hundreds of kilometers. Of course, the network device may also be a base station deployed on the ground, water, etc. For example, the network device may be a next generation NodeB (gNB) or a next generation-evolved NodeB (ng-eNB). Among them, the gNB provides user plane functions and control plane functions of the new radio (NR) interface for the UE, and the ng-eNB provides user plane functions and control plane functions of the evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) for the UE. It should be noted that the gNB and the ng-eNB are only a name, which is used to indicate a base station supporting a 5G network system, and are not limiting. The network device may also be a base transceiver station (BTS) in a GSM system or a CDMA system, a nodeB (NB) in a WCDMA system, or an evolutional node B (eNB or eNodeB) in an LTE system. Alternatively, the network device may also be a relay station, an access point, an in-vehicle device, a wearable device, and a network-side device in a network after 5G or a network device in a future evolved PLMN network, a roadside site unit (RSU), etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0046">Uplink synchronization: it means that uplink signals, transmitted with a same time slot resource by terminal devices in different positions in a same cell, arrive at the network device at the same time. That is, the signals from different terminal devices in the same time slot arrive at the network device synchronously. Its purpose is to reduce uplink multiple access interference and multipath interference between different terminal devices in a cell, and increase the cell capacity and cell radius.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0047">Timing advance (TA): An important characteristic of uplink transmission is that different terminal devices perform orthogonal multiple access in time and frequency domains, that is, uplink transmissions of different terminal devices in a same cell do not interfere with each other. In order to ensure the orthogonality of the uplink transmissions and avoid intra-cell interference, the network device requires that the arrival times, at which signals transmitted from different terminal devices at a same time but with different frequency domain resources arrive at the network device, are substantially aligned. In order to ensure the time synchronization on the network device side, the communication system (such as the NR system) supports the mechanism of uplink timing advance.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0048">The uplink clock and downlink clock on the network device side are the same, but there is an offset between the uplink clock and the downlink clock on the terminal device side, and different terminal devices have their own different uplink timing advance (which may be referred to as TA amount, or TA value). By appropriately controlling the offset of each terminal device, the network device may control the arrival time at which the uplink signals from different terminal devices arrive at the network device. For a terminal device far away from the network device, due to a large transmission delay, such terminal device has to transmit its uplink data earlier than a terminal device close to the network device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0049">Next, the timing advance is introduced with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating timing advance provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The uplink signal transmitted by the terminal device <b>2</b> arrives at the network device after the transmission time Tp<b>2</b>, that is, the uplink signal transmitted by the terminal device <b>2</b> arrives at the network device at time <b>0</b>. As can be seen, the arrival times, at which the uplink signal transmitted by the terminal device <b>1</b> and the uplink signal transmitted by the terminal device <b>2</b> arrive at the network device, are aligned.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0052">In (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the effect of not performing uplink timing advance is shown. As can be seen from (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the timing of the uplink sub-frame and the timing of the downlink sub-frame on the network device side are the same, but there is an offset between the timing of the uplink sub-frame and the timing of the downlink sub-frame of the terminal device, that is; there is uplink timing advance TA.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0053">In the related art (for example, in the NR system), the TA value of the terminal device is controlled by the network device. The network device determines the TA value of each terminal device by measuring the uplink transmission of the terminal device. As long as the terminal device performs uplink transmission, the network device may utilize it to measure the TA value. After the network device determines the TA value for the terminal device, it transmits the TA value to the terminal device through a timing advance command (TA command).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0054">The network device transmits the TA command to the terminal device in the following two forms.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0055">(1) Initial TA: During the random access process, the network device determines the TA value by measuring the random access preamble transmitted by the terminal device, and transmits it to the terminal device through a TA command field in a random access response (RAR).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0056">(2) Adjustment of TA in RRC connected state: Although uplink synchronization is achieved between the terminal device and the network device during the random access process, the timing of the uplink signal arriving at the network device may vary over time. For example, there are several situations as follows: (a) the transmission delay between a network device and a terminal device in high-speed movement would change constantly; (b) a current transmission path disappears and it is switched to a new transmission path, for example, this situation is likely to occur when the terminal device moves to the corner of a building in a densely built city; (c) a crystal oscillator of the terminal device is offset, and the accumulation of offset for a long time may cause an error in the uplink timing; and (d) a Doppler frequency shift and the like is caused due to the movement of the terminal device. Therefore, the terminal device needs to continuously update its uplink TA value, to keep the uplink synchronization. If the TA value of a certain terminal device needs to be corrected, the network device will transmit a TA command to this terminal device, and request it to adjust the uplink TA value. The TA command is transmitted to the terminal device through a medium access control (MAC) control element (CE).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0057">In the related art, in order to keep the uplink synchronization, the network device may configure a timer (referred to as time Alignment Timer) for the terminal device through RRC signaling. The terminal device may use this timer to determine whether the uplink is synchronized. When the terminal device receives the TA command (from RAR or MAC CE), the terminal device starts or restarts the timer. During the running period of the timer, the terminal device considers that the uplink is synchronized, that is, the TA value maintained by the terminal device is valid. If the timer expires, the terminal device considers that the uplink is out of synchronization; and if the terminal device has uplink data to be transmitted, it needs to trigger the random access to re-acquire the TA value. That is to say, when the timer expires, the terminal device may only transmit the preamble on the uplink.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0058">In the terrestrial network, the TA value between the terminal device and the network device changes slowly, and the above-mentioned related technology may keep the uplink synchronization of the terminal device. However, compared with the conventional terrestrial network, in the NTN network (especially the LEO scenario), the TA value between the terminal device and the network device changes rapidly and greatly. When the above-mentioned related technology is adopted, the network device must measure the uplink transmission of the terminal device frequently, so as to update the TA value of the terminal device. However, in some scenarios (for example, when the terminal device does not have a lot of uplink transmission for measurement, or when the network device needs to measure a large number of terminal devices), the network device may not be able to control the real-time update of the TA values of the terminal devices. In this case, the TA value of the terminal device is not updated timely, resulting in frequent uplink out-of-synchronization. Furthermore, when the terminal device has uplink data to be transmitted, it needs to perform the random access process again, thereby causing a large signaling overhead and consumption of random access resources.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0059">In order to solve the above technical problem, the embodiments of the present disclosure propose a communication method.

Through this process, the real-time update and adjustment of the TA value of the terminal device are ensured, frequent uplink out-of-synchronization is avoided, and thus the consumption of random access resources and signaling overhead that are caused by frequent uplink out-of-synchronization can be avoided. Further, through this process, the network device can track the update status of the TA value of the terminal device in real time, which is beneficial to the uplink scheduling of the terminal device, reducing the scheduling delay and service transmission delay.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0063">Hereinafter, the technical solutions shown in the present disclosure will be described in detail through the specific embodiments. It should be noted that the following embodiments may exist independently or be combined with each other, and the same or similar contents will not be repeated in different embodiments.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a communication method provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the method of this embodiment includes operations as follows.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0065">At S<b>401</b>, the network device transmits configuration information to the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">The configuration information may instruct the terminal device to report the information required for the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0067">In an implementation, the configuration information is used to indicate a reporting mode of the TA information. The reporting mode may be any of periodic reporting, aperiodic reporting, and semi-persistent reporting.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0068">The periodic reporting means that the terminal device periodically reports the TA information to the network device. For example, the terminal device reports the TA information to the network device at preset time intervals. The preset time interval may be indicated by the network device in the configuration information, or may also be determined by the terminal device autonomously, or may be negotiated between the network device and the terminal device in advance.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0069">The aperiodic reporting means that the time at which the terminal device reports the TA information to the network device is not periodic. For example, the terminal device may report the TA information to the network device according to a preset reporting trigger condition. Whenever the reporting trigger condition is satisfied, the terminal device reports the TA information to the network device. The reporting trigger condition may be indicated by the network device in the configuration information, or may also be determined by the terminal device autonomously, or may be negotiated between the network device and the terminal device in advance. Alternatively, whenever the network device needs to know the TA information of the terminal device, the network device may instruct, through the indication information, the terminal device to report the TA information once.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0070">The semi-persistent reporting means that the terminal device periodically reports the TA information to the network device within a certain period of time. A start time and an end time of this period of time may be indicated by the network device in the configuration information, or may also be determined by the terminal device autonomously, or may be negotiated between the network device and the terminal device in advance. Alternatively, the network device may also indicate the start time and the end time to the terminal device through the indication information as required.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0071">In an implementation, the configuration information may indicate a physical channel carrying the TA information. The physical channel may be a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) or a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0072">In an implementation, the configuration information may also indicate the reporting mode of the TA information and the physical channel carrying the TA information at the same time. When the configuration information indicates the above two kinds of information at the same time, such two kinds of information may be indicated explicitly or implicitly. For example, if the configuration information indicates that the reporting mode is the periodic reporting, it is implicitly indicated that the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUCCH. If the configuration information indicates that the reporting mode is the aperiodic reporting, it implicitly indicates that the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0073">In an implementation, the configuration information is configured to indicate any of the following cases:</p><p id="p-0063" num="0074">Case 1: The reporting mode is the periodic reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUCCH;</p><p id="p-0064" num="0075">Case 2: The reporting mode is the aperiodic reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH;</p><p id="p-0065" num="0076">Case 3: The reporting mode is the semi-persistent reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUCCH; and</p><p id="p-0066" num="0077">Case 4: The reporting mode is the semi-persistent reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0078">In this embodiment, the configuration information may be RRC signaling. That is, the network device carries the configuration information in the RRC signaling and transmits it to the terminal device. For example, the RRC signaling may be RRC reconfiguration signaling or the like.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0079">It should be noted that, the network device may indicate the reporting mode in the configuration information in multiple ways, which are not limited in this embodiment. In the following, it is described in connection with some possible examples.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0080">In one example, the configuration information includes a first information field. A information value in the first information field is used to indicate the reporting mode. For example, in a case where the information value in the first information field is 1, it means that the reporting mode is the periodic reporting. In a case where the information value in the first information field is 2, it indicates that the reporting mode is the aperiodic reporting. In a case where the information value in the first information field is 3, it indicates that the reporting mode is the semi-persistent reporting.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0081">Alternatively, the information value in the first information field is used to indicate the different situations from the above. For example, in a case where the information value in the first information field is 1, it means that the reporting mode is the periodic reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA is the PUCCH (Case 1). In a case where the information value in the first information field is 2, it means that the reporting mode is the aperiodic reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA is the PUSCH (Case 2). In a case where the information value in the first information field is 3, it indicates that the reporting mode is the semi-persistent reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA is the PUCCH (Case 3). In a case where the information value in the first information field is 4, it means that the reporting mode is the semi-persistent reporting, and the physical channel carrying the TA is the PUSCH (Case 4).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0082">In another example, different reporting modes correspond to different information fields in the configuration information. For example, the periodic reporting corresponds to an information field 1, the aperiodic reporting corresponds to an information field 2, and the semi-persistent reporting corresponds to an information field 3. In a case where the information field 1 exists in the configuration information, it indicates that the reporting mode is the periodic reporting. In a case where the information field 2 exists in the configuration information, it indicates that the reporting mode is the aperiodic reporting. In case where the information field 3 exists in the configuration information, it indicates that the reporting mode is the semi-persistent reporting.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0083">Alternatively, the above different cases correspond to different information fields in the configuration information. For example, Case 1 corresponds to an information field 1, Case 2 corresponds to an information field 2. Case 3 corresponds to an information field 3, and Case 4 corresponds to an information field 4. In a case where the information field 1 exists in the configuration information, Case 1 is indicated. In a case where the information field 2 exists in the configuration information, Case 2 is indicated. In a case where the information field 3 exists in the configuration information, Case 3 is indicated. In a case where the information field 4 exists in the configuration information, Case 4 is indicated.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0084">It should be understood that, when the reporting modes indicated by the configuration information are different, the contents included in the configuration information may also be different. This will be described in detail with reference to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> in the following, and will not be repeated here.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0085">At S<b>402</b>, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device, according to the configuration information.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0086">The TA information is configured to indicate the TA value determined by the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0087">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the terminal device has a self-positioning capability. The terminal device may determine, based on the self-positioning capability, TA values corresponding to different times, and continuously adjust the transmitting time of the uplink data according to the determined TA values.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0088">In an implementation, the terminal device may determine the TA value according to its own location information and the location information of the network device. For example, the TA value is determined according to a distance between the terminal device and the network device. In an example, the terminal device may calculate, at preset intervals, the TA value according to the distance between itself and the network device. The embodiments of the present disclosure do not particularly limit the specific ways in which the terminal device calculates the TA value.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0089">In the NTN network, in a case where a satellite serves as the network device, the location information of the network device may change all the time, and the trajectory of the network device is consistent with that of the satellite. Therefore, the location information of the network device may be determined based on ephemeris information. The ephemeris information may also be referred to as an ephemeris, which refers to a table of satellite orbit parameters, that is, it uses table data to illustrate predetermined locations of the satellite at regular intervals. Therefore, the terminal device may determine, according to the ephemeris information, the location information of the network device at different times.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0090">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the terminal device determines and adjusts the TA value based on its own location information and the location information of the network device. As such, it ensures the real-time update and adjustment of the TA value of the terminal device, avoids frequent uplink out-of-synchronization, and further enables consumption of random access resources and signaling overhead that are caused by frequent uplink out-of-synchronization to be avoided.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0091">In an implementation, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device in the reporting mode of the TA information indicated by the configuration information. That is, when the reporting mode indicated by the configuration information is the periodic reporting, the terminal device periodically transmits the TA information to the network device. When the reporting mode indicated by the configuration information is the aperiodic reporting, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device aperiodically. When the reporting mode indicated by the configuration information is the semi-persistent reporting, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device semi-persistently.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0092">In an implementation, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device through the physical channel carrying the TA information as indicated by the configuration information. That is, when the configuration information indicates that the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUCCH, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device through the PUCCH. When the configuration information indicates that the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device through the PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0093">It should be noted that, when the reporting modes indicated by the configuration information are different, the processes of reporting the TA information by the terminal device to the network device are also different. In the following, different reporting modes will be described separately in conjunction with the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, which will not be repeated here.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0094">It should be understood that the TA information reported by the terminal device to the network device each time indicates the TA value currently determined by the terminal device. In this way, the network device may know the latest TA value of the terminal device according to the received TA information, so as to track the change of the TA value of the terminal device. This is beneficial for the network device to subsequently perform dynamic uplink scheduling for the terminal device, so that the scheduling of the network device can match the real-time TA value of the terminal device instead of adopting a maximum TA value supported by the system all the time. As such, the scheduling delay can be reduced, thereby reducing the service transmission delay.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0095">In an implementation, the TA information reported by the terminal device to the network device includes an index corresponding to the TA value. For example, the TA index may be in a range from 0 to N. Different indices correspond to different TA values, and the TA value corresponding to each index may be positive or negative. After the terminal device calculates the TA value based on its own positioning capability, it searches an index table to determine an index corresponding to the TA value, and transmits the index to the network device. It can be understood that the length of the TA information can be reduced by transmitting the index corresponding to the TA value.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0096">In one example, the TA information may include an index corresponding to a first TA value. The first TA value is a real-time TA value determined by the terminal device, that is, the TA value newly calculated by the terminal device. That is to say, an index corresponding to the real-time absolute TA value is reported by the terminal device to the network device.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0097">In another example, the TA information may include an index corresponding to a second TA value. The second TA value is a change of the real-time TA value determined by the terminal device relative to a last reported TA value. That is to say, an index corresponding to the incremental TA value is reported by the terminal device to the network device. It can be understood that, by reporting the index corresponding to the incremental TA value and the index corresponding to the absolute TA value, the length of the TA information can be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0098">In the communication method provided by this embodiment, the terminal device receives the configuration information from the network device, and transmits the TA information to the network device according to the configuration information. Through this process, the real-time update and adjustment of the TA value of the terminal device is ensured, frequent uplink out-of-synchronization is avoided, and thus the consumption of random access resources and signaling overhead that are caused by frequent uplink out-of-synchronization can be avoided. Further, through this process, the network device can track the update status of the TA value of the terminal device in real time, which is beneficial to the uplink scheduling for the terminal device, reducing the scheduling delay and service transmission delay.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of another communication method provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Correspondingly, the network device may receive the TA information at the corresponding time point and the corresponding PUCCH resource.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0105">In an implementation, the time information may include at least one of the following information: period information, configured to indicate a reporting period for reporting the TA information; and offset information, configured to indicate a time slot offset within each period. In this way, according to the period information and the offset information, the time point at which the TA information is reported periodically by the terminal device each time may be determined.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0106">In an implementation, the configuration information may further include: at least one bandwidth part (BWP) configured for the terminal device, and PUCCH resources corresponding to each BWP. Further, the configuration information may also indicate a PUCCH resource of each BWP that is used for reporting the TA information.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0107">In another example, the periodic TA information may also be carried in a PUSCH resource. The PUSCH resource may be a resource dynamically scheduled by the network device. For example, the network device periodically schedules the PUSCH resources, so that the terminal device may periodically report the TA information through the PUSCH resources. The PUSCH resource may also be a resource preconfigured by the network device for the terminal device (for example, a configured grant CG resource), and the terminal device periodically reports the TA information on the preconfigured resource.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0108">At S<b>502</b>, the terminal device periodically transmits the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0109">In this embodiment, after the terminal device receives the configuration information, in a case where the reporting mode indicated by the configuration information is the periodic reporting, the terminal device starts to periodically transmit the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0110">In an implementation, according to the time information and PUCCH resource information indicated by the configuration information, the terminal device periodically transmits the TA information to the network device through the PUCCH.

Therefore, after receiving the configuration information, the terminal device starts to periodically transmits the TA information to the network device through the preconfigured PUCCH resources used for reporting the TA information. Correspondingly, the network device may periodically receive the TA information on the corresponding PUCCH resources. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, after receiving the configuration information in which the periodic reporting of the TA information is indicated, the terminal device may start the periodic reporting of the TA information without waiting for other indication information.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0113">In this embodiment, the terminal device periodically reports the TA information to the network device, so that the network device can know the change of the TA value of the terminal device in time.

In this case, the terminal device does not immediately report the TA information to the network device, but waits for the first indication information transmitted from the network device. Correspondingly, when the network device, according to its own requirements, needs to know the TA information of the terminal device, the network device transmits the first indication information to the terminal device to instruct the terminal device to report the current TA information.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0118">The first indication information may include a target resource for reporting the TA information, so as to instruct the terminal device to transmit the TA information on the target resource. The first indication information may be carried in the MAC CE, or in the PDCCH. The target resource can be any resource used for uplink transmission. For example, the target resource may be a PUCCH resource or a PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0119">In an example, the target resource is a PUSCH resource, and the first indication information is carried in a PDCCH for scheduling the PUSCH resource. For example, the first indication information may be downlink control information (DCI) in the PDCCH information. Exemplarily, the network device dynamically schedules the PUSCH resource in the PDCCH information (for example, indicating the allocated PUSCH resource through DCI). In addition, the network device also indicates in the PDCCH information whether to report the TA information in the currently scheduled PUSCH resource. For example, when a second information field exists in the PDCCH information, or when the information value in the second information field is a first preset value (for example, 1), it is indicated to transmit the TA information on the currently scheduled PUSCH resource. When the second information field does not exist in the PDCCH information, or when the information value in the second information field is a second preset value (for example, 0), it is indicated not to transmit the TA information on the currently scheduled PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0120">In another example, the target resource is a PUCCH resource. For example, the network device pre-configures a PUCCH resource for reporting the TA information of the terminal device. When the network device needs to know the TA information of the terminal device, the network device transmits the first indication information to the terminal device, to instruct the terminal device to transmit the TA information on the preconfigured PUCCH resource.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0121">At S<b>703</b>, in a case where the first indication information indicates to transmit the TA information, the terminal device transmits the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0122">At S<b>704</b>, in a case where the first indication information indicates not to transmit the TA information, the terminal device does not transmit the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0123">Exemplarily, the terminal device receives the PDCCH information for scheduling a PUSCH resource, and in a case where the PDCCH information further indicates to transmit the TA information on the currently scheduled PUSCH resource, the terminal device transmits the TA information on the currently scheduled PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0124">In an example, when the terminal device transmits the TA information through the PUSCH resource, the TA information may be carried in the MAC CE of the PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0125">In this embodiment, when the TA information is reported in the aperiodic reporting mode, the terminal device reports the TA information according to the indication of the first indication information.

Therefore, the terminal device does not report the TA information in the currently scheduled PUSCH.

Therefore, the terminal device reports the TA information in the currently scheduled PUSCH.

Therefore, the terminal device reports the TA information in the currently scheduled PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0128">In this embodiment, the terminal device reports the TA information to the network device in the aperiodic reporting mode, so that the network device can know the change of the TA value of the terminal device in time when needed. This is beneficial for the network device to subsequently perform dynamic uplink scheduling for the terminal device, so that the scheduling of the network device can match the real-time TA value of the terminal device instead of adopting a maximum TA value supported by the system all the time. As such, the scheduling delay can be reduced, thereby reducing the service transmission delay. Further, since when the network device needs, according to its own requirements, to know the TA information of the terminal device, the network device would transmit the first indication information to the terminal device, this enables the signaling overhead to be reduced.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of yet another communication method provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure. This embodiment exemplifies the process of semi-persistently reporting the TA information. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the method of this embodiment may include operations as follows.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0130">At S<b>901</b>, the network device transmits configuration information to the terminal device, where the configuration information indicates that the reporting mode of the TA information is the semi-persistent reporting.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0131">In this embodiment, when the semi-persistent reporting mode is adopted, the TA information may be carried on a PUCCH resource or a PUSCH resource. Therefore, in a case where the configuration information indicates the semi-persistent reporting, it may also indicate the physical channel carrying the TA information at the same time. Therefore, this embodiment includes the following two cases: the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUCCH, and the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0132">In a case where the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUCCH, the TA information is carried on a PUCCH resource. The PUCCH resource may be pre-configured in configuration information. In an example, the configuration information includes at least one of the following information:<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0133">time information, configured to indicate a time point at which the TA information is periodically reported each time; and</li>        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0134">resource information, configured to indicate a PUCCH resource used for reporting the TA information.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0120" num="0135">In this way, according to the configuration information, the terminal device may determine the time point at which the TA information is periodically reported each time, and the PUCCH resource occupied for reporting the TA information each time. Correspondingly, the network device may receive the TA information at the corresponding time point and on the corresponding PUCCH resource.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0136">In an implementation, the time information may include at least one of the following information: period information, configured to indicate a reporting period for reporting the TA information; and offset information, configured to indicate a time slot offset within each period. In this way, according to the period information and the offset information, the time point at which the TA information is reported periodically by the terminal device each time may be determined.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0137">In an implementation, the configuration information may further include: at least one bandwidth part (BWP) configured for the terminal device, and PUCCH resources corresponding to each BWP. Further, the configuration information may also indicate a PUCCH resource of each BWP that is used for reporting the TA information.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0138">In a case where the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH, the TA information is carried on a PUSCH resource. The PUSCH resource may be dynamically scheduled by the network device through the PDCCH, or may be pre-configured by the network device for the terminal device (for example, a pre-configured CG resource).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0139">At S<b>902</b>, the network device transmits second indication information to the terminal device, where the second indication information is configured to instruct the reporting of the TA information to be started.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0140">In this embodiment, after receiving the configuration information, the terminal device determines that the semi-persistent reporting mode needs to be adopted according to the configuration information. In this case, the terminal device does not immediately report the TA information to the network device, but waits for the second indication information transmitted from the network device. Correspondingly, when the network device, according to its own requirements, needs to know the TA information of the terminal device, the network device transmits the second indication information to the terminal device. The second indication information is configured to instruct the reporting of the TA information to be started. In other words, the second indication information is configured to instruct the semi-persistent reporting of the TA information to be activated.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0141">In an implementation, the second indication information may be carried through the MAC CE. Exemplarily, the network device transmits the downlink PDSCH to the terminal device, and the second indication information is carried in the MAC CE of the PDSCH.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0142">In an implementation, the second indication information may be carried through the PDCCH. For example, the second indication information may be specifically carried in the DC of the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0143">Exemplarily, the second indication information includes a third information field. When the information value in the third information field is 1, it means starting the reporting of the TA information (or in other words, it means activating the semi-persistent reporting of the TA information). When the information value in the third information field is 0, it means stopping the reporting of the TA information (or in other words, it means deactivating the semi-persistent reporting of the TA information).</p><p id="p-0129" num="0144">At S<b>903</b>, the terminal device starts to periodically transmit the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0145">Based on the second indication information received in S<b>902</b>, the terminal device starts to periodically report the TA information to the network device. Exemplarily, in a case where the configuration information indicates that the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUCCH, the terminal device periodically reports the TA information to the network device through the PUCCH resource, according to the time information and resource information in the configuration information. Alternatively, if the configuration information indicates that the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH, the terminal device periodically reports the TA information to the network device through the PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0146">It should be noted that, when the physical channel carrying the TA information is the PUSCH, the network device may also periodically schedule the PUSCH resources, so that the terminal device may periodically transmit the TA information on the PUSCH resources. Alternatively, the network device may preconfigure PUSCH resources (for example, CG resources) for the terminal device, so that the terminal device may periodically transmit the TA information on the preconfigured PUSCH resources.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0147">At S<b>904</b> the network device transmits the second indication information to the terminal device, where the second indication information is configured to instruct the reporting of the TA information to be stopped.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0148">In a case where the network device does not need to know the TA information of the terminal device, the second indication information may then also be transmitted to the terminal device. The second indication information is configured to instruct the reporting of the TA information to be stopped, or in other words, the second indication information is configured to deactivate the semi-persistent reporting of the TA information. For example, the information value in the third information field of the second indication information is set as 0.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0149">At S<b>905</b>, the terminal device stops transmitting the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0150">Based on the second indication information received in S<b>904</b>, the terminal device stops periodically transmitting the TA information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0151">In the following, the process of semi-persistently reporting the TA information through PUCCH resources and the process of semi-persistently reporting the TA information through PUSCH resources are described respectively with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic sequence diagram for the semi-persistent reporting of the TA information through PUCCH resources provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure.
