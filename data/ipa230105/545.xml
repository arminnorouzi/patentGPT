Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The instant disclosure relates generally to ablation electrode assemblies. In particular, the instant disclosure relates to ablation electrode assemblies having an inner core member and an outer shell surrounding the inner core member, wherein the inner core member and the outer shell define a space therebetween. In some embodiments, the space can comprise a vacuum region or evacuated region, and in other embodiments the space can be configured for allowing the flow of irrigation fluid. The instant disclosure further relates to methods of using ablation electrode assemblies, including methods for providing irrigation fluid during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue in a human body.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">b. Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrophysiology catheters are used in a variety of diagnostic and/or therapeutic medical procedures to diagnose and/or correct conditions such as atrial arrhythmias, including for example, ectopic atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. Arrhythmias can create a variety of conditions including irregular heart rates, loss of synchronous atrioventricular contractions and stasis of blood flow in a chamber of a heart which can lead to a variety of symptomatic and asymptomatic ailments and even death.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A medical procedure in which an electrophysiology catheter is used includes a first diagnostic catheter deployed through a patient's vasculature to a patient's heart or a chamber or vein thereof. An electrophysiology catheter that carries one or more electrodes can be used for cardiac mapping or diagnosis, ablation and/or other therapy delivery modes, or both. Once at the intended site, treatment can include, for example, radio frequency (RF) ablation, cryoablation, laser ablation, chemical ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound-based ablation, microwave ablation. An electrophysiology catheter imparts ablative energy to cardiac tissue to create one or more lesions in the cardiac tissue and oftentimes a contiguous or linear and transmural lesion. This lesion disrupts undesirable cardiac activation pathways and thereby limits, corrals, or prevents errant conduction signals that can form the basis for arrhythmias.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During RF ablation, local temperature elevation can result in coagulum formation on the ablation electrode, resulting in an impedance rise. As the impedance increases, more energy is passed through the portion of the electrode without coagulation, creating even higher local temperatures and further increasing coagulum formation and the impedance. Finally, enough blood coagulates onto the electrode that no energy passes into the targeted tissue, thereby requiring the catheter to be removed from the vascular system, the electrode to be cleaned, and the catheter to be repositioned within the cardiac system at the desired location. Not only can this process be time consuming, but it can be difficult to return to the previous location because of the reduced electrical activity in the targeted tissue, which has been previously ablated. Recent studies have also demonstrated the formation of a so-called soft thrombus in RF ablation. The formation of the soft thrombus results from heat induced protein denaturation and aggregation and occurs independently of heparin concentration in serum. In addition, RF ablation can generate significant heat, which, if not controlled, can result in excessive tissue damage, such as tissue charring, steam pop, and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it can be desirable to monitor and/or control the temperature of ablation electrode assemblies. It can also be desirable to use ablation electrode assemblies to provide irrigation fluid during RF ablation. RF ablation catheters can be configured to provide temperature feedback during RF ablation via a thermal sensor such as a thermocouple or thermistor. A temperature reading provided by a single thermal sensor cannot accurately represent the temperature of the electrode/tissue interface. This is because a portion of the electrode that is in direct contact with the targeted tissue can have a higher temperature than the rest of the electrode that is being cooled by the blood flow. The orientation of the RF ablation catheter can affect the position of the thermal sensor, and accordingly, can affect the temperature reading provided by the thermal sensor. If the thermal sensor is in contact with the targeted tissue, the thermal sensor can provide a certain temperature reading generally corresponding to the temperature of the targeted tissue, but if the thermal sensor is not in contact with the targeted tissue, there will be a time lag before the thermal sensor provides a temperature reading generally corresponding to the temperature of the targeted tissue, and due to the cooling effect of the blood flow, the thermal sensor can never approach the actual temperature of the targeted tissue. In an effort to overcome the effect that the orientation of the catheter can have on temperature sensing, multiple thermal sensors positioned at different locations on the electrode can be used. For example and without limitation, the highest measured temperature can be used to represent the electrode/tissue interface temperature. However, temperature measurements provided by multiple thermal sensors cannot always accurately reflect the temperature of the electrode/tissue interface (e.g., heat transfer between the multiple thermal sensors can affect the temperature reading of each thermal sensor).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is desirable to be able to provide ablation electrode assemblies that are configured to mitigate the effects of orientation of the RF ablation catheter for monitoring the temperature of the ablation electrode assemblies and/or targeted tissue, as well as to mitigate temperature gradients (i.e., the directions and rates at which temperature changes) across electrodes. It is also desirable to interrupt and/or reduce heat transfer paths between multiple thermal sensors of the electrode, thereby improving the ability to distinguish between the temperature reading associated with a thermal sensor that is proximate the lesion formed in the targeted tissue and the temperature reading associated with a thermal sensor that is proximate the circulating blood pool. It is also desirable to have improved temperature correlation between the electrode and tissue interface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is also desirable, in some embodiments, to segment the ablation electrode and have an independent thermal sensor associated with each segment of the ablation electrode in order to offer even more complete segregation of the individual thermal sensors.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also desirable, in some embodiments, to include a mechanism to irrigate the ablation electrode assemblies and/or targeted areas in a patient's body with biocompatible fluids, such as saline solution, in order to reduce charring and inhibit the formation of coagulum and/or soft thrombus, as well as to enable deeper and/or greater volume lesions as compared to conventional, non-irrigated catheters at identical power settings. This can, in turn, enable greater energy delivery during RF ablation. The flow of biocompatible fluids (i.e., irrigation fluids) can be turbulent in order to provide an enveloping flow pattern adjacent to the surface of the ablation electrode assemblies for mixing with, displacing, and/or diluting blood that can be in contact with the ablation electrode assemblies in order to prevent stasis and the formation of coagulum. Pulsatile flow of irrigation fluids can help prevent stagnation areas at the distal end of an electrode by increasing flow turbulence around the catheter. Pulsatile flow of irrigation fluids can also improve correlation between the temperature of the electrode tip and the targeted tissue. The flow of irrigation fluids can be modified based on information and feedback received during RF ablation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also desirable, in some embodiments, to monitor a change in the temperature of irrigation fluids during RF ablation in order to provide additional information or feedback regarding energy delivery and/or the temperature of the electrode and tissue interface. RF ablation can be modified based on the information and feedback regarding energy delivery and/or the temperature of the electrode and tissue interface. Operation in a temperature control mode can be at a set point above 55 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The instant disclosure relates to an ablation electrode assembly including an inner core member having a distal end and proximal end and an outer shell surrounding the inner core member. The outer shell also has a distal end and a proximal end. The inner core member and outer shell define a space (as used herein the term &#x201c;space&#x201d; includes, for example, a volume or cavity or region). Herein, the term &#x201c;annular&#x201d; is used to describe the space; however, the configuration of the space can vary greatly and can be regular or irregular and can include support members (e.g., flutes, bosses, posts, and the like) to maintain separation and a useable space between the core and the shell. The spacing between the core and the shell can vary, if desired, and the distal end of the ablation electrode can be hemispherical, circular (e.g., the core and shell comprise a pair of concentric cylinders), rounded, geometrically-shaped, or the like. In an embodiment, the annular space can comprise a vacuum region or evacuated region. The inner core member and outer shell can both be generally cylindrical in shape with a distal end that is generally hemispherical in shape. The inner core member can comprise a thermal insulator having a reduced thermal conductivity, whereas the outer shell can comprise an electrically conductive material. The inner core member can include at least one channel configured to receive a thermal sensor, and the ablation electrode assembly can include at least one thermal sensor disposed in the channel. The inner core member can include an outer surface, an inner surface defining an inner cavity, and a radially extending passageway that extends from the inner cavity to the outer surface of the inner core member. As used herein, the term &#x201c;radially extending&#x201d; means extending away from the longitudinal axis at any angle relative to the longitudinal axis of the ablation electrode assembly. The inner core member can further include an axially extending passageway extending from an inner cavity of the inner core member to the distal end of the inner core member. In an embodiment, the outer shell can be scored with a plurality of axially extending grooves or slots to separate the outer shell into a plurality of segments. Each of the plurality of segments of the outer shell can have a corresponding thermal sensor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The ablation electrode assembly can further include an irrigant distribution element. The irrigation distribution element can be configured as a generally annular ring in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. The irrigation distribution element has a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end of the irrigant distribution element can define a circumferential irrigation port between the irrigant distribution element and the inner core member.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment of the disclosure, irrigation fluid can flow within at least a portion of at least one of the inner core member and outer shell. Irrigation fluid can flow from the inner cavity through the radially extending passageways in an embodiment with only proximal delivery of irrigation fluid. Irrigation fluid can flow from the inner cavity through the axially extending passageway in an embodiment with distal delivery of irrigation fluid. Irrigation fluid can also flow through the space between the inner core member and outer shell. In an embodiment of the disclosure, irrigation fluid has a first flow rate in a first time period and a second flow rate in a second time period. The first flow rate and the second flow rate can alternate and recur at intervals over time in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. In some embodiments, the second flow rate is greater than the first flow rate. For example and without limitation, the first flow rate can be approximately less than or about two (2) milliliters per minute (ml/min.), and the second flow rate can be approximately 13 ml/min. In other embodiments, the first flow rate is greater than the second flow rate and in yet other embodiments a single very low flow rate can be implemented (at least vis-&#xe0;-vis the prior known or typical irrigation fluid flow rates), for example, on the order of between about one ml/min. and less than about 13 ml/min. In some embodiments the first and second flow rates can be determined based on at least in part on a temperature measurement taken by a thermal sensor disposed on the inner core member. In some embodiments, the first and second flow rates can be determined based at least in part on an impedance measurement taken by a positioning electrode located on a catheter incorporating the ablation electrode assembly. Accordingly, the first and second flow rates for irrigation fluid are based on feedback provided by the ablation electrode assembly, including feedback regarding temperature and/or impedance, for example and without limitation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the disclosure, a method for providing irrigation fluid during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue includes the step of using a catheter having a catheter shaft having a fluid lumen; and an electrode assembly connected to the catheter shaft. The electrode assembly includes an inner core member having a distal end and a proximal end and an outer shell having a distal end and a proximal end. The inner core member further includes an outer surface, an inner surface defining a cavity, and an axially extending passageway extending from the cavity to the distal end of the inner core member. The outer shell surrounds the inner core member, such that the inner core member and the outer shell define a space. The method further includes the following steps: delivering energy to the outer shell of the electrode assembly; directing irrigation fluid from the fluid lumen to the cavity of the inner core member; allowing at least a first portion of the irrigation fluid from the cavity of the inner core member to flow in the space between the inner core member and the outer shell; directing at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid away from the space between the inner core member and the outer shell; measuring a first temperature of at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid near a first location where at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid enters the cavity of the inner core member; measuring a second temperature of at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid near a second location where at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid exits the electrode assembly; calculating a temperature differential value based at least in part on the first temperature and the second temperature; calculating a first value indicative of energy delivered to at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid as it flows from the first location to the second location based at least in part on the temperature differential value; and calculating a second value indicative of energy delivered to the targeted tissue based at least in part on the first value indicative of energy delivered to at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid. In an embodiment of the disclosure, the inner core member includes a first radially extending passageway that extends through the outer surface of the inner core member. At least the first portion of the irrigation fluid can be directed away from the space between the inner core member and the outer shell to the first radially extending passageway in an embodiment. In other embodiments, at least the first portion of the irrigation fluid is directed away from the space between the inner core member and the outer shell toward a proximal end of the catheter for elimination from the catheter at a location that is remote from a patient. In an embodiment of the disclosure, the inner core member includes a second radially extending passageway that extends from the inner cavity to the outer surface of the inner core member.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method for providing irrigation fluid during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue further includes the steps of directing at least a second portion of the irrigation fluid from the inner cavity of the inner core member directly to the second radially extending passageway. The first portion of the irrigation fluid can be separate from the second portion of the irrigation fluid. A flow rate of the first portion of the irrigation fluid can be independent of a flow rate of the second portion of the irrigation fluid. A flow rate of the second portion of the irrigation fluid can be greater than a flow rate of the first portion of the irrigation fluid with overall total fluid volumes much lower than prior art or typically utilized in clinical practice, especially valuable for patients already suffering from fluid overload (e.g., patient having heart failure and the like). That is, overall total fluid volume can range from low single digits to about ten or so milliliters per minute while effectively reducing or eliminating char and coagulum and improving temperature correlation for precise control of power to maintain a temperature during ablation procedures.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The outer shell of the electrode assembly can be electrically connected to an ablation system including an ablation generator for generating and delivering energy to the catheter. The energy generated and delivered to the catheter from the ablation generator is based at least in part on the highest temperature measurement from the plurality of thermal sensors in an embodiment of the disclosure. The energy generated and delivered to the catheter from the ablation generator can be based at least in part on the temperature differential value. The method for providing irrigation fluid during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue can further include the steps of correlating the temperature differential value to a temperature of the targeted tissue and determining the temperature of the targeted tissue based at least in part on the temperature differential value.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, another method for providing irrigation fluid during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue can include the step of using a catheter comprising a catheter shaft having a fluid lumen; and an electrode assembly connected to the catheter shaft. The electrode assembly can comprise an inner core member having a distal end and a proximal end; and an outer shell surrounding the inner core member. The inner core member and the outer shell can define a space. The method can further include the step of directing a pulsatile flow of irrigation fluid within at least a portion of at least one of the inner core member and outer shell. The irrigation fluid can have a first flow rate in a first time period and a second flow rate in a second time period. The first flow rate and the second flow rate can alternate and recur at intervals over time. In some embodiments, the second flow rate is greater than the first flow rate. For example and without limitation, the first flow rate can be approximately 2 ml/minute, and the second flow rate can be approximately 13 ml/minute. In other embodiments, the first flow rate is greater than the second flow rate and, as noted above, total flow rate (or volume delivered per unit of time) can be exceedingly low as compared to traditional irrigant flow rates (and volumes). In some embodiments, the first and second flow rates for irrigation fluid can be based on feedback provided by the ablation electrode assembly, including feedback regarding temperature and/or impedance, for example and without limitation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment of the disclosure, a system for providing irrigation fluid during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue includes a catheter comprising a catheter shaft having a fluid lumen and an electrode assembly connected to the catheter shaft. The system further includes a plurality of thermal sensors disposed within the catheter; an ablation generator electrically connected to at least a portion of the electrode assembly; an electronic control unit (ECU) operatively connected to each of the plurality of thermal sensors; and a control system. The ECU is configured to: receive as an input data from the plurality of thermal sensors relating to temperature measurements of irrigation fluid, determine a temperature differential value responsive to the data, determine a first value indicative of energy delivered to at a least a first portion of irrigation fluid, the first value responsive to the data, determine a second value indicative of energy delivered to the targeted tissue, the second value responsive to the data, and output the temperature differential value, the first value, and the second value. The control system is configured to receive the temperature differential value, the first value, and the second value and configured to control energy delivery of the ablation generator based at least in part on at least one of the temperature differential value, the first value, and the second value.

In an embodiment of the disclosure, the inner core member <b>14</b> includes a radially extending passageway <b>32</b> that extends from the inner cavity <b>30</b> to the outer surface <b>22</b> of the inner core member <b>14</b>. Inner core member <b>14</b> includes a plurality of radially extending passageways <b>32</b> in an embodiment. Each of the radially extending passageways <b>32</b> extend from the inner cavity <b>30</b> of the inner core member <b>14</b> to the outer surface <b>22</b> of the inner core member <b>14</b>. Each of the radially extending passageways <b>32</b> can be substantially centrally located on the inner core member <b>14</b> relative to a longitudinal axis <b>34</b> of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>. In an embodiment, the radially extending passageways <b>32</b> can be oriented at about 90 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis <b>34</b> of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>. In accordance with other embodiments, the radially extending passageways <b>32</b> can be angled generally toward the distal end <b>18</b> of the inner core member at an acute angle (e.g., between about 20 to about 70 degrees, and for some embodiments, between about 30 to about 65 degrees) with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>34</b> of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>. The orientation of the radially extending passageways <b>32</b> vary depending on the design of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>. The radially extending passageways <b>32</b> of the inner core member <b>14</b> can be straight or curved in various embodiments of the disclosure. In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, the radially extending passageways <b>32</b> of the inner core member <b>14</b> can be diametrically opposed to each other around the perimeter or circumference of the inner core member <b>14</b>. The radially extending passageways <b>32</b> can be generally tubular and can have a constant diameter along their length. In an embodiment, radially extending passageways <b>32</b> can have a diameter ranging in size from about 0.008 to about 0.015 inches, and for some embodiments between about 0.010 to about 0.012 inches. Alternate configurations having various shapes and diameters, for example, along all or portions of the length of the radially extending passageways <b>32</b> can be used in various embodiments. Radially extending passageways <b>32</b> can be configured to provide proximal delivery of irrigation fluid. Delivery of irrigation fluid generally reduces char, thrombus formation, and coagulum formation, thereby enabling greater energy delivery during RF ablation. Delivery of irrigation fluid can displace blood and prevent stasis in the areas adjacent the outer shell <b>16</b> of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Outer shell <b>16</b> improves temperature correlation between the electrode and tissue interface because it is configured as a thin shell, in place of a solid mass. The thin shell design can also mitigate temperature gradients across the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, as well as mitigate the effects of orientation of a catheter incorporating the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b> in connection with monitoring the temperature of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b> and/or targeted tissue.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Outer shell <b>16</b> can be a thin shell (i.e., have a small thickness) and can be external to and/or surround the inner core member <b>14</b>. Outer shell <b>16</b> can comprise a single layer. Outer shell <b>16</b> can be comprised of any electrically, and potentially thermally, conductive material known to those of ordinary skill in the art for the delivery of ablative energy to targeted tissue areas. Examples of electrically conductive materials include gold, platinum, iridium, palladium, stainless steel, and/or any combination thereof. In particular, a combination of platinum and iridium can be used in various combinations. Outer shell <b>16</b> can be fabricated or constructed in accordance with any method or technique known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example and without limitation, outer shell <b>16</b> can be fabricated or constructed using so-called deep drawn metal forming techniques, metal-punching techniques, electroforming techniques (e.g., electroforming over a sacrificial form that can include rods or other internal forms that melt or are subsequently dissolved), powdered metal techniques (e.g., pressing powered metal into a slug, sintering at high heat, and then covering the pressed and sintered slug with a metallic covering member), liquid metal injection molding (MIM) techniques, and the like. The powered metal techniques can also include sacrificial members, and the pressed and sintered slug can itself conduct fluid and thermal energy inside, around, and against the metallic covering.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Outer shell <b>16</b> can be electrically connected to an ablation system <b>37</b> to allow for the delivery of ablative energy, or the like.

The ablation generator <b>39</b> generates, delivers, and controls ablation energy (e.g., RF) output by the irrigated catheter assembly and the outer shell <b>16</b> of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b> thereof, in particular. The generator <b>39</b> is conventional in the art and can comprise a commercially available unit sold under the model number MI-<b>1500</b>T RF Cardiac Ablation Generator, available from St. Jude Medical, Inc. In an exemplary embodiment, the generator <b>39</b> can include an RF ablation signal source <b>43</b> configured to generate an ablation signal that is output across a pair of source connectors: a positive polarity connector SOURCE (+), which electrically connects to the outer shell <b>16</b> of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b> of the irrigated catheter assembly; and a negative polarity connector SOURCE (&#x2212;), can be electrically connected to one or more of the patch electrodes <b>41</b>. It should be understood that the term connectors as used herein does not imply a particular type of physical interface mechanism, but is rather broadly contemplated to represent one or more electrical nodes (including multiplexed and de-multiplexed nodes). The source is configured to generate a signal at a predetermined frequency in accordance with one or more user specified control parameters (e.g., power, time, etc.) and under the control of various feedback sensing and control circuitry. The source can generate a signal, for example, with a frequency of about 450 kHz or greater for RF energy. The generator <b>39</b> can also monitor various parameters associated with the ablation procedure including, for example, impedance, the temperature at the distal tip of the irrigated catheter assembly, applied ablation energy, power, force, proximity, and the position of the irrigated catheter assembly, and provide feedback to the clinician or another component within the irrigated catheter assembly regarding these parameters. Operation in a temperature control mode can be, for example, at a set point above 50 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Outer shell <b>16</b> has a distal end <b>36</b> and a proximal end <b>38</b>.

Outer shell <b>16</b> can be coupled together or connected with inner core member <b>14</b> along the same longitudinal axis <b>34</b>. Inner core member <b>14</b> and outer shell <b>16</b> can be connected or coupled together by any known mechanisms including, for example and without limitation, adhesive bonding, press-fit configurations, snap-fit configurations, ultrasonic staking, mechanical deformation, or any other mechanism known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In an embodiment, a connecting member <b>40</b> can be used to connect the outer shell <b>16</b> to the inner core member <b>14</b>. For example, the connecting member <b>40</b> can comprise a generally annular ring <b>42</b> and a radially outwardly extending flange <b>44</b> at an axial (e.g., proximal) end of the generally annular ring <b>42</b>.

In particular, a pulsatile flow of irrigation fluid can be utilized to increase flow turbulence and help prevent stagnation areas. Although pulsatile flow is mentioned in detail in accordance with some embodiments of the invention, ablation electrode assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> can be used in connection with any type of flow of irrigation fluid. For example and without limitation, pulsatile flow, intermittent flow, constant flow, and/or variable flow of irrigation fluid can be used in connection with ablation electrode assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">In an embodiment of providing irrigation fluid during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue, a catheter is used in Step <b>500</b>.

The electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> can include an inner core member <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>314</b> and an outer shell <b>16</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>.

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a pulsatile flow of irrigation fluid can be directed within at least a portion of at least one of the inner core member <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>314</b> and outer shell <b>16</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> in Step <b>502</b>. The irrigation fluid has a first flow rate in a first time period and has a second flow rate in a second time period. The first flow rate and the second flow rate can alternate and recur at intervals over time. The first flow rate and the second flow rate can alternate and recur at regular intervals in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure and/or can alternate and recur at irregular intervals in accordance with other embodiments of the disclosure. The first flow rate and the second flow rate can be intermittent in an embodiment of the disclosure. In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, the second flow rate is greater than the first flow rate. For example and without limitation, the first flow rate can be approximately 2 ml/min, and the second flow rate can be approximately 13 ml/min. In accordance with other embodiments of the disclosure, the first flow rate can be greater than the second flow rate. Accordingly, the irrigation fluid is a pulsatile flow in alternating waves of low flow rates and high flow rates, where either a low flow rate occurs first or a high flow rate occurs first. Utilization of a first flow rate of irrigation fluid that is higher and a second flow rate of irrigation fluid that is lower can be preferred in some stepped irrigation sequences. Although these particular flow rates are mentioned in detail, the first and second flow rates can be smaller or greater in other embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">The use of a pulsatile flow rate allows the temperature measurement from the thermal sensors <b>28</b> at the outer shell <b>16</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> of the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> as described herein to increase temporarily during the time period with a lower flow rate (i.e., the first time period), thereby bringing the temperature measurement from the thermal sensors <b>28</b> closer to the actual temperature of the interface between the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> and the targeted tissue <b>13</b> so that the thermal sensors <b>28</b> more closely reflect the actual temperature. In particular, the method of using an ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> to control temperature during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue <b>13</b> can utilize an extended period of low flow (i.e., the first flow rate) early in the power delivery ablation cycle in order to provide a so-called &#x201c;warm-up&#x201d; sequence. The use of a pulsatile flow with an ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> having an inner core member <b>14</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>314</b> and an outer shell <b>16</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b> can benefit most from the wave(s) of lower flow rates because the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> already has an improved correlation between the temperatures of the ablation electrode assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> and the targeted tissue. During the time period with a higher flow rate (i.e., the second time period), the ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> best receives the benefits of tissue cooling and coagulum reduction. Accordingly, the method of using an ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> to control temperature during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue can utilize higher flow rates (i.e., the second flow rate) to reduce the temperature of the interface between the electrode ablation assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> and the targeted tissue. In an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, the method of using an ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> to control temperature during cardiac ablation of targeted tissue can employ the following pattern of flow rates: (1) an initial warm-up period; (2) a first flow rate (e.g., 2 ml/min) for a first time period (e.g., 6 seconds); (3) a first cool-down period; (4) a second flow rate (e.g., 13 ml/min) for a second time period (e.g., 4 seconds); (5) a recovery period; (6) a first flow rate (e.g., 2 ml/min) for a first time period (e.g., 6 seconds); (6) a second cool-down period; and (7) a second flow rate (e.g., 13 ml/min) for a second time period (e.g., 4 seconds). Pulsatile flow of irrigation fluid can also help prevent stagnation areas and increase flow turbulence, which can help prevent stasis and the formation of coagulum.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0078">Valve members, for example and without limitation, such as those shown and described in co-owned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0161795, or other similar flow control features can be used in connection with catheters incorporating ablation electrode assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> in order to alternate between first and second flow rates. In other embodiments, the flow control features can be part of an ancillary control system separate from and to be used in conjunction with catheters. The valves can operate automatically without user input and/or can operate based on feedback recorded during RF ablation by the ECU <b>45</b>. The feedback can relate to time, temperature, and/or impedance, for example and without limitation. For example, the first and second flow rates can be based at least in part on temperature measurements taken by the thermal sensors <b>28</b>. For example, as temperature measurements from thermal sensors <b>28</b> increase, a higher flow rate can be desirable. For another example, as temperature measurements from thermal sensors <b>28</b> decrease, a lower flow rate can be desirable. The thermal sensors <b>28</b> can thus provide feedback which can be implemented in a control algorithm executed by the ECU <b>45</b> and/or control system <b>49</b> to automatically control the flow rates of irrigation fluid within catheters incorporating ablation electrode assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>.
