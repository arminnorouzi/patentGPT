In lighting applications, such as hazardous environments, reliability of the lighting system is vital. Unfortunately, the characteristics (e.g., humidity, extreme temperatures, corrosive gas) of many environments, including but not limited to hazardous environments, can cause the failure of one or more components of a light fixture to be accelerated. Further, the health and safety of a person located in such an environment can be at risk. When a light fixture is placed in certain environments, such as a hazardous environment, some of these components of a light fixture can pose a safety hazard and a violation of applicable standards if the components are not properly engineered and integrated with the rest of the light fixture.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A thermoplastic polymer must be able to withstand a variety of conditions, especially when utilized in outdoor products. Outdoor electrical products can be in service for 30 or more years and are consistently exposed to extremely harsh environments, such as temperatures ranging from &#x2212;50&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C., with constant exposure to ultraviolet radiation, rain, salt, fog, ozone, thermal cycling, corrosive chemicals, and the like.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a thermally conductive polymer luminaire generally comprises a polymer housing including at least one thermally conductive filler to configure the polymer housing as a thermally conductive polymer housing.

The luminaire has a compact design and is configured for use in hazardous locations. The luminaire <b>10</b> improves chemical resistance over traditional aluminum luminaires, while maintaining the ability to dissipate heat and endure impacts. Thus, the luminaire <b>10</b> is more lightweight, recyclable, a lower cost, and has a faster cycle time than traditional aluminum luminaires. Further, the luminaire <b>10</b> has a construction that maximizes thermal energy release to reduce a temperature within the luminaire. In particular, a housing <b>12</b> of the luminaire <b>10</b> is formed from a thermally conductive polymer and defines a plurality of heat dissipating fins <b>14</b> spaced along a length L (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) of the housing. Thus, the fins <b>14</b> are integrally formed with and define a portion of the housing <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the fins <b>14</b> extend along substantially the entire length L of the housing <b>12</b>. However, the fins <b>14</b> could have other arrangements without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Further, as will be explained in greater detail below, mounting locations of the heat generating components (e.g., electronics) in the housing <b>12</b> are selected to maximize the transfer of heat away from the luminaire <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A mounting fixture <b>16</b> is disposed on a top of the housing <b>12</b> for mounting the luminaire <b>10</b> in an installation position. For example, for mounting the luminaire <b>10</b> such that a longitudinal axis LA of the housing <b>12</b> is oriented generally horizontally. Still other installation positions are envisioned. The mounting fixture <b>16</b> includes threads <b>18</b> for mating with threaded mounting hardware to hang the fixture <b>10</b> from a pole or wall or the like. In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting fixture <b>16</b> is a pendant mount. However, other mounting fixtures are envisioned without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A cable feed-through fixture <b>20</b> extends longitudinally from the housing <b>12</b> and is configured to run electrical power lines into an interior of the housing though an opening <b>21</b> in the housing in an explosion-proof manner. A plug <b>23</b> closes an opening on an opposite end of the housing <b>12</b>. Alternatively, cable feed-through fixtures <b>20</b> may extend from both longitudinal ends of the housing <b>12</b> to run electrical power lines into the housing at one end and out of the housing at the other end. For example, electrical power lines can be run between two adjacent luminaires using the cable feed-through fixtures at their longitudinal ends. Electrical power lines may be run into the housing <b>12</b> in other ways without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>6</b></figref>, a cover plate or window <b>22</b> is mounted to a bottom of the housing <b>12</b>. Fasteners <b>24</b> secure the cover plate <b>22</b> to the housing <b>12</b>. Thus, the cover plate <b>22</b> is removeably attached to the housing <b>12</b>. The cover plate <b>22</b> may have any suitable construction. For example, the cover plate <b>22</b> may be flat or round or a combination of both. Additionally, at least a portion of the cover plate <b>22</b> may be transparent to permit light to pass. The cover plate <b>22</b> may also be formed from any suitable material. In one embodiment, the cover plate <b>22</b> is formed from a polycarbonate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the housing <b>12</b> comprises a conductive network made by incorporating different types of fillers into a polymer matrix in order to increase the thermal conductivity as well as the mechanical performance of the composite material. In this way, the mechanical performance of the polymer can be maintained without experiencing mechanical degradation as typically occurs when thermally conductive fillers are introduced. Different combinations of filler types can form the conductive network. In order to further improve the thermal conductivity and mechanical performance, nano-fillers can be used to enable formation of conductive networks at lower loadings. Nano-fillers can be provided in different shapes (e.g., spherical, platelet, and rod shape). Thus, the present disclosure generally uses certain nano-fillers, macro-fillers, and fibers in conjunction with a polymer or polymer blend (i.e., polymer matrix) to allow the thermally conductive material to survive in a variety of environments, including harsh and hazardous environments and outdoor, while reducing cost and maintaining desirable mechanical properties. In one embodiment, the housing <b>12</b> is formed by injection molding.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a thermally conductive polymer generally comprising a polymer matrix comprising a polymer or polymer blend, one or more fillers to improve thermal conductivity (thermally conductive filler), one or more fillers to improve tensile strength (tensile strength filler), and one or more fillers to improve impact strength (impact strength filler). Additional fillers can also be incorporated, such as electrically conductive fillers.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the thermally conductive polymer of the present disclosure has a thermal conductivity of at least about 0.5 W/m*K for example from about 0.5 W/m*K to about 20 W/m*K. For example, in-plane thermal conductivity can be from about 0.5 W/m*K to about 20 W/m*K and through-plane thermal conductivity can be from about 0.5 W/m*K to about 3 W/m*K. Further, the thermally conductive polymer has an impact strength of at least about 7 kJ/m<sup>2 </sup>for example from about 5 kJ/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 30 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>. The thermally conductive polymer also has a tensile strength of at least about 40 MPa, for example from about 40 MPa to about 90 MPa. In various embodiments, the thermally conductive polymer has a volume resistivity of at most about 10 &#x3a9;*cm for example from about 1 &#x3a9;*cm to about 10 &#x3a9;*cm.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The polymer matrix has a high resistance to chemicals and is able to withstand harsh and hazardous environments. In order to achieve ideal properties, a polymer blend may be preferred. Polymer choice can affect a variety of factors of the resulting thermoplastic, such as tensile strength, impact strength, chemical resistance, operating temperature, heat distortion temperature, and the like. Thus, blending different polymers with different desirable characteristics can provide a polymer matrix with a combination of those characteristics.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The polymer matrix can comprise a resin material. The polymer/resin can comprise a thermoplastic material or a thermoset material. In particular, useful polymers include thermoplastic polymers, for example, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, acrylic, celluloid, cellulose acetate, cyclic olefin copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl alcohol, polytetrafluoro ethylene, ionomers, liquid crystal polymer, polyoxymethylene, polyacrylates, polyacrylonitrile, polyamide (e.g., polyamide 66 or polyamide 6), polyamide-imide, polyimide, polyaryletherketone, polybutadiene, polybutylene terephthalate, polycarpolactone, polychlorotrifluoroetyhlene, polyether ether ketone, polyethylene terephthalate, poly-cylcohexylene dimethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyhydroxalkanoates, polyketones, polyester, polyolefin (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, and the like) polyetherketoneketone, polyetherimide, polyethersulfone, polysulfone, chlorinated polyethylene, polylactic acid, polymethylmetacrylate, polymethylpentene, polyphenylene, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polyphthalamide, polystyrene, polysulfone, polytrimethylene terephthalate, polyurethane, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, styrene-acrylonitrile, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In various embodiments, the base polymer comprises polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) blended with one or more additional polymers. Because PPS is known to create, in some circumstances, a brittle composite, a second polymer can be blended with PPS in order to improve impact properties. For example, PPS can be blended with an elastomer or a polyolefin (such as, for example, polyethylene and/or polypropylene) at relatively low concentrations. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the base polymer comprises a polyketone blended with one or more additional polymers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The thermally conductive filler can comprise any filler with thermal conductivity known in the art. The filler can have high thermal conductivity (for example, having a thermal conductivity of up to about 900 W/m*K or greater than about 10 W/m*K), an intermediate thermal conductivity (for example, having a thermal conductivity of from about 5 W/m*K to about 10 W/m*K), or a low thermal conductivity (less than about 5 W/m*K). Generally, high thermal conductivity and intermediate thermal conductivity fillers are preferred when used primarily as the thermally conductive filler. When used as the sole thermally conductive filler, high thermal conductivity fillers are most preferred, although intermediate thermal conductivity fillers could also be utilized.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As an example, the thermally conductive filler can comprise carbon black, alumina, boron nitride, silica, carbon fiber, graphene, graphene oxide, graphite (such as, for example, expanded graphite, synthesized graphite, low-temperature expanded graphite, and the like), aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, metal oxide (such as, for example, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, beryllium oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, yttrium oxide, and the like), carbon nanotubes, calcium carbonate, talc, mica, wollastonite, clays (including exfoliated clays), metal powders (such as, for example, aluminum, copper, bronze, brass, and the like), or mixtures thereof. For example, the thermally conductive filler can comprise boron nitride, carbon fiber, graphite, carbon nanotubes, or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the thermally conductive filler comprises chopped carbon fibers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The tensile strength filler can comprise, for example, a macro-size filler and/or a nano-size filler. For example, the macro-size tensile strength filler can comprise carbon fibers. The nano-size tensile strength filler can comprise nano-diamonds, carbon nanotubes, or mixtures thereof. The tensile strength of the filler can be from about 30 MPa to about 100 MPa.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A mixture of nano- and micro-fillers can significantly increase the impact strength of the composite. The nano-size impact strength filler can comprise, for example, carbon nanotubes, clays (including exfoliated clays), other high-aspect ratio fibers, rods, and flakes, spherical nano-particles (including, for example, nano-diamonds, fumed silica, nano-alumina, and fumed alumina), or mixtures thereof. The micro-size impact strength filler can comprise, for example, carbon fiber (for example, chopped carbon fiber, amorphous carbon fiber, long carbon fiber, and the like), alumina, or mixtures thereof. In various embodiments, the impact strength filler comprises chopped carbon fiber, spherical nano-particles, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It may also be desirable to incorporate an electrically conductive filler into the polymer matrix. Electrically conductive fillers include, but are not limited to, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, and mixtures thereof. Additional additives can be included to provide modified characteristics, such as UV stability, fire retardancy, heat stabilizers, antioxidants, dyes, pigments, mold release agents, lubricants, adhesion promoters, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>, electrical boards <b>30</b> are disposed within the housing <b>12</b> and mount at least some of the electrical components of the luminaire <b>10</b>.

In particular, the electrical boards <b>30</b> are canted or angled such that they are not oriented horizontally when the housing <b>12</b> is oriented horizontally. Rather, the electrical boards <b>30</b> are angled inward such that the LEDs <b>32</b> on the boards generally emit light downward and toward a central vertical plane P of the housing <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the electrical boards <b>30</b> are oriented such that an outer surface of the electrical boards defines a plane that extends at an angle of about 45 degrees to horizontal. In one embodiment, the electrical boards <b>30</b> are oriented such that the outer surface extends at an angle of between about 30 degrees and about 60 degrees to horizontal. Still other angle orientations of the electrical boards are envisioned.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">By positioning the electrical boards <b>30</b> in this manner, a width W (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the housing <b>12</b> can be reduced because the width of the housing does not have to accommodate for the total width of the electrical boards. Mounting the driver <b>40</b> above and generally between the electrical boards <b>30</b> also allows for the width W of the housing <b>12</b> to remain relatively small. A height H of the housing <b>12</b> is also reduced by the orientation of the components in the housing. In one embodiment, the length L of the housing <b>12</b> has a maximum length of about 40 in.

The clips <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B can be secured to the housing <b>12</b> by inserting fasteners <b>52</b> through the clips and into the housing <b>12</b>. For instance, when the housing <b>12</b> is oriented horizontally, the fasteners <b>52</b> may extend vertically through the clips <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B and into the housing to secure the clips to the housing. This is facilitated by the clips <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B having angled surfaces for engaging the electrical boards <b>30</b> and horizontal surfaces for receiving and locating the fasteners <b>52</b> on the clips. A first plurality of clips <b>50</b>A engage the electrical boards <b>30</b> generally at a bottom of the boards. The first plurality of clips <b>50</b>A have a first arm <b>54</b> configured to engage a bottom edge of the electrical board <b>30</b> and a second arm <b>56</b> extending transversely from the first arm and configured to engage an outer surface of the electrical board. More particularly, the outer surface of the electrical board <b>30</b> comprises the LED mounting surface of the board.
