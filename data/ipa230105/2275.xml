The carbon dioxide emissions from the production of concrete are so high that if concrete were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of CO<sub>2 </sub>behind China and the United States.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Concrete is the most widely used artificial material in existence and it currently accounts for about 8 percent of the carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere dwarfing, for example, the aviation industry's contribution of 2.5 percent. Concrete's contribution of CO<sub>2 </sub>is comparable to the entire agriculture industry, which is responsible for at least 8 percent of total carbon emissions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The central ingredient in concrete is cement, which is made by crushing limestone and clay and adding iron ore or ash. The mixture is heated in a kiln to more than 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit. When heated, the calcium carbonate in limestone breaks into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, which is released into the air. The calcium oxide is ground with limestone and gypsum to make cement. Half of the CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions in the production of concrete come from the reaction that breaks up the calcium carbonate and the other half from the fossil fuels required to heat the kilns and transport the materials.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By way of example, we can calculate the amount of carbon dioxide released in the production of one mile of a two-lane road that is 24 feet wide and 1 foot thick can be calculated by first calculating the volume of total concrete as 1&#xd7;24&#xd7;5,280=126,720 cubic feet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One cubic foot of concrete weighs 150 pounds, so the concrete in the two-lane road weighs 126,720&#xd7;150=19 million pounds.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, each pound of concrete releases 0.93 pounds of carbon dioxide during production. Therefore, the CO<sub>2 </sub>released in the construction of a single mile of a two-lane road is 0.93&#xd7;19 million=17.67 million pounds of carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need, therefore, for a method and system of producing concrete which reduces or eliminates the production of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For a more complete understanding of the present invention, and the advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows Table 1, wherein a control mixture of concrete is compared against a similar concrete wherein biochar has been used to replace a portion of the sand used in the control mix.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows Table 2, comparing the compressive strength of various formulations of the cementitious biochar material and a control mixture after a set drying period.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Biochar is a stable solid that is rich in carbon and can endure for thousands of years. Presently, Biochar is primarily used for its soil health benefits. Discussed herein is the use of biochar in cementitious mixtures, such as cement, plaster, stucco, and concrete to provide for improved, ecologically friendly, building materials.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Biochar is a high-carbon, fine to medium-grained residue formed via pyrolysis. Pyrolysis, or direct thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen (preventing combustion), produces a mixture of solids (the biochar proper), liquid (bio-oil), and gas (syngas) products. The specific yields from pyrolysis are dependent on process conditions, such as temperature, residence time, and heating rate. These parameters can be optimized to produce various properties in the biochar in addition to regulating the percentage of each solid, liquid, or gas phase that is created.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">When creating solid char from biomass, currently, the highest yield is attained when the temperatures are in the range of 400-500&#xb0; C. (673-773&#xb0; K). Pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures, typically requiring seconds rather than hours, but the increase in temperature decreases the yield of solid biochar. Therefore, a slow pyrolytic is generally better for the creation of biochar proper. Typical yields are roughly 35%.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition to the end cementitious product incorporating the biochar being carbon sequestering, it is contemplated that the process of making the biochar, may be improved to be more self-sustaining and carbon neutral.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Modern pyrolysis plants can be powered using the syngas created by the pyrolisation process and output 3-9 times the amount of energy required. As mentioned above, half of the CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions in the production of concrete come from the reaction that breaks up the calcium carbonate and the other half from the fossil fuels required to heat the kilns and transport the materials. Therefore, powering pyrolysis plants using the syngas created by the pyrolisation process can help serve to significantly reduce the amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions in the production of concrete.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As a person skilled in the art will be aware, the compositions of concrete and cement, as well as the relative amounts of their constituent components can vary significantly depending on the desired characteristics of the material.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In embodiments, the aggregate in a mixture may be eliminated to the extent that the resultant media is a carbon negative.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, see Table 1, wherein a control concrete design mix compared is to an embodiment of the design mix of the present invention. The mixture of that embodiment discussed in Table 1 comprises Portland cement, sand, biochar, aggregate, water, and two additives, all in the respective amounts shown in the table. Additive 1 may be, for example, silica fume and Additive 2 may be, for example, poly-fiber.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the biochar mixture shown in Table 1 uses 50% less sand, 25% less water, and sequesters 299% of the carbon dioxide as compared to the normal concrete control mix, C3. Accordingly, for every cubic yard of such an embodiment of biochar concrete used 18,342 pounds of CO2 is sequestered.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When referring to the amount of CO2 saved beyond the neutral point, this assumes that normal concrete, such as the C3 control, accounts for 8% of total global CO2 emissions as discussed above. In other words, implementation of this embodiment of the present invention in place of its traditional counterpart could negate not only that 8%, making the entire process carbon neutral, and but would work to offset a further &#x2dc;24% of the worldwide CO2 emissions, thereby accounting for a net reduction of emissions by approximately 32%, or roughly &#x2153; of global carbon emissions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be importantly noted that the addition of biochar to a concrete mixture need not reduce the compressive strength and may, in fact, result in a significant increase in compressive strength.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The strength of concrete can be determined experimentally by a test wherein a mixture is used to make two cylinders, the compressive strength of which are tested until failure after 7 and 28 days of drying, respectively. This tells you the relative compressive strength of the formulation's end product, and how that strength is affected by the drying process. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Table 2 a comparison of the compressive strength for a control mix without biochar compared to a number of similar mixtures comprising different amounts of biochar and other additives.
