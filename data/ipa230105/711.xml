id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus includes a drive mechanism, a patient support mechanism, and an electronic system. The drive mechanism is included in a trolley and is configured to suspend the trolley from a support track. The drive mechanism includes a first sensor configured to sense an operating condition of the drive mechanism. The patient support mechanism couples to the trolley and includes a tether and a second sensor. The tether can be operatively coupled to a patient such that the patient support mechanism supports the patient. The second sensor is configured to sense an operating condition of the patient support mechanism. The electronic system is included in the trolley and has at least a processor and a memory. The processor is configured to define a gait characteristic of the patient based at least in part on a signal received from the first sensor and a signal received from the second sensor.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="96.86mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230000712A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

More particularly, the embodiments described herein relate to apparatus and methods for supporting the body weight of a patient during gait therapy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Successfully delivering intensive yet safe gait therapy to individuals with significant walking deficits can present challenges to skilled therapists. In the acute stages of many neurological injuries such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or the like individuals often exhibit highly unstable walking patterns and poor endurance, making it difficult to safely practice gait for both the patient and therapist. Because of this, rehabilitation centers often move over-ground gait training to a treadmill where body-weight support systems can help minimize falls while raising the intensity of the training.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some instances, body-weight supported treadmill training can promote gains in walking ability similar to or greater than conventional gait training. Unfortunately, there are few systems for transitioning patients from training on a treadmill to safe, weight-supported over-ground gait training. Furthermore, since a primary goal of most individuals with walking impairments is to walk in their homes and in their communities rather than on a treadmill, it is often desirable that therapeutic interventions targeting gait involve over-ground gait training (e.g., not on a treadmill).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some known support systems involve training individuals with gait impairments over smooth, flat surfaces. In some systems, however, therapists may be significantly obstructed from interacting with the patient, particularly the lower legs of the patient. For patients that require partial assistance to stabilize their knees and/or hips or that need help to propel their legs, the systems present significant barriers between the patient and the therapist.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some known gait support systems are configured to provide static unloading to a patient supported by the system. That is, under static unloading, the length of shoulder straps that support the patient are set to a fixed length such that the patient either bears substantially all of their weight when the straps are slack or substantially no weight when the straps are taught. Static unloading systems have been shown to result in abnormal ground reaction forces and altered muscle activation patterns in the lower extremities. In addition, static unloading systems may limit the vertical excursions of a patient that prevent certain forms of balance and postural therapy where a large range of motion is necessary. As a result, some known systems may not be able to raise a patient from a wheelchair to a standing position, thereby restricting the use of the system to individuals who are not relegated to a wheelchair (e.g., those patients with minor to moderate gait impairments).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some known static support systems, there may be a limitation on the amount of body-weight support. In such a system, the body-weight support cannot be modulated continuously, but rather is adjusted before the training session begins and remains substantially fixed at that level during training. Furthermore, the amount of unloading cannot be adjusted continuously since it requires the operator to manually adjust the system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other known systems, a patient may be supported by a passive trolley and rail system configured to support the patient while the patient physically drags the trolley along the overhead rail during gait therapy. While the trolley may have a relatively small mass, the patient may feel the presence of the mass. Accordingly, rather than being able to focus on balance, posture, and walking ability, the patient may have to compensate for the dynamics of the trolley. For example, on a smooth flat surface, if the subject stops abruptly, the trolley may continue to move forward and potentially destabilize the subject, thereby resulting in an abnormal compensatory gait strategy that could persist when the subject is removed from the device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some known over-ground gait support systems include a motorized trolley and rail system. In such known systems, the motorized trolley can be relatively bulky, thereby placing height restrictions on system. For example, in some known systems, there may be a maximum suitable height for effective support of a patient. In some known systems, a minimum ceiling height may be needed for the system to provide support for patients of varying height.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">While the trolley is motorized and programmed to follow the subject's movement, the mechanics and overall system dynamics can result in significant delays in the response of the system such that the patient has the feeling that they are pulling a heavy, bulky trolley in order to move. Such system behavior may destabilize impaired patients during walking. Moreover, some known motorized systems include a large bundle of power cables and/or control cables to power and control the trolley. Such cable bundles present significant challenges in routing and management as well as reducing the travel of the trolley. For example, in some known systems, the cable bundle is arranged in a bellows configuration such that the cable bundle collapses as the trolley moves towards the power supply and expands as the trolley moves away from the power supply. In this manner, the travel of the trolley is limited by the space occupied by the collapsed cable bundle. In some instances, the bundle of cables can constitute a varying inertia that presents significant challenges in the performance of control systems and thus, reduces the efficacy of the overall motorized support system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, a need exists for improved apparatus and methods for supporting the body-weight of a patient during gate therapy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Apparatus and methods for supporting the body weight of a patient during gait therapy are described herein. In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a drive mechanism, a patient support mechanism, and an electronic system. The drive mechanism is included in a trolley and is configured to suspend the trolley from a support track. The drive mechanism includes a first sensor configured to sense an operating condition of the drive mechanism. The patient support mechanism couples to the trolley and includes a tether and a second sensor. The tether is configured to be operatively coupled to a patient such that the patient support mechanism supports at least a portion of a weight of the patient. The second sensor is configured to sense an operating condition of the patient support mechanism. The electronic system is included in the trolley and has at least a processor and a memory. The processor is configured to define a gait characteristic of the patient based at least in part on a signal received from the first sensor and a signal received from the second sensor.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

The first member of the coupling portion is moved relative to the second member of the coupling portion as the trolley portion is moved from the first position to the second position, thereby placing the coupling portion in the second configuration. The trolley portion and the coupling portion collectively limit movement of the patient support system towards the end portion of the support track when the coupling portion is in the second configuration.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a trolley, a patient attachment mechanism, and a tracking member.

The trolley can include a drive system, a control system, and a patient support system. The drive system is movably coupled to a support rail. At least a portion of the control system is physically and electrically coupled to the power rail. The patient support mechanism is at least temporarily coupled to the patient attachment mechanism. The control system can control at least a portion of the patient support mechanism based at least in part on a force applied to the patient attachment mechanism.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, a body weight support system includes a closed loop tack, a powered conductor coupled to the closed loop track, an actively controlled trolley, and a patient support assembly. The actively controlled trolley is movably suspended from the closed loop track and is electrically coupled to the powered conductor. The patient support assembly is coupled to the trolley and is configured to dynamically support a body weight of a patient.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, a body weight support device includes a housing, a drive element, a wheel assembly, and a patient support assembly. At least a portion of the drive element and at least portion of the wheel assembly is disposed within the housing. The patient support assembly is coupled to the drive element and is configured to dynamically support a body weight of a patient.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As used in this specification, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the term &#x201c;a member&#x201d; is intended to mean a single member or a combination of members, &#x201c;a material&#x201d; is intended to mean one or more materials, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; generally mean plus or minus 10% of the value stated. For example, about 0.5 would include 0.45 and 0.55, about 10 would include 9 to 11, about 1000 would include 900 to 1100.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein, the term &#x201c;set&#x201d; can refer to multiple features or a singular feature with multiple parts. For example, when referring to set of walls, the set of walls can be considered as one wall with multiple portions, or the set of walls can be considered as multiple, distinct walls. Thus, a monolithically constructed item can include a set of walls. Such a set of walls may include multiple portions that are either continuous or discontinuous from each other. For example, a monolithically constructed wall can include a set of detents can be said to form a set of walls. A set of walls can also be fabricated from multiple items that are produced separately and are later joined together (e.g., via a weld, an adhesive, or any suitable method).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As used herein, the term &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; generally describes a relationship between two geometric constructions (e.g., two lines, two planes, a line and a plane or the like) in which the two geometric constructions are substantially non-intersecting as they extend substantially to infinity. For example, as used herein, a line is said to be parallel to another line when the lines do not intersect as they extend to infinity. Similarly, when a planar surface (i.e., a two-dimensional surface) is said to be parallel to a line, every point along the line is spaced apart from the nearest portion of the surface by a substantially equal distance. Two geometric constructions are described herein as being &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially parallel&#x201d; to each other when they are nominally parallel to each other, such as for example, when they are parallel to each other within a tolerance. Such tolerances can include, for example, manufacturing tolerances, measurement tolerances or the like.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tension&#x201d; is related to the internal forces (i.e., stress) within an object in response to an external force pulling the object in an axial direction. For example, an object with a mass being hung from a rope at one end and fixedly attached to a support at the other end exerts a force to place the rope in tension. The stress within an object in tension can be characterized in terms of the cross-sectional area of the object. For example, less stress is applied to an object having a cross-sectional area greater than another object having a smaller cross-sectional area. The maximum stress exerted on an object in tension prior to plastic deformation (e.g., permanent deformation such as, for example, necking and/or the like) is characterized by the object's tensile strength. The tensile strength is an intensive property of (i.e., is intrinsic to) the constituent material. Thus, the maximum amount of stress of an object in tension can be increased or decreased by forming the object from a material with a greater tensile strength or lesser tensile strength, respectively.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, the term &#x201c;kinematics&#x201d; describes the motion of a point, object, or system of objects without considering a cause of the motion. For example, the kinematics of an object can describe a translational motion, a rotational motion, or a combination of both translational motion and rotational motion. When considering the kinematics of a system of objects, known mathematical equations can be used to describe to the motion of an object relative to a plane or set of planes, an axis or set of axes, and/or relative to one or more other objects included in the system of objects.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;feedback&#x201d;, &#x201c;feedback system&#x201d;, and/or &#x201c;feedback loop&#x201d; relate to a system wherein past or present characteristics influence current or future actions. For example, a thermostat is said to be a feedback system wherein the state of the thermostat (e.g., in an &#x201c;on&#x201d; configuration or an &#x201c;off&#x201d; configuration) is dependent on a temperature being fed back to the thermostat. Feedback systems can include a control scheme such as, for example, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Expanding further, an output of some feedback systems can be described mathematically by the sum of a proportional term, an integral term, and a derivative term. PID controllers are often implemented in one or more electronic devices. In such controllers, the proportional term, the integral term, and/or the derivative term can be actively &#x201c;tuned&#x201d; to alter characteristics of the feedback system.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Electronic devices often implement feedback systems to actively control the kinematics of mechanical systems in order to achieve and/or maintain a desired system state. For example, a feedback system can be implemented to control a force within a system (e.g., a mass-spring system and/or the like) by changing the kinematics and/or the position of one or more components relative to any other components included in the system. Expanding further, the feedback system can determine current and/or past states (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration, force, torque, tension, electrical power, etc.) of one or more components included in the mechanical system and return the past and/or current state values to, for example, a PID control scheme. In some instances, an electronic device can implement any suitable numerical method or any combination thereof (e.g., Newton's method, Gaussian elimination, Euler's method, LU decomposition, etc.). Thus, based on the past and/or current state of the one or more components, the mechanical system can be actively changed to achieve a desired system state.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a body weight support system <b>1000</b> according to an embodiment. The body weight support system <b>1000</b> (also referred to herein as &#x201c;support system&#x201d;) includes at least a trolley <b>1100</b>, a patient attachment mechanism <b>1800</b> (also referred to herein as &#x201c;attachment mechanism&#x201d;), a power supply <b>1610</b>, a powered conductor or rail <b>1620</b>, and a control <b>1900</b>. The support system <b>1000</b> can be used, for example, in intensive gait therapy to support patients with walking deficiencies brought on by neurological injuries such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or the like. In such instances, the support system <b>1000</b> can be used to support at least a portion of the patient's body weight to facilitate the gait therapy. In other instances, the support system <b>1000</b> can be used to simulate, for example, low gravity scenarios for the training of astronauts or the like. In some embodiments, the support system <b>1000</b> can be used to support a patient over a treadmill or stairs instead of or in addition to supporting a patient over and across level ground.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The trolley <b>1100</b> included in the support system <b>1000</b> can be any suitable shape, size, or configuration and can include one or more systems, mechanisms, assemblies, or subassemblies (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that can perform any suitable function associated with, for example, supporting at least a portion of the body weight of a patient. The trolley <b>1100</b> can include at least a drive system <b>1300</b>, a patient support mechanism <b>1500</b>, and an electronic system <b>1700</b>. In some embodiments, the drive system <b>1300</b> can be movably coupled to a support track (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and configured to move (e.g., slide, roll, or otherwise advance) along a length of the support track. The support track can be any suitable shape, size, or configuration. For example, in some embodiments, the support track can be substantially linear or curvilinear. In other embodiments, the support track can be a closed loop such as, for example, circular, oval, oblong, rectangular (e.g., with or without rounded corners), or any other suitable shape. In some embodiments, the support track can be a beam (e.g., an I-beam or the like) included in a roof or ceiling structure from which at least a portion of the trolley <b>1100</b> can &#x201c;hang&#x201d; (e.g., at least a portion of the trolley <b>1100</b> can extend away from the beam). In other embodiments, at least one end portion of the support track can be coupled to a vertical wall or the like. In still other embodiments, the support track can be included in a freestanding structure such as, for example, a gantry or an A-frame.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The drive system <b>1300</b> of the trolley <b>1100</b> can include one or more wheels configured to roll along a surface of the support track such that the weight of the trolley <b>1100</b> and a portion of the weight of a patient utilizing the support system <b>1000</b> (e.g., the patient is temporarily coupled to the trolley <b>1100</b> via the patient attachment mechanism <b>1800</b>, as described in further detail herein) are supported by the support track. Similarly stated, one or more wheels of the drive system <b>1300</b> can be disposed adjacent to and on top of a horizontal surface of the support track; thus, the trolley <b>1100</b> can be &#x201c;hung&#x201d; from or suspended from the support track. In other embodiments, the surface from which the trolley <b>1100</b> is hung need not be horizontal. For example, at least a portion of the support track can define a decline (and/or an incline) wherein a first end portion of the support track is disposed at a first height and a second end portion of the support track is disposed at a second height, different from the first height. In such embodiments, the trolley <b>1100</b> can be hung from a surface of the support track that is parallel to a longitudinal centerline (not shown) of the trolley <b>1100</b>. In such embodiments, the trolley can be used to support a patient moving across an inclined/declined surface, up or down stairs, etc.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the trolley <b>1100</b> can have or define a relatively small profile (e.g., height) such that the space between a surface of the trolley <b>1100</b> and a portion of the patient can be sufficiently large to allow the patient to move between a seated position to a standing position such as, for example, when a patient rises out of a wheelchair. Furthermore, with the trolley <b>1100</b> being hung from the support track, the weight of the trolley <b>1100</b> and the weight of the patient utilizing the support system can increase the friction (e.g., traction) between the one or more wheels of the drive system and the surface of the support track from which the trolley <b>1100</b> is hung. Thus, the one or more wheels of the drive system <b>1300</b> can roll along the surface of the support track without substantially slipping.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the trolley <b>1100</b> can be motorized. For example, in some embodiments, the trolley <b>1100</b> can include one or more motors configured to power (e.g., drive, rotate, spin, engage, activate, etc.) the drive system <b>1300</b>. In some embodiments, the motor(s) can be configured to rotate the wheels of the drive system <b>1300</b> at any suitable rate and/or any suitable direction (e.g., forward or reverse) such that the trolley <b>1100</b> can pace a patient utilizing the support system <b>1000</b>, as described in further detail herein. In some embodiments, the electronic system <b>1700</b> and/or the control <b>1900</b> can be operatively coupled (e.g., electrically connected) to the one or more motors such that the electronic system <b>1700</b> and/or the control <b>1900</b> can send an electronic signal associated with operating the motor(s). In some embodiments, the motor(s) can include a clutch, a brake, or the like configured to substantially lock the motor(s) in response to a power failure or the like. Similarly stated, the motor(s) can be placed in a locked configuration to limit movement of the trolley <b>1100</b> (e.g., limit movement of the drive system <b>1300</b> and/or the patient support mechanism <b>1500</b>) in response to a power failure (e.g., a partial power failure and/or a total power failure).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The patient support mechanism <b>1500</b> (also referred to herein as &#x201c;support mechanism&#x201d;) can be any suitable configuration and can be at least temporarily coupled to the attachment mechanism <b>1800</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the support mechanism <b>1500</b> can include a tether that can be temporarily coupled to a coupling portion of the attachment mechanism <b>1800</b>. Moreover, the attachment mechanism <b>1800</b> can further include a patient coupling portion (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) configured to receive a portion of a harness or the like worn by or coupled to the patient. Thus, the attachment mechanism <b>1800</b> and the support mechanism <b>1500</b> can support a portion of the body weight of a patient and temporarily couple the patient to the trolley <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, an end portion of the tether can be coupled to, for example, a winch. In such embodiments, the winch can include a motor that can rotate a drum to coil or uncoil the tether. Similarly stated, the tether can be wrapped around the drum and the motor can rotate the drum in a first direction to wrap more of the tether around the drum and can rotate the drum in a second direction, opposite the first direction, to unwrap more of the tether from around the drum. In some embodiments, the support mechanism <b>1500</b> can include one or more pulleys that can engage the tether such that the support mechanism <b>1500</b> gains a mechanical advantage. Similarly stated, the pulleys can be arranged such that the force exerted by the winch to coil or uncoil the tether around the drum while a patient is coupled to the attachment mechanism <b>1800</b> is reduced.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The horizontal drive system/motor that is configured to allow for movement of the trolley along the track, and the vertical drive system configured to move to control the tether can be simultaneously controlled and operated or not. For example, when a patient is walking over a treadmill, there is little or no horizontal movement, but the vertical (weight bearing) drive system is operational to compensate for the changes during the gait, falls, etc.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the pulley system can include at least one pulley that is configured to move (e.g., pivot, translate, swing, or the like). For example, the pulley can be included in or coupled to a cam mechanism (not shown) that is configured to define a range of motion of the pulley. In such embodiments, the movement of the at least one pulley can coincide and/or be caused by a force exerted on the attachment mechanism <b>1800</b>. For example, in some instances, the patient can move relative to the trolley <b>1100</b> such that the force exerted on the tether by the weight of the patient is changed (e.g., increased or decreased). In such instances, the pulley can be moved according to the change in the force such that the tension within the tether is substantially unchanged. Moreover, with the pulley included in or coupled to the cam mechanism, the movement of the pulley can move the cam through a predetermined range of motion. In some embodiments, the electronic system <b>1700</b> can include a sensor or encoder operatively coupled to the pulley and/or the cam that is configured to determine the amount of movement of the pulley and/or the cam. In this manner, the electronic system <b>1700</b> can send a signal to the motor included in the winch associated with coiling or uncoiling the tether around the drum in accordance with the movement of the pulley. For example, the pulley can be moved in a first direction in response to an increase in force exerted on the tether and the electronic system <b>1700</b> can send a signal to the motor of the winch associated with rotating the drum to uncoil a portion of the tether from the drum. Conversely, the pulley can be moved in a second direction, opposite the first direction, in response to a decrease in force exerted on the tether and the electronic system <b>1700</b> can send a signal to the motor of the winch associated with rotating the drum to coil a portion of the tether about the drum. Thus, the support mechanism <b>1500</b> can be configured to exert a reaction force in response to the force exerted by the patient such that the portion of the body weight supported by the support system <b>1000</b> remains substantially unchanged.

As described above, the symmetry of the first drive assembly <b>2310</b> is such that the drive wheel assemblies are the same. Thus, a discussion of the drive wheel assembly <b>2370</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> applies to both drive wheel assemblies <b>2370</b>. The drive wheel assembly <b>2370</b> includes a drive shaft <b>2371</b>, the drive bearing <b>2376</b>, the support bearing <b>2377</b>, a drive sprocket <b>2379</b>, a transfer sprocket <b>2381</b>, a drive wheel <b>2385</b>, the transfer axle <b>2388</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>), and a drive belt <b>2389</b>. The drive shaft <b>2371</b> has a first portion <b>2372</b>, a second portion <b>2373</b>, and a third portion <b>2374</b> and defines an opening <b>2375</b>. The first portion <b>2372</b> has a first diameter that is at least partially associated with the drive sprocket <b>2378</b>. Expanding further, the drive sprocket <b>2378</b> defines an opening <b>2380</b> that has a diameter that is associated with the diameter of the first portion <b>2372</b> of the drive shaft <b>2371</b>. In this manner, the drive sprocket <b>2378</b> is disposed about the first portion <b>2372</b> of the drive shaft <b>2371</b> such that a surface of the drive sprocket <b>2378</b> defining the opening <b>2380</b> forms a friction fit with an outer surface of the first portion <b>2372</b> of the drive shaft <b>2371</b>.

In this manner, the rotation of the drive sprocket <b>2378</b> (described above) rotates the belt <b>2389</b>, which, in turn, rotates the transfer sprocket <b>2381</b>. The transfer sprocket <b>2381</b> defines an opening <b>2383</b> configured to receive the transfer axle <b>2388</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). More specifically, the transfer axle <b>2388</b> can be fixedly coupled to the transfer sprockets <b>2381</b> of each drive wheel assembly <b>2370</b> such that a rotation of the transfer sprocket <b>2381</b> of the first drive wheel assembly <b>2370</b> (e.g., the drive wheel assembly <b>2370</b> coupled to the output shaft <b>2312</b> of the motor <b>2311</b>) rotates the transfer sprocket <b>2381</b> of the second drive wheel assembly <b>2370</b>. Thus, when the motor <b>2311</b> is activated to rotate the output shaft <b>2312</b>, both the drive wheels <b>2385</b> of both the drive wheel assemblies <b>2370</b> are urged to rotate.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, the side members <b>2320</b> and the base <b>2340</b> of the support structure <b>2315</b> can be arranged such that the spring <b>2324</b> of the side members <b>2320</b> is in a preloaded configuration (e.g., partially compressed without an additional external force being applied to one or both of the side members <b>2320</b>).

In this manner, the spring <b>2394</b> can exert a force on the engagement portion <b>2396</b> to pivot the lever arm <b>2391</b> about the pivot portion <b>2395</b>. Expanding further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b></figref>, the force exerted by the spring <b>2394</b> can pivot the lever arm <b>2391</b> such that the secondary wheel <b>2393</b> is pivoted towards the drive wheel <b>2385</b>.

The spacer <b>2576</b> can be formed from a material having a relatively low friction coefficient such as, for example, polyethylene, nylon, or the like to allow the cam <b>2580</b> to move relatively easily along a surface of the spacer <b>2576</b>. In this manner, the cam <b>2580</b> is spaced a sufficient distance from the second side <b>2212</b> of the base <b>2210</b> to allow a portion of the bias mechanism <b>2588</b> to be disposed therebetween, as described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The cam <b>2580</b> of the cam assembly <b>2570</b> defines an opening <b>2581</b>, and includes a mounting portion <b>2582</b> and an engagement surface <b>2583</b>. The engagement surface <b>2583</b> of the cam <b>2580</b> is in contact with a portion of the bias mechanism <b>2588</b>, as described in further detail herein. The opening <b>2581</b> defined by the cam <b>2580</b> receives a bearing <b>2584</b>. When disposed within the opening <b>2581</b>, the bearing <b>2584</b> allows the cam <b>2580</b> to rotate about the cam axle <b>2575</b>. The mounting portion <b>2582</b> of the cam <b>2580</b> is at least partially disposed within the cam pulley opening <b>2219</b> and is coupled to the cam pulley <b>2572</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, the mounting portion <b>2582</b> is a threaded rod extending from a surface of the cam <b>2580</b> that can be received by a threaded opening (not shown) defined by the cam pulley <b>2572</b>. In this manner, movement of the cam pulley assembly <b>2571</b>, in response to a change in force exerted on the tether <b>2505</b> (e.g., an increase or a decrease of force), rotates the cam <b>2580</b> about the cam axle <b>2575</b> (as described above).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The coupler housing <b>2586</b> is coupled to a surface of the cam <b>2580</b> that is opposite the side adjacent to the spacer <b>2576</b>. In other words, the coupler housing <b>2586</b> extends away from the base <b>2210</b> when coupled to the cam <b>2580</b>. The coupler housing <b>2586</b> is further coupled to the encoder <b>2587</b>. Thus, when the cam <b>2580</b> is rotated about the cam axle <b>2575</b>, the coupler housing <b>2586</b> and the encoder <b>2587</b> are also rotated about the cam axle <b>2575</b>. The coupler <b>2585</b> is disposed within the coupler housing <b>2586</b> and is coupled to both the cam axle <b>2575</b> and an input portion (not shown) of the encoder <b>2575</b>. Therefore, with the coupler <b>2585</b> coupled the to the cam axle <b>2575</b> and the input portion of the encoder <b>2587</b>, the rotation of the cam <b>2580</b> and the coupler housing <b>2586</b> rotates the encoder <b>2587</b> about its input portion. In this manner, the encoder <b>2587</b> can receive and/or determine information associated with the pivoting motion of the cam <b>2580</b> and/or the cam pulley assembly <b>2571</b> relative to the cam axle <b>2575</b>. For example, the encoder <b>2587</b> can determine position, rotational velocity, rotational acceleration, feed rate of the tether <b>2505</b>, or the like. Furthermore, the encoder <b>2587</b> can be in electrical communication (e.g., via a wired communication or a wireless communication) with a portion of the electronic system <b>2700</b> and can send information associated with the cam mechanism <b>2570</b> to the portion of the electronic system <b>2700</b>. Upon receiving the information from the encoder <b>2587</b>, a portion of the electronic system <b>2700</b> can send a signal to any other suitable system associated with performing an action (e.g., increasing or decreasing the power of one or more motors <b>2311</b> and <b>2511</b>, changing the direction of one or more of the motors <b>2311</b> and <b>2511</b>, or the like).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The bias mechanism <b>2588</b> includes an axle <b>2589</b>, a mounting flange <b>2590</b>, a first pivot arm <b>2591</b>, a second pivot arm <b>2595</b>, a guide member <b>2596</b>, a bias member <b>2597</b>, and a mounting post <b>2598</b>.

In this manner, the surface of the second pivot arm <b>2591</b> is offset from the second side <b>2212</b> of the base <b>2210</b>. Moreover, the arrangement of the spacer <b>2576</b> (described above) is such that when the axle <b>2589</b> is disposed within the axle opening <b>2592</b>, a second surface of the first pivot arm <b>2591</b> is offset from a surface of the cam <b>2580</b>. Thus, the first pivot arm <b>2591</b> can pivot relative to the base <b>2210</b> with a relatively low amount of friction. In some embodiments, at least the portion of the mounting flange <b>2590</b> that extends through the bias mechanism opening <b>2217</b> can be made from a material having a relatively low coefficient of friction such as, for example, polyethylene, nylon, or the like.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The first pivot arm <b>2591</b> defines the axle opening <b>2592</b> and a guide member opening <b>2593</b>, and includes an engagement member <b>2594</b>.

In some embodiments, the guide member <b>2596</b> can include a sleeve or the like configured to engage the base <b>2210</b>. In such embodiments, the sleeve can be formed from a material having a relatively low friction coefficient such as, for example, polyethylene, nylon, or the like. Thus, the guide member <b>2596</b> can move within the guide member track <b>2218</b> when the first pivot arm <b>2591</b> is moved relative to the base <b>2210</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The engagement member <b>2594</b> of the first pivot arm <b>2591</b> extends from a surface of the first pivot arm <b>2591</b> toward the cam <b>2580</b>.

In some embodiments, the engagement member <b>2594</b> can be rotatably coupled to the first pivot arm <b>2591</b> and can be configured to roll along the engagement surface <b>2583</b>. In other embodiments, the engagement member <b>2594</b> and/or the engagement surface <b>2583</b> can be formed from a material having a relatively low friction coefficient. In such embodiments, the engagement member <b>2594</b> can be slid along the engagement surface <b>2583</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The second pivot arm <b>2595</b> of the bias mechanism <b>2588</b> has a first end portion that is fixedly coupled to the axle <b>2589</b> and a second end portion that is coupled to a first end portion of the bias member <b>2597</b>. The mounting post <b>2598</b> is fixedly coupled to the base <b>2210</b> and is further coupled to a second end portion of the bias member <b>2597</b>. Therefore, the second pivot arm <b>2595</b> can pivot relative to the mounting flange <b>2590</b> between a first position, where the bias member <b>2597</b> is in a first configuration (undeformed configuration), and a second position, where the bias member <b>2597</b> is in a second configuration (deformed configuration). For example, in some embodiments, the bias member <b>2597</b> can be a spring that can be moved between an uncompressed configuration (e.g., the first configuration) and a compressed configuration (e.g., the second configuration). In other embodiments, the bias member <b>2597</b> can be a spring that can be moved between an unexpanded and an expanded configuration. In other words, the bias member <b>2597</b> can be either a compression spring or an expansion spring, respectively.

More specifically, with the engagement member <b>2594</b> in contact with the engagement surface <b>2583</b> of the cam <b>2580</b>, the bias member <b>2587</b> exerts the reaction force that resists the movement of the engagement member <b>2594</b> along the engagement surface <b>2583</b>. Therefore, in some instances, relatively small changes in the force exerted on the tether <b>2505</b> may not be sufficiently large to rotate the cam <b>2580</b> and the cam pulley assembly <b>2571</b>.

The guide wheels <b>3913</b> are arranged in a perpendicular orientation relative to the drive wheels <b>3912</b> and are configured to roll along a vertical portion of the support track (e.g., as similarly described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The second side assembly <b>3921</b> includes a set of drive wheels <b>3922</b>, a set of guide wheels <b>3923</b>, an outer wall <b>3924</b>, an inner wall <b>3925</b>, and a set of couplers <b>3916</b>. The first side assembly <b>3911</b> and the second side assembly <b>3921</b> are substantially the same and arranged in a mirrored configuration.

In some embodiments, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> can be coupled to the first support member <b>5100</b> or the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> includes a coupling portion <b>5090</b> that is coupled to the first support member <b>5100</b> and a trolley portion <b>5085</b> that is movably disposed about the support track <b>5050</b>.

More specifically, in some instances, a force can be exerted that can move the trolley portion <b>5085</b> along the support track <b>5085</b> to place the bumpers <b>5087</b> in contact with an object (e.g., the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;). The arrangement of the bumpers <b>5087</b> can be such that when the bumpers are placed in contact with the object, at least a portion of the force exerted to move the trolley portion <b>5085</b> along the support track <b>5050</b> is absorbed by the bumpers <b>5087</b>, resulting in a deformation (e.g., an elastic or non-permanent deformation) thereof. In some instances, the deformation of the bumpers <b>5087</b> can be such that a portion of the force transmitted through the bumpers <b>5087</b> and onto the object (e.g., the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;) is reduced, which can reduce damage to and/or fatigue of a portion of the object. Similarly stated, the bumpers <b>5087</b> can be formed from and/or can otherwise include a material that can absorb at least a portion of an impact force between the trolley portion <b>5085</b> and an object (e.g., a wall, a support member, and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">As described above, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> is coupled to a portion of the first support member <b>5100</b>. More particularly, a first end portion <b>5092</b> of the coupling portion <b>5090</b> is rotatably coupled to the portion of the first support member <b>5100</b>. For example, the first end portion <b>5092</b> can include a rotatable eyelet or the like that can be coupled to the portion of the first support member <b>5100</b> via, for example, a bolt, pin, post, and/or the like, thereby defining an axis about which the first eyelet can rotate. Similarly, a second end portion <b>5094</b> of the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be rotatably coupled to a portion of the trolley portion <b>5085</b>. Thus, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can couple or otherwise form a linkage between the first support member <b>5100</b> and the trolley portion <b>5085</b> such that movement of the first support member <b>5100</b> along the support track <b>5050</b> moves the trolley portion <b>5085</b> along the support track <b>5050</b>. For example, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be configured to transmit, transfer, and/or otherwise exert at least a portion of a force, associated with movement of the first support member <b>5100</b> along the support track <b>5050</b>, on the trolley portion <b>5085</b>. Moreover, the rotatable coupling of the coupling portion <b>5090</b> to the first support member <b>5100</b> and the trolley portion <b>5085</b> can be such that the first support member <b>5100</b> can push the trolley portion <b>5085</b> along a support track that is substantially nonlinear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">The coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be any suitable member, device, and/or mechanism. For example, in some embodiments, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be a substantially rigid rod or the like that is configured to maintain a substantially fixed distance between the trolley portion <b>5085</b> and the first support member <b>5100</b>. In other embodiments, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be substantially non-rigid wherein a distance between the first support member <b>5100</b> and the trolley portion <b>5085</b> can be varied (i.e., non-fixed). For example, in some embodiments, a first portion <b>5091</b> of the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be configured to move relative to a second portion <b>5092</b> of the coupling portion <b>5090</b>. Moreover, in some embodiments, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be configured to absorb at least a portion of a force (associated with movement of the first support member <b>5100</b> along the support track <b>5050</b>) that would otherwise be exerted on the trolley portion <b>5085</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>-<b>40</b></figref>, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be a piston-cylinder configuration, wherein a region of the first portion <b>5091</b> (e.g., a piston) is movably disposed in the second portion <b>5093</b> (e.g., a cylinder). Furthermore, an energy storage member <b>5095</b> (e.g., a spring or the like) can be disposed in the second portion <b>5093</b> of the coupling portion <b>5090</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>. In this manner, movement of the first portion <b>5091</b> relative to the second portion <b>5093</b> can increase a potential energy of the energy storage member <b>5095</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the energy storage member <b>5095</b> can be a spring that can be transitioned from a substantially non-compressed configuration (i.e., a relatively lower potential energy) to a substantially compressed configuration (i.e., a relatively higher potential energy) when the first portion <b>5091</b> is moved relative to the second portion <b>5093</b>. The energy storage member <b>5095</b> can be configured to allow the first portion <b>5091</b> to move relative to the second portion <b>5093</b>, for example, up to about 0.5 inches (0.5&#x2033;), about 1&#x2033;, about 1.5&#x2033;, about 2&#x2033;, about 2.5&#x2033;, about 3&#x2033;, about 4&#x2033;, about 5&#x2033;, about 7&#x2033;, about 10&#x2033;, or any suitable distance or fraction therebetween. Thus, the coupling portion <b>5090</b> can be configured to absorb at least a portion of energy and/or force that would otherwise be transferred and/or transmitted between the first support member <b>5100</b> and the trolley portion <b>5085</b>. Although the energy storage member <b>5095</b> is shown and described as being a spring, in other embodiments, the energy storage member <b>5095</b> can be any suitable device, member, and/or volume such as, for example, a volume of a compressible gas and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">In use, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> can be included in the support system <b>5000</b> to substantially prevent a collision between the first support member <b>5100</b> and the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>). Similarly stated, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> can be included in the support system to substantially prevent direct contact between the first support member <b>5100</b> and the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;. For example, in some instances, it can be desirable to maintain a distance between the first support member <b>5100</b> and the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; that is greater than a predetermined minimum distance and/or a distance threshold. In this manner, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> can be coupled to the first support member <b>5100</b> such that when the first support member <b>5100</b> and the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; move along the support track <b>5050</b> substantially independent from one another, a distance therebetween is maintained that is greater than the predetermined minimum distance and/or distances threshold. For example, in some instances, the first support member <b>5100</b> can move relative to the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; such that a distance therebetween is reduced to an extent that places the bumpers <b>5087</b> of the trolley portion <b>5085</b> in contact with a portion of the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;. Thus, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> can maintain the first support member <b>5100</b> and the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; at a distance that is greater than the minimal distance, thereby preventing direct contact (i.e., a direct collision) therebetween. Moreover, the arrangement of the bumpers <b>5087</b> and the coupling portion <b>5090</b> is such that as the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> is brought into contact with the portion of the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; at least a portion of a force associated with the impact is absorbed (e.g., the bumpers <b>5087</b> can be transitioned from a non-deformed to a deformed configuration and/or the energy storage member <b>5095</b> can be transitioned from a lower potential energy configuration to a higher potential energy configuration). In this manner, an acceleration and/or a jerk (e.g., the rate of change in the acceleration) of the first support member <b>5100</b> and/or the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; is not rapidly changed as the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> is brought into contact with the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;. In some instances, once the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> is placed in contact with the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;, the first support member <b>5100</b> and the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; can move along the support track <b>5050</b> substantially congruently. In other words, when the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> is placed in contact with the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> can push the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032; such that the first support member <b>5100</b>, the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;, and the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> collectively move along the support track <b>5050</b> at substantially the same speed.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">In some embodiments, the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> and/or a portion of the support members <b>5100</b> and/or <b>5100</b>&#x2032; can include, for example, one or more sensors or the like that can sense and/or detect one or more parameters associated with the collision management assembly <b>5080</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the trolley portion <b>5085</b> of the collision management assembly <b>5080</b> can include a sensor such as, for example, an accelerometer or the like that can sense and/or otherwise detect and acceleration of the trolley portion <b>5085</b> when the bumper <b>5087</b> is placed in contact with the second support member <b>5100</b>&#x2032;. In some instances, the sensor can send a signal associated with the acceleration of the trolley portion <b>5085</b> to, for example, the electronic system of the first support member <b>5100</b>.

In some embodiments, such a support track can include, for example, an end stop or the like that can be configured to substantially limit movement of a support member, support system, trolley, etc., prior to reaching the end of the support track.

The arrangement of the bumper <b>7067</b> can be such that when placed in contact with, for example, a support member, at least a portion of the force exerted to move the support member along the support track <b>7050</b> is absorbed by the bumper <b>7067</b>, resulting in a deformation (e.g., an elastic or non-permanent deformation) thereof, which can reduce damage to and/or fatigue of a portion of the support member, as described in detail above.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">The coupling portion <b>7070</b> is coupled to the end portion of the support track <b>750</b> and a portion of the trolley portion <b>7065</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>. More particularly, a mounting bracket <b>7075</b> is coupled to the end portion of the support track <b>7050</b> and is configured to couple and/or otherwise mount the coupling portion <b>7070</b> to the support track <b>7050</b>. The coupling portion <b>7070</b> can be any suitable member, device, and/or mechanism. For example, in some embodiments, the coupling portion <b>7070</b> can be a piston-cylinder device, a strut, and/or the like. As such, the coupling portion <b>7070</b> includes a first member <b>7071</b> (e.g., a piston) that can be moved relative to a second member <b>7073</b> (e.g., a cylinder). For example, at least a portion of the first member <b>7071</b> can be movably disposed in the second member <b>7073</b>. More particularly, an attachment member <b>7072</b> of the first member <b>7071</b> is rotatably coupled to the trolley portion <b>7065</b> (as described above) and in turn, the first member <b>7071</b> is configured to move substantially concurrently with the trolley portion <b>7065</b>. Similarly stated, the attachment member <b>7072</b> rotatably couples the first member <b>7071</b> to the trolley portion <b>7065</b> such that as the trolley portion <b>7065</b> is moved along the support track <b>7050</b>, the first member <b>7071</b> is moved in an axial direction. The second member <b>7073</b> of the coupling portion <b>7070</b> is fixedly coupled to the mounting bracket <b>7075</b>, which is configured to maintain the second portion <b>7073</b> in a substantially fixed position relative to the support track <b>7050</b>. Thus, movement of the trolley portion <b>7065</b> along the support track <b>7050</b> moves the first member <b>7071</b> of the coupling portion <b>7070</b> relative to the second member <b>7073</b>, as described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>, an energy storage member <b>7074</b> (e.g., a spring or the like) is disposed in the second portion <b>7093</b> of the coupling portion <b>7070</b> and is configured to engage and/or be in contact with at least a surface of the first member <b>7071</b>. In this manner, movement of the first member <b>7071</b> relative to the second member <b>7073</b> can increase a potential energy of the energy storage member <b>7074</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the energy storage member <b>7074</b> can be a spring (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>) that can be transitioned from a substantially non-compressed configuration (i.e., a relatively lower potential energy) to a substantially compressed configuration (i.e., a relatively higher potential energy) when the first member <b>7071</b> is moved relative to the second member <b>7073</b>. The energy storage member <b>7074</b> can be configured to allow the first member <b>7071</b> to move relative to the second member <b>7073</b>, for example, up to about 0.5 inches (0.5&#x2033;), about 1&#x2033;, about 1.5&#x2033;, about 2&#x2033;, about 2.5&#x2033;, about 3&#x2033;, about 4&#x2033;, about 5&#x2033;, about 7&#x2033;, about 10&#x2033;, or any suitable distance or fraction therebetween. Thus, the coupling portion <b>7070</b> can be configured to absorb at least a portion of energy and/or force, as described in further detail herein. Although the energy storage member <b>7074</b> is shown and described as being a spring, in other embodiments, the energy storage member <b>7074</b> can be any suitable device, member, and/or volume such as, for example, a volume of a compressible gas and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">In use, the track stop <b>7060</b> can be included in the support system <b>7000</b> to substantially prevent a support member and/or trolley (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>43</b> and <b>44</b></figref>) from reaching an end of a support track <b>7050</b> when moving along a length thereof. For example, a support member can move along the support track <b>7050</b> and towards the end portion to a position in which a portion of the support member is placed in contact with the bumper <b>7067</b> of the trolley portion <b>7065</b>. Thus, the support member exerts a force on the bumper <b>7067</b> that can transition the bumper <b>7067</b> from a non-deformed configuration to a deformed configuration, thereby absorbing at least a portion of the force and/or kinetic energy. Moreover, the force exerted by the support member can move the trolley portion <b>7065</b> along the support track <b>7050</b>, which in turn, moves the first member <b>7071</b> of the coupling portion <b>7070</b> relative to the second member <b>7073</b> of the coupling portion <b>7070</b>. Accordingly, with the first member <b>7071</b> in contact with the energy storage member <b>7074</b>, the movement of the first member <b>7071</b> relative to the second portion <b>7072</b> can transition the energy storage member <b>7074</b> from a lower potential energy configuration to a higher potential energy configuration. In this manner, an acceleration and/or a jerk (e.g., the rate of change in the acceleration) of the support member is not rapidly changed as the track stop <b>7060</b> limits further movement of the support member along the support track <b>7050</b>. Furthermore, by absorbing at least a portion of the kinetic energy and/or force exerted by the support member, damage to the support member that can otherwise result from the support member hitting a &#x201c;hard stop&#x201d; (e.g., a stop mechanism with little or no energy absorption).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Although the trolley <b>2100</b> is described above as including the encoder <b>2470</b> of the drive system <b>2300</b>, the encoder <b>2561</b> of the guide mechanism <b>2540</b>, and the encoder <b>2587</b> of the cam assembly <b>2570</b>, which are collectively used to determine one or more system parameters (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration, etc.), in other embodiments, a trolley and/or the like can include any suitable device, mechanism, and/or system configured to determine one or more system parameters.

The electronic system can include at least a processor and a memory configured to receive one or more signals from the encoders of the drive mechanism and the patient support mechanism. In some embodiments, the electronic system can also include an imaging device (e.g., similar to the imaging device <b>8725</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b> and <b>47</b></figref>) configured to capture and image or video stream of a tracking member (e.g., similar to the tracking member <b>8860</b>).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">As described in detail above, when a patient using the patient support system begins to walk, the drive mechanism can move the trolley along the support track in response to his or her movement. The encoder of the drive mechanism can, in turn, sense one or more characteristics associated with the operation of the drive mechanism. For example, the encoder can sense a position of the drive mechanism relative to the support track, a translational velocity of the drive mechanism along the support track, a translational acceleration of the drive mechanism along the support track, a rotational velocity of one or more wheels, a rotational acceleration of one or more wheels, an angular orientation of one or more wheels, a motor speed and/or direction, a voltage associated with at least a portion of the motor, and/or the like. The encoder can then send a signal associated with the one or more characteristics of the drive mechanism to the electronic system, which in response, can cause the processor to determine and/or or update an operating condition of the drive mechanism based at least in part on a change in the one or more characteristics of the drive mechanism relative to a previously defined operating condition of the drive mechanism (e.g., stored in a memory or the like), as described in detail above with reference to the trolley <b>2100</b>.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Similarly, in response to the walking of the patient, the encoder of the winch assembly, the guide mechanism, and/or the cam assembly (as well as the imaging device if included therein) can sense and/or determine one or more characteristics associated with the operation of the patient support mechanism. For example, in some instances, the patient may walk faster than the trolley, thereby changing the angle of the tether and the guide mechanism relative to the trolley. The encoder of the guide mechanism can sense the angular deflection of the guide mechanism and can send a signal associated with the angle of the guide mechanism to the electronic system. Upon receipt, the electronic system can cause the processor to determine and/or update an operating condition of the guide mechanism.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In some instances, the movement of the patient may, for example, increase a length of a portion of the tether. As such, a portion of the tether can be unspooled from a drum or the like included in the winch assembly. More specifically, at least a portion of a force exerted by the patient on the tether can rotate the drum or the like, which in turn, results in an unspooling of the tether (i.e., an increase in a length of a portion of the tether between the patient and the winch assembly). The encoder of the winch assembly can sense one or more characteristics associated with the operation of the winch assembly. For example, the encoder can sense an angular position of the drum, a rotational velocity of the drum, an acceleration of the drum, a speed and/or direction of a motor included in the winch assembly, a voltage associated with at least a portion of the motor of the winch assembly, and/or the like. The encoder can then send a signal associated with the one or more characteristics of the winch assembly to the electronic system, which in response, can cause the processor to determine and/or or update an operating condition of the winch assembly based at least in part on a change in the one or more characteristics of the winch assembly relative to a previously defined operating condition of the winch assembly (e.g., stored in a memory or the like), as described in detail above with reference to the trolley <b>2100</b>. In some instances, based at least in part on the updated operating condition of the winch assembly, the processor can determine a length of the portion of the tether disposed between the patient and the winch assembly. In some embodiments, the tether can be coupled to a load cell or the like configured to sense a force exerted by the patient on the tether (e.g., by measuring a stress, tension, strain, and/or the like along and/or within a portion of the tether). The load cell can be configured to send a signal to the electronic system associated with a load (e.g., force) exerted on the tether, which in turn, can cause the processor to determine a force exerted by the patient.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">In some instances, an amount of force exerted on the tether by the patient may increase or decrease in a substantially sudden manner. For example, if a patient stumbles, an amount of force exerted on the tether may increase relatively suddenly. In such instances, the increase of force exerted on the tether may pivot the guide mechanism and/or increase a length of a portion of the tether (as described above), as well as rotate a cam and/or cam arm included in the cam assembly (e.g., as described with reference to the cam assembly <b>2570</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b> and <b>33</b></figref>). In other words, at least a portion of the cam assembly can be configured to rotate in response to a relatively fast movement and/or deflection of the tether. The encoder of the cam assembly can sense one or more characteristics associated with a movement of the cam and/or cam arm such as, for example, position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, orientation, alignment, force, and/or the like. The encoder of the cam assembly can then send a signal associated with the one or more characteristics of the cam assembly to the electronic system, which in response, can cause the processor to determine and/or update an operating condition of the cam assembly based at least in part on a change in the one or more characteristics of the cam assembly relative to a previously defined operating condition of the cam assembly (e.g., stored in memory), as described above with reference to the trolley <b>2100</b>.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">By defining, determining, and/or updating one or more operating conditions of the drive mechanism and/or the patient support mechanism, the electronic system (e.g., at least the processor of the electronic system) can actively control the trolley to support at least a portion of a weight of the patient using the patient support system. As described above, in some instances, the magnitude of change in the operating condition of the drive system and/or the patient support mechanism is based at least in part on a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. In such instances, the electronic system (e.g., the processor or any other electronic device in communication with the processor) can determine the changes of the patient support mechanism and model the changes based on the PID control. Based on the result of the modeling the processor can determine the suitable magnitude of change in the operating condition of the drive system and/or the patient support mechanism.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a control diagram according to an embodiment. In this embodiment, the electronic system (described above) can be configured to control the drive system and/or the patient support mechanism based at least in part on a tension within and/or along a portion of the tether. Specifically, a nurse, technician, therapist, doctor, physician, etc. can define a predetermined value associated with a target tether tension T* (e.g., commanded tether tension). With the commanded tether tension T* stored, for example, in memory, the processor of the electronic system can compare an actual tension T within and/or along the portion of the tether against the commanded tether tension T* to determine a tension error. In some instances, the processor can then perform a derivative control operation <b>101</b> on the tension error, the output of which can be added to one or more proportional control operation outputs (described in further detail below) to determine, for example, a motor speed command &#x3c9;M* for controlling motor and drive dynamics <b>102</b> associated with a motor included in the drive system and/or the patient support mechanism.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, a proportional control operation <b>103</b> can be performed on a value associated with an actual motor speed &#x3c9;M of the motor included in the drive system and/or patient support mechanism. In addition the actual motor speed &#x3c9;M can be evaluated with a value Z associated with a downward motion of the tether (e.g., in response to a force exerted by a patient) for controlling spring mechanism dynamics <b>104</b> associated with, for example, the cam assembly of the patient support mechanism. As a result, the processor can define (1) an updated value of the actual tension T within and/or along the portion of the tether, and (2) a cam unloading rotation speed &#x3c9;C. An equivalent motor speed can be determined by evaluating a rotational speed associated with a portion of the cam and a rotational speed associated with, for example, the drum of the winch assembly (represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> by the reference numeral <b>105</b>). A proportional control operation <b>106</b> can be performed on the equivalent motor speed, an output of which can then be added to an output of the proportional control operation <b>103</b>. As described above, the sum of the proportional control operations <b>103</b> and <b>106</b> can be added to the output of the derivative control operation <b>101</b> to define the motor speed command &#x3c9;M*. Thus, in this embodiment and as described above, the electronic system (e.g., or at least the processor included therein) can control the trolley, in response to movement of a patient, based at least in part on a PID control feedback loop and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In some instances, the electronic system can determine one or more characteristic associated with a patients gait based at least in part on an operating condition and/or a change in operating condition of the drive mechanism and/or the patient support mechanism. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> is a graph <b>200</b> illustrating a displacement of a center of mass of a patient according to an embodiment. As shown, a patient's center of mass shifts during a gait cycle (e.g., up to about 5 centimeters (cm)), which in turn, results in a shifting and/or changing force exerted on the tether when the patient is using the patient support system. For example, the center of mass of the patient can be at a lowest point (i.e., closest to a surface on which the patient is walking) at about 5% and about 55% of the gait cycle, which corresponds to a termination of a swing phase of the gait cycle. The center of mass of the patient can be at a highest point (i.e., furthest away from the surface on which the patient is walking) at about 30% and about 80% of the gait cycle, which corresponds to the patient's center of mass passing over his or her weight bearing leg. Similarly, the center of mass of the patient can shift in a lateral direction during the gait cycle, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref>. With at least a portion of the weight of the patient supported by the patient support mechanism, the shifting of the center of mass of the patient results in a corresponding shift and/or change in the force exerted on the tether by the weight of the patient. Therefore, based on one or more operating conditions associated with the drive system and/or the patient support mechanism, the processor can determine a set of characteristics associated with the patient's gait.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>50</b>-<b>53</b></figref> are graphs illustrating operating conditions associated with the patient support mechanism in response to a patient's movement. In this instance, the operating conditions associated with the patient support mechanism relate to a tether position and a cam angle of the cam included in the cam assembly, which in turn, can be used to determine one or more characteristics associated with the patient's gait. More specifically, the processor of the electronic system can determine the tether position based on a signal received from one or more encoders (e.g., the encoder of the winch assembly, the guide member, and/or any other suitable encoder) and can determine the cam angle based on, for example, the encoder of the cam assembly.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the tether position and cam angle are graphed in response to a relatively slow movement of a normal or healthy patient's gait. Specifically, graph <b>301</b> illustrates a position of a portion of the tether, with and without factoring in a position associated with the cam, in response to the patient's gait; graph <b>302</b> illustrates a cam angle of the cam in response to the patient's gait; graph <b>303</b> illustrates a change in the tether position plus a change in the cam angle in response to the patient's gait; and graph <b>304</b> illustrates the speed and acceleration associated with the tether in response to the patient's gait. In some instances, the position of the portion of the tether, as shown in graph <b>301</b>, can change in response to a relatively slow, gradual, and/or substantial change in the patient's movement, while the cam angle of the cam, as shown in graph <b>302</b>, can change in response to a relatively fast, sudden, and/or abrupt movement of the tether. In some instances, the change in cam angle in response to the relatively fast movement of the tether can, for example, reduce noise or the like that might otherwise alter a determination of the tether position. As shown in graph <b>303</b>, the change in the tether position and the change in the cam angle can be determined, which in turn, can be used to determine a speed and acceleration associated with the tether position, as shown in graph <b>304</b>. Moreover, by determining the tether position, velocity, and acceleration, the processor of the electronic system can determine one or more characteristics associated with the patient's gait. For example, in some instances, the gait of a healthy patient may have and/or define a substantially symmetric characteristic when comparing movement of the patient's left leg to movement of the patient's right leg. Thus, by determining the position, velocity, and acceleration of the tether, the processor can determine gait characteristics such as, for example, a number of steps, a distance traveled, a stride length, a velocity, a difference between gait characteristics associated with the left leg and the right leg, and/or any other suitable characteristic.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In a similar manner, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b></figref> illustrates graphs showing the tether position and cam angle in response to a relatively fast movement of the normal or healthy patient's gait. Specifically, graph <b>401</b> illustrates a position of a portion of the tether, with and without factoring in a position associated with the cam, in response to the patient's gait; graph <b>402</b> illustrates a cam angle of the cam in response to the patient's gait; graph <b>403</b> illustrates a change in the tether position plus a change in the cam angle in response to the patient's gait; and graph <b>404</b> illustrates the speed and acceleration associated with the tether in response to the patient's gait. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>50</b> and <b>51</b></figref>, the speed associated with the patient's movement can result in a different response of the tether position and the cam angle. Thus, the processor of the electronic system can determine any suitable gait characteristic associated with the patient's relatively fast gait, which can be different from a corresponding gait characteristics associated with the patient's relatively slow gait.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">While the graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>50</b> and <b>51</b></figref> illustrate the tether position and the cam angle relative to a normal or healthy patient's gait, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>52</b> and <b>53</b></figref> illustrate a tether position and cam angle relative to an impaired patient's gait and more specifically, to the gait of a patient with an impairment resulting in a dragging of one of his or her legs.

Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>, graph <b>601</b> illustrates a position of a portion of the tether, with and without factoring in a position associated with the cam relative to circumduction movement of the impaired patient's gait; graph <b>602</b> illustrates a cam angle of the cam relative to circumduction movement of the impaired patient's gait; graph <b>603</b> illustrates a change in the tether position plus a change in the cam angle relative to circumduction movement of the impaired patient's gait; and graph <b>604</b> illustrates the speed and acceleration associated with the tether relative to circumduction movement of the impaired patient's gait.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>52</b> and <b>53</b></figref>, the impairment causing the patient to drag one leg during his or her gait results in a response of the tether position and the cam angle that is more erratic, abrupt, and/or otherwise more irregular relative to the response of the tether position and the cam angle resulting from a non-impaired patient's gait. In some instances, the position, velocity, and/or acceleration of the tether position resulting from the impaired patient's gait can be compared to the position, velocity, and/or acceleration of the tether position resulting from the non-impaired patient's gait. As such, the processor of the electronic system can determine, predict, and/or otherwise analyze the characteristics of the impaired patient's gait, which in turn, can be used to define a therapeutic treatment plan, a therapeutic progress report, a diagnostic method, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">In some instances, the patient support system (and/or any of the patient support systems described herein) can be used in conjunction with any other suitable device configured to determine, provide, and/or define characteristics associated with a patient's gait. In some instances, the analysis of the one or more operating conditions of the drive mechanism and/or patient support mechanism can be used in conjunction with an analysis of data associated with an electric stimulator configured, for example, to improve an impaired patient's gait. For example, the patient support system can be used to support a patient donning an electric stimulator, configured to facilitate the gait of a patient experiencing drop foot or the like, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,080,885, entitled &#x201c;Orthosis for a Gait Modulation System,&#x201d; filed Apr. 4, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, the electric stimulator can define one or more operating conditions associated with the electric stimulator and/or the impaired patient's gait. For example, the electric stimulator can sense and/or determine an anterior or posterior motion, a lateral motion, a total motion (e.g., a combination of the lateral motion and the anterior or posterior motion), and/or a pressure associated with a heel on or heel off event, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>. In this instance, graph <b>701</b> illustrates an acceleration associated with the operation of the electric stimulator; graph <b>702</b> illustrates a speed associated with the operation of the electric stimulator; graph <b>703</b> illustrates a rotation associated with the operation of the electric stimulator; and graph <b>704</b> illustrates an angle associated with the operation of the electric stimulator.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">In some embodiments, the electric stimulator can send a signal associated with one or more of its operating conditions to the electronic system of the patient support system. As such, the processor can determine one or more gait characteristics of the impaired patient based on data received from the drive system and/or patient support mechanism as well as the electric stimulator. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref> illustrates graphical representations of a set of gait characteristics of a patient, which were determined based at least in part on data associated with the patient support system and the electric stimulator (as described in detail above). Specifically, graph <b>801</b> illustrates a swing and stance duration of the patient's gait; graph <b>802</b> illustrates a swing to stance ratio of the patient's gait; graph <b>803</b> illustrates a cadence of the patient's gait; graph <b>804</b> illustrates an anterior and lateral range of motion (ROM) associated with one or both of the patient's legs; graph <b>805</b> illustrates an anterior to lateral ratio associated with one or both of the patient's legs; and graph <b>806</b> illustrates a stride length and height of the patient's gait. Thus, the operating conditions associated with the patient support system and any other suitable device can be used to determine one or more characteristics of the patient's gait. Moreover, the electronic system can be configured to send a signal to any suitable output device (e.g., a monitor, a laptop, a personal computer, a hand held controller, a smartphone, and/or the like) that is indicative of an instruction to output data associated with the one or more characteristics of the patient's gait.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">As described above, any of the patient support systems and/or body weight support systems described herein can be used to and/or can otherwise facilitate an analysis of a patient's gait while using that system. For example, in some embodiments, the patient support systems can be used with an electronic device (e.g., a personal computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, controller, remote display, workstation, server, and/or the like) to determine data associated with the patient's gait and graphically and/or alpha-numerically represent that data on a display. The patient support system can include, for example, a trolley tracking and dynamic body weight engine, module, process, compute device, etc. to determine data such as trolley speed, travelled distance, tether length, CAM angle, body weight unloading, elapsed time, and/or any other suitable data set.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">In addition, when a patient support system such as those described herein is used with, for example, an electric stimulator system or with any other suitable electric and/or electronic data collection system, the patient support system can be configured to receive signals from and/or send signals to such electric or electronic systems associated with, for example, heel on or off events and/or other gait phases. Thus, in some instances, the patient support systems described herein can calculate and/or determine a step duration, a step length, a walking speed, a symmetry level of gait patterns (left/right), and/or any other suitable gait characteristic. Moreover, the patient support systems described herein can send one or more signals (e.g., via a wired or wireless connection) to, for example, the electronic device to cause a graphical representation, a numeric representation, and/or an alpha-numeric representation of the calculated and/or determined gait characteristics to be presented on a display. In other instances, the patient support system can send data associated with one or more operating conditions of the patient support system to the electronic device. In such instances, the electronic device can calculate and/or define the gait characteristics, based at least in part on the data received from the patient support system. In addition, the electric stimulator can send data associated with the patient's gait, substantially concurrently with the patient support system, to the electric device. In other instances, the electric stimulator can send data associated with the patient's gait to the patient support system and the patient support system (e.g., a processor, module, or compute device included therein) can aggregate the data associated with the patient support system and the data associated with the electric stimulator and, in turn, can send an aggregated data set to the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In some embodiments, the patient support system and/or an electronic device in communication therewith can include memory and/or at least one module that stores data associated with one or more predetermined exercises, routines, tests, and/or the like. For example, the memory and/or module can include data associated with a set of exercises to analyze the patient's current and/or previous gait tests or analysis to track and help improve the patient's ability to walk. In some instances, the patient support system and/or the electronic device in communication therewith can graphically represent data associated with the exercises, routines, tests, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref> is a screenshot <b>901</b> illustrating a graphical representation of data associated with an asymmetry exercise. The screenshot <b>901</b> of the asymmetry exercise visually shows a patient's vertical asymmetry (leaning more on one side than on the other side) and his or her horizontal asymmetry (difference between step durations). As shown, the symmetry can be displayed in position symmetry bar graphs as well as radio dials, which can be complemented by real time graphs showing a history of, for example, changing tether positions and walking speeds. During and after the asymmetry test, the patient support system and/or the electronic device can cause data associated with an average, minimum, and/or maximum walking speed, a vertical and/or horizontal symmetry, and/or the like to be graphically represented on the display.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">By way of another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref> is a screenshot <b>902</b> illustrating a graphical representation of data associated with a timed-up-and-go (TUG) exercise. The screenshot <b>902</b> of the TUG exercise can graphically represent data defined by the patient support system and/or the electronic device associated with the time it takes a patient to stand up from a seated position, walk a predetermined distance, and then sit down. During and after the TUG exercise, the patient support system and/or the electronic device can cause data associated with an average, minimum, and/or maximum speed during the TUG training exercises. The patient support system and/or the electronic device can cause data to be graphically represented on the display such as real time graphs showing the history of the stand-up, walking, and sit down process, tether positions (included in a patient support mechanism of the patient support system, as described in detail above), and/or time durations as well as the walking speeds during the exercise. Based at least in part on the time duration results, a fall risk (e.g., high or low) can be determined for the patient. Moreover, the data associated with the TUG exercise can be compared to historical data (e.g., stored in memory) from that patient's previous TUG exercises, thereby allowing a clinician or therapist to keep track of improvements in patient's gait.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref> is a screenshot <b>903</b> illustrating a graphical representation of data associated with a timed-distance exercise. For example, a user (e.g., clinician and/or patient) can select either a fixed distance (e.g., 10 meters) or a fixed time (e.g., 2 minutes). The patient then walks for that distance or that time the patient support system and/or the electronic device can determine and/or define the patient's performance. For a fixed distance, the timed-distance exercise can determine a gait speed and duration. For a fixed time, the timed-distance exercise can determine a total travelled distance and/or a gait speed. The patient support system and/or the electronic device can cause data to be graphically represented on the display such as real time graphs showing the distance travelled and the walking speed, an average, minimum, and/or maximum walking speed, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">As described above, any data associated with the exercises, routines, tests, etc. can be saved, for example, in memory, to replay it back for post exercise analysis. In addition, data associated with any given exercise can be saved as a baseline so it can be used to compare against future exercises to show the improvements in patient's gait. Moreover, in some instances, a report can be defined (e.g., by the patient support system and/or the electronic device) and graphically represented on the display to provide details of a given exercise, including the gait speed, distance, time, time to stand, time to sit, cadence, symmetry indexes, or the like, as well as a Perry Ambulatory Category, a Functional Ambulation Category, and/or fall risk.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">The patient support mechanism and/or the electronic device (or a processor, module, compute device, etc. included therein) can be configured to perform the exercises, routines, test, or the like, based on data associated with, for example, a tether position, a cam angle, a walking speed, a motor speed, a heel on or off event (and/or other gait phases), and/or the like. In some instances, the patient support mechanism and/or the electronic device can determine, for example, a change in the position of the tether (i.e., included in a patient support mechanism, as described in detail above) between two heel events to determine a vertical symmetry of the patient's gait. In some instances, the data can be based on both linear tether positions and/or cam angles (e.g., a linear graph) and a derivative thereof (e.g., slope or rate of change) of the tether position and/or cam angles (converted to linear length) to determine a gait pattern and/or characteristic.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Based on a determined gait pattern, the patient support mechanism and/or the electronic device can determine peaks and/or valleys associated with the gait events, which can be graphically represented as a linear graph or a derivative graph. In some instances, the patient support mechanism and/or the electronic device can use, for example, a midpoint logic to normalize the linear graph and/or derivative graph (e.g., remove a graph offset, or the like). In some instances, the peaks and valleys of the graphs (e.g., local minima and/or local maxima of the data) can be used determine the heel on or off events. Based on different predetermined gait patterns (e.g., a first category for normal walkers and a second category for pathological walkers) the peaks and valleys can be defined and/or determined differently. For example, for a normal walker, a valley (e.g., locally the shortest tether position) can be about mid stance (double support) of the gait. Conversely, for a pathological walker, a valley can be during a step.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Once the peaks and valleys are associated with the respective heel on or off events, the difference between the previous and current step tether positions can be determined to define the changes in the tether positions (e.g., determine vertical symmetry difference between the right and the left steps or the difference between the two subsequent steps). The previous and current step elapsed times can also be determined to define changes in the step duration (e.g., determine horizontal symmetry).</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Although not shown herein, in some embodiments, the patient support systems and/or the body weight support systems can be used while a patient walks, for example, on a treadmill. As such, a patient support system can receive data associated with one or more operating conditions of the treadmill. In turn, the patient support system can use the data associated with the treadmill and data associated with the operating conditions of the patient support system to define one or more gait characteristics of the patient.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">Any of the patient support systems and/or body weight support systems can be used in conjunction with any other suitable device configured to be used during a patient's gait. For example, a patient support system can include camera, infrared emitter and receiver, a visual light source and sensor, magnetic sensor, a force and/or pressure plate and sensor, and/or the like. In some embodiments, a patient support system can include, for example, a projector configured to project a graphical representation of data associated with a predetermined track or path along which the patient is to walk. In some instances, such a projector can project images such as stop signs, turn signs, obstacles to walk around, etc.). Moreover, in some instances, a patient reaching a target location projected onto a surface by the projector can be associated with a value or the like (e.g., a relatively high value) used to determine a patient performance score. Similarly, failing to avoid an obstacle projected onto a surface by the projector can be associated with a value or the like (e.g., a relatively low value). In some instances, such a projector can project a hologram of the patient walking so that they may see themselves walking either from the front or behind.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Any of the patient support systems and/or body weight support systems can be used with any suitable track and/or power rail such as those described herein. In some embodiments, a patient support system can include a track and/or power rail configured to allow for switching, diverting, and/or redirecting of a trolley movably coupled thereto. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref> illustrates a first track portion <b>9620</b>A and a second track portion <b>9620</b>B, and a first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A and a second power rail portion <b>9050</b>A. In this embodiment, the first track portion <b>9620</b>A and the second track portion <b>9620</b>B are disposed perpendicular to each other. Similarly, the first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A and the second power rail portion <b>9050</b>B are disposed perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>, a turntable <b>9625</b> includes a third track portion <b>9620</b>C and a third power rail portion <b>9050</b>C. The turntable <b>9625</b> is configured to be rotated relative to the track portions <b>9620</b>A and <b>9620</b>B and the power rails <b>9050</b>A and <b>9050</b>B, as indicated by the arrow AA. For example, in some embodiments, the turntable <b>9625</b> can be manually turned (e.g., a user exerts a force on a portion of the turntable <b>9625</b> such as a handle or the like (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>)). In other embodiments, the turntable <b>9625</b> can include a motor or the like (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>) that can receive a signal from a controller or the like and based on that signal, can rotate the turntable <b>9625</b>. Therefore, in use, the turntable <b>9625</b> can rotate to a position relative to the track portions <b>9620</b>A and <b>9620</b>B and the power rails <b>9050</b>A and <b>9050</b>B to place the third track portion <b>9620</b>C in line with the first track portion <b>9620</b>A, and to place the third power rail portion <b>9050</b>C in line with the first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>. More particularly, when the third track portion <b>9620</b>C is placed in line with the first track portion <b>9620</b>A, the first track portion <b>9620</b>A and the third track portion <b>9620</b>C collectively form a substantially continuous track along which a trolley can move.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">Similarly, the first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A and the third power rail portion <b>9050</b>B can collectively form a substantially continuous power rail configured to power the trolley suspended from the track, collectively formed by the first track portion <b>9620</b>A and the third track portion <b>9620</b>C. Specifically, in this embodiment, the turntable <b>9625</b> can be disposed in a position such that the first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A and the third power rail <b>9050</b>C are in electric communication. Thus, an electric current can flow from a power source (not shown), along a first length of the first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A, along the third power rail portion <b>9050</b>C, and along a second length of the first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A. Moreover, in some embodiments, the ends of the power rail portions <b>9050</b>A, <b>9050</b>B, and <b>9050</b>C can include a transfer section or the like (e.g., a flared or flanged end) that can allow for a given amount of misalignment between the first power rail portion <b>9050</b>A or the second power rail portion <b>9050</b>B and the third power rail portion <b>9050</b>C.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">In use, a user (e.g., a patient, a therapist, a technician, a doctor, etc.) may want to redirect a trolley disposed along, for example, a length of the first track portion <b>9620</b>A. As such, the user can cause the trolley to move from a position along the first track portion <b>9620</b>A to a position along the third track portion <b>9620</b>C. With the trolley suspended from the third track portion <b>9620</b>C and with the trolley in electrical communication with the third power rail <b>9050</b>C, the user can rotate (e.g., either manually or electrically) the turntable <b>9625</b> to a position in which the third track portion <b>9620</b>C is substantially in line with the second track portion <b>9620</b>B and in which the third power rail portion <b>9050</b>C is in line with the second power rail portion <b>9050</b>B. When the third track portion <b>9620</b>C is substantially aligned with the second track portion <b>9620</b>B and the third power rail portion <b>9050</b>C is substantially aligned with the second power rail portion <b>9050</b>B, the user can cause the trolley to move from the position along the third track portion <b>9620</b>C to a position along the second track portion <b>9620</b>B. In this manner, the trolley can be turned, switched, rotated, and/or otherwise redirected. Similarly stated, the turntable can be rotated from a first position to a second position to rotate, switch, turn, and/or otherwise redirect the trolley.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">Some embodiments described herein relate to a computer storage product with a non-transitory computer-readable medium (also can be referred to as a non-transitory processor-readable medium) having instructions or computer code thereon for performing various computer-implemented operations.
