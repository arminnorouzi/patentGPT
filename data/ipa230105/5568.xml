particular to techniques for detection of chromosomal and sub-chromosomal copy number variation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Genetic information of living organisms is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA). The genetic information is a succession of nucleotides or modified nucleotides representing the primary structure of chemical or hypothetical nucleic acids. In humans, there are about 25,000 protein-coding genes and over ten thousand non-coding genes, which fulfills specific biochemical or regulatory functions within a living cell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many medical conditions are caused by variation in the genetic information of living organism (e.g., genetic variation). For example, certain genetic disorders cause medical conditions such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). These genetic disorders can result from a mutation (addition, substitution, or deletion) of one or more nucleotides in a particular gene, a mutation in multiple genes, or changes in the number or structure of chromosomes. Certain birth defects are also caused by a chromosomal abnormality, also referred to as an aneuploidy, such as Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome), Monosomy X (Turner's Syndrome), and certain sex chromosome aneuploidies such as Klinefelter's Syndrome (XXY).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Identifying genetic variation (e.g., copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs), copy number variations (CNVs), single nucleotide variations, chromosome alterations, translocations, deletions, insertions, and the like) or variance, can lead to diagnosis of, or determining predisposition to, a particular medical condition, as well as facilitating a medical decision and employing a helpful medical procedure. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a modern technique that has enabled genome-wide characterization of genetic variation. NGS refers to a process of massively parallel sequencing that produces a large number of target sequence reads. Genome-wide characterization of genetic variation such as CNVs typically begins with the alignment of sequence reads to a reference sequence. In paired-end sequencing, the alignment process yields three smaller datasets: (1) reads mapped with &#x201c;correct&#x201d; pairing, with expected orientation and distance between mates, (2) reads mapped in pairs deemed &#x201c;discordant&#x201d; in terms of distance and/or orientation, or where only one read is mapped, and (3) reads that are not mapped at all. A read pair or a single read can map to a single location on the reference sequence (&#x201c;uniquely mapped&#x201d;) or to multiple different locations (&#x201c;non-uniquely mapped&#x201d;), depending on the sequence of the read or the read pair and the contents of the reference sequence. Once all possible reads have been mapped, the resulting read depth serves as a quantitative measure of genome-wide copy number. Segmentation algorithms and other methods have been developed to call variants such as CNVs from the read depth.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed are methods, systems, and computer readable storage media for detection of chromosomal and sub-chromosomal copy number variations.

OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The present disclosure describes techniques for detection of chromosomal and sub-chromosomal copy number variations. More specifically, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a two-step normalization analysis for detecting and reporting copy number variations without the need for external reference samples.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Copy number variation (CNV) is a prevalent type of genomic disorder (structural genomic variation) that alters chromosomal structure through insertion, duplication, or deletion. When a CNV happens in a human subject, a number of nucleotide base pairs is inserted, duplicated, or deleted in the subject's chromosomes compared to a normal subject. Sometimes multi-insertion, multi-duplication, multi-deletion, or combinations thereof may happen in multiple chromosomes, or a whole or part of chromosome may be duplicated or missing. CNVs are associated with many disease phenotypes and may lead to higher disease risks. For example, patients with Klinefelter Syndrome are males born with an extra X chromosome. Typical symptoms of Klinefelter Syndrome are not obvious and hard to diagnosis: including greater height, lower energy level, and infertility. Klinefelter Syndrome may lead to a higher risk of other health issues such as Type II Diabetes and male breast cancer.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">CNV analysis was initially studied by observing the physical structure of the chromosome through inserted fluorescent probes with conventional techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, scientists and professional practitioners are able to simultaneously and rapidly detect and analyse targeted structural variants using sequence reads. Massively parallel sequencing data can be used to infer CNVs throughout relevant genomic regions (e.g., hundreds to thousands of genomic regions) of the genome in patient samples. Most traditional sequencing-based approaches for CNV detection partition the genome into nonoverlapping bins and use the read depth (RD) to look for regions that differ in copy number. To accurately detect CNVs, the RD approach requires at least five external samples (ideally around ten) that will be run as a cohort with each subject sample analyzed, using the remaining samples as a pool of reference samples. Alternatively, the paired-end (PE) approach identifies CNV based upon the distances between the paired reads. A genomic aberration is detected when the distance between reads is significantly different from the predetermined insert size. Although it is possible to detect CNV using the PE approach, the method is most often used to detect structural variation such as inversions and translocations. A third approach is based upon assembly of short reads into contigs and excludes mapping of reads to a reference genome. To identify CNV assembled contigs are then compared to a reference genome to identify quantitative differences. Both PE and assembly based approaches are limited however in targeted resequencing applications due to targeted regions being discontinuous across the genome. Therefore, all CNV detection tools for targeted resequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES) are based on the RD approach. Importantly, read depth approaches assume that reads distribute in a more or less uniform way across the genome and, therefore, the differences in read depth for the cohort are used to identify CNVs.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">However, this assumption fails in the context of whole genome and targeted sequencing. One of the main reasons for the failure is that the probes used for capturing the different genomic target regions have variable specificity and efficiency depending on the region. This fact introduces strong biases in the number of mapped reads per region that hamper the CNV detection. The traditional CNV detection approaches require multiple external reference samples because the approaches use them to control the biases given by the extensive variability in capture efficiency across target areas. Moreover, different regions in chromosomes may require different thresholds in CNV analysis and further demand extensive experimental and computational tuning. Those reference biases affect the sensitivity and specificity of CNV detection, resulting in a high false positive rate in most of the currently available methods. As a result, the traditional CNV detection approaches are available only for a limited number of target genes or catalogue CNVs, and the majority of the traditional CNV detection approaches have no capability of detecting CNVs for small regions (e.g., small exons).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">To address the problems and limitations in the traditional CNV detection approaches, techniques are disclosed herein for detection of chromosomal and sub-chromosomal (e.g., gene level and exon level) copy number variations simultaneously. One illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented double-normalization method for calling CNVs at different levels of resolution (e.g., chromosomal level, gene level, and exon level) without external reference samples. In some instances, the computer-implemented method is performed as part of pre-analysis before performing diagnosis of diseases. In some instances, the computer-implemented method is performed as part of pre-analysis before performing administration of a treatment to diseases. In other instances, the computer-implemented method is performed as part of post-analysis or adjusted-analysis after performing a traditional NGS-CNV detection analysis. However, as should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the concepts discussed herein are not limited to pre-analysis, post-analysis, or adjusted-analysis procedures, but may also be integrated into the overall clinical impact of CNV analysis in accordance with various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a computer-implemented double-normalization method <b>100</b> for calling CNVs (e.g., SMN1 copy number, GAA exon 18 deletion, and the like) at different levels of resolution comprises a two-step normalizing process. At block <b>105</b>, a batch of samples (e.g., 96 subject samples to be analyzed for CNVs) is preprocessed and sequenced using NGS techniques (this process is explained in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). A set of target genomic regions comprising one or more elements (e.g., chromosome, gene, exon, intron or other region of interest (ROI) such as a segment) is identified to detect certain types of CNVs. In some instances, each element in the set of target genomic regions is a gene, a chromosome, a portion of a chromosome, an exon, an intron, a predetermined genomic portion or ROI such as a segment, or any combination thereof. A median coverage number for each segment in each of the samples is obtained based on preprocessing and sequencing results. A segment is a part of an element such as a chromosome, gene, exon, intron or other ROI. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a segment median coverage <b>205</b> is determined by sorting the coverage values and picking the coverage at the central position in the sorted list. The global median coverage for each sample is determined based on a sorting result of the median coverage numbers for all segments in the sample. It should be pointed out that other measures for a central tendency in a numerical data set or other statistical coverages such as mean coverage and mode coverage could also be used in place of median coverage for the segments and/or the global median coverage to obtain similar results with similar performance in many cases. However, compared with mean coverage, the median coverage is generally more robust and much less affected by extreme values.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">When samples associated with subjects of different genders are processed together, an adjustment may be required before proceeding with a first normalization. Because each sample associated with a male subject has only one Chromosome X, a median coverage for a segment on Chromosome X in a sample associated with a male subject should be doubled and updated before determining a global median coverage for the sample. In various embodiments, a doubling of a median coverage for a segment in a sample associated with a male subject is processed and the corresponding original median coverage is updated for further processing. In some embodiments, a doubling of a median coverage for a segment in a sample associated with a male subject is stored as a new variable for the segment for further processing. In other embodiments, a median coverage for a segment on a sex chromosome in a sample associated with a male subject is removed before determining a global median coverage for the sample. It should be appreciated that a median coverage for an element on Chromosome X in a sample associated with a male subject may be adjusted in a similar way as above. Alternatively, the median coverage for an element on Chromosome X in a sample associated with a male subject may be adjusted on the fly, by applying the 2&#xd7; doubling factor to the male samples before analyzing male and female samples together. It should also be appreciated that the adjustment may be only for determining a global median coverage and a subsequent adjustment may be processed after a first normalization.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at block <b>110</b>, a first normalization is performed where each sample is processed independently (this process is explained in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The input is the median coverage for all segments of each sample. It is assumed that the segment median coverage follows a normal distribution. The coverage for each segment is normalized (&#x201c;scaling towards the global median&#x201d;) by dividing each segment median coverage by the sample or global median coverage&#x2014;this is the normalized segment median coverage ratio for each segment. The same normalization may be performed for each sample on an element by element basis to obtain different levels of resolution. For example, normalization for each additional element (e.g., a gene or chromosome) may comprise: (a) similar to obtaining individual segment median coverage, but only consider segments belonging to that element, to find the element median coverage for that element as opposed to all the segments of the whole sample; and (b) divide each element median coverage by the sample or global median coverage&#x2014;this is the normalized element median coverage ratio for each additional element.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">When samples associated with subjects of different genders are processed together, an adjustment may be required when proceeding with the first normalization. Because each sample associated with a male subject has only one Chromosome X, if a median coverage for a segment on Chromosome X in a sample associated with a male subject is not doubled for the first normalization, a segment median coverage ratio for the segment on Chromosome X in the sample associated with the male subject should be doubled and updated before determining the segment median coverage ratio for a second normalization. In various embodiments, a doubling of a segment median coverage ratio for a segment in a sample associated with a male subject is processed and the corresponding original segment median coverage ratio is updated for further processing. In some embodiments, a doubling of a segment median coverage ratio for a segment in a sample associated with a male subject is stored as a new variable for the segment for further processing. It should be appreciated that an element median coverage ratio for an element on Chromosome X in a sample associated with a male subject may be adjusted in a similar way as above.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">At block <b>115</b>, a second normalization is performed where all samples within a batch (e.g., a flowcell batch) of samples are processed jointly (this process is explained in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The input is the first normalized coverage for the segments/elements. It is assumed that most samples in a batch have normal copy numbers for the segments/elements to be analyzed. This assumption may not hold for a few rare cases, e.g., HBA analysis, where up to thirty percent of samples may have copy number variations. In such rare cases, the present method should not be used for copy number analysis. This input can be used to build a simple model of normal copy numbers of segments (or elements) and the model is then used to detect segments (or elements) with significantly different copy numbers. Each segment (or element) in all samples is considered an independent analysis unit. In the unit, a batch mean coverage is determined by adding all first normalized coverage for the segments (or elements) in all samples and dividing the sum by the number of samples. In some embodiments, outliers to the unit may be excluded before determining the mean coverage (an exemplary outlier exclusion is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>). Outlier detection may be an important step to remove any potential CNVs and anomalous segments to obtain a reliable statistic profile model for the normal samples. After outlier filtering, the second normalized coverage for the segment (or element) in each sample is determined by dividing a sample segment (or element) median coverage ratio by the flowcell mean for each sample. In other words, the coverage per segment (or element) is being normalized by dividing the median coverage ratio of a segment (or element) of a single sample by the mean of median coverage ratio of that particular segment (or gene or chromosome) of all the samples in the flowcell batch. Subsequently or in parallel with the second normalization process, a normal model/profile for the segment (or element) comprising all second normalized coverages for the same segment (or element) in all samples is determined and prepared to be used in CNV detection.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">At block <b>120</b>, absence or presence of CNV is detected using artificial intelligence techniques (this process is explained in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>). The artificial intelligence techniques including rule-based methods, machine learning models, or a combination thereof. CNV detection is based on the results of the second normalization, specifically copy number per segment (or element), or the p-value (or the corresponding z-score, or a statistical measure) for the segment (or element) or both the copy number and the p-value (or the corresponding z-score, or a statistical measure). For example, for each sample-segment (or element) combination, a particular sample may be compared with the model/profile of normal samples for that segment to calculate the z-score and p-value for the segment (or element). In various embodiments, a presence of CNV associated with an element in a target sample is reported based on rule-based methods, for example, when the copy number for the segment (or element) falls out of a predetermined interval and optionally its corresponding z-score and/or p-value is outside a predetermined threshold(s). In other embodiments, a presence of CNV associated with an element in a target sample is reported based on one or more machine learning models, for example, a machine learning model may be used to predict a duplication (i.e., increased copy number) or deletion (i.e., decreased copy number). In yet other embodiments, a presence of CNV associated with an element in a target sample is reported based on a combination of rule-based methods and one or more machine learning models. The reporting information may include but not limited to (i) an ID for the target sample, (ii) an indicium (e.g., name or location) of the segment (or element), (iii) the copy number for the segment (or element), (iv) the p-value (or the corresponding z-score, or a statistical measure) for the segment (or element), (v) gender of a subject associated with the target sample, (vi) gene indicium of the element if the element is an exon/intron, (vii) chromosome indicium of the element if the element is an exon/intron/gene, (viii) a type of the CNV detection (e.g., cnvdup, cnvdel, or the absence of a CNV), or (ix) any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The double-normalizing process is advantageous in many aspects, for example: (i) it is capable of simultaneously detecting CNVs at different resolutions such as chromosomes and sub-chromosomes (e.g., genes and exons), and is especially applicable to detect small regional CNVs such as small-exon CNVs; (ii) it does not demand external &#x201c;normal&#x201d; reference samples and eliminates possible biases and errors in adjusting the reference samples (perfectly CNV-normal samples are very rare to find and use as the reference); (iii) it avoids false positives and false negatives caused by artifacts due to batch-to-batch variations and (iv) it provides a series of standard procedures to fast and efficiently detect and analyse CNVs automatically. Moreover, the double-normalizing data process can be easily adapted to other target-based germline NGS tests, and potentially somatic CNV mutation analysis.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II.

TECHNIQUES FOR CNV DETECTION</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0096">CNV detection and analysis play a vital role in characterizing genetic disorders and syndromes. The present automated CNV detection method, without relying on external reference samples, provides a systematic and reliable way to perform standardized CNV detection and is also capable to provide CNV information on smaller genomic regions such as exons.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Described herein is a computer-implemented method incorporating double-normalization and artificially intelligence techniques for automated calling of CNVs at different levels of resolutions. After obtaining sequencing data, median coverage numbers of segments in each sample are used to determine a first normalized coverage for each segment/element based on the median coverage for the segment or a local median coverage for the element, and a global median coverage for all segments in the sample (&#x201c;within a sample normalization&#x201d;), and the first normalized coverage of each segment/element is second-normalized based on a mean coverage for the segment/element in all samples (&#x201c;across samples normalization&#x201d;). Each element is a chromosome, portion of a chromosome, gene, exon, intron or other region of interest (ROI)) in a set of target genomic regions. A detection of CNVs is based on results of the second normalization using artificial intelligence techniques.

In some embodiments sequence reads are of a mean, median, average or absolute length of about 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, or 5000 bp or more. In some embodiments, sequence reads are of a mean, median, average or absolute length of about 100 bp to about 200 bp.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Any suitable method of sequencing nucleic acids can be used, non-limiting examples of which include Maxim &#x26; Gilbert, chain-termination methods, sequencing by synthesis, sequencing by ligation, sequencing by mass spectrometry, microscopy-based techniques, the like or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a first generation technology, such as, for example, Sanger sequencing methods including automated Sanger sequencing methods, including microfluidic Sanger sequencing, can be used in a method provided herein. In some embodiments, sequencing technologies that include the use of nucleic acid imaging technologies (e.g., transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)), can be used. In some embodiments, a high-throughput sequencing method is used. High-throughput sequencing methods generally involve clonally amplified DNA templates or single DNA molecules that are sequenced in a massively parallel fashion, sometimes within a flow cell. Next generation (e.g., 2nd and 3rd generation) sequencing techniques capable of sequencing DNA in a massively parallel fashion can be used for methods described herein and are collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;massively parallel sequencing&#x201d; (MPS). In some embodiments, MPS sequencing methods utilize a targeted approach, where specific chromosomes, genes or regions of interest are sequenced. In certain embodiments, a non-targeted approach is used where most or all nucleic acids in a sample are sequenced, amplified and/or captured randomly.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">MPS sequencing sometimes makes use of sequencing by synthesis and certain imaging processes. A nucleic acid sequencing technology that may be used in a method described herein is sequencing-by-synthesis and reversible terminator-based sequencing (e.g., Illumina's Genome Analyzer; Genome Analyzer II; HISEQ 2000; HISEQ 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, Calif.)). With this technology, millions of nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) fragments can be sequenced in parallel. In one example of this type of sequencing technology, a flow cell is used which contains an optically transparent slide with 8 individual lanes on the surfaces of which are bound oligonucleotide anchors (e.g., adapter primers).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Sequencing by synthesis generally is performed by iteratively adding (e.g., by covalent addition) a nucleotide to a primer or preexisting nucleic acid strand in a template directed manner. Each iterative addition of a nucleotide is detected and the process is repeated multiple times until a sequence of a nucleic acid strand is obtained. The length of a sequence obtained depends, in part, on the number of addition and detection steps that are performed. In some embodiments of sequencing by synthesis, one, two, three or more nucleotides of the same type (e.g., A, G, C or T) are added and detected in a round of nucleotide addition. Nucleotides can be added by any suitable method (e.g., enzymatically or chemically). For example, in some embodiments a polymerase or a ligase adds a nucleotide to a primer or to a preexisting nucleic acid strand in a template directed manner. In some embodiments of sequencing by synthesis, different types of nucleotides, nucleotide analogues and/or identifiers are used. In some embodiments reversible terminators and/or removable (e.g., cleavable) identifiers are used. In some embodiments fluorescent labeled nucleotides and/or nucleotide analogues are used. In certain embodiments sequencing by synthesis comprises a cleavage (e.g., cleavage and removal of an identifier) and/or a washing step. In some embodiments the addition of one or more nucleotides is detected by a suitable method described herein or known in the art, non-limiting examples of which include any suitable imaging apparatus, a suitable camera, a digital camera, a CCD (Charge Couple Device) based imaging apparatus (e.g., a CCD camera), a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon) based imaging apparatus (e.g., a CMOS camera), a photo diode (e.g., a photomultiplier tube), electron microscopy, a field-effect transistor (e.g., a DNA field-effect transistor), an ISFET ion sensor (e.g., a CHEMFET sensor), the like or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Any suitable MPS method, system or technology platform for conducting methods described herein can be used to obtain nucleic acid sequence reads. Non-limiting examples of MPS platforms include Illumina/Solex/HiSeq (e.g., Illumina's Genome Analyzer; Genome Analyzer II; HISEQ 2000; HISEQ), SOLiD, Roche/454, PACBIO and/or SMRT, Helicos True Single Molecule Sequencing, Ion Torrent and Ion semiconductor-based sequencing (e.g., as developed by Life Technologies), WildFire, 5500, 5500xl W and/or 5500xl W Genetic Analyzer based technologies (e.g., as developed and sold by Life Technologies, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0012399); Polony sequencing, Pyrosequencing, Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS), RNA polymerase (RNAP) sequencing, LaserGen systems and methods, Nanopore-based platforms, chemical-sensitive field effect transistor (CHEMFET) array, electron microscopy-based sequencing (e.g., as developed by ZS Genetics, Halcyon Molecular), nanoball sequencing, the like or combinations thereof. Other sequencing methods that may be used to conduct methods herein include digital PCR, sequencing by hybridization, nanopore sequencing, chromosome-specific sequencing (e.g., using DANSR (digital analysis of selected regions) technology.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In various embodiments, the MPS process makes use of a solid phase comprising a flow cell on which nucleic acid from a library can be attached and reagents can be flowed and contacted with the attached nucleic acid. A flow cell includes flow cell lanes, and use of identifiers can facilitate analyzing a number of samples in each lane. A flow cell often is a solid support that can be configured to retain and/or allow the orderly passage of reagent solutions over bound analytes. Flow cells frequently are planar in shape, optically transparent, generally in the millimeter or sub-millimeter scale, and often have channels or lanes in which the analyte/reagent interaction occurs. In some embodiments the number of samples analyzed in a given flow cell lane is dependent on the number of unique identifiers utilized during library preparation and/or probe design. Multiplexing using 12 identifiers, for example, allows simultaneous analysis of 96 samples (e.g., equal to the number of wells in a 96 well microwell plate) in an 8 lane flow cell. Similarly, multiplexing using 48 identifiers, for example, allows simultaneous analysis of 384 samples (e.g., equal to the number of wells in a 384 well microwell plate) in an 8 lane flow cell. Non-limiting examples of commercially available multiplex sequencing kits include Illumina's multiplexing sample preparation oligonucleotide kit and multiplexing sequencing primers and PhiX control kit (e.g., Illumina's catalog numbers PE-400-1001 and PE-400-1002, respectively). In some embodiments, the samples are from different subjects and sequenced simultaneously as a batch run in a same flow cell. However, it should be understood that the samples from different subjects may be sequenced within multiple runs in different flow cells, combined and analyzed in a single batch or in multiple batches. However, this may introduce some variability into the process (e.g., artifacts due to batch-to-batch variations), which could cause a drop in performance.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">At block <b>410</b>, the sequence reads are mapped to genomic portions of a reference genome. Mapping sequence reads (i.e., sequence information from a fragment whose physical genomic position is unknown) can be performed in a number of ways, and often comprises alignment of the obtained sequence reads with a matching sequence in the reference genome. In such alignments, sequence reads generally are aligned to a reference sequence and those that align are designated as being &#x201c;mapped,&#x201d; as &#x201c;a mapped sequence read&#x201d; or as &#x201c;a mapped read.&#x201d; In certain embodiments, a mapped sequence read is referred to as a &#x201c;hit&#x201d; or &#x201c;count.&#x201d; In some embodiments, mapped sequence reads are grouped together according to various parameters and assigned to particular genomic portions.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The terms &#x201c;aligned,&#x201d; &#x201c;alignment,&#x201d; or &#x201c;aligning&#x201d; generally refer to two or more nucleic acid sequences that can be identified as a match (e.g., 100% identity) or partial match. Alignments are performed by a computer (e.g., a software, program, module, or process), a non-limiting example of which includes the Efficient Local Alignment of Nucleotide Data (ELAND) computer program distributed as part of the Illumina Genomics Analysis pipeline. Alignment of a sequence read can be a 100% sequence match. In some cases, an alignment is less than a 100% sequence match (i.e., non-perfect match, partial match, partial alignment). In some embodiments an alignment is about a 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91%, 90%, 89%, 88%, 87%, 86%, 85%, 84%, 83%, 82%, 81%, 80%, 79%, 78%, 77%, 76% or 75% match. In some embodiments, an alignment comprises a mismatch. In some embodiments, an alignment comprises 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 mismatches. Two or more sequences can be aligned using either strand (e.g., sense or antisense strand). In certain embodiments a nucleic acid sequence is aligned with the reverse complement of another nucleic acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Various computational methods can be used to align and map each sequence read to a genomic portion of the reference genome. Non-limiting examples of computer process that can be used to align sequences include, without limitation, BLAST, BLITZ, FASTA, BOWTIE 1, BOWTIE 2, ELAND, MAQ, PROBEMATCH, SOAP, BWA or SEQMAP, or variations thereof or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, sequence reads are aligned with sequences in a reference genome. In some embodiments, sequence reads are found and/or aligned with sequences in nucleic acid databases known in the art including, for example, GenBank, dbEST, dbSTS, EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) and DDBJ (DNA Databank of Japan). BLAST or similar tools can be used to search identified sequences against a sequence database. Search hits can then be used to sort the identified sequences into appropriate portions (described hereafter), for example.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments, a read may uniquely or non-uniquely map to portions in a reference genome. A read is considered as &#x201c;uniquely mapped&#x201d; if it aligns with a single sequence in the reference genome. A read is considered as &#x201c;non-uniquely mapped&#x201d; if it aligns with two or more sequences in the reference genome. In some embodiments, non-uniquely mapped reads are eliminated from further analysis (e.g. quantification). A certain, small degree of mismatch (0-1) may be allowed to account for single nucleotide polymorphisms that may exist between the reference genome and the reads from individual samples being mapped, in certain embodiments. In some embodiments, no degree of mismatch is allowed for a read mapped to a reference sequence.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">As used herein, the term &#x201c;reference genome&#x201d; can refer to any particular known, sequenced or characterized genome, whether partial or complete, of any organism or virus which may be used to reference identified sequences from a subject. For example, a reference genome used for human subjects as well as many other organisms can be found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information at World Wide Web URL ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. A &#x201c;genome&#x201d; refers to the complete genetic information of an organism or virus, expressed in nucleic acid sequences. As used herein, a reference sequence or reference genome often is an assembled or partially assembled genomic sequence from an individual or multiple individuals. In some embodiments, a reference genome is an assembled or partially assembled genomic sequence from one or more human individuals. In some embodiments, a reference genome comprises sequences assigned to chromosomes.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">At block <b>415</b>, the mapped sequence reads may be grouped together according to various features and assigned to particular portions (e.g., portions of a reference genome). A &#x201c;portion&#x201d; also may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;genomic section,&#x201d; &#x201c;bin,&#x201d; &#x201c;partition,&#x201d; &#x201c;portion of a reference genome,&#x201d; &#x201c;portion of a chromosome&#x201d; or &#x201c;genomic portion.&#x201d; A portion often is defined by partitioning of a genome according to one or more features. Non-limiting examples of certain partitioning features include length (e.g., fixed length, non-fixed length) and other structural features. Genomic portions sometimes include one or more of the following features: fixed length, non-fixed length, random length, non-random length, equal length, unequal length (e.g., at least two of the genomic portions are of unequal length), do not overlap (e.g., the 3&#x2032; ends of the genomic portions sometimes abut the 5&#x2032; ends of adjacent genomic portions), overlap (e.g., at least two of the genomic portions overlap), contiguous, consecutive, not contiguous, and not consecutive. Genomic portions sometimes are about 1 to about 1,000 kilobases in length (e.g., about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 kilobases in length), about 5 to about 500 kilobases in length, about 10 to about 100 kilobases in length, or about 40 to about 60 kilobases in length.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Partitioning sometimes is based on, or is based in part on certain informational features, such as, information content and information gain, for example. Non-limiting examples of certain informational features include speed and/or convenience of alignment, sequencing coverage variability, GC content (e.g., stratified GC content, particular GC contents, high or low GC content), uniformity of GC content, other measures of sequence content (e.g., fraction of individual nucleotides, fraction of pyrimidines or purines, fraction of natural vs. non-natural nucleic acids, fraction of methylated nucleotides, and CpG content), methylation state, duplex melting temperature, amenability to sequencing or PCR, uncertainty value assigned to individual portions of a reference genome, and/or a targeted search for particular features. In some embodiments, information content may be quantified using a p-value profile measuring the significance of particular genomic locations for distinguishing between groups of confirmed normal and abnormal subjects (e.g. euploid and trisomy subjects, respectively).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, partitioning a genome may eliminate similar regions (e.g., identical or homologous regions or sequences) across a genome and only keep unique regions. Regions removed during partitioning may be within a single chromosome, may be one or more chromosomes, or may span multiple chromosomes. In some embodiments, a partitioned genome is reduced and optimized for faster alignment, often focusing on uniquely identifiable sequences.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments, genomic portions result from a partitioning based on non-overlapping fixed size, which results in consecutive, non-overlapping portions of fixed length. Such portions often are shorter than a chromosome and often are shorter than a copy number variation region (e.g., a region that is duplicated or is deleted), the latter of which can be referred to as a segment. A &#x201c;segment&#x201d; or &#x201c;genomic segment&#x201d; often includes two or more fixed-length genomic portions, and often includes two or more consecutive fixed-length portions (e.g., about 2 to about 100 such portions (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 such portions)).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Multiple portions sometimes are analyzed in groups, and sometimes reads mapped to portions are quantified according to a particular group of genomic portions. Where portions are partitioned by structural features and correspond to regions in a genome, portions sometimes are grouped into one or more segments and/or one or more regions. Non-limiting examples of regions include sub-chromosome (i.e., shorter than a chromosome), chromosome, autosome, sex chromosome and combinations thereof. One or more sub-chromosome regions sometimes are genes, gene fragments, regulatory sequences, introns, exons, segments (e.g., a segment spanning a copy number alteration region), microduplications, microdeletions and the like. A region sometimes is smaller than a chromosome of interest or is the same size of a chromosome of interest, and sometimes is smaller than a reference chromosome or is the same size as a reference chromosome.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">At block <b>420</b>, the sequence reads mapped to genomic portions are counted. The counting generates a quantification of the sequence reads mapped to the genomic portions of the reference genome. For example, sequence reads that are mapped or partitioned based on a selected feature or variable can be quantified to determine the amount or number of reads that are mapped to one or more portions (e.g., portion of a reference genome). In certain embodiments the quantity of sequence reads that are mapped to a portion or segment is referred to as a count or read density. A count often is associated with a genomic portion. In some embodiments a count is determined from some or all of the sequence reads mapped to (i.e., associated with) a portion. In certain embodiments, a count is determined from some or all of the sequence reads mapped to a group of portions (e.g., portions in a segment or region (described herein)).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">A count can be determined by a suitable method, operation or algorithm. A count sometimes is the direct sum of all sequence reads mapped to a genomic portion or a group of genomic portions corresponding to a segment, a group of portions corresponding to a sub-region of a genome (e.g., copy number variation region, copy number duplication region, copy number deletion region, microduplication region, microdeletion region, chromosome region, autosome region, sex chromosome region) and/or sometimes is a group of portions corresponding to a genome. A read quantification sometimes is a ratio, and sometimes is a ratio of a quantification for portion(s) in region A to a quantification for portion(s) in region B. Region A sometimes is one portion, segment region, copy number variation region, copy number duplication region, copy number deletion region, microduplication region, microdeletion region, chromosome region, autosome region and/or sex chromosome region. Region B independently sometimes is one portion, segment region, copy number variation region, copy number duplication region, copy number deletion region, microduplication region, microdeletion region, chromosome region, autosome region, sex chromosome region, a region including all autosomes, a region including sex chromosomes and/or a region including all chromosome.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, a count is derived from raw sequence reads and/or filtered sequence reads. In certain embodiments a count is an average, mean or sum of sequence reads mapped to a genomic portion or group of genomic portions (e.g., genomic portions in a region). In some embodiments, a count is associated with an uncertainty value. A count sometimes is adjusted. A count may be adjusted according to sequence reads associated with a genomic portion or group of portions that have been weighted, removed, filtered, normalized, adjusted, averaged, derived as a mean, derived as a median, added, or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">A sequence read quantification sometimes is a read density. A read density may be determined and/or generated for one or more segments of a genome. In certain instances, a read density may be determined and/or generated for one or more chromosomes. In some embodiments a read density comprises a quantitative measure of counts of sequence reads mapped to a segment or portion of a reference genome. A read density can be determined by a suitable process. In some embodiments a read density is determined by a suitable distribution and/or a suitable distribution function. Non-limiting examples of a distribution function include a probability function, probability distribution function, probability density function (PDF), a kernel density function (kernel density estimation), a cumulative distribution function, probability mass function, discrete probability distribution, an absolutely continuous univariate distribution, the like, any suitable distribution, or combinations thereof. A read density may be a density estimation derived from a suitable probability density function. A density estimation is the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an underlying probability density function. In some embodiments a read density comprises a density estimation (e.g., a probability density estimation, a kernel density estimation). A read density may be generated according to a process comprising generating a density estimation for each of the one or more portions of a genome where each portion comprises counts of sequence reads. A read density may be generated for normalized and/or weighted counts mapped to a portion or segment. In some instances, each read mapped to a portion or segment may contribute to a read density, a value (e.g., a count) equal to its weight obtained from a normalization process described herein. In some embodiments read densities for one or more portions or segments are adjusted. Read densities can be adjusted by a suitable method. For example, read densities for one or more portions can be weighted and/or normalized.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Reads quantified for a given portion or segment can be from one source or different sources. In one example, reads may be obtained from nucleic acid from a subject having cancer or suspected of having cancer. In such circumstances, reads mapped to one or more portions often are reads representative of both healthy cells (i.e., non-cancer cells) and cancer cells (e.g., tumor cells). In certain embodiments, some of the reads mapped to a portion are from cancer cell nucleic acid and some of the reads mapped to the same portion are from non-cancer cell nucleic acid. In another example, reads may be obtained from a nucleic acid sample from a pregnant female bearing a fetus. In such circumstances, reads mapped to one or more portions often are reads representative of both the fetus and the mother of the fetus (e.g., a pregnant female subject). In certain embodiments some of the reads mapped to a portion are from a fetal genome and some of the reads mapped to the same portion are from a maternal genome.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">At block <b>425</b>, one or more portions of the reference genome may be filtered or selected. The term &#x201c;filtering&#x201d; as used herein refers to removing portions or portions of a reference genome from consideration. In certain embodiments, one or more portions are filtered (e.g., subjected to a filtering process) thereby providing filtered portions. In some embodiments a filtering process removes certain portions and retains portions (e.g., a subset of portions).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Portions of a reference genome can be selected for removal based on any suitable criteria, including but not limited to redundant data (e.g., redundant or overlapping mapped reads), non-informative data (e.g., portions of a reference genome with zero median counts), portions of a reference genome with over represented or under represented sequences, noisy data, the like, or combinations of the foregoing. A filtering process often involves removing one or more portions of a reference genome from consideration and subtracting the counts in the one or more portions of a reference genome selected for removal from the counted or summed counts for the portions of a reference genome, chromosome or chromosomes, or genome under consideration. In some embodiments, portions of a reference genome can be removed successively (e.g., one at a time to allow evaluation of the effect of removal of each individual portion), and in certain embodiments all portions of a reference genome marked for removal can be removed at the same time. In some embodiments, portions of a reference genome characterized by a variance above or below a certain level are removed, which sometimes is referred to herein as filtering &#x201c;noisy&#x201d; portions of a reference genome. In certain embodiments, a filtering process comprises obtaining data points from a data set that deviate from the mean profile level of a portion, a chromosome, or part of a chromosome by a predetermined multiple of the profile variance, and in certain embodiments, a filtering process comprises removing data points from a data set that do not deviate from the mean profile level of a portion, a chromosome or part of a chromosome by a predetermined multiple of the profile variance. In some embodiments, a filtering process is utilized to reduce the number of candidate portions of a reference genome analyzed for the presence or absence of a genetic variation and/or copy number alteration (e.g., aneuploidy, microdeletion, microduplication). Reducing the number of candidate portions of a reference genome analyzed for the presence or absence of a genetic variation and/or copy number alteration often reduces the complexity and/or dimensionality of a data set, and sometimes increases the speed of searching for and/or identifying genetic variations and/or copy number alterations by two or more orders of magnitude.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Portions may be processed (e.g., filtered and/or selected) by any suitable method and according to any suitable parameter. Non-limiting examples of features and/or parameters that can be used to filter and/or select portions include redundant data (e.g., redundant or overlapping mapped reads), non-informative data (e.g., portions of a reference genome with zero mapped counts), portions of a reference genome with over represented or under represented sequences, noisy data, counts, count variability, coverage, mappability, variability, a repeatability measure, read density, variability of read density, a level of uncertainty, guanine-cytosine (GC) content, CCF fragment length and/or read length (e.g., a fragment length ratio (FLR), a fetal ratio statistic (FRS)), DNase1-sensitivity, methylation state, acetylation, histone distribution, chromatin structure, percent repeats, the like or combinations thereof. Portions can be filtered and/or selected according to any suitable feature or parameter that correlates with a feature or parameter listed or described herein. Portions can be filtered and/or selected according to features or parameters that are specific to a portion (e.g., as determined for a single portion according to multiple samples) and/or features or parameters that are specific to a sample (e.g., as determined for multiple portions within a sample). In some embodiments portions are filtered and/or removed according to relatively low mappability, relatively high variability, a high level of uncertainty, relatively long CCF fragment lengths (e.g., low FRS, low FLR), relatively large fraction of repetitive sequences, high GC content, low GC content, low counts, zero counts, high counts, the like, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments portions (e.g., a subset of portions) are selected according to suitable level of mappability, variability, level of uncertainty, fraction of repetitive sequences, count, GC content, the like, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments portions (e.g., a subset of portions) are selected according to relatively short CCF fragment lengths (e.g., high FRS, high FLR). Counts and/or reads mapped to portions are sometimes processed (e.g., normalized) prior to and/or after filtering or selecting portions (e.g., a subset of portions). In some embodiments counts and/or reads mapped to portions are not processed prior to and/or after filtering or selecting portions (e.g., a subset of portions).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments, portions may be filtered according to a measure of error (e.g., standard deviation, standard error, calculated variance, p-value, mean absolute error (MAE), average absolute deviation and/or mean absolute deviation (MAD)). In certain instances, a measure of error may refer to count variability. In some embodiments portions are filtered according to count variability. In certain embodiments count variability is a measure of error determined for counts mapped to a portion (i.e., portion) of a reference genome for multiple samples (e.g., multiple sample obtained from multiple subjects, e.g., 50 or more, 100 or more, 500 or more 1000 or more, 5000 or more or 10,000 or more subjects). In some embodiments, portions with a count variability above a pre-determined upper range are filtered (e.g., excluded from consideration). In some embodiments portions with a count variability below a pre-determined lower range are filtered (e.g., excluded from consideration). In some embodiments, portions with a count variability outside a pre-determined range are filtered (e.g., excluded from consideration). In some embodiments portions with a count variability within a pre-determined range are selected (e.g., used for determining the presence or absence of a copy number alteration). In some embodiments, count variability of portions represents a distribution (e.g., a normal distribution). In some embodiments portions are selected within a quantile of the distribution. In some embodiments portions within a 99% quantile of the distribution of count variability are selected.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Sequence reads from any suitable number of samples can be utilized to identify a subset of portions that meet one or more criteria, parameters and/or features described herein.

One or more samples from each of the multiple subjects can be addressed (e.g., 1 to about 20 samples from each subject (e.g., about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19 samples)), and a suitable number of subjects may be addressed (e.g., about 2 to about 10,000 subjects (e.g., about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 subjects)). In some embodiments, sequence reads from the same test sample(s) from the same subject are mapped to portions in the reference genome and are used to generate the subset of portions.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Portions can be selected and/or filtered by any suitable method. In some embodiments portions are selected according to visual inspection of data, graphs, plots and/or charts. In certain embodiments portions are selected and/or filtered (e.g., in part) by a system or a machine comprising one or more microprocessors and memory. In some embodiments portions are selected and/or filtered (e.g., in part) by a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium with an executable program stored thereon, where the program instructs a microprocessor to perform the selecting and/or filtering.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, sequence reads derived from a sample are mapped to all or most portions of a reference genome and a pre-selected subset of portions are thereafter selected.

Certain methods for pre-selecting a subset of portions are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0180594, which is incorporated by reference herein. Reads from a selected subset of portions often are utilized in further steps of a determination of the presence or absence of a genetic variation, for example. Often, reads from portions not selected are not utilized in further steps of a determination of the presence or absence of a genetic variation (e.g., reads in the non-selected portions are removed or filtered).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, portions associated with read densities (e.g., where a read density is for a portion) are removed by a filtering process and read densities associated with removed portions are not included in a determination of the presence or absence of a copy number alteration (e.g., a chromosome aneuploidy, microduplication, microdeletion). In some embodiments a read density profile comprises and/or consists of read densities of filtered portions. Portions are sometimes filtered according to a distribution of counts and/or a distribution of read densities. In some embodiments portions are filtered according to a distribution of counts and/or read densities where the counts and/or read densities are obtained from one or more reference samples. One or more reference samples may be referred to herein as a training set. In some embodiments portions are filtered according to a distribution of counts and/or read densities where the counts and/or read densities are obtained from one or more test samples. In some embodiments portions are filtered according to a measure of uncertainty for a read density distribution. In certain embodiments, portions that demonstrate a large deviation in read densities are removed by a filtering process. For example, a distribution of read densities (e.g., a distribution of average mean, or median read densities) can be determined, where each read density in the distribution maps to the same portion. A measure of uncertainty (e.g., a MAD) can be determined by comparing a distribution of read densities for multiple samples where each portion of a genome is associated with measure of uncertainty. According to the foregoing example, portions can be filtered according to a measure of uncertainty (e.g., a standard deviation (SD), a MAD) associated with each portion and a predetermined threshold. In certain instances, portions comprising MAD values within the acceptable range are retained and portions comprising MAD values outside of the acceptable range are removed from consideration by a filtering process. In some embodiments, according to the foregoing example, portions comprising read densities values (e.g., median, average or mean read densities) outside a pre-determined measure of uncertainty are often removed from consideration by a filtering process. In some embodiments portions comprising read densities values (e.g., median, average or mean read densities) outside an inter-quartile range of a distribution are removed from consideration by a filtering process. In some embodiments portions comprising read densities values outside more than 2 times, 3 times, 4 times or 5 times an inter-quartile range of a distribution are removed from consideration by a filtering process. In some embodiments portions comprising read densities values outside more than 2 sigma, 3 sigma, 4 sigma, 5 sigma, 6 sigma, 7 sigma or 8 sigma (e.g., where sigma is a range defined by a standard deviation) are removed from consideration by a filtering process.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">At block <b>430</b>, the mapped reads and counts thereof are output for downstream data processing such as normalization and CNV analysis, as described in detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. Mapped sequence reads that have been counted are referred to herein as sequencing data. In some instances, the sequencing data represents unmanipulated counts (e.g., raw counts). In other instances, the sequencing data represents manipulated counts such as coverage for each reference base within a segment, a median coverage for each segment of the reference genome, and/or a sample median coverage (&#x201c;global median coverage&#x201d;) for all segments in a sample. The base coverage for each reference base within a segment is determined based on the count of sequence reads mapped to each reference base within a segment. The median coverage for each segment is determined based on sorting the base coverage in a list from smallest to the largest (or largest to smallest) and finding a segment median coverage half-way down the sorted list. The sample median coverage for each sample is determined based on sorting the median coverage for each segment in a list from smallest to the largest (or largest to smallest) and finding the sample median coverage half-way down the sorted list, as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. For calculating sample median coverage, segments on a sex chromosome could be excluded so that male and female samples could be analyzed together in the step of a second normalization. Alternatively, segment median coverage on Chromosome X for males could be doubled before being used for sample median coverage calculation, to ensure consistency between male samples and female samples in a second normalization. As described herein, it should be understood that other measures for a central tendency in a numerical data set or other statistical coverages such as mean coverage and mode coverage could also be used in place of median coverage for the segments and/or the global median coverage to obtain similar results with similar performance in many cases.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, sequence read data in a data set can be processed further (e.g., processed using mathematical approaches, statistical approaches, artificial intelligence approaches, or any combination thereof) and/or displayed to facilitate providing an outcome such as CNV analysis. In certain embodiments, data sets, including larger data sets, may benefit from pre-processing to facilitate further analysis. Pre-processing of data sets sometimes involves removal of redundant and/or uninformative portions or portions of a reference genome (e.g., portions of a reference genome with uninformative data, redundant mapped reads, portions with zero median counts, over represented or under represented sequences), or removal/exclusion of uninformative or noisy segments. Without being limited by theory, data processing and/or preprocessing may (i) remove noisy data, (ii) remove uninformative data, (iii) remove redundant data, (iv) reduce the complexity of larger data sets, and/or (v) facilitate transformation of the data from one form into one or more other forms.

The terms &#x201c;threshold&#x201d; and &#x201c;threshold value&#x201d; herein refer to any number that is calculated using a qualifying data set and serves as a limit of diagnosis of a genetic variation (e.g., a copy number alteration, an aneuploidy, a microduplication, a microdeletion, a chromosomal aberration, and the like). In certain embodiments, a threshold is exceeded by results obtained by methods described herein and a subject is diagnosed with a copy number alteration. A threshold value or range of values often is calculated by mathematically and/or statistically manipulating sequence read data (e.g., from a reference and/or subject), in some embodiments, and in certain embodiments, sequence read data manipulated to generate a threshold value or range of values is sequence read data (e.g., from a reference and/or subject). In some embodiments, an uncertainty value is determined. An uncertainty value generally is a measure of variance or error and can be any suitable measure of variance or error.

The splitting the data assets <b>745</b> into training and validation sets <b>745</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be performed randomly (e.g., a 90/10% or 70/30%) or the splitting may be performed in accordance with a more complex validation technique such as K-Fold Cross-Validation, Leave-one-out Cross-Validation, Leave-one-group-out Cross-Validation, Nested Cross-Validation, or the like to minimize sampling bias and overfitting.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The training data <b>745</b><i>a </i>may include at least a subset of data from prior samples. The data includes raw coverage values, median coverage values as described with respect to the first normalization, mean coverage values as described with respect to the second normalization, copy numbers and a normal profile for each element in a sample, p-value, a z-score, and/or a coefficient of variation for each element in a sample, the GC-content for each element in a sample, or any combination thereof. The data can be obtained in various ways including image or text. For example, if the historical data is provided as images of sequencing data, the data preparation <b>730</b> may convert the images to text using an image-to-text converter (not shown) that performs text recognition (e.g., optical character recognition) to determine the text within the image. Additionally or alternatively, the data preparation module <b>730</b> may standardize the format of the data. In some instances, the data is provided by a second party or a third party for purposes of training a prediction model. The training data <b>745</b><i>a </i>for a prediction model <b>825</b> may include the historical data and labels <b>850</b> corresponding to the true positives of true negatives for absence or presence of CNV. For example, for each sample, an indication of the correct CNV call to be inferred by the prediction model <b>725</b> may be provided as ground truth information for labels <b>750</b>. In some instances, the labels <b>750</b> may be obtained from a data structure used to maintain data consistency across training samples. The behavior of the prediction model <b>725</b> can then be adapted (e.g., through back-propagation) to minimize the difference between the generated inferences for various entities and the ground truth information.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The model training framework <b>740</b> performs the processes of determining hyperparameters for the model <b>725</b> and performing iterative operations of inputting examples from the training data <b>745</b><i>a </i>into the model <b>725</b> to find a set of model parameters (e.g., weights and/or biases) that minimizes a cost function(s) such as loss or error function for the model <b>725</b>. The hyperparameters are settings that can be tuned or optimized to control the behavior of the model <b>725</b>. Most models explicitly define hyperparameters that control different features of the models such as memory or cost of execution. However, additional hyperparameters may be defined to adapt the model <b>725</b> to a specific scenario. For example, the hyperparameters may include the number of hidden units of a model, the learning rate of a model, the convolution kernel width, the number of kernels for a model, the maximum depth of a tree in a random forest, a minimum sample split, a maximum number of leaf nodes, a minimum number of leaf nodes, and the like. The cost function can be constructed to measure the difference between the outputs inferred using the models <b>745</b> and the ground truth annotated to the samples using the labels. For example, for a supervised learning-based model, the goal of the training is to learn a function &#x201c;h( )&#x201d; (also sometimes referred to as the hypothesis function) that maps the training input space X to the target value space Y, h: X&#x2192;Y, such that h(x) is a good predictor for the corresponding value of y. Various different techniques may be used to learn this hypothesis function. In some techniques, as part of deriving the hypothesis function, the cost or loss function may be defined that measures the difference between the ground truth value for an input and the predicted value for that input. As part of training, techniques such as back propagation, random feedback, Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA), Indirect Feedback Alignment (IFA), Hebbian learning, and the like are used to minimize this cost or loss function.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Once the set of model parameters are identified, the model <b>725</b> has been trained and the model training framework <b>740</b> performs the additional processes of testing or validation using the subset of testing data <b>745</b><i>b </i>(testing or validation data set). The testing or validation processes includes iterative operations of inputting utterances from the subset of testing data <b>745</b><i>b </i>into the model <b>725</b> using a validation technique such as K-Fold Cross-Validation, Leave-one-out Cross-Validation, Leave-one-group-out Cross-Validation, Nested Cross-Validation, or the like to tune the hyperparameters and ultimately find the optimal set of hyperparameters. Once the optimal set of hyperparameters are obtained, a reserved test set from the subset of test data <b>745</b><i>a </i>may be input into the model <b>725</b> to obtain output (in this example, one or more recognized entities), and the output is evaluated versus ground truth entities using correlation techniques such as Bland-Altman method and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Further, performance metrics <b>755</b> may be calculated in evaluation stage <b>715</b> such as the error, accuracy, precision, recall, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), etc. The metrics <b>755</b> may be used in the evaluation stage <b>715</b> to analyze performance of the model <b>725</b> for providing recommendations.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The model training stage <b>710</b> outputs trained models including one or more trained prediction models <b>760</b>.

It should be appreciated that the statistical measure is not limited to p-value or z-score. Any statistical measure having a similar function as p-value may be used in the CNV detection step.

A copy number for an element in the target sample is compared to a predetermined interval to see if the copy number falls into the predetermined interval. The copy number for an element is treated as an abnormal copy number if the copy number does not fall into the predetermined interval. For example, a predetermined interval may be [0.7, 1.3].

The machine-learning model outputs a classification for the presence or absence of the copy number variation for each segment (optionally classification of abnormal as duplication or deletion) in a target set according to the operation of the decision trees. Advantageously, the machine-learning based approach trained on previously confirmed copy number variation samples has better sensitivity and specificity compared to the rule-based approaches, and does not require hard cutoffs or thresholds for p-values and double normalized copy numbers to call the copy number variations.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">At block <b>835</b>, a detection of CNV is reported based on the classification for an element by the machine learning model.

Sample <b>1</b> is one of the plurality of the samples and its sequencing data, including a median coverage for each segment, has been obtained through MPS sequencing methods. A target set has been determined for detection of a certain type of CNVs. In some instances, elements in the target set are chromosomes and each chromosome covers a number of different segments, and there is no overlapped segment between two different elements. In some instances, elements in the target set are genes and different genes may cover a same segment. Pseudo numbers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrate an instance when elements in a target set share one or more segments. For example, Element A and Element B in the target set share both Segment <b>1</b> and Segment <b>2</b>. When considering local median coverage for Element A and Element B, Segment <b>1</b> and Segment <b>2</b> will be taken into account in both elements. It should be appreciated that it is possible that not all elements share a segment with another element in the target set. and it is possible that no element has a same segment with another element in the target set. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> should not be appreciated as a limitation in any purpose.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">A local median coverage for each element in a target set in a sample and a global median coverage for all segments in the sample should be determined before performing a first normalization. Only segments covered by an element in the target set will be considered in determining the local median coverage for the element. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, when determining the local median coverage for Element A, only Segments <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> are considered. To determine the local median coverage for Element A, median coverages of Segments <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> are arranged from the smallest to the largest (<b>1054</b> for Segment <b>3</b>, <b>1064</b> for Segment <b>1</b>, and <b>1099</b> for Segment <b>2</b>) and the middle number (<b>1064</b>) is the local median coverage for Element A. It should be appreciated that the sorting of median coverages and the selecting of a middle number can be done temporarily and there is no need to store sorting information. It should be also appreciated that the arranging of median coverages can be from the largest to the smallest. If there is an even number of segments in the element, the median can be either (i) one of the two numbers in the middle, or (ii) a mathematical mean of the two numbers in the middle.

After sorting all the median coverages, a median (<b>1060</b>) can be found and be assigned to the global median coverage for all segments in Sample <b>1</b>. In many instances, each segment in the sample is covered by at least one element.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the first normalized coverage for Element A equals the local median coverage for Element A (<b>1064</b>) divided by the global median coverage (<b>1060</b>). The way to determine a local median coverage can be applied to each element in each target set in each sample.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">A first normalization was performed within each sample, while a second normalization was performed across samples. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, a second normalization was performed for Element B across Sample <b>1</b> to Sample Z. A second normalized coverage for Element B in each sample was determined based on a first normalized coverage for Element B in each sample and a mean coverage. The mean coverage is a mathematical average of all first normalized coverage for Element B. One method to determine the second normalized coverage for Element B in a sample is to divide the first normalized coverage for Element B in the sample by the mean coverage, as shown in the third column in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>.

In most instances, the adjustment is to double the coverage numbers or to double the first normalized coverage. Once the adjustment to the &#x201c;raw&#x201d; coverages for elements on Chromosome X is done, the normal male and female subjects will both have the copy numbers centered around 1.0 (the expected copy number), and any significant deviations would indicate likely abnormal copy numbers in the sample.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a CNV detection result on Chromosome X from a female subject. A circle marks abnormal second normalized coverage for every gene on Chromosome X from a female subject. The abnormal second normalized coverage suggests a CNV on the whole Chromosome X. The values of the second normalized coverage are around 1.5 comparing to a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; second normalized coverage of value 1.0, which suggests the female subject has an extra sex chromosome, consistent with the finding of an independent method. This CNV detection information can be further used in disease diagnosis, administration of a treatment to the female subject, or the like.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a CNV detection of a partial chromosomal loss on Chromosome X from female subjects. A circle marks abnormal second normalized coverage for three genes (PDHA1, DMD and, OTC) on the p-arm of Chromosome X from a female subject, while its second normalized coverage for the other two genes (IL2RG and IDS) on the q-arm of Chromosome X are not abnormal. The abnormal second normalized coverage suggests a CNV on partial Chromosome X. The values of the abnormal second normalized coverage are around 0.5 comparing to a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; second normalized coverage of value 1.0 for the three genes on the p-arm of Chromosome X, which suggests the female subject has partial or complete loss of the p-arm of her Chromosome X, while the q-arm is intact or mostly intact with both copies, consistent with the finding of an independent method. This CNV detection information can also be used in disease diagnosis, administration of a treatment to the female subject, or the like.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows that the detection method is also compatible to perform exon-scale CNV detection. Points having a value around 0.5 suggest the corresponding exons are missing one copy. The rectangular marks a distribution of the second normalized coverage of DMD-X79 exon, the base pair length of which is only 52. This experiment result also suggests the exon CNV detection using the disclosed method is not affected by small region size.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0195">A further experiment shows that CNV detection can be performed in combination of gene-level and exon-level. The circle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> marks a critical second normalized coverage for Gene GALC. The value of the circled second normalized coverage is around 0.75, which is not close enough to be an absolute abnormal value, but could suggest maybe partial gene is missing. A further &#x201c;zoom-in&#x201d; into the exon-level CNV detection shows that Exons 11-17 of GALC are missing one copy, as illustrated by FIG.<b>16</b>B. The breakpoint between exon 10 and 11 has been confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The results suggest that CNV detection can be performed in combination of neighboring exons or even bins to provide a streamline CNV reporting.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0000">IV.C. An Experiment with 10000 Samples</p><p id="p-0199" num="0196">Real-world experiments were performed with about 10000 samples in about 110 flowcells. The experiments used machine learning approaches including use of a random forest model developed based on historical sample data including raw coverage values, the copy number for elements, the normal profile of the elements, p-values, z-scores, and GC %. Examining the overall performance of the experiments using the disclosed machine learning approaches, ROC curve and the area under the curve (AUC) (indicative of model discriminatory power) show a sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR) of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.995 (and a false positive rate of 0.005). The discriminatory power of the model using the disclosed method thus is 0.9999, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> shows that the machine learning model was able to correctly identify a presence of a CNV (deletions) in a number of instances where the rule-based approaches had failed to identify the presence of the CNV.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">V.
