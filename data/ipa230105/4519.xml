In embodiments, an unknown USB supply (e.g., a USB port of a television) that is connected to a CPE (customer premise equipment) device (e.g., a STB (set-top box)) may be tested to determine a current draw capacity of the USB supply. For example, the CPE device may test the USB supply to determine whether the USB supply is capable of supplying a predetermined current (e.g., 1 A). If the determination is made that the USB supply is not able to supply the predetermined current, an end-user may be instructed to plug an alternative PSU (power supply unit) into the CPE device, wherein the alternative PSU is capable of supplying the predetermined current to the CPE device. For example, the CPE device may output an indication that an alternative PSU should be used via a graphics output to a display device through an HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface) connection or via an LED indication using one or more LEDs at the CPE device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example CPE device <b>105</b> that is connected to a display device <b>110</b>, the CPE device <b>105</b> being operable to facilitate current draw capacity testing. In embodiments, a CPE device <b>105</b> (e.g., STB (set-top box), television dongle, or other multimedia device) may be connected to a display device <b>110</b> (e.g., television or other display device) through a connection to a USB port <b>115</b> of the display device <b>110</b>, and the CPE device <b>105</b> may be further connected to the display device <b>110</b> through an HDMI connection (e.g., HDMI cable <b>120</b>). For example, a USB cable <b>125</b> may be connected to the USB port <b>115</b> of the display device at one end and to a connector <b>130</b> (e.g., a USB port or other connector) of the CPE device <b>105</b> at the other end, and the HDMI cable <b>120</b> may be connected to an HDMI port <b>135</b> of the display device at one end and to a connector <b>140</b> (e.g., an HDMI port or other connector) of the CPE device <b>105</b> at the other end. As another example, the CPE device <b>105</b> may include a USB connector and/or an HDMI connector, each of which may be plugged directly into the USB port <b>115</b> of the display device <b>110</b> and/or the HDMI port <b>135</b> of the display device <b>110</b> respectively.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Upon each boot, a power test may be run by the CPE device <b>105</b>, wherein the CPE device <b>105</b> tests the ability of an unknown USB supply (e.g., the USB port <b>115</b> of a display device <b>110</b> to which the CPE device <b>105</b> is connected) to supply a predetermined current. The predetermined current may be a current draw applied during a normal operation of the CPE device. When the current draw capacity test is initiated, the CPE device <b>105</b> may generate and apply a current load, wherein the current load is applied differently during the current draw capacity test than a current draw being applied during a normal operation of the CPE device. The power test may commence with a low (e.g., sub 500 mA) known DC loaded state in order to make sure that the system is good before the test commences. The power test may be completed without shutting down the unknown USB supply (e.g., the USB port <b>115</b> and/or the display device <b>110</b> to which the CPE device <b>105</b> is connected). The power test may be completed without having error messages generated by the display device <b>110</b> and displayed on the display device <b>110</b>. The minimum current delivery of the USB supply may be 500 mA and CPE device <b>105</b> power during operation may vary from &#x2dc;0.3 A to 1 A.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">If, during the power test, the CPE device <b>105</b> determines that the unknown USB supply cannot supply the predetermined current, the CPE device <b>105</b> may output a notification instructing a user to plug the CPE device <b>105</b> into an alternative PSU (power supply unit) <b>145</b>. The CPE device <b>105</b> may determine whether the USB port is capable of supporting the current draw applied during the normal operation of the customer premise equipment device, and the CPE device may output a notification when the determination is made that the USB port is not capable of supporting the current draw applied during the normal operation of the customer premise equipment device. For example, the CPE device <b>105</b> may generate a visual and/or audible notification, and the visual and/or audible notification may be output from the CPE device <b>105</b> to the display device <b>110</b> through the HDMI connection. The visual and/or audible notification may be displayed, or otherwise output, by the display device <b>110</b>. As another example, the CPE device <b>105</b> may utilize one or more light indicators (e.g., LED(s)) to output an LED indication associated with the failed power test.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In embodiments, loading of the current draw may be carried out via a progressive loading. For example, current drawn from the unknown USB supply may be progressively loaded while monitoring the voltage at each stage to detect when it drops below a critical threshold, thereby indicating that the unknown USB supply will not be able to provide enough power. This may be accomplished by ramping up the SW drive in known steps until a predetermined current limit (e.g., 1 A) is reached.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In embodiments, loading of the current draw may be carried out via a pulsed loading. For example, a predetermined current load (e.g., 1 A) may be pulsed in a controlled manner in a duration that is short enough to prevent the overcurrent trip from fully activating. The current load may be pulsed by removing the full load periodically. The current load may be released as soon as possible once the threshold is triggered to avoid the possibility of overloading the USB supply to the point that the USB supply is disabled.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When using pulsed loading to generate a predetermined current load (e.g., 1 A), a steady state of SW may be utilized. During pulsed loading, the applied current load may be a pulsed current load that is equivalent to the current draw applied during the normal operation of the customer premise equipment device, wherein current load is removed periodically. For example, to generate a 1 A current load, a SW loader may be taken to &#x2dc;400 mA and a known load (e.g., &#x2014;600 mA) may then be applied to mimic a total of 1 A. It should be understood that the actual current values may be adjusted according to various parameters associated with a use case.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example CPE device <b>105</b> that is operable to facilitate current draw capacity testing using a power monitor <b>205</b>.

When progressive (i.e., stepped) loading is used, a predetermined current load (e.g., 1 A) may be sourced from current load source <b>210</b> by adding more functions in a controlled manner, and the current load test module <b>220</b> may read back voltage values from a power monitor <b>205</b> (e.g., I2C (inter-integrated circuit) power monitor). For example, at each respective one stage of one or more stages, the current load source <b>210</b> may increase a sourced amount of current (e.g., current sourced by SW or current sourced by the unknown USB supply may be increased by incremental amounts), and at the end of the respective stage, the current load test module <b>220</b> may read the resulting voltage value from the power monitor <b>205</b> and determine whether the voltage has dropped below a threshold. If the resulting voltage value is not below the threshold, the current load test module <b>220</b> may initiate a next stage at which the sourced amount of current is again increased and the resulting voltage value is read. The current load test module <b>220</b> may determine that the unknown USB supply cannot supply a predetermined current when the current load test module <b>220</b> identifies a voltage drop (from the voltage values recovered from the power monitor <b>205</b>) below a critical threshold.

In embodiments, the brownout detector <b>405</b> may be used to detect, for example, a 3V negative going threshold. The potential divider may be set to provide a 3.08V level when the VBUS+5V rail passes 4.85V drop (it should be understood that these threshold levels may be adjusted to suit). The brownout detector <b>405</b> input to the system-on-chip (SoC) (set to be an interrupt) may be monitored during the test period (e.g., by the current load test module <b>420</b>). The brownout detector <b>405</b> signal may be asserted within, for example, 20 us of the brownout threshold voltage being reached and may remain asserted for, for example, 220 ms. If the DC can withstand the load, then there is no change. If a drop appears beyond the predetermined brownout threshold, then a negative pulse will occur from the brownout detector <b>405</b> into the gate <b>425</b> (e.g., a logic gate such as AND gate U12001).
