No. 17/327,408 filed on May 21, 2021 and entitled, &#x201c;DECK EXTENDER FOR WATERCRAFT&#x201d;, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Inventions</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventions relate to personal watercraft, and more specifically, accessories such as deck extenders for personal watercraft.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional personal watercraft accessory platform is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,577,057. This personal watercraft platform is modular and removable for providing storage and a workspace above the rear deck of a PWC. The modular watercraft platform includes a generally flat upper and lower surface supported by a plurality of vertical struts spacing the lower surface of the platform above the original rear deck of the watercraft.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another conventional personal watercraft accessory is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,517,824. This personal watercraft accessory includes a removable rear extension for the aft end of the watercraft which includes a longitudinal channel that receives a portion of the propulsion system and through which a stream of water is directed for purposes of propulsion for the associated watercraft. This deck extension includes numerous surfaces and wall portions meant to conform to portions of the lower hull of the watercraft that sit below the waterline.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of at least one of the inventions disclosed herein includes the realization that a deck extender for a watercraft can be supported in a cantilevered configuration. Such a deck extender can have an upper support surface that extends beyond an edge of an original watercraft deck with attachment and support surfaces of the deck above the water line providing a substantial portion or all of the structural support for the deck extender. For example, a deck extender for a watercraft can include sleeve members fixed to the upper deck and a deck portion having tabs that extend into the sleeves, wherein the sleeves resist uplift of the tabs. A further outboard portion of the deck extender can contact a portion of the deck of the watercraft so as to provide a support with sufficient strength such that an outboard portion of the deck can extend beyond an edge of the watercraft in a cantilevered fashion. Further, such a configuration lends itself to a low profile configuration, thereby avoiding separate vertical struts for spacing the removable deck away from the upper deck of the watercraft. As such, a deck extender can have a low profile and the cantilevered configuration can effectively extend an upper deck surface of the watercraft for example, but without limitation, four inches or more beyond an edge of the watercraft.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the upper surface of the deck extender, when installed in use, is generally parallel or substantially parallel to a surface of the water when the watercraft is at rest in a body of water. This can be advantageous because some watercraft include sloped rear deck areas, for example, behind the rearmost seat, that slope gently towards the waterline and rearwardly away from the rear seat. This configuration is common and more optimized for watersports and weight reduction of the watercraft. However, some users prefer to have additional, relatively level and flat space at the rear of a watercraft for facilitating other activities according to their preference. Thus, providing an extended flat surface, generally parallel to the waterline of the watercraft, can provide further conveniences for some users.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, in some embodiments, a deck extender for a watercraft can comprise a deck member comprising an upper support surface, a lower surface, and first and second mounting tabs configured with sufficient strength to support the deck member in a cantilevered configuration on a rear portion of an upper deck of a personal watercraft.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

inventions disclosed herein are described below in the context of accessories for personal watercraft because the inventions disclosed herein have particular utility in this context. However, the inventions disclosed herein are applicable to other contexts as well. Further, the personal watercraft described below are illustrated in several different orientations including a static orientation, in which the watercraft floats in still water in a displacement mode of buoyancy, a transition orientation in which the watercraft, during acceleration, moves from a displacement mode of buoyancy to a planing mode, and a planing orientation in which a watercraft is moving at a speed sufficient to support the watercraft on the surface of the water with a minimal amount of the hull being wetted and in contact with the water.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a side view of a personal watercraft <b>1</b> with a deck extender <b>100</b> according to an embodiment wherein the personal watercraft <b>1</b> is at rest floating in a body of water, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrating the personal watercraft <b>1</b> being in a state of transition between displacement mode and planing, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrating the personal watercraft <b>1</b> in a planing mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view of the personal watercraft <b>1</b> including the deck extender <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged side elevational view of a rear portion of the personal watercraft <b>1</b> with the deck extender <b>100</b> and illustrating a movement of a lid over a rear storage portion on the personal watercraft <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> includes a hull <b>2</b>, a deck <b>3</b>, a seat <b>4</b>, and a steering handle <b>5</b>. The deck <b>3</b>, which can be referred to as an upper deck, can be attached to the hull along a bond flange. The deck <b>3</b> can include a seat pedestal <b>3</b>A. The seat <b>4</b> and the steering handle <b>5</b> are disposed above the deck <b>3</b>. The seat <b>4</b> and the steering handle <b>5</b> are supported on the deck <b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the seat <b>4</b> and the steering handle <b>5</b> are disposed at a central portion of the personal watercraft <b>1</b> in the right-left direction. The seat <b>4</b> is disposed at the rear of the steering handle <b>5</b> and is supported by the seat pedestal <b>3</b>A. The seat <b>4</b> extends in the front-rear direction in a plan view. The seat <b>4</b> has, for example, a three-seater configuration. The seat <b>4</b> is not limited to a three-seater configuration, and may have a two-seater configuration or a single-seater configuration.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> further includes an engine <b>6</b> and a jet pump <b>7</b>. The engine <b>6</b> is disposed inside the hull <b>2</b>. The jet pump <b>7</b> is disposed at the rear portion of the hull <b>2</b>. The engine <b>6</b> is disposed forward relative to the jet pump <b>7</b>. The seat <b>4</b> is disposed above the engine <b>6</b>. The deck <b>3</b> includes a platform <b>8</b> disposed at the stern of the personal watercraft <b>1</b>. The platform <b>8</b> slopes gently downwardly, away from the seat <b>4</b> and toward the waterline. The jet pump <b>7</b> is disposed below the platform <b>8</b>. The jet pump <b>7</b> is driven by the engine <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> is illustrated in a stationary state floating in water, and due to its buoyancy, to a depth shown relative to the waterline. The depth at which the personal watercraft <b>1</b> reaches beneath the waterline depends on the total weight and the volume of water displaced by the hull of the personal watercraft <b>1</b>. As noted above, the platform <b>8</b> which forms a rear deck of the personal watercraft <b>1</b>, slopes gently away from the seat <b>4</b> and toward the waterline W. In accordance with some embodiments, the deck extender <b>100</b> can be configured such that its upper surface <b>120</b> extends generally parallel to the waterline when the personal watercraft <b>1</b> is at rest and floating in water. In some embodiments, the upper support surface <b>120</b> of the deck extender <b>100</b> is not perfectly parallel with the waterline, however, may be closer to parallel with the waterline than the surface of the platform <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, when the personal watercraft <b>1</b> is accelerated from stationary or slow movement within water, towards a planing state, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> moves through a transition orientation in which the front end of the personal watercraft rises out of the water. In some embodiments, the deck extender <b>100</b> can be configured such that it does not make contact with a surface of the water when the personal watercraft <b>1</b> is in transition.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">After further acceleration, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> will reach a planing state, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. For a watercraft such as the personal watercraft illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a planing state may be reached at speeds above 15-20 miles per hour. In a planing state, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, a much smaller area of the bottom surface of the hull <b>2</b> remains in contact with the water thus and as such, a smaller amount of the hull <b>2</b> is wetted during forward movement, thereby significantly reducing the hydrodynamic drag between the hull <b>2</b> and the water.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, while a small portion of the platform <b>8</b> can be substantially the horizontal below the rear end <b>4</b>A of the seat <b>4</b>, the rearward-most portion of a platform <b>8</b> slopes gently downwardly towards the waterline W. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the platform <b>8</b> preferably has a quadrilateral shape in a plan view. The right and left sides and the rear side of the platform <b>8</b> are open. In a state in which the personal watercraft <b>1</b> floats in water, the platform <b>8</b> is higher than the waterline W. Therefore, when the deck extender <b>100</b> is removed, a passenger can climb down into water from a position on the platform <b>8</b> through the lateral side or rear side of the platform <b>8</b>. Further, a passenger can move from a position in water onto the platform <b>8</b> through the lateral side or rear side of the platform <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The jet pump <b>7</b> is arranged to generate a propulsive force by jetting water suctioned from below, rearwardly. In detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the jet pump <b>7</b> includes an impeller <b>9</b> joined to the engine <b>6</b> and a steering nozzle <b>10</b> disposed at the rear of the impeller <b>9</b>. The impeller <b>9</b> is disposed in a flow passage <b>11</b> provided inside the personal watercraft <b>1</b>. A first end portion of the flow passage <b>11</b> defines an intake <b>12</b> open at the bottom surface of the hull <b>2</b>, and a second end portion of the flow passage <b>11</b> defines an outlet <b>13</b> opened at the steering nozzle <b>10</b>. The steering nozzle <b>10</b> is arranged to turn to the right or left according to an operation of the steering handle <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the impeller <b>9</b> is driven to rotate by the engine <b>6</b>, water is suctioned from the intake <b>12</b> into the flow passage <b>11</b>. A such, the portion of the flow passage <b>11</b> downstream from the impeller <b>9</b> can be considered as the high-pressure side of the jet pump <b>7</b>. Water suctioned from the intake <b>12</b>, pumped into the flow passage <b>11</b> by the impeller <b>9</b>, and is then jetted from the outlet through the steering nozzle <b>10</b>. Accordingly, a propulsive force is generated to propel the personal watercraft <b>1</b>. When the steering handle <b>5</b> is operated, the direction of the steering nozzle <b>10</b> changes, and the jetting direction of water from the steering nozzle <b>10</b> changes. Therefore, the steering handle <b>5</b> is arranged to change the jetting direction of water from the jet pump <b>7</b>. The personal watercraft <b>1</b> is steered by operation of the steering handle <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> further includes a cooling water passage <b>14</b> and a washing water passage <b>15</b> disposed inside the personal watercraft <b>1</b>. The cooling water passage <b>14</b> connects the engine <b>6</b> with the high pressure side of the jet pump <b>7</b>. A portion of water pumped into the flow passage <b>11</b> by the jet pump <b>7</b> is supplied into the cooling water passage <b>14</b>. Water supplied into the cooling water passage <b>14</b> is thereby supplied to a water jacket provided in the engine <b>6</b>. Accordingly, the engine <b>6</b> is cooled.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the deck <b>3</b> includes a seat support portion <b>50</b> which supports the seat <b>4</b>, and a cover <b>60</b> covering the seat support portion <b>50</b> at a height between the rear end <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the seat <b>4</b> and the platform <b>8</b> from the rear side. The cover <b>60</b> includes an outer wall <b>19</b>, and the seat support portion <b>50</b> includes an inner wall <b>20</b>. The platform <b>8</b> and the inner wall <b>20</b> preferably are integral with each other, and the outer wall <b>19</b> is separate from the platform <b>8</b> and the inner wall <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The washing water passage <b>15</b> includes a first end portion <b>16</b> connected to the cooling water passage <b>14</b>, a second end portion <b>17</b> connected to an article storage space S<b>1</b>, described in greater detail below. A check valve <b>18</b> is arranged such that water flows in only a direction from the second end portion <b>17</b> to the first end portion <b>16</b>. Therefore, even if water flows into the washing water passage <b>15</b> from the cooling water passage <b>14</b>, this water is checked by the check valve <b>18</b>. On the other hand, water supplied into the washing water passage <b>15</b> from the second end portion <b>17</b> flows into the cooling water passage <b>14</b> through the check valve <b>18</b>. The cooling water passage <b>14</b> and the water jacket can be washed with water supplied from the washing water passage <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Optionally, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> can include a visibility nozzle <b>8</b>A disposed on the platform <b>8</b>. A passage <b>8</b>B can connect the nozzle <b>8</b>A with the high-pressure side of the jet pump <b>7</b>. The passage <b>8</b>B can feed water from the high-pressure side of the jet pump <b>7</b> to the nozzle <b>8</b>A which can eject water upwardly into the air during use.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the article storage space S<b>1</b> is disposed rearward relative to the engine <b>6</b>. The article storage space S<b>1</b> is disposed at a height between the rear end <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the seat <b>4</b> and the platform <b>8</b>. The article storage space S<b>1</b> is disposed forward relative to the rear end of the platform <b>8</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the outer wall <b>19</b> defines an opening O<b>1</b> accessible to the article storage space S<b>1</b>. The opening O<b>1</b> penetrates through the outer wall <b>19</b> in the front-rear direction. The opening O<b>1</b> is disposed at the rear of the article storage space S<b>1</b>. The article storage space S<b>1</b> is accessible from the rear side through the opening O<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the outer wall <b>19</b> includes a lid <b>21</b> arranged to open and close the opening O<b>1</b>. The deck <b>3</b> further includes a hinge <b>22</b> which joins the lid <b>21</b> and the deck <b>3</b>. The hinge <b>22</b> is provided on the lower portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the lid <b>21</b>. The lid <b>21</b> is rotatable around the hinge <b>22</b> between a closed position at which the lid <b>21</b> closes the opening O<b>1</b> and an opened position at which the lid <b>21</b> opens the opening O<b>1</b>. The hinge <b>22</b> is arranged to function as a grip.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the personal watercraft <b>1</b> further includes a mount grip <b>23</b> having a U shape in a plan view disposed along the rear portion of the seat <b>4</b>. The mount grip <b>23</b> extends forward along the rear portion of the seat <b>4</b> from the rear end <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the seat <b>4</b>. The mount grip <b>23</b> includes a grip portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>provided at the rear end portion of the mount grip <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hinge <b>22</b> is disposed rearward relative to the grip portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and lower than the grip portion <b>23</b><i>a</i>. Further, the hinge <b>22</b> is disposed lower than the seat <b>4</b>. The hinge <b>22</b> is closer to the platform <b>8</b> than the grip portion <b>23</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">By opening the lid <b>21</b>, the passenger can take articles out of and put articles into the article storage space S<b>1</b> through the opening O<b>1</b> while remaining on the platform <b>8</b> or the deck extender <b>100</b>. Further, the opening O<b>1</b> is disposed near the rear end <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the seat <b>4</b>, so that the passenger can take articles out of and put articles into the article storage space S<b>1</b> through the opening O<b>1</b> while sitting on the seat <b>4</b>. Further, the outer wall <b>19</b> is inclined such that the upper end <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the outer wall <b>19</b> is positioned forward relative to the lower end <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the outer wall <b>19</b>, so that the passenger sitting on the seat <b>4</b> easily accesses the article storage space S<b>1</b> as compared with, for example, a case where the outer wall <b>19</b> extends vertically. Therefore, the passenger can easily access the article storage space S<b>1</b> from a position on either the deck <b>3</b> or the seat <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Additionally, in some embodiments, the deck extender <b>100</b> can include a generally U-shaped removable deck member that includes a bite portion that provides clearance around the lower end of the lid <b>21</b> and thus allows the lid <b>21</b> to be moved easily between the closed and open states illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the deck extender <b>100</b> can include a mounting portion <b>102</b> and a deck member <b>104</b>. The mounting portion <b>102</b> can include one or more mounting sleeve portions <b>106</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting portion <b>102</b> includes a right-side mounting sleeve <b>106</b> and a left-side mounting sleeve <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The mounting sleeves <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> can be generally channel-shaped, in cross-section. The mounting sleeve <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b> are configured to be mounted at a forward portion of the platform <b>8</b> on either side of the seat pedestal <b>3</b>A. In some embodiments, the mounting sleeve portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are configured to be mounted just rearward from an apex of the deck <b>3</b> that forms the foot wells of the watercraft <b>1</b>, which reaches a maximum depth portion along lateral sides of the seat pedestal <b>3</b>A, and reaches an apex just forward of the illustrated position of the mounting sleeve portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. The surface on either side of the seat pedestal <b>3</b><i>a </i>extends rearward from the apex and into the platform <b>8</b> which may extend generally horizontally in an area just rearward from the seat pedestal, and then gently slopes towards the waterline.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Positioned as such, the mounting sleeve <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> form a generally low profile superstructure of the deck and thus do not present an excessive obstruction of access to the foot wells. For example, water can enter the foot wells during use of the personal watercraft <b>1</b>. When a watercraft accelerates through a transition speed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), water in the foot wells can drain rearwardly flowing over the apex of the deck <b>3</b> at the rear of the foot wells.

For example in the illustrated embodiment, the recess <b>330</b> is generally channel-shaped, defining a concave channel disposed adjacent to support surfaces <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>. The two support surfaces <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> can be sized so as to support the bottom surface with portions of the frame member <b>302</b> and can include apertures <b>336</b> aligned with the apertures <b>308</b> of the frame member <b>302</b>, and thereby configured to receive the threaded fasteners <b>310</b>, when assembled.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">With the recess <b>330</b> positioned as such, a portion of the frame member <b>302</b> overlies an open upper end of the recess <b>330</b>, thereby creating a receptacle <b>340</b> beneath the frame member <b>302</b> and within the channel <b>330</b>. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, when assembled, the frame member <b>302</b> and the recess <b>330</b> form a receptacle <b>340</b>, therebetween. The receptacle <b>340</b> can be used for optional modes of operation for securing accessories to the mounting mechanism <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>, when the anchor member <b>304</b> is in the stowed position, the stem <b>310</b> and arms <b>316</b> fit within the aperture <b>306</b>. As such, the anchor member <b>304</b> can be oriented in a position in which it is essentially flush with the frame member <b>302</b> when in a stowed position.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Additionally, optionally, the recess <b>330</b> and surfaces <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, can be further recessed from the upper surface <b>120</b> of the removable deck member <b>104</b>. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the recess <b>330</b> and surfaces <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> can be disposed within a further recess <b>338</b> which can have a depth approximately equal to a height of the frame member <b>302</b>. Thus, when mounted in the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the upper surface of the frame member <b>302</b> is substantially flush with the surrounding upper surface <b>120</b> of the removable deck member <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Further, optionally, as noted above, the deck member <b>104</b> can include matting <b>171</b> disposed around the recess <b>330</b> and/or the recess <b>338</b>. In some embodiments, the recess <b>338</b> is sized such that the upper surface of the frame member <b>302</b> is flush or substantially flush, or recessed from the upper surface of the matting <b>171</b> surrounding the mounting mechanism <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>24</b></figref> illustrate an optional use of the receptacle <b>340</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the frame member <b>302</b> is mounted over the recess <b>330</b>, forming a receptacle <b>340</b>. As noted above, the receptacle <b>340</b> can be used in optional configurations for mounting an accessory. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> includes an illustration of an optional structure for an accessory, including a leg <b>350</b> and a mounting toe <b>352</b> extending from a lower end of the leg <b>350</b>. The mounting leg <b>350</b> can be provided on the lower end of any of a variety of different kinds of accessories, an example of which is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>33</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting leg <b>350</b> comprises a cross-section that is smaller than the aperture <b>306</b> of the frame member <b>302</b>. Thus, the lower end of the mounting leg <b>350</b> can fit within the aperture <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Additionally, the mounting leg <b>350</b> includes a foot portion <b>360</b> extending from a lower end of the mounting leg <b>350</b>. In some embodiments, the foot <b>360</b> can have a longitudinally extending shape generally complementary to the recess <b>330</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the foot <b>360</b> can have a width approximately equal to and/or slightly smaller than the width of the recess <b>330</b>. As such, the fit between the foot <b>360</b> and the recess <b>330</b> can provide for a more positive registration therebetween, in use.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, in use, the support leg <b>350</b> can be inserted through the aperture <b>306</b> and then the toe portion <b>352</b> can be tucked under a portion of the frame member <b>302</b>, into the receptacle <b>340</b>. Then, the support leg <b>350</b> can be pivoted downwardly in the direction of arrow P to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the toe portion is captured within the receptacle <b>340</b> by portion of the frame member <b>302</b>. As such, any upward movement of the support leg <b>350</b> would be limited by the frame member <b>302</b>. Additionally, with a close fit between the outer surfaces of the foot and the recess <b>330</b> movements in other directions would also be limited.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>27</b></figref>, additional anchoring devices can be used for preventing upward or pivoting movement of a support leg <b>350</b> relative to the mounting mechanism <b>300</b>. For example, a clasp mechanism <b>400</b> can be used to secure the anchor member <b>304</b> to a portion of the support leg <b>350</b>. In some embodiments, the clasp mechanism <b>400</b> can be configured to provide resistance against pivoting of the support leg <b>350</b> relative to the mounting mechanism <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, the clasp <b>400</b> can be configured to provide securement with additional bias or tension holding the leg or foot <b>360</b> seated against the lower surface of the recess <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, the clasp mechanism can be configured to operate according to the over-center principle of operation.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">For example, in some embodiments, the clasp mechanism <b>400</b> can include a draw hook portion <b>402</b> with one or more hook members <b>403</b>, a lever member <b>404</b> and a base portion <b>406</b>. The draw hook portion is connected to the lever member <b>404</b> at a drop hook pivot <b>408</b>. The lever member <b>404</b> can be connected directly to the base <b>406</b> at a base pivot <b>410</b>. Optionally, one of the draw hook portion <b>420</b> or the lever member <b>404</b> can be slightly elastic. As such, the clasp mechanism <b>400</b> can be configured to deform the elastic one of the draw hook portion <b>420</b> or the lever member <b>404</b> so as to cause stretching or compression to thereby provide a biasing force. The structure and operation of such over-center clasp mechanisms are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, the clasp mechanism <b>400</b> can be configured to, in an open position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, have sufficient slack such that the draw hook portion can engage the arms <b>316</b> of the anchor member <b>304</b>. In this position, the distance between the end of the draw hook <b>402</b> and the pivot <b>410</b> is a first distance.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, as the draw hook <b>402</b> is pushed in the direction of arrow C, the draw hook pivot passes <b>408</b> over the base pivot <b>410</b>, thereby pulling the end of the draw hook <b>402</b> upwardly against the arm <b>316</b> of the anchor member and compressing the lever member <b>404</b>. Because the base pivot <b>408</b> is now on the other side of the draw hook axis, the clasp <b>400</b> is in the over-centered, locked position with the lever member <b>404</b> pressing downwardly on the base <b>406</b> and thereby pushing the bottom of the foot <b>360</b> against the bottom of the recess <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In some embodiments, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, the draw hook <b>402</b> can be configured with sufficiently narrow hook members <b>403</b> that additional clearance <b>405</b> is left at the outer lateral ends of the arms <b>316</b> so as to provide additional clearance for securing additional rope or hooks when the clasp member <b>400</b> is in use.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>31</b></figref>, the deck extender <b>100</b> can be used for supporting a variety of different devices.
