In the load distribution sensor including the viscoelastic body sheet, there is a problem that a part of the input load is converted into stress in the sliding direction (horizontal direction), and the measurement accuracy of the load value in the vertical direction is decreased. Especially when applied to a rehabilitation training system, since a low-friction sheet and a belt are stacked on the load distribution sensor sheet, the input load further flows in the horizontal direction due to the influence of the belt and the low-friction sheet, and there is a pronounced decrease in the measurement accuracy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure has been made to solve such problems, and provides a load measurement system, a walking training system, a load measurement method, and a program that improve the measurement accuracy of a load value.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A load measurement system according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes an acquisition unit, a load calculation unit, and an output unit.

The treadmill <b>131</b> is a moving body that rotates a ring-shaped belt <b>132</b> with a motor (not shown). Thus, the belt <b>132</b> travels along the orbit. The treadmill <b>131</b> is a device that prompts the trainee <b>900</b> to walk.

The load measurement device <b>100</b><i>b </i>has basically the same configuration and function as the load measurement device <b>100</b>. However, the load measurement device <b>100</b><i>b </i>is different from the load measurement device <b>100</b> in that the load measurement device <b>100</b><i>b </i>has a load calculation unit <b>103</b><i>b</i>, a storage unit <b>105</b><i>b</i>, a learning database (DB) <b>106</b>, and a learning process unit <b>107</b> instead of the load calculation unit <b>103</b> and the storage unit <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The load calculation unit <b>103</b><i>b </i>calculates the total load value by using a trained load estimation model M. In the load estimation model M, the input is the sensor output value and the geometric information, and the output is the total load value. The sensor output value may be the cell output value in the load region SL or the sum of the cell output values (total sensor output), included in the sensor output information. For example, the load calculation unit <b>103</b><i>b </i>inputs the total sensor output and the load information of the load region SL into the load estimation model M, and acquires the total load value output from the load estimation model M. As a result, the load calculation unit <b>103</b><i>b </i>can easily estimate the total load value even for an unknown combination of the geometric information and the sensor output value.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The storage unit <b>105</b><i>b </i>stores the trained load estimation model M instead of the conversion map T.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The learning DB <b>106</b> is a database that stores teacher data including the sensor output value and the geometric information tagged with the total load value.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The learning process unit <b>107</b> optimizes the parameters of the load estimation model M by using the teacher data stored in the learning DB <b>106</b>. As a result, the load estimation model M is learned.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The load estimation model M may be a model that outputs the total load value from a matrix diagram in which the output value of each cell is held as a pixel value. In this case, in the load estimation model M, the matrix diagram is an input and the total load value is the output. The load estimation model M may include, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, the load calculation unit <b>103</b><i>b </i>may generate the matrix diagram based on the output value of each cell and the position information of each cell and input the matrix diagram to the load estimation model M, so as to acquire the total load value output from the load estimation model M. As a result, the load calculation unit <b>103</b><i>b </i>can easily and accurately estimate the total load value even if the geometric information is complicated.
