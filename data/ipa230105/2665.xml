The well <b>100</b> extends from the surface <b>106</b> through the Earth <b>108</b> to one more subterranean zones of interest <b>110</b> (one shown). The well <b>100</b> enables access to the subterranean zones of interest <b>110</b> to allow recovery (that is, production) of fluids to the surface <b>106</b> (represented by flow arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and, in some implementations, additionally or alternatively allows fluids to be placed in the Earth <b>108</b>. In some implementations, the subterranean zone <b>110</b> is a formation within the Earth <b>108</b> defining a reservoir, but in other instances, the zone <b>110</b> can be multiple formations or a portion of a formation. The subterranean zone can include, for example, a formation, a portion of a formation, or multiple formations in a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir from which recovery operations can be practiced to recover trapped hydrocarbons. In some implementations, the subterranean zone includes an underground formation of naturally fractured or porous rock containing hydrocarbons (for example, oil, gas, or both). In some implementations, the well can intersect other types of formations, including reservoirs that are not naturally fractured. For simplicity's sake, the well <b>100</b> is shown as a vertical well, but in other instances, the well <b>100</b> can be a deviated well with a wellbore deviated from vertical (for example, horizontal or slanted), the well <b>100</b> can include multiple bores forming a multilateral well (that is, a well having multiple lateral wells branching off another well or wells), or both.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some implementations, the well <b>100</b> is a gas well that is used in producing hydrocarbon gas (such as natural gas) from the subterranean zones of interest <b>110</b> to the surface <b>106</b>. While termed a &#x201c;gas well,&#x201d; the well need not produce only dry gas, and may incidentally or in much smaller quantities, produce liquid including oil, water, or both. In some implementations, the well <b>100</b> is an oil well that is used in producing hydrocarbon liquid (such as crude oil) from the subterranean zones of interest <b>110</b> to the surface <b>106</b>. While termed an &#x201c;oil well,&#x201d; the well not need produce only hydrocarbon liquid, and may incidentally or in much smaller quantities, produce gas, water, or both. In some implementations, the production from the well <b>100</b> can be multiphase in any ratio. In some implementations, the production from the well <b>100</b> can produce mostly or entirely liquid at certain times and mostly or entirely gas at other times. For example, in certain types of wells it is common to produce water for a period of time to gain access to the gas in the subterranean zone. The concepts herein, though, are not limited in applicability to gas wells, oil wells, or even production wells, and could be used in wells for producing other gas or liquid resources or could be used in injection wells, disposal wells, or other types of wells used in placing fluids into the Earth.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The wellbore of the well <b>100</b> is typically, although not necessarily, cylindrical. All or a portion of the wellbore is lined with a tubing, such as casing <b>112</b>. The casing <b>112</b> connects with a wellhead at the surface <b>106</b> and extends downhole into the wellbore. The wellhead defines an attachment point for other equipment to be attached to the well <b>100</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows well <b>100</b> being produced with a Christmas tree attached to the wellhead. The Christmas tree includes valves used to regulate flow into or out of the well <b>100</b>. The casing <b>112</b> operates to isolate the bore of the well <b>100</b>, defined in the cased portion of the well <b>100</b> by the inner bore <b>116</b> of the casing <b>112</b>, from the surrounding Earth <b>108</b>. The casing <b>112</b> can be formed of a single continuous tubing or multiple lengths of tubing joined (for example, threadedly) end-to-end. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the casing <b>112</b> is perforated in the subterranean zone of interest <b>110</b> to allow fluid communication between the subterranean zone of interest <b>110</b> and the bore <b>116</b> of the casing <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the casing <b>112</b> is omitted or ceases in the region of the subterranean zone of interest <b>110</b>. This portion of the well <b>100</b> without casing is often referred to as &#x201c;open hole.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A composition including a corrosion inhibitor, as described in this disclosure, can be flowed into the wellbore of the well <b>100</b> to inhibit corrosion in the wellbore.

A carbon steel (C-1018) coupon was used for corrosion testing. The test was carried out at 55&#xb0; C. in a 3.5% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas was bubbled through the brine solution for the first two hours to de-aerate and was continuously bubbled throughout the experiment to simulate sweet corrosive condition. The solution was continuously stirred at a flow speed of 500 rpm throughout the test. After 2 hours of purging CO<sub>2 </sub>with gas, the measurement of the corrosion rate of the carbon steel coupon using linear polarization resistance (LPR) was initiated, and the corrosion rate was recorded automatically every 10 minutes. The carbon steel coupon (exposed area of 3.5 square centimeters (cm<sup>2</sup>)) was subjected to pre-corrosion for 2 hours before injecting the corrosion inhibitor (pyranopyrazole derivative). A concentration of 100 ppm of the pyranopyrazole derivative (corrosion inhibitor) was used to evaluate its performance in inhibiting corrosion. The test conditions are provided in Table 1. The test results were then monitored for 24 hours to allow for the corrosion rate to stabilize. The corrosion inhibiting performance was then calculated as percent corrosion protection with respect to the uninhibited baseline corrosion rate (C<sub>Ru</sub>) and the inhibited corrosion rate (C<sub>Ri</sub>) during the 2-hour pre-corrosion period before the addition of the pyranopyrazole derivative (Equation 1).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Corrosion Bubble Test Conditions</entry></row><row><entry><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>%</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mi>Corrosion</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mi>Protection</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>C</mi>      <mrow>       <mi>R</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>u</mi>      </mrow>     </msub>     <mo>-</mo>     <msub>      <mi>C</mi>      <mrow>       <mi>R</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>i</mi>      </mrow>     </msub>    </mrow>    <msub>     <mi>C</mi>     <mrow>      <mi>R</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>u</mi>     </mrow>    </msub>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#xd7;</mo>   <mn>1</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mn>0</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mn>0</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>%</mi>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Brine Solution</entry><entry>3.5% NaCl</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Temperature</entry><entry>55 &#xb1; 2&#xb0; C.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Flow Speed</entry><entry>500</entry><entry>revolutions</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>per minute</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(rpm)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Test Duration</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>hours</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>CO<sub>2 </sub>Purging</entry><entry>100%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Solution pH</entry><entry>3.8-4.4</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Pre-corrosion Duration</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>hours</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Corrosion Inhibitor Concentration</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>ppm</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">High Temperature/High Pressure Dynamic Autoclave Test (Weight Loss)</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0035">The autoclave test was used to study the performance of the pyranopyrazole derivative (corrosion inhibitor) at high-temperature, high-pressure, and high-shear stress.
