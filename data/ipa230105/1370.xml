olefins from an oxygen-containing compound, and use thereof, and belongs to the technical field of chemical equipment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methanol-to-olefin technology (MTO) mainly includes DMTO (methanol-to-olefin) technology of Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and MTO technology of UOP Company of the United States. In 2010, the Shenhua Baotou methanol-to-olefin plant using DMTO technology was completed and put into operation. This is the world's first industrial application of MTO technology. As of the end of 2019, 14 DMTO industrial plants have been put into production, with a total production capacity of about 8 million tons of low-carbon olefins per year.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, DMTO technology has been further developed, and a new generation of DMTO catalyst with better performance have gradually begun industrial applications, creating higher benefits for DMTO plants. The new generation of DMTO catalyst has higher methanol processing capacity and low-carbon olefin selectivity. It is difficult for the existing DMTO industrial devices to take full advantage of the advantages of the new generation of DMTO catalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a DMTO device and production method that can meet the needs of a new generation of DMTO catalyst with high methanol processing capacity and high selectivity of low-carbon olefins.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the present application, a fluidized bed reactor is provided, which can control the coke content, coke content distribution, and coke species in a dimethyl ether/methanol to olefins (DMTO) catalyst, thereby controlling the performance of the DMTO catalyst and improving the selectivity for low-carbon olefins.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The low-carbon olefins mentioned in the present application refer to ethylene and propylene. The fluidized bed reactor includes a main shell and a coke control zone shell; the main shell includes an upper shell and a lower shell; the upper shell encloses a gas-solid separation zone, and the lower shell encloses a reaction zone; the reaction zone axially communicates with the gas-solid separation zone; the coke control zone shell is circumferentially arranged on an outer wall of the main shell; the coke control zone shell and the main shell enclose an annular cavity, and the annular cavity is a coke control zone; n baffles are radially arranged in the coke control zone, and the n baffles divide the coke control zone into n coke control zone subzones, where n is an integer; the coke control zone subzones are provided with a coke control raw material inlet; and a catalyst circulation hole is formed in each of n&#x2212;1 of the baffles, such that a catalyst entering the coke control zone flows in an annular direction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When there is only one zone in the coke control zone, a residence time distribution of the catalyst entering the coke control zone is similar to a residence time distribution of a completely-mixed tank reactor, and under such conditions, the obtained coke controlled catalyst granules show poor coke content uniformity (that is, some catalyst granules have a low coke content and some catalyst granules have a high coke content), resulting in low average activity and low average selectivity of the catalyst. In the present application, a coke control zone is arranged and baffles are radially arranged in the coke control zone to divide the coke control zone into a plurality of coke control zone subzones, such that a residence time distribution of the catalyst entering the coke control zone can be controlled to make the coke controlled catalyst have narrow coke content distribution, high average activity, and high average selectivity. Moreover, the zone control is also beneficial to the control of the coke species and coke content in the coke controlled catalyst.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the present application, the catalyst entering the coke control zone may be a fresh catalyst or a regenerated catalyst. Preferably, the catalyst may be a regenerated catalyst, such that both the regeneration and the coke control can be achieved on-line.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, in the coke control zone, the n baffles may include a 1<sup>st </sup>baffle, and a 2<sup>nd </sup>baffle to an n<sup>th </sup>baffle;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">no catalyst circulation hole may be formed in the 1<sup>st </sup>baffle; the catalyst circulation hole may be formed in each of the 2<sup>nd </sup>baffle to the n<sup>th </sup>baffle;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a coke control zone catalyst inlet may be formed in a 1<sup>st </sup>coke control zone subzone formed through division by the 1<sup>st </sup>baffle and the 2<sup>nd </sup>baffle;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe may be arranged in an n<sup>th </sup>coke control zone subzone formed through division by the 1<sup>st </sup>baffle and the n<sup>th </sup>baffle, and an outlet of the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe may be formed in the reaction zone;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">the coke control raw material inlet may be formed at bottoms of the coke control zone subzones, and the coke control raw material inlet may be a coke control zone distributor; and a coke control zone gas delivery pipe may be arranged at tops of the coke control zone subzones, and an outlet of the coke control zone gas delivery pipe may be formed in the gas-solid separation zone.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Specifically, one or more catalyst circulation holes can be formed in each of the baffles, which is not strictly limited in the present application. When a plurality of catalyst circulation holes are formed, relative positions of the catalyst circulation holes are not strictly limited in the present application. For example, the plurality of catalyst circulation holes may be arranged in parallel, or may be arranged randomly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the present application, a shape of the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe is not strictly limited, as long as it is ensured that the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe can deliver a coke controlled catalyst to the reaction zone. For example, the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe can be an L-shaped pipe, and can also be in other suitable shapes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe can be an L-shaped pipe, such that an outlet of the coke controlled catalyst delivery pipe is at a lower position in the reaction zone, and a coke controlled catalyst can efficiently contact and react with the raw material including the oxygen-containing compound entering from the reaction zone distributor, which prevents the coke controlled catalyst from entering the first stripper.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A coke control zone distributor may be arranged at bottoms of the coke control zone subzones.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, a coke control zone distributor may be arranged at a bottom of each of the coke control zone subzones. In this way, the coke control raw material can enter the coke control zone uniformly as a whole, such that the phenomenon of non-uniform distribution of the coke control raw material among the subzones can be avoided, and the coke content and coke content distribution in a catalyst can be well controlled.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A gas delivery pipe may be arranged at tops of the coke control zone subzones.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, a gas delivery pipe may be arranged at a top of each of the coke control zone subzones.

The low-carbon olefins mentioned in the present application refer to ethylene and propylene. The applicants have found through research that main factors affecting the activity of a DMTO catalyst and the selectivity for low-carbon olefins include coke content, coke content distribution, and coke species in the catalyst. Under the same average coke content in catalysts, the narrower the coke content distribution, the higher the selectivity and activity of low-carbon olefins. Coke species in a catalyst may include polymethyl aromatic hydrocarbons, polymethyl cycloalkanes, and the like, where polymethylbenzene and polymethylnaphthalene can promote the formation of ethylene. Therefore, the control of the coke content, coke content distribution, and coke species in a catalyst is the key to control the activity of the DMTO catalyst and improve the selectivity of low-carbon olefins.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The fluidized bed reactor in the present application is provided with a coke control zone, and the coke control zone is divided into a plurality of subzones by the baffles arranged in the coke control zone, such that a catalyst flows along the subzones one by one. A residence time distribution of the catalyst is controlled through the subzones to be narrow, such as to control a coke content distribution in the catalyst and make the coke content distribution narrow. Moreover, the coke content and coke species are also controlled. Therefore, the activity of the DMTO catalyst and the selectivity for low-carbon olefins are improved.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">(2) In the method of the present application, a catalyst can only flow from an upstream subzone to a downstream subzone through the catalyst circulation holes on the baffles in the coke control zone, such that an average residence time of a catalyst in the coke control zone can be controlled to control a coke content in the catalyst; and the structure of n coke control zone subzones is adopted to control a residence time distribution of a catalyst (the residence time distribution is similar to n serially-connected completely-mixed tank reactors), and a catalyst with a narrow coke content distribution is obtained.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">(3) The present application can control the conversion and generation of coke species in a catalyst. On the one hand, inactive large-molecule coke species remaining in a regenerated catalyst are converted into small-molecule coke species; and on the other hand, a coke control raw material can also enter the catalyst to generate highly-active small-molecule coke species, and the small-molecule coke species are mainly polymethylbenzene and polymethylnaphthalene, which can improve the selectivity for ethylene.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">(4) With the method for on-line modification of a DMTO catalyst through a coke control reaction in the present application, a coke controlled catalyst with high coke content, narrow coke content distribution, and polymethylbenzene and polymethylnaphthalene as main coke species components can be obtained, that is, the regenerated catalyst with low selectivity for low-carbon olefins is converted into a coke controlled catalyst with high selectivity for low-carbon olefins.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">(5) The regenerated catalyst in the present application can be directly used in the process of preparing low-carbon olefins from an oxygen-containing compound without a coke control treatment, and in this case, the selectivity for low-carbon olefins in an obtained product gas is 80 wt % to 83 wt %. When the regenerated catalyst in the present application is subjected to a coke control treatment and then used in the process of preparing low-carbon olefins from an oxygen-containing compound, the selectivity for low-carbon olefins in an obtained product gas is 93 wt % to 96 wt %.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">(6) In the method of the present application, a high-temperature regenerated catalyst from the regenerator is first cooled in the coke control zone and then enters the reaction zone, that is, there is no local high-temperature zone in the reaction zone; and thus the raw material with an oxygen-containing compound has a low coking rate.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">(7) The reaction zone of the fluidized bed reactor in the present application includes a fluidized bed reactor cooler, which can accurately control a temperature of the reaction zone.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a DMTO device for preparing low-carbon olefins from an oxygen-containing compound according to an embodiment of the present application;
