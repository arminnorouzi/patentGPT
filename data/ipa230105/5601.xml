id="p-0003" num="0002">A health care service provider may query a health care payment plan administrator, e.g., a private insurance entity, government insurance entity, and/or a medical expense sharing organization, which may be referred to as a &#x201c;payor,&#x201d; to determine a patient's eligibility under a payment plan or coverage plan offered by the payor. This eligibility query may be performed at various stages during the patient care process, such as, for example, in advance of a patient's appointment, when the patient arrives for the appointment, and/or when generating a bill after a patient has been cared for by a health care service provider. The payment plan or coverage plan eligibility determination is used to ensure that the patient is billed correctly and receives all the benefits that the patient is entitled to. A payor may, however, receive high volumes of eligibility confirmation requests from health care service providers for the patients that they serve, which can overwhelm a payor's response infrastructure. As a result, health care service providers may not get timely eligibility information from a payor, which may result in billing errors and/or delays in submitting invoices to patients and/or the payor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to some embodiments of the inventive concept, a method comprises: maintaining a cache of past responses from a payor to past patient eligibility confirmation requests for one or more payment plans generated by a health care service provider; receiving a present patient eligibility confirmation request from the health care service provider to determine whether a patient is eligible for a payment plan of the one or more payment plans offered by a payor; querying the cache based on demographic information associated with the patient to determine whether the cache has eligibility information for the payment plan for the patient stored therein; selecting a portion of the eligibility information for the payment plan based on health care service provider preferences or payor preferences when the cache has the eligibility information for the payment plan for the patient stored therein; and returning the portion of the eligibility information to the health care service provider.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other embodiments, querying the cache comprises determining whether to query the cache based on defined cache access rules.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In still other embodiments, returning the portion of the eligibility information comprises: determining whether to return the portion of the eligibility information based on defined cache information usage rules.

However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present inventive concept. It is intended that all embodiments disclosed herein can be implemented separately or combined in any way and/or combination.

That is, all embodiments and/or features of any embodiments can be combined in any way and/or combination.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, a payor is an entity that provides payment in whole or in part on behalf of a patient that receives health care services from a health care service provider. A payor may include, but is not limited to, a private insurance entity, a governmental insurance entity, and/or a medical expense sharing entity. Health care services may include, but are not limited to, interactive examinations, procedures, laboratory tests, prescriptions, and the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some embodiments of the inventive concept stem from a realization that a payor's computer system for responding to payment plan or coverage eligibility requests from health care service providers for their patients can get overwhelmed resulting in the health care service providers getting error messages or timeouts in response to their requests. As a result, health care service providers may not be able to verify the payment plan coverage status of their patients in a timely manner, which can result in delays and/or errors in billing patients and/or their payors. Some embodiments of the inventive concept may provide an eligibility management system for assisting a payor in processing patient payment plan eligibility requests that are generated by health care service providers. The eligibility management system may act as an intermediary between the health care service providers and payors by monitoring past responses from payors to patient eligibility confirmation requests for one or more payment plans associated with the payors that are generated by health care service providers. The system may maintain a cache based on the history of responses from the payors for the various patients served by the health care service providers. When a payor's response infrastructure is operating at a functional level that it is able to handle the number of incoming patient eligibility confirmation requests, then the eligibility management system may route these requests to the payor or one of the payor's intermediaries for generating the responses for the health care service providers. When a payor's response infrastructure is out of service or is generating time-outs due to the number of eligibility requests exceeding its capacity, the eligibility response management system may intervene and rather than route the incoming requests to the payor or one of the payors intermediaries, the eligibility response management system may query the cache to determine that previous responses have been generated for the particular patients associated with the requests. If a previous response has been generated for a particular patient, then the eligibility management system may proceed in a variety of different ways based on rules that express payor and/or service provider preferences. That is, in some embodiments, the payors and/or the health care service providers may communicate with the eligibility management system to define rules that express their preferences in handling responses for eligibility confirmation requests when the payor is unable to generate a response directly. The rules may specify, for example, whether/when to access the cache, whether/when to use the results of the cache if/when the cache is accessed, and/or what portions of information obtained from the cache may be used when the cache is accessed. For example, a payor and/or a health care service provider may define a variety of rules including, but not limited to the following examples: rules that specify a time-to-live (TTL) for responses stored in the cache on a per payor basis; rules that define circumstances on whether a cached eligibility response is returned to the health care service provider, e.g., only return a cached ineligible response, only return a cached eligible response, return cached eligible and ineligible responses; rules that define how much additional information may be returned to the health care service provider from the cached eligibility response, such as benefits details, co-pay amounts, deductible caps, and the like; rules that specify a particular age limit on cached information that may be different from a TTL value, such as only return information from a cached response if the cached response does not exceed a specified age; rules that provide for discovery of additional coverage for a patient, such as detecting that a patient is also covered by one or more additional payment or coverage plans associated with one or more payors including private payors and/or governmental payors due to, for example, a familial relationship; and rules that define when the eligibility management system intervenes to generate a response for a health care service provider based on the cached responses, e.g., a payor may define a rule that a response should always be generated from the cache unless the cache does not have any response information for a particular patient (cache miss), a response should only be generated from the cache after the payor has generated time-outs or errors for a particular time period, or never use the cache for a particular payor or health care service provider.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Thus, an eligibility response management system, according to some embodiments of the inventive concept, may provide dynamic caching and routing functionality for managing patient eligibility confirmation requests that can be customized using a control plane to reflect preferences or requirements associated with the payors and/or the health care service providers.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a communication network <b>100</b> including an eligibility management system for dynamic caching and routing of health care plan eligibility responses, in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept, comprises multiple health care provider facilities or practices <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>. Each health care provider facility or practice may represent various types of organizations that are used to deliver health care services to patients via health care professionals, which are referred to generally herein as &#x201c;providers.&#x201d; The providers may include, but are not limited to, hospitals, medical practices, mobile patient care facilities, diagnostic centers, lab centers, pharmacies, and the like. The providers may operate by providing health care services for patients and then invoicing one or more payors <b>160</b><i>a </i>and <b>160</b><i>b </i>for the services rendered. The payors <b>160</b><i>a </i>and <b>160</b><i>b </i>may include, but are not limited to, private insurance plans, government insurance plans (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, state, or federal public employee insurance plans), hybrid insurance plans (e.g., Affordable Care Act plans), private medical cost sharing plans, and the patients themselves. Two provider facilities <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the first provider including a first patient intake/accounting system server <b>105</b><i>a </i>accessible via a network <b>115</b><i>a</i>.

The patient intake/accounting system <b>120</b><i>a </i>may be configured to perform payment plan eligibility confirmation to ensure that a patient is covered by a particular payment plan. The patient intake/accounting system <b>120</b><i>a </i>may generate a patient eligibility confirmation request for a payor at various times when serving a patient. For example, an eligibility confirmation request may be generated prior to a patient's appointment. Some health care service providers, for example, generate eligibility confirmation requests for all patients that will be seen in a particular week or other time period. An eligibility confirmation request may also be generated when a patient arrives for an appointment. An eligibility confirmation request may also be generated when a health care service provider generates an invoice for services and products rendered in caring for a patient. The network <b>115</b><i>a </i>communicatively couples the first patient intake/accounting system server <b>105</b><i>a </i>to other devices, terminals, and systems in the provider's facility <b>110</b><i>a</i>. The network <b>115</b><i>a </i>may comprise one or more local or wireless networks to communicate with first patient intake/accounting system server <b>105</b><i>a </i>when the first patient intake/accounting system server <b>105</b><i>a </i>is located in or proximate to the health care service provider facility <b>110</b><i>a</i>.

Moreover, these requests can be managed in a customized way for the health care service providers and the payors using a control plane to reflect preferences or requirements associated with the payors and/or the health care service providers. The eligibility management system may include an eligibility management interface server <b>130</b>, which includes an eligibility/coverage interface system module <b>135</b>, and an eligibility/coverage response engine server <b>140</b>, which includes an eligibility/coverage response engine <b>145</b>. The eligibility/coverage interface system module <b>135</b> may be configured to receive eligibility confirmation requests from one or more health care service providers <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, to communicate with the appropriate payor <b>160</b><i>a</i>, <b>160</b><i>b </i>and/or the eligibility/coverage response engine server <b>140</b> to obtain responses for the requests based on service provider and/or payor preferences, and to communicate a response back to the health care service providers <b>110</b><i>a</i>,<b>110</b><i>b </i>by way of the patient intake/accounting systems <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>based on the service provider and/or the payor preferences.

The eligibility/coverage response engine module <b>145</b> may be further configured to provide APIs for health care service providers <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>and/or payors <b>160</b><i>a</i>, <b>160</b><i>b </i>to all these entities to create rules expressing their preferences for how the cached responses may be used in responding to patient eligibility confirmation requests generated from the health care service providers <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A network <b>150</b> couples the patient intake/accounting system servers <b>105</b><i>a</i>, <b>105</b><i>b </i>to the eligibility/coverage interface system server <b>130</b> and couples the payors <b>160</b><i>a </i>and <b>160</b><i>b </i>to the eligibility/coverage interface system server <b>130</b>. The network <b>150</b> may be a global network, such as the Internet or other publicly accessible network. Various elements of the network <b>150</b> may be interconnected by a wide area network, a local area network, an Intranet, and/or other private network, which may not be accessible by the general public.

For example, health care service providers and/or payors may access the eligibility management system service as a Web service. In some embodiments, the eligibility management system service may be implemented as a Representational State Transfer Web Service (RESTful Web service).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example communication network including an eligibility management system for dynamic caching and routing of health care plan eligibility responses, it will be understood that embodiments of the inventive subject matter are not limited to such configurations, but are intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out the operations described herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a message flow diagram illustrating operations for dynamic caching and routing of health care payment plan eligibility responses in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, health care service providers <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>and payors <b>160</b><i>a</i>, <b>160</b><i>b </i>may communicate with a payor eligibility response manager, such as an eligibility management system embodied by the eligibility/coverage interface system server <b>130</b>, eligibility/coverage interface system module <b>135</b>, eligibility/coverage response engine server <b>140</b>, and eligibility/coverage response engine module <b>145</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The payor eligibility response manager may provide APIs, which can be used by the health care service provider(s) and the payor(s) to express their preferences for how cached responses may be used in responding to patient eligibility confirmation requests through creation of rules and guidelines. The payor eligibility response manager may monitor ongoing patient eligibility responses from payor(s) to health care service provider(s) and may maintain these responses in a cache, subject to TTL rules established by the health care service provider(s) and/or the payor(s). The payor eligibility response manager may also monitor payor responses to assess the payor's availability. For example, if a payor has generated a specified number of error messages or time-outs within a specified time interval, then it may be concluded that the payor's system is unavailable to process patient eligibility confirmation requests at this time. When a health care service provider transmits an eligibility confirmation request for a patient to the payor eligibility response manager, the payor eligibility response manager may route the request to the payor or payor's intermediary or search the cache based on payor preference. As described above, even if the payor is available, the payor may use the payor eligibility response manager to use cached responses in response to eligibility requests with requests only being forwarded to the payor when there is a cache miss. Such a rule may be further subject to preferences or requirements of a health care service provider as a provider may place limits on when the use of cached responses is acceptable. The payor eligibility response manager may resolve conflicts between rules using a variety of mechanisms including defaulting to the most restrictive rule. Thus, if the payor is unavailable or if the payor has a preference for use of the cache even when available, then the payor eligibility response manager will search the cache for a response corresponding to the particular patient and payor. The payor eligibility response manager may then obtain either a cached eligibility response (if available through a cache hit) or an eligibility response from the payor if the request was routed to the payor. The payor eligibility manager may then select a portion of the eligibility information obtained through the response to return to the health care service provider. The portion selected and the nature of the returned information may be based on health care service provider and/or payor preferences expressed through the rules created by way of the APIs. As described above, a variety of types and amounts of information may be returned to the health care service provider based on the defined preferences. For example, for cached responses, a rule may specify that a response should be returned only if the patient is eligible or only if the patient is ineligible. A more expansive rule, for example, may allow the payor eligibility response manager to return a response based on cached information for both eligible and ineligible patients, but additional benefits information may not be included. Less restrictive rules may allow the payor eligibility response manager to provide benefits information based on cached response information in addition to payment plan eligibility status. Even less restrictive rules may allow the payor eligibility response manager to construct a broader picture of a patient's health care coverage by including potential coverage options with the same or different payor based on, for example, the patient's relationship with other people, such as a family member, through which the patient may access coverage. This information may be provided to the health care service provider in addition to the eligibility confirmation requested. Such rules may be applied in the same or different ways based on responses received from the payor in conjunction with or independent from the cached responses.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref> are flowcharts that illustrate operations for dynamic caching and routing of health care payment plan eligibility responses in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept. The example operations are described with respect to a single health care service provider submitting a patient eligibility confirmation request for a single patient to a single payor. It will be understood that the eligibility management system described herein and the operations associated therewith are applicable to managing patient eligibility confirmation requests for multiple payors that were generated by multiple health care service providers serving multiple patients. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a cache is maintained of past responses from a payor to past patient eligibility confirmation requests for one or more payment plans generated by a health care service provider (block <b>300</b>). A present patient eligibility confirmation request from the health care service provider is received (block <b>305</b>) and, based on rules established by the health care service provider and/or the payor, a determination is made whether to access the cache (block <b>310</b>). Payors and/or health care service providers may define a variety of different rules for when the cache is accessed. For example, a payor may define a rule that the cache should be accessed and a response generated therefrom unless there is a cache miss, i.e., the cache does not have previous eligibility information stored for a particular patient. In other embodiments, rules may be defined that specify that a response should be generated from the cache only after the number of time-outs or errors received from a payor in a defined time period exceeds a defined threshold. In still other embodiments, rules may defined that the cache is not used for particular payors and/or health care service providers. If the cache is not accessed, then the request is forwarded to the payor or payor intermediary (block <b>315</b>). Otherwise, the cache is queried (block <b>320</b>) using demographic information associated with the patient to determine whether the cache has eligibility information for the payment plan for the patient stored therein. If the cache does not have eligibility information stored therein for the patient (block <b>325</b>), i.e., a cache miss, then the request is forwarded to the payor or payor intermediary. (block <b>315</b>). Otherwise, a determination is made whether to return information to the health care service provider based on defined cache information usage rules (block <b>330</b>). Even if the cache contains eligibility information for the patient, rules may be defined by the payors and/or health care service providers that limit whether any information is returned and how much information is returned. For example, a payor and/or a health care service provider may define a time-to-live (TTL) for responses stored in the cache on a per payor basis such that eligibility information that is older than a certain age is not returned to a health care service provider. Other rules may be defined specifying that the eligibility response management system should only return a cached ineligible response, only return a cached eligible response, or return both cached eligible and ineligible responses. In some embodiments, additional patient information may be stored in the cache and rules may be defined that specify how much, if any, of that information is returned to the health care service provider. This additional information may include, but is not limited to benefits details, co-pay amounts, deductible caps, and the like. This additional information may have different TTL values associated therewith as compared to the TTL used for eligibility information. Rules may also be defined that provide for discovery of additional coverage for a patient, such as detecting that a patient is also covered by one or more additional payment or coverage plans associated with one or more payors including private payors and/or governmental payors due to, for example, a familial relationship. Based on the evaluations of the rules for returning information from the cached response for the patient (block <b>330</b>), no information may be returned or some of all of the cached information may be returned (block <b>335</b>). A portion of the eligibility information for the payment plan is selected (block <b>335</b>) based on the health care service provider preferences or the payor preferences as expressed by the defined rules. This portion may be a subset of the cached information for the patient or all of the cached information for the patient. The selected portion of the eligibility information is then returned (block <b>340</b>) to the health care service provider.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cache of the payor responses to eligibility confirmation requests may be embodied in a variety of ways according to different embodiments of the inventive concept. In some embodiments, the cache may be implemented using a Bloom filter data structure. The Bloom filter data structure tells whether an element may be in a set or is definitely not in the set. The only possible errors are false positives. Thus, a search for a nonexistent element can give an incorrect answer. With more elements in the filter, the error rate increases. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the cache may also be embodied through the use of a hash digest. A hash digest is formed by combining portions of the patient demographic information used as a hash key (block <b>400</b>). The cache may then be queried using the hash digest formed through a combination of portions of the demographic information (block <b>405</b>). In some embodiments, the hash digest approach may be further modified to use a fuzzy hash digest. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the specificity of a portion of the patient demographic information may be reduced (block <b>500</b>). The portion of the demographic information with reduced specificity is combined with at least one other portion of the demographic information to form a fuzzy hash digest (block <b>505</b>). The fuzzy hash digest may then be used to query the cache (block <b>510</b>). Examples of the use of a fuzzy hash digest for searching a cache are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 10,510,440 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, health care service providers may submit patient eligibility confirmation requests to payors on a regular basis, such as the beginning of every week for all patients with appointments that week. The eligibility management system may include an Artificial Intelligence (AI) prediction engine as part of the eligibility/coverage response engine module <b>145</b> that can be trained based on historical patterns of patient eligibility confirmation requests to predict arrival times for new patient eligibility confirmation requests, such as when batch requests are received for all patients to be seen by a health care service provider in an upcoming time period. The AI prediction engine may be embodied in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, a machine learning system, a deep learning system, and/or a multi-layer neural network. Moreover, it will be understood that the multi-layer neural network is a multi-layer artificial neural network comprising artificial neurons or nodes and does not include a biological neural network comprising real biological neurons. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an AI prediction engine is used to predict when a present eligibility confirmation request will be received from the health care service provider (block <b>600</b>). The cache is queried (block <b>605</b>) based on the identifying information for the health care service provider to obtain payment plan eligibility information for all patients served by the health care service provider (block <b>605</b>) prior to receiving the present patient eligibility confirmation request. Thus, the cache is queried in advance to obtain all the cached eligibility responses for a particular health care service provider. When the present patient eligibility confirmation request is received, the payment plan eligibility information for all of the patients served by the health care service provider obtained from the cache query at block <b>605</b> is searched (block <b>610</b>) based on the demographic information for the patient to determine whether the cache had eligibility information for the payment plan for the patient stored therein. The use of an AI prediction engine may allow the cache queries to be performed during time intervals when processing demands are lower, which may improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the overall eligibility management system.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a data processing system <b>700</b> that may be used to implement the eligibility/coverage response engine server <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments of the inventive concept, comprises input device(s) <b>702</b>, such as a keyboard or keypad, a display <b>704</b>, and a memory <b>706</b> that communicate with a processor <b>708</b>.
