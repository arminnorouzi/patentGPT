The invention more particularly relates to an electrical circuit breaker assembly capable of isolating a faulty electrical line in an electrical circuit of an aircraft. The invention also relates to an aircraft comprising such an electrical circuit breaker assembly.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrical power requirements on board an aircraft are constantly increasing, leading to the voltage levels of the electrical sources needing to be increased in order to maintain acceptable current levels for transporting energy between a source and the consuming devices that are connected to it. In the event of an incident on an electrical line, and of an abnormal increase in the current in this line, the line should be isolated to prevent the fault propagating to other elements of the electrical circuit. The means usually used to do this no longer satisfy the specificities of use on board an aircraft, on account of the increasingly high voltages and currents used. For the purpose of isolating a faulty electrical line, electrical protections comprising a pyrotechnic element are used in the automotive industry. The benefit of the pyrotechnic element is that it makes it possible to act very quickly. These systems use a current sensor that is configured to measure the current consumed in an electrical line such that, when a sudden and significant increase in the current is detected, a control module activates an actuator of a circuit breaker assembly arranged on the current line, physically severing the current line. The actuator is activated by a pyrotechnic element, which gives the short-circuit assembly a very short activation time and consequently makes it possible to quickly isolate the faulty electrical line from the rest of the electrical circuit before the fault propagates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Equivalent devices exist in aircraft, such as, for example, remote control circuit breakers, sometimes abbreviated to RCCB, which are electromechanical, or else solid state power controllers, sometimes abbreviated to SSPC. These devices typically perform functions of protecting cables or power supply buses, or else of switching loads, of detecting electric arcs, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is known that opening a circuit through which a current is flowing can generate significant overvoltages due to the inductive nature of the circuit. Such an overvoltage, when an electrical power supply line is opened, is all the higher since the inductance of the electrical line is large and parasitic capacitances are small. The overvoltage across the terminals of an opening point of a power supply line can lead to destruction of elements of the circuit. Very often, the majority of the energy stored in an electrical line is dissipated in the breaking arc when the line is opened. The rest of the energy is dissipated in the rest of the electrical circuit, thus constituting a fault that is detrimental to the integrity of the latter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The significant increase in the voltage used by aircraft energy sources is such that the volume, weight and cost characteristics of certain elements of the electrical circuits no longer satisfy the conditions of use on board an aircraft. This is, in particular, due to the observed effects described by Paschen's law. Paschen's law makes it possible to characterize the appearance of an electric arc during the opening of an electrical power supply line as a function of the atmospheric pressure around the point of opening of the electrical line, and therefore as a function of the operating altitude.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The situation can therefore be improved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention aims, in particular, to provide an electrical circuit breaker assembly that allows a faulty electrical power supply line in an aircraft to be quickly isolated before the overvoltage present can be transferred to other elements of the electrical circuit comprising this electrical power supply line, while at the same time avoiding having to oversize components of the electrical installation of the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To this end, one subject of the invention is an electrical circuit breaker assembly comprising a conductive element of an electrical power supply line of an electrical circuit and a cut-off device that can be activated by a first pyrotechnic element and that is configured to sever the conductive element in a predetermined cut-off zone delimited by a downstream point, the electrical circuit breaker assembly further comprising a contactor element that can be activated by a second pyrotechnic element, the contactor element being configured to connect the downstream point of the predetermined cut-off zone to an earth conductor of the electrical circuit prior to a severing of the conductive element or simultaneously with the severing of the conductive element.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, it is thus possible to isolate an electrical power supply line having an electrical fault from the rest of the electrical circuit and thus to limit the propagation of this electrical fault to other elements of the electrical circuit.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a portion of an electrical circuit <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">According to one embodiment, the electrical circuit <b>1000</b> is an electrical circuit of an aircraft. The portion of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b> shown comprises an electrical energy source <b>1</b> supplying power through an electrical power supply line <b>10</b> to an element that consumes electrical energy <b>11</b>. The electrical power supply line <b>10</b> is therefore a power supply line for supplying electrical energy to the consuming element <b>11</b>. The element that consumes electrical energy <b>11</b> is any electrical device, and is also commonly called a load, receiver or current receiver. The electrical power supply circuit for the element that consumes electrical energy <b>11</b> is closed by connection of the electrical energy source <b>1</b> to an electrical earth (ground) <b>14</b> and connection of the element that consumes electrical energy <b>11</b> to the same electrical earth <b>14</b>. The electrical line <b>10</b> comprises an electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> which is configured to be able to, if necessary, quickly open the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> at a location, which is predetermined by the physical position of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>, between the electrical energy source <b>1</b> and the element that consumes electrical energy <b>11</b>. Opening of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> is required, in particular, in the event of an electrical fault being detected, such as, for example, an overcurrent in this electrical power supply line. The electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> is configured to be activated, that is to say to be capable of opening the electrical line <b>10</b>, in response to at least one control signal carried by a control line <b>13</b>. The control signal <b>13</b> is delivered by a control module <b>15</b> that monitors the electric current present and measured in the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. The control module <b>15</b> acts as a supervisor of the electric current established in the electrical line <b>10</b> such that, in the event of overcurrent in the electrical line <b>10</b>, the control module <b>15</b> delivers the activation signal <b>13</b> to activate the electrical circuit breaker <b>100</b> in order to open the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. More precisely, the control module <b>15</b> is intended to deliver the activation signal <b>13</b> as soon as it detects that the value of the current measured in the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value. In the present description, the activation signal and the physical medium carrying this signal, that is to say, the control line, are both referenced <b>13</b>. The control module <b>15</b> continuously monitors the electric current present in the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">The circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> is mounted in series on the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> between a first point <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the electrical line <b>10</b>, called the &#x201c;upstream point&#x201d;, and a second point <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the electrical line <b>10</b>, called the &#x201c;downstream point&#x201d;. The electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> is therefore configured to open the electrical line in a predetermined zone situated between these two points. The term &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; is to be interpreted here as meaning arranged on the side of the electrical energy source <b>1</b> with respect to an opening point of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>, i.e., to the point at which the electrical power supply line is opened in the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>. In contrast, the term &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; is to be interpreted as meaning arranged on the side opposite the opening point of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> with respect to the electrical energy source <b>1</b>, that is to say, arranged on the side of the element that consumes electrical energy <b>11</b> with respect to the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>. An earth (ground) conductor <b>12</b> connects an electrical earth <b>14</b> of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b> to the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> at a connection point <b>12</b><i>a. </i>The electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> comprises an internal contactor device <b>120</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> but visible for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that makes it possible to connect the downstream point <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> to the connection point <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the earth conductor <b>12</b>, and therefore consequently to the electrical earth <b>14</b> of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b>, and also an internal severing device <b>110</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> but likewise visible for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that is capable of physically severing the electrical line <b>10</b> in a predetermined zone between the upstream <b>10</b><i>a </i>and downstream <b>10</b><i>c </i>points, so as to quickly open the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> electrically. Advantageously, it is thus possible to short-circuit the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> in the event of a fault occurring downstream of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>, before disconnecting the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> from the rest of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b>. This makes it possible to limit propagation of an overvoltage or an overcurrent to other elements of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b>, in particular in the critical case of a highly inductive electrical line which is therefore likely to release a lot of energy when it is opened. Short-circuiting the line before opening makes it possible to make the performance of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> independent of the inductance value of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. It is advantageously possible to reduce the energy to be dissipated in the electric arc produced by opening the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>, and to decrease to zero the overvoltage across the inputs of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>, and more broadly across all of the elements of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">The term &#x201c;contactor&#x201d; should be interpreted throughout the present description to mean a device that is configured to make irreversible contact between a point of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> bearing the electrical circuit breaker device <b>100</b> and another point of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b> comprising the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. In the present case, the contactor device <b>120</b> is configured here to establish a direct electrical contact between the downstream point <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> and a point of the earth conductor <b>12</b> in the immediate vicinity of the downstream point <b>10</b><i>c. </i>In other words, the contactor device <b>120</b> acts as a contactor device but also as a diverter, configured and used to divert the energy present in the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> to the earth conductor <b>12</b> and therefore ultimately to the earth <b>14</b> of the electrical circuit <b>1000</b>, after contact has been established between these elements.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">According to one embodiment, the contactor device <b>120</b> and the line-severing device <b>110</b>, both internal to the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>, are both configured such that they can be activated by pyrotechnic means that permit great responsiveness in the event of a fault appearing on the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">The current control circuit <b>15</b> can operate by direct or indirect measurement. In the case of direct measurement, the current measured in the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> flows into the control device <b>15</b>, which comprises a shunt resistor or a transistor. According to one variant, indirect measurement of the current in the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> is used and the control device <b>15</b> then comprises a galvanic isolation system between the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> and its internal measurement means. According to this variant, a parameter that is representative of the current established in the power supply line <b>10</b> is measured, such as, for example, the magnetic field induced by this current in a coil.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically illustrates an implementation principle of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>. The electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> comprises a conductive element, or conductor <b>10</b><i>b </i>which connects the upstream <b>10</b><i>a </i>and downstream <b>10</b><i>c </i>points of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. The upstream <b>10</b><i>a </i>and downstream <b>10</b><i>c </i>points each advantageously comprise elements for electromechanical connection (not shown in the figure), such as, for example, a screw terminal, crimping means, or any equivalent configured for the series connection of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> on the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. A pyrotechnic circuit breaker is arranged opposite the conductor <b>10</b><i>b. </i>The pyrotechnic circuit breaker is mainly composed of the severing device <b>110</b> made from an insulating material and of a pyrotechnic element <b>112</b> housed in a body <b>114</b>. This pyrotechnic circuit breaker can be activated by an exterior signal delivered by a control module. This signal, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for the sake of simplicity, is the activation signal <b>13</b> visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. When the activation signal <b>13</b> is controlled such that it is in its active state, a pyrotechnic solution of the pyrotechnic element <b>112</b> is ignited so as to activate the severing device <b>110</b> moved by the displacement of a piston in a chamber of the body <b>114</b>. When the severing device <b>110</b> is displaced following the ignition of the pyrotechnic element <b>112</b>, the severing device <b>110</b> physically severs the conductor <b>10</b><i>b, </i>at a predetermined cut-off point, that is to say opposite the severing device <b>110</b>, and in any case between the upstream point <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the downstream point <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. Although such an irreversible severing is very quick, that is to say, takes only a few milliseconds, the sudden opening of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>, which in essence is always relatively inductive, is of a nature to generate an electric arc which should be controlled as well as possible, as otherwise the efficiency and integrity of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> could be compromised. This is all the more true in the context of an aircraft, where pressure variations can occur around the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> and inside the latter. Advantageously, and for the purposes of best achieving the desired quick opening of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> by severing the conductor <b>10</b><i>b, </i>the contactor device <b>120</b> is used in the vicinity of the severing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">The contactor device <b>120</b> is arranged and configured to compress, or even crush, a portion of the earth conductor <b>12</b>, connecting the circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> to an earth <b>14</b> of the electrical circuit <b>100</b>, so as to short-circuit the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. Such a short-circuit is achieved by connecting the downstream point <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the power supply line <b>10</b> to the earth conductor <b>12</b>. To make the electrical contact, a contactor device <b>120</b>, preferably made from a conductive material, is itself also cleverly moved by a pyrotechnic element <b>122</b>, comprising a pyrotechnic solution. Advantageously and according to one preferred embodiment, the contactor device <b>120</b> is activated before the cut-off device <b>110</b> is activated. This ordering is achieved by igniting the pyrotechnic element <b>122</b> before igniting the pyrotechnic element <b>112</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the delay between the two ignitions is set and calibrated when the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> is manufactured. This delay may be determined by a control circuit designed to delay the activation signal of the pyrotechnic element <b>112</b> with respect to the activation signal of the pyrotechnic element <b>122</b>. Of course, the severing device <b>110</b> and contactor device <b>120</b> are arranged such that the activation of one does not in any way compromise the integrity of the other prior to its activation. Typically, the severing device <b>110</b> comprises a severing point that is configured to make a cut along a section of the conductor <b>10</b><i>b, </i>in a cut-off chamber delimited by the body <b>124</b> comprising arranged ferromagnetic elements and means for controlling the speed of the piston in the combustion chamber, etc. The contactor device <b>120</b> operates according to a similar principle, except that the contactor device <b>120</b> is configured not to sever the conductor portion <b>12</b> arranged opposite it, but to compress, or even crush, this conductor portion onto the conductor <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the power supply line <b>10</b>, and to consequently establish a sufficient electrical contact to short-circuit the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>. The implementation details of the pyrotechnic elements <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>, respectively arranged in the bodies <b>114</b> and <b>124</b>, are not described any further here in so far as they are not useful for understanding the invention.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">According to one implementation variant, the activation signals of the pyrotechnic elements <b>112</b> and <b>122</b> are distinct and controlled independently of one another. Advantageously, it is thus possible for an external activation controller, such as the control module <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to define the predetermined delay between the two respective ignitions of the two pyrotechnic elements <b>112</b> and <b>122</b>. According to this variant, two activation signals are then connected between the control module <b>15</b> and the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a first internal state of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> after activation of the contactor device <b>120</b> and before activation of the severing device <b>110</b>. The electrical contact established between the conductor <b>12</b> and the point <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> can be seen.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a second internal state of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> after activation of the contactor device <b>120</b> and after subsequent activation of the severing device <b>110</b>. In addition to the electrical contact established between the conductor <b>12</b> and the point <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>, the electrical opening of the power supply line <b>10</b> via physical severing of the conductor <b>10</b><i>b </i>opposite the severing device <b>110</b> can be seen.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates an implementation variant of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> according to which the severing device <b>110</b> and contactor device <b>120</b> are arranged in one single part or in two elements mounted integrally with each other, both moved by igniting just one single pyrotechnic element <b>112</b>. Of course, according to this variant, just one activation signal is used to activate the short-circuit of the conductor <b>10</b><i>b </i>and of the earth conductor <b>12</b>, and to activate the quick opening of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b>, via physical severing of the conductor <b>10</b><i>b. </i>Although the structure of the circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> is simplified thereby, this making the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> easier and less expensive to manufacture, this variant makes it more complex to ensure the operations are carried out in order, i.e. the short-circuiting operation first, then the operation of opening of the electrical power supply line subsequently. As a matter of fact, only the mechanical arrangement of the severing device <b>110</b> and contactor device <b>120</b> makes it possible to create a short-circuit first then a severing, for example, if the contactor device <b>120</b> has a more consequential protruding shape than the severing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> schematically illustrates an internal state of the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b> after activation and in the implementation variant according to which the electrical circuit breaker <b>100</b> comprises just one pyrotechnic element <b>112</b>. It is possible to see the contact established by the contactor device <b>120</b> between the conductor <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the conductor <b>12</b> by compression or crushing, and also the opening of the conductor <b>10</b><i>b </i>and therefore of the electrical power supply line <b>10</b> via a severing under the effect of the physical severing of the conductor <b>10</b><i>b </i>by the severing device <b>110</b>, which is made from an insulating material. According to this variant, both devices, the severing device <b>110</b> and the contactor device <b>120</b>, are made to move as a result of the ignition of one and the same pyrotechnic element <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> schematically illustrates an internal activation circuit of the pyrotechnic elements <b>122</b> then <b>112</b> comprising a delay module At making it possible to define a predetermined delay between the activation of the pyrotechnic element <b>122</b> and the subsequent activation of the pyrotechnic element <b>112</b>. The delay module At comprises a delay circuit that defines a propagation delay, for example using a combination of a resistive component and of a capacitive component. According to the embodiment shown, just one activation signal is used, which is delivered by an element external to the electrical circuit breaker assembly <b>100</b>, such as the control and activation module <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> schematically illustrates an internal activation circuit of the pyrotechnic elements <b>122</b> then <b>112</b> without an internal delay module making it possible to define a predetermined delay between the activation of the pyrotechnic element <b>122</b> and the subsequent activation of the pyrotechnic element <b>112</b>.
