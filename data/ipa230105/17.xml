Each cutting portion can be separated from an adjacent cutting portion by at least one projection of the plurality of projections. Adjacent projections of the plurality of projections can extend distally from opposite sides of each cutting portion defining a receiving space aligned with each cutting portion within which the stalk of a plant can be received to contact the respective cutting portion and be cut by the cutting portion into a first plant portion and a second plant portion. The tine assembly can be configured to be rotated to urge the first plant portion into the interior space of the housing. The auger can be disposed within the interior space and configured to urge the first plant portion toward and through the at least one rear opening.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, a method includes advancing a housing such that a base of a stalk of a plant is received in a receiving space defined between a first projection and a second projection extending from a front of the housing and such that at least one of the first projection or the second projection urges a non-stalk portion of the plant vertically upward away from the base of the stalk (e.g., away from an intended cutting location at the base of the stalk). The method further includes further advancing the housing (i.e., toward the plant) such that cutting blades disposed between the first projection and the second projection sever the base of the stalk at the cutting location such that the plant is divided into a first plant portion and a second plant portion and the first plant portion is pulled into an interior of the housing by a tine assembly disposed at least partially within the housing and urged toward a rear opening of the housing by an auger such that the first plant portion is deposited behind the housing via the rear opening as the housing is advanced.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, a method includes receiving a base of a stalk of a plant into a receiving space defined between a first projection and a second projection such that at least one of the first projection or the second projection urges a non-stalk portion of the plant upward away from the base of the stalk to expose a cutting location of the base of the stalk. The base of the stalk can be severed into a first plant portion and a second plant portion at the cutting location using one or more cutting blades disposed proximally of the receiving space (e.g., between the first projection and the second projection). The first plant portion can be moved (e.g., pulled or urged) into an interior space of the housing using a tine assembly disposed at least partially within the housing. The first plant portion can be urged toward a rear opening of the housing using an auger such that the first plant portion exits the housing via the rear opening.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, a system <b>100</b> includes a housing or frame <b>110</b>, a cutting assembly <b>105</b>, a tine assembly <b>140</b>, and an auger <b>150</b>. The cutting assembly <b>105</b> includes one or more cutting portions <b>120</b> and two or more projections <b>130</b>. The system <b>100</b> also includes or is couplable to an actuation assembly <b>170</b> and one or more wheel assemblies <b>180</b>. The actuation assembly <b>170</b> can be operably coupled to the tine assembly <b>140</b> and the auger <b>150</b> to control (e.g., simultaneously) rotation of the tine assembly <b>140</b> and the auger <b>150</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the actuation assembly <b>170</b> can also be operably coupled to the cutting portions <b>120</b> such that the actuation assembly <b>170</b> can control a cutting motion (e.g., a rotational movement or lateral axial movement) of cutting blades included at least partially within the cutting portions <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The housing <b>110</b> can define an interior space within which the auger <b>150</b> is disposed. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the tine assembly <b>140</b> can also be disposed within the interior space defined by the housing <b>110</b>. The housing <b>110</b> can include a bottom wall, opposing sidewalls extending upward from each end of the bottom wall, and a back wall extending upward from a back edge of the bottom wall. The back wall, the bottom wall, and/or a combination of the back wall and the bottom wall can define at least one rear opening <b>160</b>. In some embodiments, the housing <b>110</b> can include a top wall portion (e.g., defining an upper boundary of the interior space). In some embodiments, the housing <b>110</b> can include a curved wall portion coupling the back wall to the bottom wall, and the curved wall portion can define a portion of the rear opening <b>160</b> (e.g., in combination with the back wall and/or the bottom wall).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each wheel assembly <b>180</b> can include mounting hardware and at least one wheel. The wheel assemblies <b>180</b> can be mounted to the housing <b>110</b> such that the system <b>100</b> can be supported at least in part by the wheel assemblies <b>180</b> and can be translated (e.g., advanced forward relative to the ground and/or one or more rows of plants) via rotation of the wheels of the wheel assemblies <b>180</b>. In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> can include two wheel assemblies <b>180</b> (e.g., each coupled to opposing sides of the housing <b>110</b>). The system <b>100</b> (e.g., the housing <b>110</b>) can also be mounted to a vehicle such as a tractor (e.g., a loader) such that the system <b>100</b> is partially supported by the wheel assemblies <b>180</b> and partially supported by and translatable via rotation of the wheels of the wheel assemblies <b>180</b> under the power of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of the one or more cutting portions <b>120</b> can be disposed near or adjacent to a bottom front portion of the housing <b>110</b> (e.g., near or adjacent to a front edge of the bottom wall of the housing <b>110</b>). Each of the one or more cutting portions <b>120</b> can be operable to sever a plant at a cutting location (e.g., at a base of a stalk) into a first plant portion and a second plant portion as the system <b>100</b> is advanced (e.g., translated forward) relative to (i.e., towards) the plant. The first plant portion can include, for example, flowers, leaves, and at least a portion of a stalk of the plant. The second plant portion can include, for example, roots and any portion of the stalk of the plant disposed below the cutting location. The second plant portion can remain rooted in the ground after the plant is severed at the cutting location. The plant can be, for example, hemp plants.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> can include one, two, three, four, or more sets of cutting portions <b>120</b>. The cutting portions <b>120</b> can be axially-aligned and spaced apart along an axis disposed perpendicular to the direction of travel of the system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, each cutting portion <b>120</b> can each include at least a portion of at least one cutting blade. In some embodiments, each cutting portion <b>120</b> can be an exposed portion of a cutting blade assembly that extends along the axis and has alternating exposed and unexposed portions such that only the exposed portions can contact plants. Thus, in some embodiments, each cutting portion <b>120</b> can include a portion of one or more cutting blades that may also be included in other cutting portions <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, each cutting portion <b>120</b> can include one or more cutting blades distinct from the cutting blades in other cutting portions <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, each of the one or more cutting portions <b>120</b> can include a set of cutting blades. In some embodiments, each set of cutting blades can be rotatable about a central axis. The central axis of each set of cutting blades can be coaxial with each central axis of the remaining sets of cutting blades. The cutting blades of each set of cutting blades can be rotated to serially contact and cut the plant at the cutting location to sever the first plant portion from the second plant portion of the plant. In some embodiments, each set of cutting blades can include one, two, three, four, or more cutting blades coupled to (e.g., affixed to) and extending from a central axle. In some embodiments, each set of cutting blades can be coupled to (e.g., affixed to) and extend from a central rotatable bar such that rotation of the rotatable bar causes simultaneous rotation of each cutting blade of each set of cutting blades about a central axis of the central rotatable bar. The central rotatable bar can include discrete axle portions to which the cutting blades are attached formed as a unitary structure with connecting portions. In some embodiments, the central rotatable bar to which the cutting blades are coupled can be partially enclosed within a bar housing and/or by projections <b>130</b>. The bar housing can define openings within which the sets of cutting blades are disposed to expose the cutting blades such that the cutting blades can extend through the openings in the bar housing to cut plants and/or plants can be received within the openings and into contact with the cutting blades. The central rotatable bar can be rotated such that the cutting blades cut upward when rotated into contact with a plant (i.e., an upwardly directed cutting motion). Additionally, the cutting portions <b>120</b> can include a tubular member to which the cutting blades are coupled (e.g., mounted). The tubular member can define a passageway or lumen having a cross-sectional shape and size configured to receive and mate with the central rotatable bar such that rotation of the central rotatable bar causes rotation of the tubular member. For example, each can have a square, rectangular, or triangular cross sectional shape. Thus, the tubular member can be coupled to the central rotatable bar by sliding the tubular member along the central rotatable bar to the desired location and mounting the tubular member in place. If needed, such as due to a broken cutting blade, the tubular member can be decoupled via sliding the tubular member off of the central rotatable bar (after uncoupling any lateral securing mechanisms such as bolts and/or bearings). In some embodiments, the tubular member has a square-shaped outer cross-sectional area, with each of four cutting blades extending from a different outer surface of the tubular (e.g., in a direction perpendicular to adjoining surfaces and parallel to the surface to which the cutting blade is coupled). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a cross-section of a cutting portion <b>820</b> including a tubular member <b>821</b> defining a central passageway or lumen <b>821</b>A having a square-shaped cross-section, a central rotatable bar <b>824</b> disposed within the passageway <b>821</b>A, and four cutting blades <b>822</b>A, <b>822</b>B, <b>822</b>C, and <b>822</b>D coupled (e.g., welded) to the tubular member <b>821</b>. As shown, the first cutting blade <b>822</b>A can be coupled to a first surface <b>824</b>A of the tubular member <b>821</b> and can have a free end extending away from the tubular member <b>821</b> and the central rotatable bar <b>824</b> in a direction parallel to a plane including the first surface <b>824</b>A and perpendicular to the second surface <b>824</b>B of the tubular member <b>821</b>, which is perpendicular to the first surface <b>824</b>A. The second cutting blade <b>822</b>B is coupled to the second surface <b>824</b>B of the tubular member <b>821</b>, the third cutting blade <b>822</b>C is coupled to the third surface <b>824</b>C of the tubular member <b>821</b>, and the fourth cutting blade <b>822</b>D is coupled to the fourth surface <b>824</b>D of the tubular member <b>821</b> similarly to the manner in which the first cutting blade <b>822</b>A is coupled to the first surface <b>824</b>A. The cutting blades <b>822</b> can extend away from the central rotatable bar <b>824</b> any suitable distance. In some embodiments, the central rotatable bar <b>824</b> can be rotated clockwise for cutting.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, each of the one or more cutting portions <b>120</b> can include a set of cutting blades extending distally from a longitudinally-extending bar along an axis. The bar (also referred to as a cutter bar) can be moved laterally along the axis back and forth such that the cutting blades (also referred to as teeth or mowing fingers) also move back and forth and can cut plants that contact the cutting blades. In some embodiments, the cutting blades can move back and forth relative to one or more stationary sickle guards (e.g., a sickle guard can be disposed between each blade in an initial configuration of the cutting assembly <b>105</b>) and/or other cutting blades in the set. In some embodiments, the cutting blades can be shaped as triangular distally-extending teeth. In some embodiments, rather than having cutting blades evenly spaced and extending distally from the longitudinally-extending bar, the longitudinally-extending bar can include discrete portions (associated with the cutting portions <b>120</b>) to which the cutting blades are attached (that may be the same as or larger in length than exposed portions <b>120</b> of the longitudinally-extending bar that are exposed for contact with a plant) and may be formed as a unitary structure with connecting portions. In some embodiments, the longitudinally-extending bar to which the cutting blades are coupled can be partially enclosed within a bar housing and/or by projections <b>130</b>. The bar housing can define openings within which at least a portion of the sets of cutting blades are disposed during operation of the cutting assembly <b>105</b> to expose the cutting blades such that the cutting blades can extend through the openings in the bar housing to cut plants and/or plants can be received within the openings and into contact with the cutting blades.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each cutting portion <b>120</b> can be separated from an adjacent cutting portion by at least one projection <b>130</b>. The projections <b>130</b> can also be referred to as &#x201c;crop lifters.&#x201d; Adjacent projections <b>130</b> extending distally from opposite sides of each cutting portion <b>120</b> can define a receiving space aligned with each cutting portion <b>120</b> within which the stalk of a plant can be received to contact the respective cutting portion <b>120</b> and be cut by the cutting portion <b>120</b> into a first plant portion and a second plant portion. In some embodiments, the projections <b>130</b> can include a set (e.g., a pair) of projections <b>130</b> associated with each cutting portion <b>120</b>. For example, each projection <b>130</b> of a pair of projections can be arranged adjacent to a cutting portion <b>120</b> such that a first projection <b>130</b> extends from a first side of the cutting portion <b>120</b> (e.g., from a first end of an axle of a set of cutting blades of the cutting portion <b>120</b>, a location near a first end of a set of cutting blades of the cutting portion <b>120</b>, or a location at or near a first end of a cutting portion <b>120</b> defined by an opening in a bar housing) and a second projection extends from a second side of the cutting portion (e.g., from a second end of the axle of the set of cutting blades of the cutting portion <b>120</b>, a location near a second end of the set of cutting blades of the cutting portion <b>120</b>, or a location at or near a second end of the cutting portion <b>120</b> defined by the opening in the bar housing opposite the first end). Each projection <b>130</b> extends distally (e.g., forward) relative to the cutting portions <b>120</b> (e.g., the cutting blades) such that the projections can contact a plant and lift portions of the first plant portion (e.g., leaves, stems, and/or branches) of the plant away from the cutting location of the stalk (e.g., vertically upward) to expose the cutting location prior to the plant being received by a cutting portion <b>120</b>. For example, each projection <b>130</b> can be coupled (e.g., mounted) to the bar housing enclosing the central rotatable bar or longitudinally-extending bar described above to which cutting blades are coupled. Each projection <b>130</b> can taper away from the housing <b>110</b> and the cutting portion <b>120</b>. For example, each projection <b>130</b> can include an upper surface (e.g., a first plant portion contacting surface) that is tapered downward such that more distal portions of the upper surface are vertically lower than more proximal portions of the upper surface.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, each projection <b>130</b> can be formed as a tapered plate that extends distally relative to the cutting portions <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, one or more projections <b>130</b> can extends laterally the entire distance between adjacent cutting portions <b>120</b>, and one or more projections can extend laterally away from the outermost axially disposed cutting portions <b>120</b> (e.g., as end projections disposed between a cutting portion <b>120</b> and an end of the housing <b>110</b> and/or the system <b>100</b>). Thus, rather than each cutting portion <b>120</b> being associated with a discrete pair of projections <b>130</b>, adjacent cutting portions <b>120</b> can share one common tapered plate projection <b>130</b>. Thus, rather than a discrete pair of projections <b>130</b> defining the lateral boundaries of each receiving space aligned with each cutting portion <b>120</b>, in some embodiments, a first projection <b>130</b> and a second projection <b>130</b> can defined the boundaries of a first receiving space aligned with a first cutting portion <b>120</b>, and the second projection <b>130</b> and a third projection <b>130</b> can define the boundaries of a second receiving space aligned with a second cutting portion <b>120</b>. The tapered plate projection <b>130</b> can include an upper surface (e.g., a first plant portion contacting surface) that is tapered downward such that more distal portions of the upper surface are vertically lower than more proximal portions of the upper surface. The upper surface can be planar or rounded.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, each cutting portion <b>120</b> can be disposed a distance from an adjacent cutting portion <b>120</b> such that each cutting portion <b>120</b> can be simultaneously aligned with a respective row of plants. The rows can be arranged in parallel relative to one another and a plant from each row can be simultaneously contacted and severed by a cutting portion <b>120</b> aligned with that respective row. The system <b>100</b> can include any suitable number of cutting portions. For example, in some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> can include one, two, three, four or more sets of cutting portions <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The tine assembly <b>140</b> (also referred to as a reel or a pickup reel) includes at least one set of tines (also referred to as teeth) configured to be rotated about a central axis to urge plant material (e.g., a first portion of a plant cut by the cutting portions <b>120</b>) into an interior of the housing <b>110</b> and toward the auger <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, each set of tines can be arranged in a row (e.g., along a &#x201c;bat&#x201d;) extending from a first end to a second end of an interior of the housing <b>110</b> and disposed parallel to the remaining sets of tines. In some embodiments, each set of tines can be coupled to a central rotatable bar (e.g., via a connecting bar and/or plate) and disposed equidistant from the central rotatable bar such that rotation of the central rotatable bar causes rotation of each set of tines around the central axis of the central rotatable bar. In some embodiments, each tine in each set of tines can extend away from the central axis at any suitable angle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The auger <b>150</b> can be used to urge plant material (e.g., a first portion of a plant cut by the cutting portions <b>120</b>) disposed within the interior of the housing <b>110</b> toward and through one or more rear openings <b>160</b> defined by the housing <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, each of the one or more rear openings <b>160</b> are disposed a distance relative to an adjacent rear opening <b>160</b> such that, as the system <b>100</b> is advanced forward relative to the rows of plants, the first plant portions cut by the sets of cutting portions <b>120</b> are urged and/or fall from the rear openings <b>160</b> to form rows of first plant portions (i.e., windrows). In some embodiments, each rear opening <b>160</b> can be disposed in alignment with a cutting portion <b>120</b> such that the rows of plants that are disposed ahead of and are aligned with the cutting portions <b>120</b> are also aligned with the rows of cut first plant portions formed behind the system <b>100</b> as the system <b>100</b> advances (i.e., by the system <b>100</b> cutting the first plant portions from the second plant portions and moving the first plant portions through the system <b>100</b> and out of the rear openings <b>160</b>). Thus, in some embodiments, there are equal numbers of cutting portions <b>120</b> and rear openings <b>160</b>. In some embodiments, the center of each rear opening <b>160</b> is aligned with a center of a cutting portion <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the center of each rear opening <b>160</b> is spaced from the center of an adjacent rear opening <b>160</b> (e.g., the next closest rear opening in a series of two or more rear openings <b>160</b>) the same distance as the distance between the centers of adjacent cutting portions <b>120</b> and/or the distance between the center of beds within which rows of plants are planted from which the system <b>100</b> is intended to be harvesting plants simultaneously (e.g., about 60 inches or about 30 inches). In some embodiments, each rear opening <b>160</b> has a width in a plane parallel to the ground that is less than the axially-spaced distance between center points or end points of adjacent cutting portions <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the housing <b>110</b> defines only one rear opening <b>160</b> such that all plant portions that enter the housing <b>110</b> exit via the one rear opening <b>160</b> and form one row of plant portions behind the system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the rear opening <b>160</b> can be centered along the back and/or bottom of the housing <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As disclosed above, the actuation assembly <b>170</b> can be operably coupled to each of the auger <b>150</b>, the tine assembly <b>140</b>, and the one or more sets of cutting portions <b>120</b>. For example, the actuation assembly <b>170</b> can be coupled to the auger <b>150</b>, the central rotatable bar of the tine assembly <b>140</b>, and the central rotatable bar or longitudinally-extending bar to which the cutting blade(s) of the cutting portions <b>120</b> are coupled such that the actuation assembly <b>170</b> can simultaneously rotate the auger <b>150</b> and the tine assembly <b>140</b> and move the cutting portions <b>120</b> in a cutting movement (e.g., rotationally or laterally). In some embodiments, the actuator assembly <b>170</b> can be operatively coupled to the auger <b>150</b>, the central rotatable bar of the tine assembly <b>140</b>, and the central rotatable bar or longitudinally-extending bar associated with the cutting portions <b>120</b> to via one or more wheels and pulleys. In some embodiments, the actuation assembly <b>170</b> can include a motor assembly. The motor assembly <b>170</b> can be, for example, a hydraulic motor and can be powered and controlled via the vehicle to which the system <b>100</b> is coupled. For example, the system <b>100</b> can include hoses (e.g., hydraulic hoses) configured to couple the motor of the system <b>100</b> to a hydraulic actuator of the vehicle such that an interface of the vehicle can be used to control the actuation and/or direction of rotation of the auger <b>150</b>, the tine assembly <b>140</b>, and the cutting blades <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the actuation assembly <b>170</b> can be mechanically driven. For example, one or more pulleys operably coupled to the cutting assembly <b>105</b>, the auger <b>150</b>, and the tine assembly <b>140</b> can be coupled to one or more power take-off (PTO) shafts of the vehicle via a gear box so that mechanical power can be transferred from the vehicle to the pulleys to drive rotation of the auger <b>150</b> and the tine assembly <b>140</b> and to drive rotational and/or lateral cutting motion of the cutting portions <b>120</b>.

In some embodiments, the sets of cutting blades <b>420</b> can be rotated such that the contact with plants is an upward motion. For example, from the angle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the cutting blades <b>420</b> can be configured to be rotated in a clockwise cutting motion.

The central rotatable bar <b>424</b> can include discrete axle portions to which the cutting blades are attached formed as a unitary structure with connecting portions. For example, in some embodiments, the central rotatable bar <b>424</b> (also referred to as a drive shaft) can have a square cross-section, and each of the blades can be coupled to a tubular member having a square cross-section that is configured to receive the central rotatable bar <b>424</b> such that the tubular member can slide along the central rotatable bar <b>424</b>. When disposed in a desired location along the central rotatable bar <b>424</b>, bearings on each side of the tubular member can be mounted to the central rotatable bar <b>424</b> such that the tubular member is secured in place. The desired location of the tubular member and cutting blades can depend on the distance between beds of the plants to be harvested. For example, if the plants are arranged in beds spaced 60&#x2033; apart, the tubular member can be disposed such that a center of the tubular member is 60&#x2033; from the center of an adjacent tubular member so that plants can be harvested from the two beds simultaneously. If the beds are 30&#x2033; apart, the tubular members can be disposed such that their centers are 30&#x2033; apart.

Each cutting blade can have a surface that is co-planar with a surface of the tubular member and extend beyond the surface such that a cutting edge of the cutting blade can be rotated into severing contact with a plant. Thus, each cutting blade can be disposed in a plane that is perpendicular to the plane in which adjacent cutting blades are disposed and parallel to the plane in which an oppositely-disposed cutting blade is disposed.

The bar housing <b>425</b> can define openings within which the first set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, the second set of cutting blades <b>420</b>B, and the third set of cutting blades <b>420</b>C are disposed such that the cutting blades can extend through the openings in the bar housing <b>425</b> to cut plants and/or plants can be received within the openings and into contact with the first set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, the second set of cutting blades <b>420</b>B, and the third set of cutting blades <b>420</b>C.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each of the first set of projections <b>430</b>A, the second set of projections <b>430</b>B, and the third set of projections <b>430</b>C can be arranged adjacent to a respective one of the first set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, the second set of cutting blades <b>420</b>B, and the third set of cutting blades <b>420</b>C. For example, each of the first set of projections <b>430</b>A, the second set of projections <b>430</b>B, and the third set of projections <b>430</b>C can include a first projection extending from a first side of a set of cutting blades (e.g., from a first end of an axle of a set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C or a location near a first end of a set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C) and a second projection extending from a second side of the set of cutting blades (e.g., from a second end of the axle of the set of cutting blades <b>120</b> or a location near a second end of the set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, for example, the second set of projections <b>430</b>B includes a first projection <b>432</b>A and a second projection <b>434</b>A. The first projection <b>432</b>A and the second projection <b>432</b>A are disposed on opposite sides of the set of cutting blades <b>420</b>B. Additionally, the housing <b>425</b> can include segments extending between adjacent sets of projections <b>430</b>A, <b>430</b>B, or <b>430</b>C. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in some embodiments, instead of projections being arranged in sets, a projection can optionally extend from only one side of a set of cutting blades, as shown with respect to the first set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each projection of the sets of projections <b>430</b>A, <b>430</b>B, and <b>430</b>C can extend forward (i.e., distally) relative to the cutting blades of the respective sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, and <b>420</b>C such that the projections can contact a plant and lift portions of the first plant portion (e.g., leaves, stems, and/or branches) of the plant away from the cutting location of the stalk (e.g., upward) prior to the plant being received by the first set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, the second set of cutting blades <b>420</b>B, or the third set of cutting blades <b>420</b>C. For example, each projection of the sets of projections <b>430</b>A, <b>430</b>B, and <b>430</b>C can be coupled (e.g., mounted) to the bar housing enclosing the central rotatable bar to which the sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, and <b>420</b>C are coupled. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, each projection of the sets of projections <b>430</b>A, <b>430</b>B, and <b>430</b>C can taper away from the housing <b>410</b> and the respective sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, and <b>420</b>C. For example, each projection can taper from a larger height closer to a cutting blade to a lower height farther from the cutting blade. Each projection can have a maximum height that is higher than a distal-most portion of the nearest set of cutting blades such that any plant portion in contact with an upper surface of the projection will be urged away from a portion of the stalk of the plant first contacted by the set of cutting blades. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the projections can each include a tapered extension member (e.g., extension member <b>435</b>A) and a base portion (e.g., base portion <b>435</b>B) on an end of the tapered extension member opposite the end coupled to the housing <b>410</b>. The base portion can include flanges extending perpendicular to the extension member. In some embodiments, instead of including pairs of projections on either side of each cutting portion including a cutting blade set, the system <b>400</b> can include projections formed as tapered plates extending between the cutting portions as described with respect to other embodiments herein (e.g., projections <b>130</b>, projections <b>530</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Such tapered plate projections can be formed to have any suitable feature described herein, such as having an upper surface that has a maximum height higher than a rotation axis or a maximum height of the cutting blade set in a cutting portion adjacent the tapered plate projection. Thus, in some embodiments, no portion of the cutting assembly <b>405</b> may include a distally facing flat surface, ensuring that plant portions are directed upward and into the interior space of the housing <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, each set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, and <b>420</b>C can be disposed a distance from an adjacent set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C such that each set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, and <b>420</b>C can be simultaneously aligned with a respective row of plants. The rows can be arranged in parallel relative to one another and a plant from each row can be simultaneously contacted and severed by a set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, and <b>420</b>C aligned with that respective row. Although the system <b>400</b> is shown as including three sets of cutting blades, the system <b>400</b> can include any suitable number of cutting blades.

In some embodiments, the tine assembly <b>440</b> can include more or fewer sets of tines (e.g., three sets, four sets, six sets). Each set of tines is configured to be rotated about a central axis of a drive shaft <b>442</b> to urge plant material (e.g., a first portion of a plant cut by the sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C) into an interior of the housing <b>410</b> and toward the auger <b>450</b>. Each set of tines can be coupled to and extend from a tine-supporting bar (also referred to as a &#x201c;bat&#x201d;). Specifically, the first set of tines <b>446</b>A can extend from a first tine-supporting bar <b>444</b>A, the second set of tines <b>446</b>B can extend from a second tine-supporting bar <b>444</b>B, the third set of tines <b>446</b>C can extend from a fourth tine-supporting bar <b>444</b>C, the fourth set of tines <b>446</b>D can extend from a fourth tine-supporting bar <b>444</b>D, and the fifth set of tines can extend from a fifth tine-supporting bar (now shown). Each set of tines can be arranged in a row extending from a first end to a second end of the tine-supporting bar to which the tines are couple.

For example, the tine assembly <b>440</b> can include one or more plates <b>448</b>A, <b>448</b>B, <b>448</b>C, and <b>448</b>D and one or more extension portions <b>449</b> extending from each plate <b>448</b>A, <b>448</b>B, <b>448</b>C, <b>448</b>D. Each plate <b>448</b>A, <b>448</b>B, <b>448</b>C, and <b>448</b>D can be fixedly coupled to the drive shaft <b>442</b> at discrete locations along the drive shaft <b>442</b> (e.g., at a first end, a second end, and at intermediate locations along the drive shaft <b>442</b>). Each tine-supporting bar <b>444</b>A, <b>444</b>B, <b>444</b>C, and <b>444</b>D can be fixedly coupled to each plate <b>448</b>A, <b>448</b>B, <b>448</b>C, and <b>448</b>D via extension portions <b>449</b> fixedly coupled to and extending away from each plate <b>448</b>A, <b>448</b>B, <b>448</b>C, and <b>448</b>D.

For example, the motor assembly <b>470</b> can be coupled to a central rotatable bar of the auger <b>450</b> (e.g., via a pulley and a wheel <b>472</b>), the central rotatable bar of the tine assembly <b>440</b> (e.g., via a pulley and a wheel <b>474</b>), and the central rotatable bar to which the sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C are coupled (e.g., via a drive pulley <b>476</b>A (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and a wheel <b>476</b>) such that the motor assembly <b>470</b> can simultaneously rotate the auger <b>450</b>, the tine assembly <b>440</b>, and the cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C. The drive pulley <b>476</b>A can be a larger (e.g., wider and/or thicker pulley than the pulleys associated with the auger <b>450</b> and the tine assembly <b>440</b> such that sufficient rotational force is applied to the central rotatable bar (also referred to as a drive shaft) to which the sets of cutting blades can be coupled. In some embodiments, the drive pulley <b>476</b>A can be a 3V belt.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The motor assembly <b>470</b> can be, for example, a hydraulic motor and can be powered and controlled via the vehicle <b>490</b>.

In some embodiments, rather than including a hydraulic motor, for example, the system can be mechanically driven, such as via being coupled to a PTO shaft via a gear box.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the housing <b>410</b> can also include or be coupled to a pair of bars <b>419</b> disposed on an opposite side of the pulley assembly from the sidewall <b>414</b> of the housing to which the pulley assembly is mounted. As shown, the bars <b>419</b> can be disposed parallel to each other and can extend from a region distal of the pulley assembly (e.g., a distal edge of the sidewall <b>414</b>) to a region proximal of the pulley assembly (e.g., attached to the motor of the motor assembly <b>470</b>). In some embodiments, the bars <b>419</b> can be disposed at different angles relative to the sidewall <b>414</b> and/or the ground. The bars <b>419</b> can be vertically spaced and, optionally, horizontally disposed when the system <b>400</b> is in an operating configuration (e.g., translating forward). The bars <b>419</b> can be positioned such that they block debris from traveling into the pulley assembly and contacting the pulleys (e.g., the pulleys associated with the auger <b>450</b> and the tine assembly <b>440</b>. For example, the bars <b>419</b> can be positioned to block debris (e.g., rocks, dirt) that may be kicked up or otherwise displaced by the wheel <b>480</b>A. Although not shown or described with respect to other embodiments herein, any of the embodiments described herein can include bars similar to the bars <b>419</b> to prevent debris from reaching the pulley assembly from below.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">To operate the system <b>400</b>, after coupling the motor assembly <b>470</b> to the hydraulic actuator of the vehicle <b>490</b> and mechanically engaging a rear portion of the housing <b>410</b> with the vehicle <b>490</b> such that the housing <b>410</b> is partially supported by the wheels <b>480</b>A and <b>480</b>B and partially supported by the vehicle <b>490</b>, the vehicle <b>490</b> can be operated to advance the housing <b>410</b> toward one or more rows of plants (e.g., three rows of plants) that are spaced apart about the same distance as the one or more sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, or <b>420</b>C are spaced relative to an adjacent set of cutting blades. As the first set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, for example, nears a plant, the first set of projections <b>430</b>A can first contact a first portion of the plant (e.g., leaves and/or branches of the plant). As the system <b>400</b> continues to advance relative to the plant, the first portion of the plant can be urged upward due to the taper (i.e., the increasing height relative to the ground) of the first set of projections <b>430</b>A, exposing a cutting location of the plant. When the first set of cutting blades <b>420</b>A contacts the plant at the cutting location and separates (e.g., slices) the plant into the first plant portion and a second plant portion (e.g., the root and base of the stalk below the cutting location), the first set of tines <b>446</b>A can rotate downward to contact the first plant portion and urge the first plant portion into an interior of the housing <b>410</b> and toward the auger <b>450</b>. When the first plant portion reaches the auger <b>450</b>, the auger <b>450</b> can urge the first plant portion <b>450</b> toward the rear opening <b>460</b> such that the first plant portion <b>450</b> falls through the rear opening <b>460</b> into a row of first plant portions being formed behind the system <b>400</b>. Each of the other sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>B and <b>420</b>C and sets of projections <b>430</b>B and <b>430</b>C, respectively, can simultaneously separate other plants into first and second plant portions such that the tine assembly <b>440</b> also pulls the other first plant portions into the interior of the housing <b>410</b> and toward the auger <b>450</b> simultaneously. Each of the sets of cutting blades <b>420</b>A, <b>420</b>B, and <b>420</b>C, the tine assembly <b>440</b>, and the auger <b>450</b> can simultaneously be operating on different first plant portions simultaneously as the system <b>400</b> advances down one, two, or three rows of plants to cut the plants and form them into a single row (e.g., a windrow).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, in some embodiments, the systems described herein can include projections formed as tapered plates extending distally relative to cutting portions.

Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d;, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein in the specification and in the embodiments, &#x201c;or&#x201d; should be understood to have the same meaning as &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, &#x201c;or&#x201d; or &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as &#x201c;only one of&#x201d; or &#x201c;exactly one of,&#x201d; or, when used in the embodiments, &#x201c;consisting of,&#x201d; will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. &#x201c;one or the other but not both&#x201d;) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as &#x201c;either,&#x201d; &#x201c;one of&#x201d; &#x201c;only one of&#x201d; or &#x201c;exactly one of.&#x201d; &#x201c;Consisting essentially of,&#x201d; when used in the embodiments, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As used herein in the specification and in the embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, &#x201c;at least one of A and B&#x201d; (or, equivalently, &#x201c;at least one of A or B,&#x201d; or, equivalently &#x201c;at least one of A and/or B&#x201d;) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiments, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;carrying,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; &#x201c;holding,&#x201d; &#x201c;composed of,&#x201d; and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">While specific embodiments of the present disclosure have been outlined above, many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
