The wash water sprayed at high pressure hits a surface of an object to be washed to remove foreign substances remaining on the object to be washed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A user needs to use detergent for a dishwasher to operate the dishwasher. However, the user can put ordinary detergent into a dispenser or the tub out of negligence or ignorance. Thus, a large amount of foam is generated in the tub.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When a large amount of foam is generated in a pre-wash course or a main wash course, the dishwasher can make operational errors, resulting in a halt to the wash operation. Further, a large amount of foam can lead to an increase in air pressure in the wash space and leakage of the wash water from a door provided at a front of the tub.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A controlling method of a dishwasher is disclosed in Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2019-0004151 as a prior art document.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure is directed to a dishwasher and a method of controlling the same that may measure an amount of foam generated in a wash space accurately and rapidly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is also directed to a dishwasher and a method of controlling the same that may measure an amount of foam generated in a wash space without an additional device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure is also directed to a dishwasher and a method of controlling the same that may remove foam generated in a wash space within a short period of time.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure is also directed to a dishwasher and a method of controlling the same that may prevent an increase in an amount of foam, caused by a downward movement of wash water to a bottom of a tub, when the wash water is sprayed through a top spray arm and an upper spray arm during a foam removal operation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure is also directed to a dishwasher and a method of controlling the same that may prevent a proceeding course and a remaining course from stopping when foam is detected and removed, thereby alleviating user inconvenience.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure is also directed to a dishwasher and a method of controlling the same that may make no operational errors and guarantee user convenience.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Objectives of the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned ones, and other objectives and advantages of the disclosure which are not mentioned can be understood from the following description, and more clearly understood from the embodiments of the disclosure.

The number of times of performing the foam removal operation may be proportional to an amount of the foam in the wash space <b>12</b><i>a</i>, That is, a larger amount of foam in the wash space <b>12</b><i>a </i>may result in an increase in the frequency of the foam removal operation, and a smaller amount of foam in the wash space <b>12</b><i>a </i>may result in a decrease in the frequency of the foam removal operation.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">In an example, when an amount of foam in the wash space <b>12</b><i>a </i>is less than the threshold amount of foam, the foam removal operation may not be carried out. In another example, when the user uses <b>3</b><i>g </i>of ordinary detergent, the foam removal operation may be repeated five times. In another example, when the user uses <b>9</b><i>g </i>of ordinary detergent, the foam removal operation may be repeated nine times, In yet another example, when the user uses <b>15</b><i>g </i>of ordinary detergent, the foam removal operation may be repeated 14 times.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Further, the foam removal operation may be performed as a result of control over driving of the water supply valve <b>22</b>, the plurality of spray arms <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, the wash pump <b>150</b>, the drainage pump <b>250</b> and the like.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">After the foam removal operation is performed more than once, the remaining operations (i.e., operations in the pre-wash course, or the main wash course, or the heating and rinsing course) of the dishwasher <b>1</b> may be continuously performed. That is, after the foam removal operation is performed more than once in case foam is generated in the pre-wash course, the remaining operations of the pre-wash course may be carried out; after the foam removal operation is performed more than once in case foam is generated in the main wash course, the remaining operations in the main wash course may be carried out; after the foam removal operation is performed more than once in case foam is generated in the heating and rinsing course, the remaining operations in the heating and rinsing course may be carried out.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In one embodiment, the foam removal operation may include a drainage operation by the drainage pump <b>250</b>, a water supply operation by the water supply valve <b>22</b> and a wash operation by the wash pump <b>150</b> and the plurality of spray arms <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, In this case, the drainage operation, the water supply operation and the wash operation may be consecutively performed.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">That is, the controller may control driving of the water supply valve <b>22</b>, the plurality of spray arms <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, the wash pump <b>150</b> and the drainage pump <b>250</b> such that the foam removal operation is performed more than once, to remove the foam in the wash space <b>12</b><i>a </i>in each of the pre-wash course, the main wash course and the heating and rinsing course, The foam removal operation may include a drainage operation, a water supply operation and a wash operation that are consecutively performed.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">The drainage operation may be a process of draining the wash water stored in the sump <b>100</b> outward.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In this case, the drainage operation may include a first drainage operation, an intermediate water supply operation and a second drainage operation. The first drainage operation, the intermediate water supply operation and the second drainage operation may be consecutively performed.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">The first drainage operation may be a process of draining at least part of the wash water in the sump <b>100</b> by the drainage pump <b>250</b> outward. For example, the first drainage operation may be performed for 10 seconds.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">The intermediate water supply operation may be process of supplying wash water to the sump <b>100</b> by the water supply valve <b>22</b> after the first drainage operation is carried out, Accordingly, the wash water may be further stored in the sump <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">The second drainage operation may be a process of draining all the wash water stored in the sump <b>100</b> through the drainage pump <b>250</b> outward. For example, the second drainage operation may be performed for 10 seconds.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In summary, the drainage operation may be carried out twice to remove the foam. That is, when the drainage operation is performed once, the foam may be left on an inner wall and a lower surface of the sump <b>100</b>, and the foam may not be effectively removed. According to the disclosure, the drainage operation may be performed twice such that the foam is removed efficiently.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">The water supply operation may be a process of supplying wash water to the sump <b>100</b> through the water supply valve <b>22</b>. For example, in the water supply operation, <b>3</b>L of wash water may be supplied to the wash space <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">The wash operation may be a process of spraying the wash water, stored in the sump <b>100</b>, to the plurality of spray arms <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> by the wash pump <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">In one embodiment, in the wash operation, the controller may control the wash pump <b>150</b> and the lower spray arm <b>13</b> to spray the wash water to the lower spray arm <b>13</b> among the plurality of spray arms <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. In this case, the upper spray arm <b>14</b> and the top spray arm <b>15</b> may not spray the wash water. That is, the controller may control the diverter valve <b>130</b> to spray the wash water only through the lower spray arm <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view showing a concept of spraying wash water <b>910</b> of the lower spray arm <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the wash operation, the controller may control driving of the lower spray arm <b>13</b> such that a maximum height of the wash water <b>910</b> sprayed from the lower spray arm <b>13</b> corresponds to a height of a lower surface of the lower rack <b>16</b>. That is, the height of the wash water <b>910</b> sprayed from the lower spry arm <b>13</b> may be the same as the height of the lower rack <b>16</b> in a predetermined error range. In other words, a spray pressure of the wash water <b>910</b> sprayed from the lower spray arm <b>13</b> may be controlled by the controller to prevent the wash water from spraying over a bottom portion of the lower rack <b>16</b>. In an example, the controller may set an RPM of a wash motor (not illustrated) in the wash pump <b>150</b> to <b>2000</b> to prevent the wash water <b>910</b>, sprayed from the lower spray arm <b>13</b>, from spraying over the bottom portion of the lower rack <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In summary, in the wash operation, when water is sprayed through all the top spray arm <b>15</b>, the upper spray arm <b>14</b> and the lower spray arm <b>13</b>, foam may be increased due to a spray pressure, a flow of the wash water and the like. According to the disclosure, the wash water is sprayed only to the row spray arm <b>13</b> among the plurality of spray arms <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. Also, the height of the wash water (i.e., the spray pressure of the wash water) sprayed from the lower spray arm <b>13</b> is the same as the height of the lower rack <b>16</b> within the predetermined error range. Accordingly, the wash operation may be performed effectively.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">In one embodiment, the foam removal operation may further include an intermittent wash operation performed between the water supply operation and the wash operation. The intermittent wash operation may be a process that is intermittently performed instead of being performed in all the foam removal operations. When the intermittent wash operation is further carried out, the foam may be removed more definitely.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">As described above, when the foam removal operation is performed more than once, the controller may control the communicator such that at least one of information indicating that the foam removal operation is performed/completed more than once and information on extension of time for operation of the dishwasher <b>1</b> following the foam removal operation performed more than once is transmitted to an external terminal device or may control the input interface to display the at least one information.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">According to the present disclosure, as the foam removal operation is performed more than once as described above, deterioration of wash performance and leakage of wash water caused by a large amounts of foam may be prevented, foam generated in the wash space <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be removed within a short period of time, and user convenience in use of the dishwasher <b>1</b> may be ensured without causing an operational error.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">Even though all the components of the embodiment of the present disclosure are coupled as a single unit or coupled to operate as a single unit in the above description, the embodiment in the disclosure may not be limited. That is, among the components, one or more components may be optionally coupled to operate as one or more units within the range of the disclosure. In addition, although each of the components may be implemented as an independent hardware, some or all of the components may be optionally combined with each other, so that they can be implemented as a computer program having one or more program modules for executing some or all of the functions combined in one or more hardwares. Codes and code segments forming the computer program may be easily conceived by one skilled in the technical field of the disclosure.
