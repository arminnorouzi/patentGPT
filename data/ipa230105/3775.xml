The invention also relates to a drive train having a device, a vehicle having a drive train, and to a computer program and a machine-readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Methods for current measurement are known in which a current in a power-electronic system, for example in a DC-voltage converter, can be measured via the voltage drop of a smoothing choke, for example. No separate shunt resistor is required for this. Such methods are known as &#x201c;DCR current sensing&#x201d;, where the abbreviation &#x201c;DCR&#x201d; stands for &#x201c;DC resistance&#x201d; of the choke. Here, the current through the choke is measured indirectly by detecting the voltage drop across the choke and continuously integrating it. The measured current is obtained by integrating the voltage. For this purpose, an integrator circuit is used, which is matched to the electrical properties of the choke, for example by means of an RC low-pass, for example a series circuit of a resistor and capacitor in parallel with the choke. Under very rapid current changes, the inductive component of the voltage drop across the choke dominates over the voltage drop across the copper resistance of the choke. For DC currents, on the other hand, no voltage is dropped across the inductance, so that the current can be measured directly via the ohmic copper resistance of the choke. The integrator circuit is dimensioned such that its time constant or its cutoff frequency is almost identical to the time constant or cutoff frequency of the choke. The time constant of the integrator circuit corresponds to the product of the ohmic resistance and capacitance of the integrator circuit (R*C). The time constant of the choke corresponds to the quotient of the inductance of the choke divided by the ohmic resistance of the choke (L/Rdc). Therefore, for identical time constants, the product of the ohmic resistance and capacitance of the integrator circuit corresponds to the quotient of the inductance of the choke divided by the ohmic resistance of the choke (R*C=L/Rdc). This ensures that the overall transfer function is constant over the entire frequency range. The transfer function of the choke is given by: Rdc+s*L, or that of the RC filter of the integrator circuit: 1/(1+s*R*C), with s=&#x3c9;. Multiplying the two functions, the overall transfer function is obtained:</p><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>G</mi>   <mo>&#x2061;</mo>   <mo>(</mo>   <mi>s</mi>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>R</mi>    <mrow>     <mi>d</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>c</mi>    </mrow>   </msub>   <mo>*</mo>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>/</mo>      <mi>s</mi>      <mo>*</mo>      <mfrac>       <mi>L</mi>       <msub>        <mi>R</mi>        <mrow>         <mi>d</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>c</mi>        </mrow>       </msub>      </mfrac>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>+</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>s</mi>       <mo>*</mo>       <mi>R</mi>       <mo>*</mo>       <mi>C</mi>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mfrac>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">If both time constants are equal, then the frequency-dependent component is always 1 and thus the following applies: G(s)=Rdc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">The advantages of this measuring principle compared to other current sensors such as a shunt resistor are the lower unit costs, the smaller space requirements, and a loss-free current measurement. However, the measurement accuracy is limited because the copper resistance of the choke is subject to high production tolerances and is also highly temperature-dependent. Temperature compensation can be achieved by means of an NTC resistor connected in parallel with the capacitor of the integrator circuit. The temperature-dependent gain factor of the sensor circuit is varied in such a way that it counteracts the temperature coefficient of the copper resistance of the choke and thus almost completely compensates for the influence of temperature.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">However, the circuit design above does not allow measurement of a current that is not only fluctuating but also changing its direction of flow, and thus flowing bi-directionally. The resulting negative voltage measurement signals cannot be processed without additional circuit complexity. In such cases, it is known to shift the zero point by means of an injected bias offset voltage in order to extend the measuring range for negative currents and thus always output positive voltage measurement signals. However, the temperature compensation using an NTC resistor changes the offset voltage depending on temperature, which means that the current value can no longer be correctly derived from the voltage measurement signal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for alternative measuring circuits.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">A device is provided for measuring a current through a choke of a voltage converter having an integrator circuit, an amplifier circuit, and an NTC resistor. A load current flows through the choke of the voltage converter. The choke is connected on the output side to an output terminal of the voltage converter. The integrator circuit is arranged in parallel with the choke. The integrator circuit comprises a series circuit consisting of an integrator resistor and an integrator capacitor. The integrator capacitor is also connected to the output terminal of the voltage converter. A center tap is implemented between the integrator resistor and the integrator capacitor as an output of the integrator circuit. An integrator output signal is present at this output of the integrator circuit. The amplifier circuit comprises an inverting and a non-inverting amplifier input terminal and an amplifier output terminal. The non-inverting amplifier input terminal is supplied with an amplifier input signal depending on the integrator output signal. A voltage signal characterizing the current through the choke is present at the amplifier output terminal of the amplifier circuit. The NTC resistor is arranged in the feedback path of the amplifier circuit between the inverting amplifier input terminal and the amplifier output terminal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">A device is provided for measuring a preferably bidirectional current through a choke, which is preferably designed as a smoothing choke on the secondary side at the output of a voltage converter. The device comprises an integrator circuit and a preferably active amplifier circuit. An integrator output signal is present at the output of the integrator circuit. An amplifier input signal is fed to the non-inverting amplifier input terminal as a function of the integrator output signal, wherein for this purpose the output of the integrator circuit is preferably electrically connected to the non-inverting amplifier input terminal, preferably directly connected. The NTC resistor is arranged in the feedback path of the amplifier circuit between the inverting amplifier input terminal and the amplifier output terminal.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">A device is advantageously provided, in which the NTC resistor is arranged independently of a possible offset voltage, thus allowing an undistorted measurement of bidirectional currents. Since the NTC resistor is decoupled from a potential zero-point offset generation, any adverse effect due to the NTC resistor is avoided. An extension of the measuring circuit used for DCR current measurement is provided for bi-directional currents without the use of a bipolar supply voltage and while maintaining the temperature compensation using an NTC resistor and active amplifier circuit.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">In another embodiment of the invention, the amplifier circuit comprises an operational amplifier.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">The amplifier circuit comprises an operational amplifier which preferably operates as a non-inverting operational amplifier. A means is advantageously created of providing an efficient amplifier circuit which enables an economical implementation of the device. An additional active amplifier circuit using operational amplifiers is preferably used, wherein the amplifier stage is also used to amplify the useful signal, in particular the integrator output signal, in order to achieve an improved resolution of the useful signal. The amplification of the useful signal is preferably applied if the copper resistance of the inductor coil is very low in relation to the measured current.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">In another embodiment of the invention, the device comprises a reference voltage source with a positive source terminal and a negative source terminal. Using the reference voltage source, a first offset voltage is coupled in at the output of the integrator circuit. Preferably, the negative source terminal is connected to the output terminal of the voltage converter and the positive source terminal is connected to the output of the integrator circuit via a coupling resistor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Using a reference voltage source, a first offset voltage is coupled in at the output of the integrator circuit. As a result, the potential of the integrator output signal is raised. This allows the circuit to be used even for currents flowing in the opposite direction. A device is advantageously provided that can be used to detect bi-directional currents.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">Preferably, the zero point offset, the first offset voltage, at the output of the integrator circuit is generated by means of the reference voltage source which is coupled into the signal path, the integrator output signal, via the coupling resistor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">In another embodiment of the invention, a second offset voltage is coupled into the feedback path at the inverting amplifier input terminal of the amplifier circuit by means of the reference voltage source. Preferably, the negative source terminal is connected to the output terminal of the voltage converter and the positive source terminal is connected to the output terminal of the voltage converter via a voltage divider having a first, second and third voltage divider resistor. Furthermore, a tap between the second and third voltage divider resistors is preferably connected to the inverting amplifier input terminal.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">By means of the reference voltage source, a second offset voltage is coupled in at the inverting amplifier input terminal of the amplifier circuit. Advantageously, this results in the possibility, preferably by dimensioning of the voltage divider resistors, that the second offset voltage at the inverting input of the operational amplifier will be set identical to the voltage at the non-inverting input, even if no current flows through the choke. The second offset voltage preferably remains the same even with increasing currents through the choke.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Preferably, the amplifier circuit or the operational amplifier operates as a non-inverting amplifier. If the NTC resistor changes with temperature, the linear gain factor of the circuit changes at the same time, because the NTC resistor changes the dividing factor in the feedback path. To ensure that a third offset voltage at the output of the amplifier circuit remains constant independently of temperature, the reference voltage source is also fed into the feedback path of the amplifier circuit. The voltage divider resistors, preferably three of them, form a voltage divider. By appropriate dimensioning of the resistors, the second offset voltage at the inverting input of the amplifier circuit will be set almost identical to the voltage at the non-inverting input. If the current to be measured through the choke increases from OA to higher values, only the voltage increase due to the current change is amplified. Preferably, the first, second and third offset voltages remain the same if no current flows through the choke.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">In another embodiment of the invention, in the feedback path of the amplifier circuit between the inverting amplifier input terminal and the amplifier output terminal, a series resistor is arranged in series with the NTC resistor and a parallel resistor is arranged in parallel with the series circuit consisting of series resistor and NTC resistor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">A resistor is arranged in series with the NTC resistor and a parallel resistor is arranged in parallel with the series circuit consisting of the serial and NTC resistors. These three resistors are arranged in the feedback path of the amplifier circuit between the inverting amplifier input terminal and the amplifier output terminal. A circuit arrangement for linearizing the NTC resistance over temperature is advantageous. Without this circuit arrangement, the resistor behaves nonlinearly with temperature.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">Preferably, the resistor in series with the NTC resistor and a parallel resistor in parallel with the series circuit of the series and NTC resistors serves to linearize the NTC resistor with temperature, since the NTC resistor behaves non-linearly with temperature. The function of the series resistor is to prevent the total impedance consisting of the NTC resistor, the series resistor, and the parallel resistor from becoming too small at high temperatures. The function of the parallel resistor, on the other hand, is to prevent the total impedance of the NTC resistor, the series resistor, and the parallel resistor from becoming too highly resistive at low temperatures.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">In another embodiment of the invention, a first filter capacitor is arranged in parallel with the NTC resistor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">Advantageously, a circuit arrangement is provided that adjusts the gain factor in a frequency-selective manner. The first filter capacitor, connected in parallel with the NTC resistor, short-circuits the NTC resistor at higher frequencies so that it is no longer active above a specified or specifiable cutoff frequency.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">In another embodiment of the invention, a second filter capacitor is arranged in parallel with the first voltage divider resistor or the second voltage divider resistor.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">Advantageously, a circuit arrangement is provided that adjusts the gain factor in a frequency-selective manner. The second filter capacitor, connected in parallel to the first or second voltage divider resistor, short-circuits the first or second voltage divider resistor at higher frequencies so that it is no longer active above a specified or specifiable cutoff frequency and only one of the two voltage divider resistors is now active. Therefore, the NTC resistor preferably only acts frequency-selectively at low frequencies below a specified or specifiable cutoff frequency, preferably the cutoff frequency of the choke, which is given by the quotient of its inductance and copper resistance.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">Preferably, an amplifier circuit is provided which enables the measuring range for bi-directional currents and the temperature compensation by means of an NTC resistor at the same time, wherein the NTC resistor is not connected to the output of the integrator circuit but instead is arranged in the feedback path of the amplifier circuit.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">Furthermore, the time constants of the choke and the integrator circuit are preferably kept as constant as possible over temperature in order to keep the gain factor of the device for measuring the current through a choke, i.e. the sensor circuit, constant over the frequency range. If this were not the case, the device for measuring the current through a choke could generate a measurement error during rapid current changes or, conversely, in the case of short-circuit monitoring, measure the current too slowly. Since the NTC resistor in this circuit is no longer connected to the output of the integrator circuit, the first and second filter capacitors are used to adjust the gain factor frequency-selectively so that it remains constant both over temperature and over the frequency range. The first filter capacitor short-circuits the NTC resistor at higher frequencies so that it is no longer active above a specific cutoff frequency, or no longer contributes to the overall gain. With the second filter capacitor, the effect of the first voltage divider resistor is switched off for higher frequencies, so that only the second voltage divider resistor now contributes to the overall gain. This allows the amplifier to be set such that the NTC resistor acts frequency-selectively only in a specific frequency range, preferably towards the low frequencies, preferably only at low frequencies below a specified or specifiable cutoff frequency, preferably the cutoff frequency of the choke, which is given by the quotient of its inductance and copper resistance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Therefore, the zero-point offset generation is decoupled from the NTC resistor and a bidirectional current measurement is thus possible. The first, second and third offset voltages are not adversely affected by the temperature and a constant overall transfer function is also maintained over the frequency range.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The present invention also relates to a voltage converter having an above-described device. For this purpose the voltage converter is designed as an inverter, as a DC converter, or as a charging device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">A special voltage converter with a device for measuring a current through a choke is advantageously provided.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The invention also relates to a drive train of a vehicle with a voltage converter.
