More particularly, the invention is directed to a composition having a pH that is over the natural pH of skin and that comprises a specific zwitterionic to anionic surfactant system. The composition is, unexpectedly, preserved with a naturally derived preservative comprising benzoic acid and/or a derivative thereof. The preservative surprisingly provides superior antimicrobial benefits to compositions having a surfactant system with zwitterionic to anionic surfactant at a weight ratio of 1:8 to 1:2, even when such compositions are formulated to have a pH over the natural pH of skin to as high as 7.25 and less than 8.0% by weight total sulfate-based surfactant. In addition to having antimicrobial stability, the compositions of the present invention are mild, remain free of discoloration, syneresis and odor after being stored for 3 months at 45&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">DMDM hydantoin, parabens, methylisothiazolinone as well as methylchloroisothiazolinone are commonly used preservatives found in consumer products. Such preservatives have been safely used for years and are known to work well at maintaining the integrity and stability of certain end use compositions. Another preservative suitable for use in consumer products is sodium benzoate. However, sodium benzoate, while generally regarded as safe, is well known for use in compositions that are well within an acidic pH range and under the natural pH of skin. Notwithstanding, there is a desire to use naturally derived preservatives, and especially, preservatives that include components suitable to work well across a full range of consumer products that are formulated at a pH that is over the natural pH of skin. Moreover, such naturally derived preservatives should be effective at preserving products, not be skin sensitizing and not negatively impact the sensorial characteristics of consumer products they are formulated in, and particularly, those that are topically applied. They should also not induce any negative composition characteristics, like color change, odor or syneresis to the products they are added to.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to delivering superior antimicrobial benefits, the naturally derived preservative should not be harmful to the environment and gentle enough for use on the most fragile consumer, babies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention, therefore, is directed to a composition having a specific surfactant ratio and a naturally derived preservative. The preservative comprises benzoic acid and/or a derivative thereof that, surprisingly, provides superior antimicrobial benefits to compositions having a weight ratio of zwitterionic to anionic surfactant from 1:8 to 1:2, even when such compositions are formulated to have a pH over the natural pH of skin to as high as 7.25 and less than 8.0% by weight sulfate-based surfactant. Moreover, such a preservative system unexpectedly does not negatively impact the composition's stability, color and odor, and provides superior antimicrobial benefits when formulated therein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Efforts have been disclosed for making preservative systems.

The resulting formulae had a pH of 6.5 and a water activity at about 0.96. Each formula made was split and weighed into 5 different aliquots. The 5 different aliquots were then inoculated with a respective organism or organism mix as identified below, resulting in challenged formulations. Inoculum was equal to 1% of the formula weight and at initiation did not alter the character of the formula being challenged. All formulae were thoroughly mixed manually after inoculation to distribute the respective microorganisms uniformly. The challenged formulations were then stored at about 25&#xb0; C. for the duration of the test.
