The applications of gyroscopes include, but are not limited to, military, aircraft navigation, robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming etc. Gyroscopes can be mechanical or optical, and can vary in precision, performance, cost and size. Since optical gyroscopes do not have any moving parts, they have advantages over mechanical gyroscopes as they can withstand effects of shock, vibration and temperature variation better than the mechanical gyroscopes with moving parts. The most common optical gyroscope is the fiber optical gyroscope (FOG) that operates based on interferometric measurements of optical phase shift due to the Sagnac effect (a phenomenon encountered in interferometry that is elicited by rotation). Construction of a FOG typically involves a coil comprising several turns of polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber. Laser light is launched into both ends of the PM fiber coil so that two optical beams travel in opposite directions. If the fiber coil is moving, the optical beams traveling in opposite directions experience different optical path lengths with respect to each other. By setting up an interferometric system, one can measure the small path length difference that is proportional to the area of the loop enclosed by the turns of the fiber coil and the angular velocity of the rotating fiber coil. This path length difference is expressed as a phase signal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Phase signal of an optical gyro is proportional to the Sagnac effect times the angular rotation velocity, as shown in the following equation:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;&#x3d5;=(8&#x3c0;<i>NA/&#x3bb;c</i>)&#x3a9;<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">where, N=number of turns in the gyro,</li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A=area enclosed</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">&#x3a9;=angular rotation velocity</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">&#x394;&#x3d5;=optical phase difference signal</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">&#x3bb;=wavelength of light</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">c=speed of light</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Fiber-based gyroscopes can provide very high precision, but at the same time, they are of larger footprint, are very expensive, and are hard to assemble due to the devices being built based on discrete optical components that need to be aligned precisely.

Four main process flows are described: (1) process flow based on a repeated sequence of oxide deposition and anneal; (2) chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP)-based process flow followed by wafer bonding; (3) Damascene process flow followed by oxide deposition and anneal, or wafer bonding; and (4) CMP-based process flows followed by oxide deposition. Any combination of these process flows may be adopted to meet the end goal of fabricating optical gyroscope waveguides in one or more layers on a silicon substrate using standard silicon fabrication technologies. In this particular application, the CMP-based process flows achieve at least two objectives: obtaining accurate thickness of a layer without having to precisely control the deposition parameters, and, obtaining a desired surface roughness of the CMP-ed top surface of a SiN core, as the surface roughness has a big impact on waveguide loss. Note that CMP can be used even before depositing the SiN layer to further reduce roughness of the deposited SiN layer.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The key to fiber-based optical gyroscopes' high performance is the long length of high quality, low loss, optical fiber that is used to measure the Sagnac effect. The present inventors recognize that with the advent of integrated silicon photonics suitable for wafer scale processing, there is an opportunity to replace FOGs with smaller integrated photonic chip solutions without sacrificing performance. Photonics based optical gyros have reduced size, weight, power and cost, but in addition can be mass produced in high volume, are immune to vibration and have the potential to offer performances equivalent to FOGs.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">One key element of this integrated photonic solution is to produce very low loss waveguides that can be manufactured using wafer scale processes and can be used to replace the long length PM optical fiber in optical gyros. The technology platform used for this integrated photonics based optical gyros is based on silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) waveguide core surrounded by oxide or fused silica claddings. The whole waveguide structure is sometimes referred to as SiN waveguide for simplicity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Disclosed herein are configurations and methods to produce very low loss SiN waveguides that can be used as integral component for a small-footprint integrated optical gyroscope, which is abbreviated as SiPhOG&#x2122; (Silicon Photonics Optical Gyroscope). The propagation loss in the SiN waveguides fabricated according to the process flows described herein can be well below 0.1 db/meter. This is a vast improvement over the current state-of-the-art SiN process with propagation loss in the range of 0.1 db/centimeter. The key to lowering the loss while using the standard silicon fab processes and equipment is to either use high quality fused silica (sometimes called &#x201c;glass&#x201d;) wafers, or, using wafers with a pre-grown oxide as a lower cladding and then depositing a silicon oxide layer of the required thickness as the upper cladding by repeated deposition/anneal steps. The repeated deposition/anneal steps ensure precise control of thickness of the upper cladding layer, as well as expunging trapped hydrogen from the deposited layers.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present inventors recognize that distributing the SiN waveguide coils (or spirals) and/or rings into different vertically separated layers (e.g., two or more layers) leads to lower values of gyro sensitivity without increasing the form factor.

Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a wafer with a substrate <b>102</b> with a pre-grown oxide layer <b>104</b>. The substrate <b>102</b> may be a silicon substrate and the pre-grown oxide layer may be a crystalline layer with an example dimension of 10-15 &#x3bc;m. The key characteristics of the layer <b>104</b> is that it has low absorption peak at the wavelengths of interest (e.g., around 1550 nm, but not necessarily at exact 1550 nm, as the waveguide propagation loss may be optimized for a wavelength slightly different from 1550 nm.) The wafer may be polished on both sides.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that a SiN layer is deposited to form a layer on top of and adjacent to the pre-grown oxide layer <b>104</b>, which is patterned to create waveguide core <b>106</b>. A non-limiting illustrative dimension of the SiN waveguide core <b>106</b> is a height (i.e. thickness &#x2018;h&#x2019; of the waveguide layer) of 60-100 nm and a lateral width of 2-10 &#x3bc;m. Persons skilled in the art would appreciate that these illustrative dimensional values mentioned in the specification are not limiting to the scope of the disclosure. The SiN layer may be deposited using Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) process or other processes. The bottom SiN layer <b>108</b> may remain intact, where the top SiN layer is photolithographically or otherwise patterned on the pre-grown oxide layer <b>104</b> to form waveguide core <b>106</b>. In order to reduce line edge roughness in the SiN waveguide core <b>106</b>, some post-etch treatment may be needed. For example, a blanket Argon (Ar) sputter step after photoresist and lithography assist layers (e.g., BARC) may be removed to smooth the top and sides of the SiN waveguide core <b>106</b>. Alternatively, a blanket dip in hot phosphoric acid may be performed, which has very high selectivity between SiN (high etch rate) and the pre-grown oxide <b>104</b>. Post-etch clean may include a Piranha clean (e.g., hot sulfuric acid mixed with peroxide) and SC1 (diluted hot ammonium hydroxide and peroxide mix) or SC2 (hydrochloric acid mixed with peroxide). Finally, a post-etch high temperature anneal may be performed to drive any remaining hydrogen or other impurities from the SiN layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows that in an alternative embodiment, instead of a crystalline pre-grown oxide layer <b>104</b>, other types of oxide start material <b>103</b> can be used too as the bottom cladding, an example of which is non-crystalline fused silica (&#x201c;glass&#x201d;) or quartz.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Continuing with the process flow with the pre-grown oxide layer <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a silicon oxide layer (also called TEOS layer) <b>110</b> is grown to cover the SiN waveguide core <b>106</b>. The silicon oxide layer <b>110</b> may have a total thickness of 2-3 &#x3bc;m. The hydrogen in the TEOS layer needs to be minimized, and the growth rate is adjusted accordingly. Optionally, a pre-deposition anneal may be performed (e.g., at 1150-1200&#xb0; C. for 2 or more hours). Total final thickness of the TEOS layer may be obtained in several rounds, e.g. each round producing a layer that is 0.1 to 0.2 &#x3bc;m thick. Note that the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> has asymmetric cladding around the waveguide core <b>106</b>, as the upper cladding is TEOS (layer <b>110</b>), and the lower cladding is grown oxide (layer <b>104</b>). The waveguide loss depends largely on the quality of the TEOS layer acting as the upper cladding.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the oxide layer <b>110</b> comprises individual layers of deposited TEOS, each deposition followed by an anneal step to drive hydrogen away.

For example, if a total thickness of layer <b>110</b> is 2 &#x3bc;m, then ten layers may be deposited, each having 0.2 &#x3bc;m thickness. Typically a high-temperature LPCVD method is used for TEOS deposition. The method may start with a pre-deposition anneal. Then deposition-anneal-deposition-anneal sequence is repeated multiple times.

The same analogy applies to a planer device such as the SiPhOG where the fiber is replaced by a planer waveguide. To design a sensitive system, one would like to get the longer length and to maximize the product (L*D). However, a limitation to such a system is the propagation loss of the SiN waveguide. The present inventors have developed several methods to reduce the propagation loss such as the deposition-anneal sequence described above. From measurement data, it was determined that the reduction of loss is approaching the limit of the loss caused by the properties of the bulk material and the loss would largely depend on scattering caused by imperfections in the fabrication process. Since the waveguide cores are thin and wide (e.g., 60-100 nm thick and 2-3 um wide), the propagation loss has very low dependency on the roughness of the side walls of the waveguide core, and high dependency on the roughness of the bottom and top of the waveguide core. The waveguide-based gyroscope sensing coil with multiple turns can be tens of meters long, and it has been experimentally validated that the excess loss in the SiN chip can be attributed to scattering loss. In order to improve the scattering loss, the inventors have demonstrated that chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) can be used to reduce the roughness of the top and bottom surfaces of the waveguide core. The resulting levels of loss post-CMP is comparable to a new polished silicon wafer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>24</b></figref> illustrate one possible CMP flow to create SiN waveguide core in an oxide bottom cladding layer, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
