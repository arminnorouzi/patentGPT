A thin glass, silicon or other dielectric substrate material is created having a plurality of holes or vias that are metalized in such a manner as to create an electrical path. The integrated circuit packaging industry refers to these interconnection substrates as interposers. Holes fabricated into the interposer are typically very small, for example, 5 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m in diameter and 50 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m in depth. The number of holes per square centimeter may be in the hundreds or even thousands. Following the processing necessary to fabricate these holes the next step is to metalize the hole to provide for an electrically conductive pathway from one circuit plane or substrate to another.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current state of the art processes known as &#x201c;copper electroplate&#x201d; methods for metalizing interposer through and blind holes are very costly and generally lack manufacturing scalability. The metallization methods include a combination of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) or evaporative or sputtering deposition to form an adhesion/barrier/and or seed layer followed by electroplating, typically of copper. The equipment necessary to run these processes is expensive and difficult to scale to high-throughput manufacturing. For instance, the copper electroplating process can typically take 1 to 8 hours for each substrate, depending on substrate size, hole diameter and aspect ratio. The electroplating process requires each substrate to be electroplated in an individual process cell having sophisticated analytical and dispensing controls and precise chemical species and electrical field distribution across the substrate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electroplated copper deposits extending beyond the surface of the substrate are referred to in the art as &#x201c;over burden.&#x201d; To level the copper electroplated deposit flush or planar with the substrate surface typically requires a secondary process using chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). Maintenance and operation of the CMP process requires highly skilled technicians for monitoring and control to achieve consistent results. Copper is a relatively soft metal and methods used to mechanically remove the excess copper are constrained by the loading of the soft copper into the abrasive material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A second method of depositing copper or other electrically conductive materials into via holes in interposer substrates utilizes metallic inks. The metallic inks typically are formulated using metal powder dispersed in a bonding resin or other polymer for ease of hole filling and a capping agent to prevent the metallic powder from oxidizing. After the holes are filled with the metallic ink along with the resin or capping agents it is necessary to volatize all organic materials and remove them from the metallic powder to achieve reasonable electrical conductivity. Temperatures required for volatizing these organic compounds may reach 400 C to 800 C. The carbon ash left after volatizing the organic compounds may negatively impact optimal conductivity and leave significant potential for discontinuous filling of the hole. The potential for discontinuous or electrically open areas in the filled hole or via is unacceptable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most of these processes work only on a very limited hole length/width ratio, and narrow or extra wide holes are very difficult to manufacture in a consistent manner.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one example of the present disclosure, an electrical component can include a substrate that defines a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface, and an electrically conductive via that extends from the first surface to the second surface, such that the first and second surfaces define respective first and second openings to the hole. The electrical component can further include an electrically conductive fill that extends in the hole from the first surface to the second surface, wherein the electrically conductive fill defines an electrically conductive path from the first surface to the second surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments of the present application, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings.

Further, for one or more of the disclosures described herein, numerous alternative embodiments may be described; it should be appreciated that these are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not limiting of the disclosures contained herein or the claims presented herein in any way. One or more of the disclosures may be widely applicable to numerous embodiments, as may be readily apparent from the disclosure. In general, embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice one or more of the disclosures, and it should be appreciated that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical, software, electrical and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the particular disclosures. Accordingly, one skilled in the art will recognize that one or more of the disclosures may be practiced with various modifications and alterations. Particular features of one or more of the disclosures described herein may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments or figures that form a part of the present disclosure, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments of one or more of the disclosures. It should be appreciated, however, that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or figures with reference to which they are described. The present disclosure is neither a literal description of all embodiments of one or more of the disclosures nor a listing of features of one or more of the disclosures that must be present in all embodiments.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">A description of an embodiment with several components in communication with each other does not imply that all such components are required. To the contrary, a variety of optional components may be described to illustrate a wide variety of possible embodiments of one or more of the disclosures and in order to more fully illustrate one or more aspects of the disclosures. Similarly, although process steps, method steps, algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order, such processes, methods and algorithms may generally be configured to work in alternate orders, unless specifically stated to the contrary. In other words, any sequence or order of steps that may be described in this patent application does not, in and of itself, indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of described processes may be performed in any order practical. Further, some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non-simultaneously (e.g., because one step is described after the other step). Further still, some steps illustrated in a method can be omitted. Moreover, the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto, does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to one or more of the disclosure(s), and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred. Also, steps are generally described once per embodiment, but this does not mean they must occur once, or that they may only occur once each time a process, method, or algorithm is carried out or executed. Some steps may be omitted in some embodiments or some occurrences, or some steps may be executed more than once in a given embodiment or occurrence. Further, some of the steps can be eliminated in some embodiments. Further still, other steps can be added as desired.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Techniques and mechanisms described or referenced herein will sometimes be described in singular form for clarity. However, it should be appreciated that particular embodiments may include multiple iterations of a technique or multiple instantiations of a mechanism unless noted otherwise. Process descriptions or blocks in figures should be understood as representing modules, segments, or portions of code which include one or more executable instructions for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. Alternate implementations are included within the scope of embodiments of the present disclosure in which, for example, functions may be executed out of order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrently or in reverse order, depending on the functionality involved, as would be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, a substrate <b>20</b> defines opposed outer surfaces including a first surface <b>22</b> and a second surface <b>24</b> opposite the first surface along a direction. The substrate <b>20</b> further includes a plurality of internal surfaces <b>29</b> that define a respective plurality of holes <b>26</b>. The holes <b>26</b> extend from the first surface <b>22</b> toward the second surface <b>24</b> along a central axis. For instance, the holes can extend from the first surface <b>22</b> to the second surface <b>24</b> along the central axis. The substrate <b>20</b> can be cut into wafers of 150 mm, 200 mm, or 300 mm in diameter, but it is recognized that the substrate <b>20</b> can define any suitable diameter or other maximum dimension as desired. Thus, the term &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; can be used interchangeably with the term &#x201c;maximum cross-sectional dimension&#x201d; to denote that the structure of reference need not be circular unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The holes <b>26</b> can have any suitable diameter as desired. For instance, the holes <b>26</b> can have a diameter or other cross-sectional dimension that range from 10 &#x3bc;m to 25 &#x3bc;m. The holes <b>26</b> can have a depth along their respective central axes within a range from 100 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m. The diameter requirements have no upper limit. The aspect ratio between hole diameter and hole depth are unlimited for this process. Additionally, a plurality of different hole diameters may be placed in the same substrate. The holes <b>26</b> can be conical in shape, cylindrical in shape, hourglass shaped, or can define any suitable shape along their length. The holes <b>26</b> can be arranged in one or more hole arrays <b>27</b> as desired. Thus, the substrate <b>20</b> can define one or more arrays <b>27</b> spaced with each other at any suitable distance suitable for cutting the glass and separating the arrays into 27 discrete components of the substrate <b>20</b>. While glass substrates can have particular applicability to certain end-use applications, it should be appreciated that substrate <b>20</b> can be a glass substrate, a silicon substrate, a ceramic substrate, a sapphire substrate, or any organic substrate or any other substrate of any suitable alternative material as desired. When the substrate <b>20</b> is a glass substrate, the glass can be substantially lead-free, including lead-free, in one example. In other examples, the glass can include lead.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The term substantially &#x201c;lead-free,&#x201d; derivatives thereof, and phrases of like import as used herein can refer a quantity of lead is in accordance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) specifications. In one example, the term &#x201c;lead-free,&#x201d; &#x201c;free of lead,&#x201d; and derivatives thereof can mean that means that the quantity of lead is less than 0.1% by weight, including 0% by weight. Alternatively or additionally, the term &#x201c;lead-free,&#x201d; derivatives thereof, and phrases of like import as used herein can mean that the quantity of lead is less than 0.1% by volume. In another example, the term &#x201c;lead-free,&#x201d; derivatives thereof, and phrases of like import as used herein can mean that the quantity of lead is less than 100 parts per million (ppm).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">At least one or more of the holes <b>26</b> can be configured as a through hole <b>28</b> that extends through the substrate <b>20</b> from the first surface <b>22</b> to the second surface <b>24</b>. Thus, the first surface <b>22</b> defines a first opening <b>23</b> to the through hole <b>28</b>, and the second surface <b>24</b> defines a second opening <b>25</b> to the through hole <b>28</b>. Otherwise stated, the through hole <b>28</b> defines a first end at the first opening <b>23</b>, and a second end at the second opening <b>25</b>. Thus, both the first and second ends of the through holes <b>28</b> are open to the outer perimeter of the substrate <b>20</b>. The through hole <b>28</b> can be straight and linear from the first opening <b>23</b> to the second opening <b>25</b>. Alternatively, one or more portions of the through hole <b>28</b> can be angled, bent, or define any suitable alternative non-straight shape.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Alternatively or additionally, at least one or more of the holes <b>26</b> can be configured as a blind hole <b>30</b> that can extend from one of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> toward the other one of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Further, the blind hole can terminate at a location spaced from the other of the first and second surfaces and <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Thus, the blind hole <b>30</b> is open to one surface of the substrate <b>20</b> at a first end, and internally closed by the substrate <b>20</b> at a second end opposite the first end. Otherwise stated, the first terminal end of the blind hole <b>30</b> extends to one of the first and second openings <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> at the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively, and the second terminal end of the blind hole <b>30</b> is disposed between the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. It is recognized, however, that the second terminal end of the blind hole <b>30</b> can terminate at another hole <b>26</b>, and thus can be in fluid communication with both the first and second openings <b>23</b> and <b>25</b>. Further, the blind hole <b>30</b> can be linear, or can have one or more segments that are angled with respect to each other. One or more of the segments can include a lateral component. The substrate <b>20</b> can include a sacrificial hole that extends from the blind hole <b>30</b> to an outer surface of the substrate <b>20</b>. For instance, when the blind hole <b>30</b> is open, either directly or through another hole, to the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, the sacrificial hole can extend from the closed end of the blind hole <b>30</b> to the second surface <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, in accordance with one example, one or more up to all of the holes <b>26</b> can be contain an electrically conductive material so as to define an electrically conductive via <b>34</b>. In one example, the electrically conductive material can include an electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> that is disposed in the respective one or more up to all of the holes <b>26</b>. Thus, the electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can at least partially define the electrically conductive via <b>34</b>. As will be appreciated from the description below, additional electrically conductive materials can be disposed in the hole <b>26</b> so as to further define the electrically conductive via <b>34</b>. The hole arrays <b>27</b> including the electrically conductive material illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> can thus define via arrays. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the substrate <b>20</b> having electrically conductive vias <b>34</b> can be referred to as an electrical component.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In particular, the through hole <b>28</b> that contains the electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can be said to define a through via <b>36</b>. The buried hole <b>30</b> that contains the electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can be said to define a buried via <b>39</b>. Thus, the term &#x201c;via&#x201d; and derivatives thereof as used herein can refer to one or both of the through via <b>36</b> and the buried via <b>39</b>. The electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can extend continuously from the first end of the via <b>34</b> to the second end of the via <b>34</b>. Thus, the electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can define an electrically conductive path along the via <b>34</b> in the direction that extends between first end of the via and to the second end of the via. For instance, the electrically conductive path can be defined from the first end of the via <b>34</b> to the second end of the via <b>34</b>. In this regard, it is appreciated that the first and second ends of the via <b>34</b> can be defined by the first and second openings <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> when the via <b>34</b> is a through via <b>36</b>.

In one example, the substrate <b>20</b> can be configured as an electrical interposer configured to make electrical connections at each of the first surface <b>22</b> and the second surface <b>24</b> at electrical contacts that are in electrical communication with each other through the electrically conductive via <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can be defined by any suitable highly conductive electrically conductive material as desired so as to create the electrically conductive via <b>34</b>.

In one example, the electrically conductive material can be metallic. For instance, the electrically conductive material can be copper, gold, silver, aluminum, or any suitable alternative metal or alloys thereof or other combinations thereof. Thus, the electrically conductive material can include a copper alloy. Alternatively or additionally, the electrically conductive material can include a silver alloy. Alternatively or additionally, the electrically conductive material can include a gold alloy. Accordingly, in certain examples, the electrically conductive vias <b>34</b> can be referred to as metallized vias <b>34</b>.

The electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can extend in the via <b>34</b> from the first end of the via to the second end of the via, such that the electrically conductive material defines an electrically conductive path from the first end to the second end.

The method begins at step <b>42</b>, whereby the substrate <b>20</b> and at least one suspension <b>60</b> of particles <b>62</b> suspended in a liquid medium are procured. Next, at step <b>44</b>, the at least one suspension can be agitated as desired so as to disperse the particles in the liquid medium.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, at step <b>46</b>, the holes <b>26</b> can be filled with one or both of the particles and the liquid medium of the at least one suspension <b>60</b>. It is appreciated that the term &#x201c;filled&#x201d; as used herein with respect to the suspension <b>60</b> includes at least partially filled or entirely filled, unless otherwise indicated. The filling step can be achieved by performing a filling operation that forces the suspension into the holes <b>26</b> under one or more of a pressure, which could be a positive pressure or a negative pressure, a centrifugal force, and an electrostatic force. The filling step <b>46</b> can include on filling operation or a plurality of filling operations. At step <b>50</b>, the particles are packed together to increase the packing density of the particles in the holes. The filling and compacting steps <b>46</b> and <b>50</b> define a filling and compacting sequence <b>55</b> that can be repeated as many times as desired until the hole <b>26</b> receives a desired volume of particles <b>62</b>. In some examples, however, the compacting step <b>50</b> can be omitted, as will be described in more detail below. In one example, the desired volume of particles <b>62</b> can extend substantially from the first end of the hole <b>26</b> substantially to the second end of the hole <b>26</b>. When the hole <b>26</b> is a through hole, the particles <b>62</b> can extend to one or both of the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> and the second surface <b>24</b>. In some examples, the holes <b>26</b> can be overfilled with the particles <b>62</b>, such that the particles <b>62</b> are filled beyond one or both of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">At step <b>52</b>, the metallic particles <b>62</b> are sintered so as to define a metallic structure, or metal via. In some examples, the method <b>40</b> can proceed from the filling step <b>46</b> to the sintering step <b>52</b> without performing the step of increasing packing density <b>50</b>. At step <b>53</b>, the metallic structure can be subjected to a pressing step whereby the metallic structure is compressed at one or both of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively, of the substrate <b>20</b>, thereby sealing the interface between the particles <b>62</b> and the substrate <b>20</b>. As will be described in more detail below, the pressing step can be an isostatic pressing step, or a uniaxial or hard pressing step. At step <b>54</b>, the vias can be sealed if desired. In some examples, step <b>54</b> can be omitted. Thus, the method can advance from step <b>52</b> to step <b>56</b>. As will be appreciated from the description below, the particles <b>62</b> can define a hermetic seal with themselves and with the substrate <b>20</b>. The combination of the sintered particles <b>62</b> and air can define the electrically conductive fill. Finally, at step <b>56</b>, at least one or more redistribution layers <b>37</b> are applied to one or both of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.

Further, step <b>42</b> can include the step of suspending the particles <b>62</b> in the liquid medium <b>64</b>, or procuring the suspension <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As described above, the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be defined by any suitable electrically conductive material as desired. For instance, the electrically conductive material can be a metal, such as copper, silver, gold. Alternatively, the electrically conductive material can be a combination of more than one metal. For instance, one metal can be coated onto another metal. Alternatively or additionally, the electrically conductive material can be an electrically conductive polymer. In one example, a metal can coat the electrically conductive polymer. Alternatively, the electrically conductive polymer can coat one of the metals. It should be appreciated that one or more of the electrically conductive metals and the electrically conductive polymer can coat any suitable material as desired. In one example, the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be silver particles. Alternatively or additionally, the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be configured as include copper particles coated with silver. Alternatively or additionally, the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be configured as uncoated copper particles.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In this regard, it is recognized that silver is a high electrical conductivity metal. Further, silver is a highly ductile metal, which can be useful during sintering. In particular, the present inventors have discovered that the process of sintering silver does not crack glass substrates whose vias are filled with silver particles. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the malleability of silver particles allows the substrate <b>20</b> to expand and contract during and after sintering without damaging the structural integrity of the substrate <b>20</b>. At the same time, silver exhibits sufficient strength characteristics. Further still, silver is a substantially nonporous metal, which thereby enhances the electrically conductivity of the resulting electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> in the via <b>34</b>. Alternatively or additionally, as described above, the particles <b>62</b> can be gold particles, or particles of any suitable alternative material. Alternatively still, as described above, the particles <b>62</b> can be copper particles. While copper particles can be subject to oxidation, it is believed that the oxidation layers can be removed from the copper particles during the methods described herein. For instance, it is believed that at least a portion of the oxidation layer of the copper particles can be removed under vacuum or centrifugal forces described in more detail below. Further, at least a portion up to substantially all of the remaining oxidation layer can be removed during a sintering operation of the type described below. It can therefore be desirable to sinter the copper at step <b>52</b> in reduction conditions for the copper oxide.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, it can be desirable for the particles <b>62</b> to be substantially spherical such when they are packed, the particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> define respective interstices <b>66</b> therebetween (see., e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>) that can combine to define at least one liquid flow path for the evacuation of the liquid medium <b>64</b> from the holes <b>26</b>, leaving behind the particles <b>62</b> in the holes <b>26</b>. Thus, the term &#x201c;substantially spherical&#x201d; recognizes that the particles <b>62</b> might not be perfectly spherical, but they can approximate the shape of a sphere to the extent that the resulting interstices <b>66</b> define a reliable flow path. Thus, the particles <b>62</b> can define any shape that they define the interstices <b>66</b> described herein. Accordingly, the particles <b>62</b> can be at least partially or entirely curved, rounded, or can alternatively or additionally include straight edges. Further, it should be appreciated that when the holes <b>26</b> are at least partially or entirely filled with the particles <b>62</b>, the fill <b>35</b> can include pores that are defined by the interstices <b>66</b>. It should be appreciated that the interstices can define internal air pores of the electrically conductive material in the holes <b>26</b>. In some examples, substantially all pores of the electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can be defined by the interstices. The term &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; derivatives thereof, and words of similar import as used herein with respect to a value, size, shape, direction, or location, can include the stated value, size, shape, direction, and location, and variances up to 10% of the stated value or shape, or location, including 8%, 5%, 3%, 2%, and 1%, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, it can be desirable for the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be crystallite controlled so that the particles <b>62</b> can be sintered without substantial densification, as described in more detail below. While it can be desirable for the silver or copper to be as pure as possible, and thus devoid of organic material, it is recognized that processes for producing the particles <b>62</b> that are both substantially spherical silver or copper and crystallite controlled can produce particles having trace amounts of organic material. Therefore, &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; as used with respect to a material of the particles <b>62</b> can mean greater than 90% pure material, by weight. In one example, the particles <b>62</b> can be greater than 95% pure material by weight. For instance, the particles <b>62</b> can be greater than 98% pure material by weight. That is, the particles <b>62</b> can be devoid of more than 2% organic impurities by weight. For instance, the particles can be approximately 98.3% pure material by weight. Otherwise stated, in one example, the substantially pure particles <b>62</b> can mean 10% or less of organic material by weight, such as less than 5% organic material by weight, and in one example less than 2% of organic material by weight. For instance, the particles can have approximately 1.7% organic material by weight. In one example, the solid particles <b>62</b> have a porosity of no greater than approximately 5% by volume.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus, though the electrically conductive material can include a small quantity of organic material as described above, it can be said that the resulting via <b>34</b> can include only the electrically conductive material and air. It can further be said that the resulting via <b>34</b> can consist essentially of the electrically conductive material and air. As described above, the electrically conductive material can be a metal such as silver or copper in some examples, but other materials are contemplated as set forth herein. Or the silver or copper can be mixed with conductive polymers to get more conduction in the air gaps. Further, the particles <b>62</b> can be substantially nonporous, such that when sintered a resulting sintered matrix is produced that provides a highly conductive path from the first end of the via to the second end of the via. In one example, the via can conduct DC current and radio frequency (RF) current at desirable rates.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">For instance, the electrically conductive via <b>34</b> can conduct RF signals along an entirety of its length with an insertion loss of no more than approximately &#x2212;0.15 decibels (dB) at an approximately 20 gigahertz (GHz) operating frequency. For instance, the insertion loss can be no more than approximately &#x2212;1 dB at an approximately 20 GHz operating frequency in some examples. For instance, the insertion loss can be no more than approximately &#x2212;0.5 dB at an approximately 20 GHz operating frequency in some examples. For instance, the insertion loss can be no more than No more than approximately &#x2212;0.3 dB at an approximately 20 GHz operating frequency in some examples. For instance, the insertion loss can be no more than approximately &#x2212;0.1 dB out to an approximately 20 GHz operating frequency some examples. The term &#x201c;no more than&#x201d; in this context is used to connote &#x201c;no less negative than&#x201d; the stated decibels.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The liquid medium can be any suitable liquid medium as desired to suspend the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b>. In one example, the liquid medium <b>64</b> can be an alcohol. In particular, the alcohol can be one of isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol. In this regard, it is recognized that metals such as silver and copper can have a zeta potential, or electrical surface charge. Thus, particles of the metals can thus potentially agglomerate with each other. Further, the particles can interact with the substrate that can be electrostatically charged, for instance when the substrate is a glass substrate, and with each other. The alcohol can be mildly polar, and thus can be configured to neutralize the zeta potential of the particles <b>62</b>. Further, the particles <b>62</b> can be coated with an organic anti-agglomerating agent that prevents the particles from agglomerating in the liquid medium <b>64</b>. The anti-agglomerating agent can be defined by a fatty acid. For instance, the fatty acid can be an oleic acid. Alternatively, the fatty acid can be a stearic acid.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The particles <b>62</b> can be sized as desired. It will be appreciated that it can be desirable for the particles <b>62</b> to be sized sufficiently large such that the interstices <b>66</b> define a reliable liquid flow path to evacuate the liquid from the holes <b>26</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> while leaving behind the electrically conductive material in the holes <b>26</b>. However, it can be desirable for the particles <b>62</b> to be sized sufficiently small such that the resulting via <b>34</b> contains a suitable volume of the electrically conductive material of the particles so as to define a reliable electrical path from the first end of the via to the second end of the via. In one example, the particles <b>62</b> can have an average size within a range from approximately 1 microns to approximately 10 microns, such as from approximately 2 microns to approximately 10 microns. In one example, the average size of the particles <b>62</b> can be range from approximately 2 microns to approximately 4 microns. In another example, the average size of the particles <b>62</b> can range from approximately 2.5 microns to approximately 3.5 microns.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">It is recognized, however, that an auxiliary electrically conductive material can be added to the particles <b>62</b> in the interstices <b>66</b> as part of the electrically conductive fill after the liquid medium <b>64</b> has been evacuated. In particular, it is envisioned that the auxiliary electrically conductive material can be added prior to sintering. Alternatively or additionally, it is envisioned that the auxiliary electrically conductive material can be added after sintering. The reliable electrical path can be configured to reliably conduct one or both of DC current and RF current as described above. In one example, the particles <b>62</b> of the suspension <b>60</b> can have an average size within a range from approximately 1 microns to approximately 10 microns, such as from approximately 2 microns to approximately 10 microns.

Thus, it can be said that the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>have a first average particle size, the second particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>have a second average particle size, and the first average particle size is greater than the first average particle size. In one example, without being limited unless otherwise indicated, the first average particle size can range from approximately 1.5 to approximately 120 times the second average particle size. In one example, the first average particle size can range from approximately 5 to approximately 20 times the second average particle size.

The fill density can be defined as the density of the particles in the via <b>34</b>. Thus, it is envisioned that in some examples the vias <b>34</b> produced from a bimodal distribution can have a greater electrical conductivity than the vias <b>34</b> produced from a monomodal distribution.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>can include a plurality of first bimodal particles <b>74</b> and a plurality of second bimodal particles <b>76</b>. The first bimodal particles <b>74</b> can have a first bimodal average particle size as described above with respect to the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the monomodal distribution. Thus, the first bimodal particles <b>74</b> can define the interstices <b>66</b> described above. The second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can have a second bimodal average particle size that is less than the first bimodal average particle size of the first bimodal particles <b>74</b>. As shown, the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can be sized to fit in respective ones of the interstices <b>66</b> defined by the first bimodal particles <b>74</b>. In one example, the second average particle size of the bimodal particles <b>76</b> can range from approximately 0.3 micron to approximately 1 micron. For instance, the second average particle size can be approximately 0.6 micron.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some examples, it can be desirable to maximize the size of the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> so that they fit in respective ones of the interstices <b>66</b> without expanding the interstices <b>66</b>. It is appreciated, however, that the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can expand the interstices <b>66</b> while increasing the density of the first particles with respect to the monomodal distribution. Regardless, the first and second bimodal particles <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> can be said to combine so as to define second bimodal interstices <b>75</b> that are smaller than the interstices <b>66</b> that can be referred to as first bimodal interstices. Further, the second bimodal interstices <b>75</b> can be disposed inside the first bimodal interstices <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">While not being limiting unless otherwise indicated, the first bimodal particle size and the second bimodal average particle size can define a ratio within a range from approximately 4:1 to approximately 10:1. For instance, the ratio can be approximately 7:1. In other examples, the ratio can range from approximately 1.5:1 to approximately 12:1. For instance, the ratio can range from approximately 1.5:1 to approximately 3.5:1. It is envisioned that the size of the interstices <b>66</b> that contain the bimodal particles <b>74</b> remains sufficiently large such that the bimodal interstices <b>66</b> combine to define a liquid flow path to evacuate the liquid medium <b>64</b> from the holes <b>26</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, while sufficiently small such that the resulting via <b>34</b> contains a suitable volume of the electrically conductive material of the particles so as to define a reliable electrical path. It should be appreciated that the second particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>of the second suspension <b>60</b><i>b </i>can also define the bimodal distribution if desired. In particular, one or both of the first and second particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>can include the bimodal distribution. The second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can included in a quantity within a range from approximately five percent by volume of the hole to approximately 20 percent by volume of the hole. For instance, the quantity can be approximately ten percent by volume of the hole. It is understood that including the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can decrease the viscosity of the suspension during the filling step <b>46</b>, and can result in a higher green density of the fill.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">It is appreciated that the bimodal distribution can achieve higher packing densities than the single bulk fill prior to sintering. Thus, the resulting electrically conductive fill can be higher density. The second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can be a metal different than the metal of the first bimodal particles <b>74</b>. The second bimodal particles can be any suitable metal. In one example, the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can have a melting point less than that of the first bimodal particles. In one example, the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can comprise indium. In another example, the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can comprise tin. The bimodal particles <b>76</b> can form intermetallics or alloys with the first bimodal particles <b>74</b> for transient liquid phase sintering. Further, the transient liquid phase sintering can result in templated/shape-holder pore configurations left over from the second bimodal particles <b>76</b>. The resulting pore structure and associated porosity can be tunable in order to achieve desired RF and DC conductivity for the resulting via. In particular, the pore structure can be tunable based, at least in part, on the volume of the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> and the average particle size of the second bimodal particles <b>76</b>. Alternatively, if desired, one or both of the volume and average particle size of the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> can be controlled to eliminate a continuous porosity from the first end to the second end. Further, the transient liquid phase can result in less organic contamination, better via wall adhesion of the fill, and more controllable via geometries.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">It is further recognized that the alloy can be temperature stable during a future RDL step. In particular, the sintering step causes the second bimodal particles <b>76</b> to melt and liquify in the first bimodal particles <b>74</b>, which creates the alloy that has a melting point greater than the temperature at which the RDL layer is applied.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In one example, the hole can be overfilled with the bimodal particles <b>60</b><i>a </i>when the compacting step is performed.

Further, a redistribution layer can be applied with or without the plating.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">It is recognized that the bimodal particles <b>60</b><i>a </i>can be filled to a level outboard of the outer surface of the substrate. In particular, a sacrificial layer can be applied to the outer surface having an aperture that is in alignment with the hole of the plate. The sacrificial layer thus extends along a length that effectively increases the length of the hole. Thus, the hole of the substrate can be filled, and the aperture of the sacrificial layer can be at least partially or entirely filled. The sacrificial layer can be removed prior to or after compression of the fill. It is envisioned that the compressed fill can be substantially coplanar with outer surface of the substrate after the sintering step. Accordingly, a redistribution layer alone or in combination with plating can be applied to the sintered fill <b>35</b> without performing a final fill. Alternatively, a final fill can be performed if desired, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Alternatively, an electrically conductive layer can be applied to one or both outer surfaces of the substrate prior to filling the hole. The electrically conductive layer can further extend along the inner wall of the hole. For instance, the electrically conductive layer can extend along one or both outer regions of the inner wall. The electrically conductive layer can be titanium in one example.

The bulk fill can occupy a first portion of the hole <b>26</b> or via, and the final fill can occupy a second portion of the hole <b>26</b> or via that is different than the first portion.

In particular, the filter media <b>100</b> can rest on the support member <b>108</b>, and the substrate <b>20</b> can rest on the filter media <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Each of substrate <b>20</b>, the filter media <b>100</b>, and the support member <b>108</b> define an inner surface <b>97</b> that faces the vacuum chamber <b>90</b>, and an outer surface <b>99</b> that is opposite the inner surface <b>97</b>. The outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> can be defined by one of the first surface <b>22</b> and the second surface <b>24</b>. The inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> can be defined by the other of the first surface <b>22</b> and the second surface <b>24</b>. At least a portion of the inner surface of the support member <b>108</b> can be open to the vacuum chamber <b>90</b>. At least a portion of the inner surface of the filter member <b>100</b> can rest on at least a portion of the outer surface of the support member <b>108</b>. At least a portion of the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> can rest on at least a portion of the outer surface of the filter member <b>100</b>. The gasket <b>94</b> can rest on the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate at the exclusion zone <b>106</b>. Thus, each of the holes <b>26</b> that receives the suspension <b>60</b> can be aligned with each of the filter member <b>100</b> and the support member <b>108</b> with respect to the length of the holes <b>26</b>, which is coincident with the direction of through the holes <b>26</b> that defines the air pressure differential.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The support member <b>108</b> can be made from any suitable material that is porous with respect to both air and the filter media <b>100</b>. In particular, the support member <b>108</b> can have a porosity greater than that of the filter media <b>100</b>. Thus, both air and the filter media are able to pass through the support member <b>108</b>. In one nonlimiting example, the support member <b>108</b> can be defined by a fritted glass (also referred to as a glass frit). Thus, the support member <b>108</b> can be a rigid support member.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">During operation, a quantity of the suspension <b>60</b> is applied to the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, such that the suspension covers at least a portion of the outer surface <b>99</b>. For instance, the suspension <b>60</b> can be coated onto the outer surface <b>99</b>. During a bulk fill operation, the suspension <b>60</b> can be defined by the first suspension <b>60</b><i>a</i>. As will be appreciated from the description below, during a final fill operation, the suspension <b>60</b> can be defined by the second suspension <b>60</b><i>b</i>, though it should be appreciated that other sized particles may be sufficient for the final fill. For instance, the first suspension <b>60</b><i>a </i>can be used for the final fill.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In particular, the suspension <b>60</b> is applied to a fill zone of the substrate <b>20</b>. The fill zone of the substrate <b>20</b> can be defined by the holes <b>26</b> that are in alignment with the filter media and the support member <b>108</b>. Thus, the suspension <b>60</b> can cover the holes <b>26</b> that are to be filled. For instance, the suspension <b>60</b> can extend over and across the holes <b>26</b>. Alternatively or additionally, as described in more detail below, the suspension <b>60</b> can be induced to flow along the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> across the holes <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The filling step <b>46</b> can include the step of applying the suspension <b>60</b> to the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. The vacuum source can be activated so as to apply negative pressure to the vacuum chamber <b>90</b>. It should be appreciated that the vacuum source can be activated before the suspension <b>60</b> is applied to the substrate <b>20</b>, during application of the suspension <b>60</b> to the substrate <b>20</b>, or after the suspension <b>60</b> has been applied to the substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring to now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the negative pressure urges the suspension <b>60</b> to flow from the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> into the respective holes <b>26</b> that is open to the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate. As described above, the filter media <b>100</b> extends across the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> and across the holes <b>26</b>. Because the filter media <b>100</b> and the support member <b>108</b> are porous with respect to air, the negative pressure in the vacuum chamber <b>90</b> creates a pressure differential across the holes <b>26</b>, which can be configured as a negative pressure that draws a quantity of the suspension <b>60</b> into the holes <b>26</b>. Thus, both the liquid medium and the particles <b>62</b> suspended in the liquid medium <b>64</b> flow into the holes <b>26</b> under the pressure differential. Because the filter media <b>100</b> is porous with respect to the liquid medium <b>64</b> but nonporous with respect to the particles <b>62</b>, the pressure differential causes the liquid medium <b>64</b> to flow through the filter media <b>100</b>. Because the particles <b>62</b> are unable to flow through the filter media <b>100</b>, the particles <b>62</b> remain in the holes <b>26</b>. Thus, the particles <b>62</b> collect in the hole <b>26</b> as the liquid medium <b>64</b> flows through the holes <b>26</b>. Further, because the filter media <b>100</b> can be flat against the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, the particles <b>62</b> can accumulate against the filter media <b>100</b>, and can thus be substantially flush with the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. Further, when all filling steps have been completed, the particles can be substantially flush with the outer surface <b>99</b>. Alternatively, the particles <b>62</b> can be filled beyond the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. The particles <b>62</b> that are disposed beyond the outer surface <b>99</b> can be removed from the outer surface, for instance, by driving a wand across the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to remove the particles <b>62</b> that extend out from the outer surface <b>99</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">As described above, the holes <b>26</b> can be through holes, such that one or both of the negative pressure and the flow of liquid medium <b>64</b> from the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> causes the particles <b>62</b> to pack against each other, thereby defining one or more of the interstices of the type described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>, depending on the nature of the particle size distribution. In particular, a vacuum force applied against the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> can draw the suspension from the outer surface into the holes <b>26</b>. Alternatively, a positive air pressure applied to the outer surface <b>99</b> can cause the suspension to flow into the holes <b>26</b> toward the inner surface <b>97</b>. Air and the liquid medium of the suspension can evacuate from the through hole <b>26</b>. Alternatively, if the hole <b>26</b> is a blind hole of the type described above, a sacrificial hole can extend from the blind hole to an outer surface of the substrate <b>20</b> so as to create a through hole. Thus, the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be forced into the blind hole and the sacrificial hole under one or more up to all of forces of pressure differential, centrifugal forces, and electrostatic forces. In order to prevent the sacrificial hole from acting as an electrically conductive via, the sacrificial hole can be capped at a location adjacent the second surface <b>24</b> with an electrical insulative cap. Thus, the redistribution layer will not be in electrical communication with metal in the sacrificial hole. The electrically insulative cap can seal the sacrificial hole to provide hermeticity to the sacrificial hole as described herein. Alternatively or additionally, at least some up to all of the metal can be removed from the sacrificial hole. For instance, a laser can ablate the metal in the sacrificial hole without removing the metal from the blind hole. Alternatively or additionally, the sacrificial hole can be etched so as to remove the metal in the sacrificial hole without removing the metal from the blind hole. Alternatively or additionally still, the redistribution layer can avoid contact with the metal in the sacrificial hole, for instance at the second surface <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">It is recognized that the particles <b>62</b> in practice might not be as highly packed as the particles <b>62</b> schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>. Accordingly, the resulting interstices may be sized greater than those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-C</figref>, which allows the liquid medium <b>64</b> to flow through the particles <b>62</b> at greater flow rates. Further as described above, the interstices of the packed particles <b>62</b> can define a flow path that allows the liquid medium <b>64</b> to flow through the hole <b>26</b> and evacuate the hole through the filter media <b>100</b>. Thus, the liquid medium <b>64</b> that has entered the holes <b>26</b> is also removed from the holes <b>26</b>. As the suspension <b>60</b> continues to flow into the hole <b>26</b>, the particles <b>62</b> accumulate within the hole <b>26</b> until the filling step <b>46</b> is completed.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Further, because the support member <b>108</b> is porous with respect to the liquid medium <b>64</b>, the liquid medium <b>64</b> can be drawn under the vacuum pressure into the vacuum chamber <b>90</b>. The vacuum pressure can be any pressure below atmospheric, depending on the desired speed of the filling process. In one nonlimiting example, the negative pressure can range between any pressure below atmospheric up to approximately 120 KPa, such as approximately 80 KPa.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The frame <b>86</b> can define a drain <b>114</b> that extends through the frame body <b>87</b> and in fluid communication with the vacuum chamber <b>90</b>. Thus, the drain <b>114</b> can provide an outlet for the flow of the liquid medium <b>64</b> out the vacuum chamber <b>90</b> as expelled liquid medium <b>64</b>. The expelled liquid medium <b>64</b> can be discarded. Alternatively, the expelled liquid medium <b>64</b> can be reused. In one example, a quantity of particles <b>62</b> can be fed into a quantity of the expelled liquid medium <b>64</b> so as to produce suspension <b>60</b> for use in a subsequent fill operation of the substrate <b>20</b>, or for a fill operation of a different substrate <b>20</b>. In one example, the expelled liquid medium <b>64</b> can be circulated past a hopper of dry particles <b>62</b> as a stream. The hopper can release a quantity of dry particles <b>62</b> into the stream so as to produce the suspension <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">While it is appreciated that the filter media <b>100</b> can be nonporous with respect to the particles <b>62</b> as described above, it is recognized that the potential exists that the filter media <b>100</b> may be porous with respect to a quantity of the particles <b>62</b> less than an entirety of the particles <b>62</b> that enters the holes <b>26</b>. Whether the filter media <b>100</b> is nonporous with respect to all of the particles <b>62</b> or some of the particles <b>62</b>, the particles <b>62</b> that do not pass through the filter media <b>100</b> can accumulate in the holes <b>26</b> in the manner described above.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, is recognized that the pressure differential causes an aligned portion of the suspension <b>60</b> that is disposed on the outer surface <b>99</b> at a region of alignment <b>110</b>, whereby the suspension is aligned with a respective hole <b>26</b>. Thus, the suspension <b>60</b> in the region of alignment can be forced into the respective hole <b>26</b> under the pressure differential. Further, the pressure differential urges an offset portion of the suspension <b>60</b> that is disposed on the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> at a region of influence <b>112</b> to flow into the respective hole <b>26</b>. The region of influence <b>112</b> can have a shape of a circle on the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, or any suitable alternative shape as desired. The offset portion of the suspension disposed at the region of influence <b>112</b> is positioned laterally offset from the respective hole <b>26</b> along a lateral direction that is perpendicular to the length of the holes <b>26</b>. The region of influence is positioned at a location sufficiently close to the respective hole <b>26</b> so as to be drawn into the hole <b>26</b> under the force from the pressure differential. It has been found that the region of influence <b>112</b> is substantially spherical. However, it is envisioned that the region of influence <b>112</b> can be alternatively shaped depending on a number of factors including the dispersion gradient of the particles <b>62</b> in the liquid medium. It should be recognized that the suspension <b>60</b> disposed on the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> can be agitated during the filling step <b>46</b>, thereby maintaining the dispersion of the particles <b>62</b> in the liquid medium <b>64</b>. For instance, the substrate <b>20</b> can be vibrated, shook, or otherwise moved in such a manner so as to agitate the suspension <b>60</b> and cause the suspension to travel either to the respective hole <b>26</b>, or to the region of influence <b>112</b> so as to be forced into the respective hole <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Depending on the volume of suspension <b>60</b> applied to the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, the volume of the aligned portion of the suspension <b>60</b> and the offset portion of the suspension <b>60</b> may be sufficient to fill the hole <b>26</b>. Thus, in one example, the filling step <b>46</b> can be completed when a substantial entirety of the hole <b>26</b> is filled with particles <b>62</b>. Alternatively, it is recognized that the volume of the aligned portion of the suspension <b>60</b> and the offset portion of the suspension <b>60</b> may not be sufficient to fill the hole <b>26</b> in one fill operation in some examples. In this case, the vacuum pressure fails to draw additional quantities of suspension <b>60</b> into the hole <b>26</b>, leaving a volume of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> that is less than a volume of particles <b>62</b> sufficient to fill a substantial entirety of the hole <b>26</b> from the first end of the hole to the second end of the hole. It should therefore be appreciated that the step <b>46</b> of filling the hole <b>26</b> can include partially filling the hole <b>26</b> and filling a substantial entirety of the hole <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Once the liquid medium <b>64</b> has been drawn into the hole <b>26</b> from the regions of alignment <b>110</b> and influence <b>112</b> under the vacuum pressure, and no other liquid medium <b>64</b> is available to be drawn into the hole <b>26</b> under the pressure differential, continued application of the pressure differential to the hole <b>26</b> draws air through the hole <b>26</b>. The drawn air forces the liquid medium <b>64</b> in the holes to evacuate the hole <b>26</b> through the flow path defined by the interstices. Because the electrically conductive material is at least substantially nonporous, the liquid medium <b>64</b> does not enter the electrically conductive material. Rather, the liquid medium <b>64</b> evacuates the hole <b>26</b> under the pressure differential. Thus, the pressure differential applied during the filling step causes the packed particles <b>62</b> in the hole to be at least substantially dry or entirely dry with respect to the liquid medium <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">It is appreciated that once the liquid medium has vacated the hole <b>26</b>, the resulting packed electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be in contact with each other so as to define a first or initially packed powder <b>63</b> of a first fill <b>65</b>. The first or initially packed powder <b>63</b> can be configured as a bulk fill as described herein. It should be recognized that when the liquid medium <b>64</b> has evacuated the hole, the surface charge of the particles <b>62</b> is no longer neutralized by the liquid medium <b>64</b>. Accordingly, the particles <b>62</b> can agglomerate to each other, so that the particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> defines a volume of packed particles.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In one example, the filling step <b>46</b> can include the step of causing additional suspension <b>60</b> to be brought into one or both of the region of alignment <b>110</b> and the region of influence <b>112</b>.

Alternatively, the additional suspension <b>60</b> can increase the volume of the particles <b>62</b> in the hole to a volume less than the volume of particles <b>62</b> sufficient to substantially fill the hole, but greater than the volume of particles <b>62</b> that become packed in the hole <b>26</b> without the causing step.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">For instance, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>, the causing step can include the step of rocking the substrate <b>20</b> so as to angulate the substrate <b>20</b> back and forth in one or more planes of angulation. In particular, the causing step can include the step of rocking the fluid pressure fill apparatus <b>82</b> including the substrate <b>20</b> back and forth. The rocking step can cause the suspension <b>60</b> on the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to flow across the outer surface <b>99</b>. Thus, quantities of the suspension can flow into one or both of the region of alignment <b>110</b> and the region of influence <b>112</b> of the hole <b>26</b>. As the substrate <b>20</b> is continuously rocked, additional quantities of the suspension <b>60</b> can replace quantities of suspension that have flowed into the hole <b>26</b> from one or both of the region of alignment <b>110</b> and the region of influence <b>112</b>. A rocker member <b>209</b> can be actuated to apply the rocking step. It is recognized that the substrate <b>20</b> can be rocked manually by manually actuating the rocker member. Alternatively, the vacuum fill apparatus <b>84</b> can define a rocking platform that supports the substrate <b>20</b> directly or indirectly, and is configured to rock the substrate <b>20</b> automatically. It is appreciated that the fluid pressure fill apparatus <b>82</b> can include a dam <b>116</b> that captures the suspension <b>60</b> and prevents the suspension <b>60</b> from flowing off of the substrate <b>20</b> as the substrate <b>20</b> is rocked. The dam <b>116</b> can be defined by the at least one gasket <b>94</b> in one example.

The dam <b>116</b> can extend up with respect to the substrate <b>20</b> at a sufficient height so as to prevent the suspension from spilling off the dam <b>116</b> during the step of rocking the substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Alternatively, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>, the causing step can include the step of causing the suspension to cross-flow fill into the holes <b>26</b>. In particular, the suspension <b>60</b> can be applied to the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> at a location laterally spaced from the holes <b>26</b>. The substrate <b>20</b> can then be tilted, which causes the suspension <b>60</b> to flow across the outer surface <b>99</b> and sequentially over the holes <b>26</b>. As the suspension <b>60</b> flows over a first hole <b>26</b>, a volume of the suspension <b>60</b> can flow into the first hole <b>26</b>. The suspension <b>60</b> then flows over a second hole <b>26</b> adjacent the first hole <b>26</b> so as to cause a volume of the suspension <b>60</b> to flow into the second hole <b>26</b>. Accordingly, the tilting of the substrate <b>20</b> can cause the suspension to sequentially flow over the holes <b>26</b>. The suspension can flow into the holes <b>26</b> under gravitational forces. In this regard, the suspension can flow into the holes <b>26</b> under gravitational forces as the substrate <b>20</b> is rocked as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>.

In one example, the isostatic pressure can be in the range of approximately 25,000 PSI to approximately 40,000 PSI.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">The pressure of the isostatic press applied to the envelope <b>118</b> can drive the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>to enter opposite ends of the holes <b>26</b> under the isostatic pressure, thereby further compacting the particles <b>62</b> of the initially packed powder <b>63</b> achieved during the filling step <b>46</b> to a highly packed powder <b>77</b> whose particles <b>62</b> that are more tightly packed than the packed particles <b>62</b>. Thus, it can be said that the pressure densifies the particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b>. In particular, the isostatic pressure drives the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>to densify the packed powder <b>63</b>. It should be appreciated that when the initially packed powder is further packed into highly packed powder, the distance along the length of the hole <b>26</b> that is occupied by the particles of the highly packed powder decreases with respect to the distance that is occupied by the particles of the initially packed powder. That is, the particles <b>62</b> can compress longitudinally in the hole <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The isostatic pressure can be applied at room temperature. In this regard, the isostatic press can be referred to as a cold isostatic press (CIP). Alternatively, the isostatic press can be configured as a warm isostatic press (WIP) that can configured to apply the isostatic press at a temperature that can be in a range from approximately 120 C to approximately 250 C for a time period sufficient to cause the particles <b>62</b> to deform and further densify. That is, the substrate <b>20</b> and the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> can be heated during the compaction step. The compaction step under WIP can displace the anti-agglomerating agent described above so as to promote metal-on-metal contact between the adjacent particles <b>62</b>, both of the bulk fill when the bulk fill is compacted, and of the final fill when the final fill is compacted.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can cause the outer ends of the initially packed powder <b>63</b> to densify more than the intermediate portion of the initially packed powder <b>63</b> that extends between the outer ends. Further, referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can drive the initially packed powder <b>63</b> of the first filling step <b>46</b> to move in the hole <b>26</b> toward the center of the hole <b>26</b>. Thus, initially packed powder <b>63</b> can be driven to substantially the center of the hole <b>26</b> with respect to the overall length of the hole <b>26</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. Subsequent pressing steps of subsequent fills can drive the resulting subsequent packed powder <b>79</b> against the powder that was drawn into the hole <b>26</b> during a previous filling step <b>46</b>, also referred to as prior powder. The prior powder can be defined by one or both of the first filling step <b>46</b> and, if desired, a first compacting step <b>50</b>. Alternatively, the prior powder can be defined by one or both of a subsequent filling step <b>46</b> and, if desired, a subsequent compacting step <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In one example, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can apply substantially equal amounts of pressure to each end of the holes <b>26</b> as they extend into opposed ends of the hole <b>26</b>. Accordingly, the initially packed powder <b>63</b> that is disposed off-center with respect to the length of the hole <b>26</b> can be contacted by the respective one of the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>, driven toward the center of the hole <b>26</b>, and pressed between the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>. Subsequent initially packed powders are pressed against previously pressed highly packed powders. Thus, one of the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>contacts the outer end of a previously pressed highly packed powder, and the other of the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>contacts the outer end of the subsequent initially packed powder, thereby highly compacting the subsequent initially packed powder into highly packed powder. As the initially packed powders are packed longitudinally by the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>, it should be appreciated that the initially packed powders can expand radially as they are packed into highly packed powders, thereby compressing the respective particles <b>62</b> against the inner wall of the substrate <b>20</b> that defines the hole <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be made of any suitable material as desired. In one example, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be made of a viscoelastic material and thus configured to enter the holes <b>26</b> so as to compress the particles <b>62</b> disposed therein. For instance, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can distribute the isostatic pressure uniformly across the substrate, such that the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>conform to the outer surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> and extend into the holes <b>26</b>. Thus, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can mechanically pack the initially packed powder <b>63</b> into a highly packed powder. It is therefore desirable that the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>are made from a material that does not adhere to the particles <b>62</b>, such that when the isostatic pressure is removed, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be removed from the holes <b>26</b> without pulling the particles <b>62</b> out of the holes <b>26</b>. In one example, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be made of Mylar. In another example, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be made of Teflon. The outer layers sheets <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>can be made of any suitable nonporous material. For instance, the outer sheets <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>can be made of a flexible metal such as aluminum.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In one example, the outer sheets <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>can include a fusion material <b>121</b> such as mylar coated to their respective inner surfaces if desired. The fusion material <b>121</b> can fuse to itself to create the vacuum enclosure <b>126</b>. The inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can be separate from the outer sheets <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>, and placed between the outer sheets and the substrate <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>can line the outer sheets <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>as desired.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">It should therefore be appreciated that the vacuum in the enclosure <b>126</b> is sufficient so as to cause the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>to lay flat against the inner and outer surfaces <b>97</b> and <b>99</b> alone or in combination with the overfill. Accordingly, it will be recognized that any suitable apparatus that causes the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>to lay flat against the inner and outer surfaces <b>97</b> and <b>99</b>, alone or in combination with the overfill, prior to applying the isostatic pressure to the inner layers <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>either directly, or indirectly through the outer layers, uniformly as described herein is contemplated. The inner layers can therefore be referred to as compaction members that are configured to be driven into the holes <b>26</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> so as to highly pack the initially packed powder <b>63</b> into highly packed powders disposed therein.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>B</figref>, the step of increasing the packing density <b>50</b> is completed once the isostatic pressure has been removed from the compaction members. Once the step of increasing the packing density has been completed, a first filling and compacting sequence <b>55</b> has likewise been completed. It is appreciated, however, that in certain examples, the step <b>50</b> can be omitted. Instead, a step of pressing the substrate <b>20</b> to pack the particles <b>62</b> can be performed at step <b>53</b> as described in more detail below. Still in other examples, both steps <b>50</b> and <b>53</b> can be performed during the method <b>40</b>. Further, it should be appreciated that the step of isostatically pressing the particles <b>62</b> can be performed at a plurality of instances between a plurality of sequential iterations, respectively, of filling the holes at step <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B-<b>7</b>C</figref>, it is recognized that the particles <b>62</b> after the first fill step <b>46</b>, and optionally after the first compacting step <b>50</b>, can define a bulk fill that extends along only a portion of the hole <b>26</b> in some examples. In other examples, the bulk fill can extend along a substantial entirety of the hole <b>26</b>. When the bulk fill extends along only a portion of the hole, the particles <b>62</b> can occupy a length of the hole <b>26</b> that is less than an entirety of the length of the hole <b>26</b>, thereby defining longitudinal distances that are measured from the bulk fill to each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. If each of the distances is greater than a predetermined distance, then a subsequent sequence <b>55</b> is performed to fill the hole <b>26</b> with additional bulk fill until the distances reach the predetermined distance. If each of the distances is less than or equal to the predetermined distance, a final fill can be introduced into the hole <b>26</b> from the bulk fill to the first and second ends, respectively, of the hole <b>26</b>. The distances can be determined after a filling step <b>46</b> is performed. Alternatively, the distances can be determined after a compacting step <b>50</b> is performed that compacts the final fill, and further compacts the final fill against the bulk fill which may have been compacted during a previous compacting step.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Alternatively still, it is recognized that the particles <b>62</b> of the bulk fill can extend from the first end of the hole <b>26</b> to the second end of the hole after the first compacting step <b>50</b> in some examples. Accordingly, the bulk fill can extend substantially from the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> substantially to the second surface <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. For instance, the bulk fill can extend from the holes <b>26</b> beyond one or both of the first surface <b>22</b> and the second surface <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. Thus, a single filling step <b>46</b> can fill the holes <b>26</b> such that the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> extend continuously through the holes and can extend from the hole beyond each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.

The final fill is intended to occupy a portion of the hole <b>26</b> that extends from the bulk fill to the first and second terminal ends of the hole <b>26</b>. When the hole <b>26</b> is a through hole, the final fill is intended to extend from the bulk fill to each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. The particles <b>62</b> of the bulk fill can be defined by the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>that are configured and intended to extend along a majority of the length of the hole <b>26</b>. The particles <b>62</b> of the final fill can be defined by the second particles <b>62</b><i>b</i>, though it is appreciated that other sized particles are contemplated for the final fill.

It is recognized in certain examples that the interstices of the first fill <b>65</b> can be sized smaller than the first particles <b>62</b><i>a</i>.

Alternatively, if the first final fill is not packed at the compacting step <b>50</b>, the compacting step <b>50</b> can be performed after the second or opposite final filling step <b>46</b> so as to produce highly packed powder from the finally packed powder of both the first and second final filling steps <b>46</b>. The opposite packed powder <b>77</b> of the final fill can likewise be overfilled in the hole <b>26</b> after the final filling step <b>46</b>, and further after the compaction step as desired.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">It is recognized that the packed bulk fill <b>130</b> and the packed final fill <b>134</b>, whether packed at step <b>50</b> or not, can combine so as to define the fill <b>35</b> of the via <b>34</b>. Thus, the fill <b>35</b> can be said to be defined by the electrically conductive material.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Once the final compacting step has been performed, excess particles can be removed from the substrate <b>20</b>. In this regard, it can be said that a first final fill extends from the bulk fill to the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, and can be overfilled such that an excess first final fill extends out beyond the first surface <b>22</b>. Alternatively or additionally second final fill extends from the bulk fill to the second surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, and can be overfilled such that an excess second final fill extends beyond the second surface <b>24</b>. Thus, one or both of the excess first final fill and an excess of the second final fill can be removed after the final compaction step and before sintering the particles, so as to substantially planarize the first and second final fills. For instance, a wand can be driven across the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to remove the excess first final fill, and across the second surface <b>24</b> of the substrate to remove the excess second final fill. The wand can have a hardness greater than the final fill, and less than the substrate <b>20</b>. In one example, the wand can be a rubber wand. In another example, the wand can be a Teflon wand. Next, the particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> can be substantially non-densification sintered to produce an electrically conductive via <b>34</b>, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">It is recognized that the density of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> of the highly packed powder <b>77</b>, if applicable, of the first fill <b>65</b> is greater than the density of particles <b>62</b> in the hole of the initially packed powder <b>63</b> of the first fill <b>65</b>.

As discussed above, when the liquid medium <b>64</b> has evacuated the hole, the remaining particles <b>62</b> can be referred to as a dry packed powder.

Further, the particles <b>62</b> can be devoid of areas of highly packed powder <b>77</b> in the holes <b>26</b> after completion of the one or more filling steps, and when the sintering step <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) is to be performed.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, while the filling step <b>46</b> has been described as inducing air pressure to drive the suspension <b>60</b> into the holes in examples described above, it is recognized that the filling step <b>46</b> can be performed in accordance with a number of other examples. For instance, a centrifuge <b>150</b> can provide the force that drives or draws the suspension <b>60</b> into the holes <b>26</b>. In one example, the holes <b>26</b> can be through holes of the type described above. Thus, the force that urges the particles <b>62</b> to flow into the holes <b>26</b> can be a centrifugal force. The centrifuge <b>150</b> can include a rotatable hub <b>152</b>, at least one bucket <b>156</b> such as a plurality of buckets <b>156</b>, and arms <b>154</b> that extend between the hub <b>152</b> and the buckets <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, the substrate <b>20</b> can be placed in the bucket <b>156</b>, such that the substrate <b>20</b> is supported by a distal wall <b>158</b> of the bucket <b>156</b>. Thus, the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> faces the distal wall <b>158</b> of the bucket <b>156</b>, and the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> faces away from the distal wall <b>158</b>. The inner surface <b>97</b> can be defined by one of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The outer surface <b>99</b> can be defined by the other of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The inner surface <b>97</b> can be placed against a corresponding support surface <b>157</b> of the distal wall <b>158</b> inside the bucket <b>156</b>. The support surface <b>157</b> of the bucket <b>156</b> can be planar and made of a suitable material that will allow the substrate <b>20</b> to be subsequently removed from the inner surface <b>157</b> without causing pull out of the particles disposed in the holes. Alternatively, an auxiliary support member <b>160</b> can be placed in the bucket <b>156</b> between the substrate <b>20</b> and the inner surface <b>157</b>. The support member <b>160</b> can define a support surface, such that the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> is placed against the support surface. The support member <b>160</b> can be made of any suitable material, such as glass which can be coated to prevent the support member <b>160</b> from adhering to the particles of the substrate <b>20</b> as desired. The inner surface <b>157</b> or the support member <b>160</b> can seal the inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> in order to prevent evacuation of the particles <b>62</b> out of the holes <b>26</b> at the interface between inner surface <b>97</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> and the support surface. In some examples, it is recognized that the hole can be a blind hole as opposed to a through-hole. Thus, the centrifuge <b>150</b> can cause particles to flow into the blind hole through the open end of the blind hole so as to fill the blind hole in the manner described herein with respect to the through-hole.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, the suspension <b>60</b> can then be applied to the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> in the bucket <b>156</b> such that the suspension covers at least a portion of the outer surface <b>99</b>.

Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C</figref>, the buckets <b>156</b> can be pivotally attached to the arms <b>154</b>.

The centrifuge <b>150</b> can cause the buckets <b>156</b> to revolve about the hub <b>152</b> at any suitable speed as desired. For instance, the centrifuge <b>150</b> can rotate at a speed that applies any suitable G-force as desired to drive the particles <b>62</b> into the holes <b>26</b>. For instance, the g-force can be between approximately 100 and approximately 15,000 Gs. In one example, the g-force can be approximately 6,000 Gs.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>D</figref>, it is recognized that the specific gravity of the particles <b>62</b> is significantly higher than that if the liquid medium <b>64</b>. As a result, the centrifugal forces applied to the suspension <b>60</b> causes the particles <b>62</b> to displace the liquid medium <b>64</b> from the holes <b>26</b> and flow into the holes <b>26</b>. The particles <b>62</b> in the holes <b>26</b> pack against each other under the centrifugal forces, thereby creating a packed powder <b>162</b>. However, because the liquid medium <b>64</b> remains in the interstices between the particles of the packed powder <b>162</b>, the packed powder <b>162</b> can be referred to as a wet packed powder. After the centrifuge operation is completed a volume of residual liquid medium <b>64</b> can remain on the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.

However, the concentration of particles <b>62</b> in the residual liquid medium <b>64</b> outside the substrate <b>20</b> after the fill operating is less than the particle concentration of the suspension <b>60</b> prior to operating the centrifuge <b>150</b>. Alternatively, the particle content of the suspension <b>60</b> can be calculated to fill the holes <b>26</b> during the centrifuge operation such that substantially no particles <b>62</b> remain in the residual liquid medium <b>64</b>. Once the holes <b>26</b> have been filled with the packed powder <b>162</b>, the centrifuge operation is discontinued, and the residual liquid medium can be desiccated off the substrate <b>20</b> or otherwise removed from the substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The liquid medium <b>64</b> disposed in the holes <b>26</b> can then be removed. For instance, the substrate <b>20</b> can then be placed in any suitably warm environment to cause the liquid medium to evaporate. Alternatively or additionally, air can be forced through the holes <b>26</b> so as to remove the liquid medium from the holes <b>26</b>. It should be appreciated that in one example, when the filling process is performed with the centrifuge <b>150</b>, the filling process <b>46</b> can be brushless. That is, the method <b>40</b> can omit any step of brushing or otherwise bringing any structure along the outer surface of the substrate <b>20</b> so as to forcibly removing excess electrically conductive material from the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> after the filling step <b>46</b>.

For instance, any suitable wand <b>103</b> can be driven across the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to remove the residual liquid <b>64</b> containing particles <b>62</b>. The wand <b>103</b> can be made of any material as desired that will not pull the electrically conductive particles out of the holes <b>26</b>.

In one example, the compacting step <b>50</b> can be performed after removing the residual liquid medium <b>64</b> and particles <b>62</b> from the outer surface <b>99</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. In particular, the substrate <b>20</b> can be placed inside the envelope <b>118</b>, and the air can be removed from the envelope <b>118</b> in the manner described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>, and the substrate <b>20</b> can be pressed in the press <b>128</b> as described above with respect to FIG. <b>8</b>C.

In one example, the bulk fill of particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>can extend along an entirety of the length of the hole <b>26</b>. Alternatively, a first filling step <b>46</b> under centrifugal forces can introduce a plurality of second particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>into the hole <b>26</b> so as to define a final fill that enters the hole <b>26</b> from the outer surface <b>99</b>. Thus, the step introduces a first final fill into the hole <b>26</b>. The centrifugal forces cause the particles to flow to the inner surface <b>97</b>, and accumulate in the hole <b>26</b> toward the outer surface <b>99</b>. Thus, a first final fill extends to the inner surface <b>97</b>, which can be defined by the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. Next, a second filling step <b>46</b> under centrifugal forces can introduce a plurality of first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>into the hole <b>26</b> from the outer surface so as to define a bulk fill that extends from the first final fill toward the second surface <b>24</b>.

A gap can be defined in the hole from the bulk fill to the outer surface <b>99</b>, which can be defined by the second surface <b>24</b>, of the substrate <b>20</b>. Thus after the second filling step, a third filling step under centrifugal forces can introduce a plurality of second particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>into the hole as a second final fill. Thus, the step introduces a second final fill into the hole <b>26</b>. The second final fill can extend from the bulk fill to the second surface <b>24</b>. It is appreciated that the compacting step <b>50</b> can be applied to the particles in the hole <b>26</b> after the first filling step and prior to the second filling step. Alternatively or additionally, the compacting step <b>50</b> can be applied to the particles in the hole after the second filling step and prior to the third filling step. Alternatively, a single filling step can be performed that substantially fills the hole with second particles <b>62</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some examples, a first filling step can include the step of introducing the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the bulk fill into the hole using a gaseous pressure differential of the type described above.

For instance, a first final filling step under centrifugal forces can force the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>into the hole such that they extend from the bulk fill substantially to the first surface of the substrate. A second final filling step under centrifugal forces can force the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>hole such that they extend from the bulk fill substantially to the second surface of the substrate. This may be desirable when, for instance, the bulk fill in the hole has been rendered substantially non-porous and thus not suitable for gas pressure differential filling.

The precoated suspension <b>60</b> can include the second particles <b>62</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the first final fill including the second particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>can be overfilled in the hole <b>26</b>, and thus can extend out with respect to the inner surface <b>97</b>, or first surface <b>22</b>. Alternatively still, a stand-off member can be disposed between the support member <b>160</b> and the inner surface <b>97</b> prior to performing the step of filling <b>46</b> under centrifugal forces.

The filling step <b>46</b> under centrifugal forces can then be repeated as a subsequent filling step under centrifugal forces. Thus, where the centrifugal forces <b>150</b> urged particles into the holes <b>26</b> substantially from the first surface <b>22</b> in the first filing step, the centrifugal forces can now urge particles into the holes <b>26</b> substantially from the second surface <b>24</b> during the subsequent filling step under centrifugal forces.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">After the one or more filling steps <b>46</b> under centrifugal forces have been completed, the particles <b>62</b> can subsequently be compacted inside the holes <b>26</b> and against one or both of the first surface <b>22</b> and the second surface <b>24</b> during the pressing step <b>53</b> described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">If the compacting step <b>50</b> is performed, the resulting highly packed powder can occupy a length of the hole <b>26</b> that is less than an entirety of the length of the hole, thereby defining longitudinal distances that are measured from the bulk fill to each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>26</b>, as described above.

Further, it is recognized that one or more bulk fill operations can be performed. In some examples, a final fill operation can be performed after the one or more bulk fill operations. The particles during the final fill operation can have an average size that is smaller than the average size of the particles during the bulk fill operation. In one example, the filling step can include filling the hole at a first side of the substrate <b>20</b> that defines the first surface <b>22</b>, flipping the substrate, and filling the hole at an opposed second side of the substrate the that defines the second surface <b>24</b>. Alternatively, it is recognized that a first step of filling the substrate can include introducing the final fill into the hole at the first side of the substrate in accordance with any of the filling steps described herein such that the final fill accumulates at the second side of the substrate.

Alternatively or additionally, a first final fill can extend from the hole onto the second surface in the manner described above, so as to define a button after the hard pressing step.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, once the filling step or steps <b>46</b> have been completed so as to fill the holes <b>26</b>, alone or in combination with one or more compacting steps <b>50</b>, the particles <b>62</b> can be sintered at sintering step <b>52</b>. It is appreciated that the particles <b>62</b> can be dry prior to the sintering step <b>52</b>. In particular, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the substrate <b>20</b> can be placed in an oven <b>164</b> for a length of time at any suitable pressure at a temperature sufficient to sinter the particles <b>62</b>. For instance, the pressure in the oven <b>164</b> can be at atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, the oven <b>164</b> can define a vacuum. The oven can further include any suitable gaseous environment as desired. In one example, the sintering process is substantially a non-densification sintering process. It is recognized that densification during sintering can cause portions of adjacent ones of the particles <b>62</b> to flow toward each other, thereby shrinking the resulting electrically conductive fill <b>35</b>.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref>, it is recognized that deformation of the particles <b>62</b> can take place during the substantially non-densifying sintering step <b>52</b>. However, the deformation is relatively minimal compared to densification sintering. For instance, the substantial non-densification is illustrated whereby in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, a plurality of adjacent particles <b>62</b> are in contact with each other and define respective geometric centers <b>159</b> that are spaced from each other a first distance D<b>1</b>.

The difference between the second distance D<b>2</b> and the first distance D<b>1</b> is no more than approximately 30% of the first distance in one example. For instance, the difference is no more than approximately 20% of the first distance. For example, the difference is no more than approximately 15% of the first distance. In another example, the difference is no more than approximately 10% of the first distance. For instance, in one specific example, the difference is no more than approximately 5% of the first distance. In one particular example, the first distance D<b>1</b> can be substantially equal to the second distance D<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">It is recognized that sintering includes an initial stage whereby a neck <b>145</b> is formed that extends between adjacent sintered particles, so as to define grain boundaries <b>149</b> at respective interfaces between adjacent sintered particles <b>62</b>. It should be appreciated that the particles <b>62</b> can define what is referred to as a &#x201c;bulk nanostructured&#x201d; powder. Each of the particles <b>62</b> can include a packed array of nanograins. In one example, each particle <b>62</b> can include at least a thousand up to over a million nanograins. It is, however, contemplated, that the particles <b>62</b> can each include less than one-thousand nanograins, for instance when the average size of the particles is 0.22 &#x3bc;m. During the initial stage of sintering, the nanograins that make up the particles <b>62</b> can expand or grow. As this occurs, pores internal to the particles <b>62</b> can be moved to the outer surface of the particle <b>62</b> and removed. In a second or intermediate stage of sintering, interstices <b>66</b> between the adjacent particles <b>62</b> can shrink during densification of the particles <b>62</b>. However, the densification of the particles <b>62</b> can be tuned by determining the average grain size in the originally synthesized particles <b>62</b> of the suspension <b>60</b> described above. The densification of the particles <b>62</b> can further be tuned by determining the modal distribution of particles <b>62</b>. For instance, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>, the particles <b>62</b> can define a monomodal distribution, a bimodal distribution, or a trimodal distribution for example. It is appreciated that the modal distribution of the particles <b>62</b> does not affect the grain growth behavior of the nanograins in each of the particles <b>62</b>. Rather, the multimodal distribution can affect the densification behavior of particle to particle interaction, such as necking, during sintering.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">It has been found that smaller sized nanograins produce greater nanograin growth during the first phase of densification. Greater nanogram growth in the first stage of densification has been found to result in less densification of the particles <b>62</b> during the second or intermediate stage of densification. Further, greater initial density of the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> prior to sintering can also produce less densification of the particles <b>62</b> during the second or intermediate stage of densification. It is recognized that trimodal distributions have a greater initial density than bimodal distributions. Further, bimodal distributions have a greater initial density than a monomodal distributions. Thus, a trimodal distribution of the particles has greater initial density than a monomodal distribution.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Accordingly, to decrease densification during the second or intermediate stage of sintering, it can be desirable to decrease the sizes of the nanograins that form the particles <b>62</b>. Further, to decrease densification during the second or intermediate stage of sintering, it can be desirable to provide the particles in a bimodal or trimodal distribution. It is recognized, however, that the particles can be substantially non-densification sintered in a monomodal distribution.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that decreasing the nanograin size alone or in combination with providing bimodal or trimodal particle distributions can decrease a transition point of total achievable densification between the intermediate stage of sintering and the final stage of sintering. Otherwise stated, the ability of the particles <b>62</b> to densify during the intermediate stage of sintering can be reduced such that the resulting sintered particles <b>62</b> are substantially non-densified. During the final stage of sintering, nanograins can further grow in addition to the growth achieved during the initial sintering phase, which can be a precursor to closure of pores within the particles <b>62</b>. The end result after sintering is completed is a contiguous metal networked fill within the via that can extend substantially from the first surface <b>22</b> substantially to the second surface <b>24</b> without changing the coplanarity of the metallized via and the surrounding substrate <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Further, the contiguous metal networked fill can contact the substrate <b>20</b> at one or more up to all locations of in the via, at the first surface, and at the second surface <b>24</b>.

The method can further include the step <b>52</b> of sintering the particles in the hole at a temperature range for a time duration. The method can further include the step of determining at least one of an average grain size and a modal distribution prior to the filling, step so as to, in turn, determine an amount of densification during the sintering step. As described above, the filling step can include filling the hole with a suspension of the particles in a liquid medium, and evacuating the liquid medium from the hole prior to the sintering step <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">As described above, a majority of the total volume of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> can be substantially non-densification sintered as described above.

In another example, at least approximately 70% of the total volume of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> is substantially non-densification sintered. In still another example, at least approximately 80% of the total volume of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> is substantially non-densification sintered. In yet another example, at least approximately 90% of the total volume of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> is substantially non-densification sintered. For instance, in one particular example, at least approximately 95% of the total volume of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> is substantially non-densification sintered. Particular. More particularly, in one example, approximately 100% of the total volume of particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> is substantially non-densification sintered. It should be appreciated that at least a portion of the fill defined by the non-densification sintered particles <b>62</b> in the hole <b>26</b> can contact the internal surface of the substrate <b>20</b> that extends from the first surface <b>22</b> to the second surface <b>24</b> and at least partially defines the hole.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">The sintering step <b>52</b> can occur at a sintering temperature within a temperature range from approximately 100 degrees Celsius to approximately 400 degrees Celsius.

For instance, the temperature range can be from approximately 300 degrees Celsius to approximately 400.

For instance, the duration can be in a duration range from approximately 15 minutes to approximately 4 hours. In one example, the duration range can be from approximately 30 minutes to approximately 2 hours. For instance, the duration can be approximately 1 hour.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">Advantageously, as discussed above, the particles <b>62</b> can be ductile and malleable. As a result, the particles <b>62</b> can have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that tis mismatched with respect to that of the substrate <b>20</b> without damaging the substrate <b>20</b> during sintering. In particular, the malleability of the silver particles <b>62</b>, for instance, allows for non-densification sintering while maintaining the structural integrity of the substrate. Thus, it is appreciated that no materials are added to either of the suspensions <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>that are intended to bring the coefficient of thermal expansion of the resulting particles <b>62</b> closer to that of the substrate <b>20</b>. Accordingly, the sintered particles <b>62</b> is devoid of residual material that is the product of a burned CTE matching agent.

In particular, the electrically conductive fill, such as the final fill, can be bonded to the second layer <b>214</b>. In one example, the final fill can be sinter bonded to the second layer <b>214</b> during sintering of the particles in the hole <b>26</b>. The final fill can be a monomodal fill or a multimodal fill as desired. In one example, the final fill can be a bimodal or trimodal fill. In this regard, it should be appreciated that the coating <b>210</b> defines an interface between the final fill and the internal surface <b>29</b> of the substrate <b>26</b>. The interface can present a barrier to gas with respect to penetration into the via <b>34</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the interface can present a barrier to liquid with respect to penetration into the via <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">It should be appreciated that the electrically conductive coating <b>210</b> can be applied to the substrate <b>20</b> prior to performing the step of filling the second electrically conductive particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>that defines the final fill into the hole <b>26</b>. For instance, the electrically conductive coating <b>210</b> can be applied to the substrate <b>20</b> prior to performing the step of filling the first electrically conductive particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>that defines the bulk fill into the hole <b>26</b>. Thus, the electrically conductive coating <b>210</b> can be applied to the internal surface <b>39</b> prior to filling any of the electrically conductive particles <b>39</b> into the hole <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">Alternatively, the method can include the step of performing a first filling operation step that forces a plurality of the first electrically conductive particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>into the hole <b>26</b>.

Once an entirety of the first electrically conductive particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>have been forced into the hole using one or more first filling steps, and the particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>have been packed as desired, the coating <b>210</b> can be applied to the substrate <b>26</b> in the manner described above. Thus, the step of applying the coating can be after a first filling step, including a plurality of first filling steps. Therefore, the coating <b>210</b> can thus be further applied to at least one of the opposed outer ends of the bulk fill. For instance, the first portion <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the coating can be applied to a first outer end of the bulk fill. The second portion <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the coating can be applied to a second outer end of the bulk fill that is opposite the first outer end along the same direction that separates the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.

The final filling operations can be performed under vacuum as described above, under centrifugal forces described above, under electrostatic forces as described above, or using any suitable alternative method as desired. Once the coating has been applied to the internal surface <b>29</b> and the first and second particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>have been filled into the hole <b>26</b>, the particles can be non-densification sintered in the manner described above.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">It is appreciated that the coating <b>210</b> can be vapor deposited to the internal surface <b>29</b> in a vapor deposition chamber. Further, the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b>, including the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>and the second particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>can be non-densification sintered in the same common vapor deposition chamber. Thus, heat can be applied to the vapor deposition chamber that increases the temperature in the chamber to a sintering temperature sufficient to cause the first and second electrically conductive particles to sinter. The sintering temperature can range from approximately 100 degrees Celsius to approximately 400 degrees Celsius. For example, the sintering temperature can range from approximately 300 degrees Celsius to approximately 400 degrees Celsius. In particular, the sintering temperature can range from approximately 300 degrees Celsius to approximately 350 degrees Celsius. In one specific example, the sintering temperature can be approximately 325 degrees Celsius. Heat can be applied to the vapor deposition chamber in any suitable manner as desired.

Alternatively, after the sintering has been completed in the vapor deposition chamber, the temperature in the vapor deposition chamber can be reduced, and the coating <b>210</b> can be vapor deposited to the internal wall. In particular, the first layer <b>212</b> can be vapor deposited onto the internal surface <b>29</b>, and the second layer <b>214</b> can be vapor deposited onto the first layer <b>212</b>. The elevated temperature inside the vapor deposition chamber during the vapor deposition can be sufficient to sinter bond the particles <b>62</b> to the coating <b>210</b>.

For instance, the temperature at the internal surface <b>29</b> can be maintained at a temperature within a range from approximately 0 degrees Celsius to approximately 80 degrees Celsius during the vapor deposition. The vapor deposition chamber can be cooled using any suitable apparatus and method as desired. For instance, helium backside cooling can be applied to the vapor deposition chamber. Alternatively or additionally, a water jack can reduce the temperature of the vapor deposition chamber. Alternatively or additionally still, a plurality of internal heat exchange tubes can carry a cooled fluid inside the vapor deposition chamber.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">Once the vapor deposition has been completed, heat can be applied to the vapor deposition chamber to raise the temperature in the chamber <b>241</b> to the non-densification sintering temperature described above.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">It is recognized that the coating <b>210</b> can be applied to the inner surface of any suitable hole in the substrate <b>20</b>, whether the hole is metallized or not.

For instance, the elevated temperature can be approximately 50 degrees Celsius. Next, the temperature in the chamber is increased to a level that causes organics in the hole to form oxides. For instance, the temperature in the chamber can be increased to a level within a range from approximately 75 degrees Celsius to approximately 150 degrees Celsius. In one example, the temperature can be increased to approximately 120 degrees Celsius. The flow of the nitrogen and oxygen mix through the hole causes the oxides to evacuate from the particles <b>62</b>, and thus from the holes. The weight of the substrate can be monitored throughout this process, it being recognized that as the substrate reduces or stops losing weight, it can be concluded that substantially all of the organics that have formed oxides have been evacuated from the hole.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">Next, the nitrogen and oxygen mix can be evacuated from the hole.

Accordingly, in one example, no portion of the holes <b>26</b> or vias <b>34</b> is defined by a layer of resist that extends out from either of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Further, the holes <b>26</b>, and thus the vias <b>34</b>, can be filled with the particles <b>62</b> without depositing an electrically conductive layer onto the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, for instance, gold or titanium, in order to artificially extend the hole <b>26</b> beyond the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Accordingly, in one example, no portion of the holes is defined by a layer of titanium or gold that extends out from either of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">In some examples, the hard pressing step can be performed at atmospheric temperature and at a heated temperature, and the overfilled particles can be surface finished. In some examples, the heated temperature can be sufficient to cause all particles in the respective holes to sinter during the step of hard pressing.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">Further, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed at atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed under vacuum. For instance, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>B</figref>, first and second rigid press-members <b>143</b> can be disposed inside any suitable envelope, such as the envelope <b>118</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>. Thus, the envelope can include a first laminate structure <b>119</b><i>a </i>and a second laminate structure <b>119</b><i>b</i>. The first and second laminate structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b </i>can be impermeable with respect to airflow therethrough. It should be appreciated that the laminate structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>can be replaced by a single layer as desired. The substrate <b>20</b> can be placed in the envelope between the opposed press members <b>143</b>, such that the first surface <b>22</b> faces a first one of the press members, and the second surface <b>24</b> faces the other of the press members <b>143</b>. Thus, the first press member <b>143</b> is disposed between the first surface <b>22</b> and the first structure <b>119</b><i>a</i>, and the second press member <b>143</b> is disposed between the second surface and the second structure <b>119</b><i>b</i>. The interior of the envelope can be placed under vacuum in the manner described above. Next, the platens <b>141</b> can apply a compressive force to the envelope, and in particular to the first and second structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b</i>, which is applied to the press members <b>143</b> inside the envelope. Thus, the respective press surfaces of the press members <b>143</b> apply a uniaxial force that compresses the electrically conductive fill against the substrate <b>20</b> in the manner described above. Alternatively, the pressing step <b>253</b> can be performed in an isostatic press, whereby isostatic pressure can be applied to the first and second press members <b>143</b> that causes the press members <b>143</b> to apply the uniaxial force to the electrically conductive fill.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">The uniaxial force can be applied for any suitable duration lasting from seconds to several hours. The uniaxially force can further be applied while the substrate <b>20</b> is at any suitable temperature from approximately zero C to the melting temperature of the substrate <b>20</b>. Thus, in one example, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be a cold hard pressing step at room temperature. Alternatively, the pressing step can be a warm or hot hard pressing step at a temperature greater than room temperature up to the melting temperature of the substrate <b>20</b>. For instance, the temperature can be up to approximately 1200 C. The temperature of the platen <b>141</b> during the pressing step can be sufficient to soften and deform the electrically conductive fill, but not liquify it. The platen <b>141</b> can heat the electrically conductive fill directly or through the press members <b>143</b>. Thus, the pressing step <b>53</b> can forge the electrically conductive fill in some examples. The uniaxial forces can range up to approximately 100,000 PSI.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">Alternatively still, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>, an isostatic force can be applied to the substrate <b>20</b> and electrically conductive fill disposed inside the envelope between the first and second opposed structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b</i>. In one example, the isostatic forces are applied to the envelope, and the structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b</i>, which are malleable, can apply the isostatic forces directly to the substrate <b>20</b> and electrically conductive fill. When the isostatic forces are applied to the envelope, the first structure <b>119</b><i>a </i>conforms to the first surface <b>22</b> and the first end of the electrically conductive fill, and the second structure <b>119</b><i>b </i>confirms to the second surface <b>24</b> and the second end of the electrically conductive fill. The first and second structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b </i>thus apply isostatic compressive forces to the overfilled portions of the electrically conductive fill that extend beyond the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. The isostatic forces can be applied to the overfilled portions of the electrically conductive fill along a direction substantially normal to the outer surfaces of the overfilled portions. The resulting first and second portions of the overfilled electrically conductive fill can be compressed and densified, and define substantially dome shaped outer surfaces after isostatic pressure has been applied.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">Alternatively, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>B</figref>, any suitable malleable layers <b>127</b> can be disposed in the envelope and configured to apply the isostatic forces to the substrate <b>20</b> and both opposed ends of the sintered electrically conductive fill. Thus, the malleable layers <b>127</b> can define respective press surfaces that are configured to bear against the overfilled portions of the sintered electrically conductive fill. The malleable layers <b>127</b> can be configured as any suitable high temperature polymer such as Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or can alternatively be a metal foil. In this regard, it is appreciated that the malleable layers <b>127</b> are resistant to melting or decomposing. The malleable layers <b>127</b> can also advantageously resist adhering to, or altering material composition of, the substrate <b>20</b> and the electrically conductive fill. Isostatic forces are applied to the envelope, which causes isostatic pressure applied to the first and second structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b </i>to be applied to the first and second malleable layers <b>127</b>, respectively. Thus, when the isostatic forces are applied to the envelope, the first malleable layer <b>127</b> conforms to the first surface <b>22</b> and the first end of the electrically conductive fill, and the second malleable layer <b>127</b> confirms to the second surface <b>24</b> and the second end of the electrically conductive fill. The malleable layers <b>127</b> thus apply isostatic compressive forces to the overfilled portions of the electrically conductive fill that extend beyond the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. The isostatic forces can be applied to the overfilled portions of the electrically conductive fill along a direction substantially normal to the outer surfaces of the overfilled portions. The resulting first and second portions of the overfilled electrically conductive fill can be compressed and densified, and define substantially dome shaped outer surfaces after isostatic pressure has been applied.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">During the pressing step <b>53</b>, the isostatic forces can be applied at room temperature (also known as a cold isostatic press). Alternatively, the isostatic forces can be applied at an elevated temperature, up to approximately 2,200 C, for instance from in a range from approximately 45 C to approximately 500 C. Thus, the temperature of structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>199</b><i>b</i>, alone or in combination with the malleable layer <b>127</b>, can be elevated with respect to room temperature as the isostatic forces are applied to the substrate and electrically conductive fill. When the isostatic forces are applied at the elevated temperature, it is desirable to construct the envelope such that the first and second structures <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>199</b><i>b </i>do not melt against the substrate and electrically conductive fill. The isostatic pressure can be applied up to approximately 100,000 PSI.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is recognized that the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed after the sintering step <b>52</b> as described above. Further, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed alone or in combination with one or more of the compacting steps <b>50</b>. Alternatively, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed in the method <b>40</b> whereby no compacting steps <b>50</b> are performed. Alternatively, the method <b>40</b> can include one or more compacting steps <b>50</b> whereby no pressing steps <b>53</b> are performed. When the method includes the pressing step <b>53</b> but not the compacting step <b>50</b>, outer portions of the electrically conductive fill can have a greater density at its outer ends than the portion of the electrically conductive fill that extends from the first outer portion of the electrically conductive fill to the second portion of the electrically conductive fill.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">In still other examples, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed prior to the sintering step <b>52</b>. In particular, one or more filling steps <b>46</b> can be performed until the electrically conductive particles overfill the holes <b>26</b>, such that the particles extend beyond the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> as described above. Next, after the pressing step <b>53</b>, the electrically conductive particles can be sintered at step <b>52</b> as described above. Alternatively, the sintering step <b>52</b> and the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed simultaneously. That is, the electrically conductive particles can be sintered while under isostatic pressure that performs the pressing step <b>53</b>. Therefore, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed to the sintered electrically conductive fill, to the unsintered electrically conductive particles, or to the electrically conductive particles as they are sintered.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">In some examples, the method <b>40</b> can include the step <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of sealing the via. In one example, the sealing step can be performed by polishing or surface finishing the particles <b>62</b>. In particular, as illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>B</figref>, the outwardly-facing surface of the sintered particles <b>62</b> at each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> can be polished to increase the planarity of the outward-facing surface of the sintered particles <b>62</b>. It is recognized that the outwardly-facing surface of the sintered particles <b>62</b> can be defined by the final fill. For instance, the outwardly-facing surface of the sintered particles <b>62</b> at each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> can be pressed with a wand <b>166</b> that is driven across the respective surface. The wand <b>166</b> can have a hardness greater than that of the electrically conductive material and less than that of the substrate. For instance, the hardness can be greater than one or both of silver and copper, and less than glass. Thus the wand <b>166</b> can cause the sintered particles <b>62</b> at each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> to change its shape without compromising the integrity of the substrate. In particular, the wand <b>166</b> can change the shape of the overfilled portion of the sintered particles at each of the first and second surfaces so as to seal the openings to the via at one or more interfaces between the electrically conductive material and the substrate <b>20</b>. For instance, the interfaces can be disposed at the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively, of the substrate <b>20</b>. In one example, the wand <b>166</b> can be made of nickel. It is recognized that the sintered particles <b>62</b> at the first and surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> can be defined by the final fill as described above. Thus, it can be said that the final fill defines end caps <b>161</b> of the via <b>34</b>. Further, the end caps can hermetically seal the via. The end caps <b>161</b> can be surface finished as described above.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">The wand <b>166</b> can be pressed into the final fill and moved across the final fill so as to cause a plurality of the interstices at the first and second ends of the via to plug with electrically conductive material. The ductility of silver or copper final fill can be particularly suitable for this purpose. Further, the final fill can be pressed over the one or more interfaces with the opening to the hole <b>26</b> at each of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. In one example, the sealing step <b>54</b> can be performed in a vacuum, such that both the substrate <b>20</b> and the wand <b>166</b> can be disposed in a vacuum environment during surface finishing of the electrically conductive material. It should be appreciated that the step of surface finishing the electrically conductive material can further level the electrically conductive material. Alternatively or additionally, the sealing step <b>54</b> can include the step of applying a vacuum deposition of electrically conductive material into the electrically conductive material at the ends of the via so as to one or both of 1) plug a plurality of the interstices, and 2) fill the openings at the interfaces between the electrically conductive material and the substrate <b>20</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the sealing step <b>54</b> can include vacuum melting of the electrically conductive material so as to one or both of 1) plug a plurality of the interstices, and 2) fill the openings at the interfaces between the electrically conductive material and the substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">The sealing step <b>54</b> can produce a hermetic via having a hermeticity less than approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>.

Thus, the method <b>40</b> can include the pressing step <b>53</b> and omit the sealing step <b>54</b>. Alternatively, the method <b>40</b> can include the sealing step <b>54</b> and omit the pressing step <b>53</b>. Alternatively still, it is envisioned that the method can include both the sealing step <b>54</b> and the pressing step <b>53</b>. The pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed prior to the sealing step <b>54</b>. Alternatively, the pressing step <b>53</b> can be performed after the sealing step <b>54</b>. As illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>B</figref>, is appreciated that the sealing step <b>54</b> can seal the ends of the vias <b>34</b> at the first and second sides of the substrate that define the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively. Thus, the vias <b>34</b> can be hermetic. Accordingly, the electrically conductive material of the sintered particles <b>62</b>, and thus also of the via <b>34</b>, can be substantially nonporous at each of the first surface <b>22</b> and the second surface <b>24</b>. In particular a wand can smear the particles along the outer surfaces of the glass. Alternatively, as described above, the sealing step <b>54</b> can be omitted from the method <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">In some examples, the sealing step <b>54</b> can include, alone or in combination with one or both of the pressing step <b>53</b> and the driving the wand across the final fill as described above, the step of selectively laser sintering the one or both of the outer ends of the final fill to define dense end caps that are substantially nonporous and further seal the via <b>34</b>. Thus, at least one or both of the outer ends of the final fill can define a substantially nonporous laser-melted end cap at its outer end. In particular, after the step <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), a laser light can be directed selectively at the at least one or both ends of the final fill sufficient to cause the final fill to melt and define the dense end cap. The step of directing the laser light can be performed at a controlled pulse time and intensity of the laser so as to melt the outer ends of the final fill, thereby defining the dense end cap. As described above, the final fill can be filled beyond the hole, such that an overfilled portion of the final fill extends beyond either or both of the first and second outer surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>B-<b>12</b>C</figref>). The laser light can be directed at the overfilled portion of the final fill. The laser can be a green laser in some examples. The dense end cap can define a barrier to either or both of gas and liquid with respect to penetration into the hole. As described in more detail below, the dense end cap can be at least partially defined by sintered flakes or flake particles <b>225</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">In other examples, instead of surface finishing with a wand, a polishing or lapping method can be used to surface finish the particles. In particular, the particles can be overfilled and sintered in the manner described above, and subjected to hard press or isostatic press before or after sintering as desired. The overfilled particles can be polished using a polishing substrate that can be constructed as desired, and made of CeO2 in some examples.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">Alternatively, or additionally, an electrically conductive conformal coating can be applied to the ends of the vias after the sintering step <b>52</b>. In this regard, the conformal coating can be applied after the pressing step <b>53</b>. Alternatively, the conformal coating can be applied prior to performing the pressing step <b>53</b>. Alternatively still, the conformal coating can be applied when the method <b>40</b> does not include the pressing step <b>53</b>. For instance, the conformal coating can be applied to one or both of the outer surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate, and to the via that can be substantially planar with the surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>. The conformal coating can be applied to the ends of the vias using any suitable deposition technique as desired. In one example, the conformal coating can be applied to the particles <b>62</b> of the final fill at the ends of the vias, if a final filling step was performed. Alternatively, the conformal coating can be applied to the particles <b>62</b> of the bulk fill at the ends of the vias. In one example, the conformal coating can be electroplated to the particles <b>62</b>. Alternatively, the conformal coating can be deposited through variations of such techniques as evaporation, physical vapor deposition (PVD), or Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) such as atomic layer deposition (ALD). Alternatively still, the conformal coating can be applied in an electroless plating step.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">It is recognized that the conformal coating can occupy, and in some instances fill, the interstices <b>66</b> that are defined between adjacent ones of the particles as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>. In some examples, the final fill can include palladium. The palladium can be present in any suitable amount, such as from approximately 0.5% to approximately 30% of the final fill by weight. For instance, the palladium can be present in an amount within a range from approximately 0.5% to approximately 1% final fill by weight. Alternatively, the palladium can be present in an amount within a range from approximately 10% to approximately 30% final fill by weight. For instance, in a bimodal distribution of the second particles <b>62</b><i>b</i>, the second bimodal particles can be defined by palladium as described above. Alternatively, the second bimodal particles can be at least partially or entirely bismuth. Alternatively, the second bimodal particles can be at least partially or entirely aluminum. Alternatively, the second bimodal particles can be at least partially or entirely tin. Alternatively, the second bimodal particles can be at least partially or entirely copper.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">Alternatively, or additionally still, after the final compaction step, any suitable metal can be deposited into the interstices of the particles <b>62</b>, and in particular the particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>of the final fill. It is recognized that it may also be desirable to deposit metal into the interstices defined by the first particles <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the first fill. For instance, in one example, an electroplatable metal can be electroplated into the interstices of the silver particles <b>62</b> disposed in the hole. Thus, the electroplatable metal can at least partially or substantially fill the interstices. The electroplating step can be performed prior to the sintering step <b>52</b> or after the sintering step <b>54</b>. The electroplatable metal can be any one or more up to all of aluminum, copper, titanium, silver, or any suitable alternative metal or alloy thereof as desired.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282">In another example, a metal can be deposited into the interstices using any suitable process, such as chemical vapor deposition. In particular, the process can be a metal organic chemical vapor deposition. For instance, the process can be an atomic layer deposition process. The deposition can take place under vacuum. The chemical vapor deposited metal can be at least one of indium, aluminum, bismuth, copper, titanium, silver, or any suitable alternative metal as desired. The metal deposited in the interstices decreases the porosity of the fill. Thus, when the metal is deposited in the interstices of the bulk fill, the porosity of the bulk fill decreases. Similarly, when the metal is deposited in the interstices of the final fill, the metal disposed in the interstices can decrease the porosity of the end caps defined by the final fill. The chemical vapor deposition can take place before the particles of the bulk and final fills are sintered. Alternatively, the chemical vapor deposition can take place after the particles of the bulk and final fills are sintered, but prior to surface finishing the end caps in the manner described above.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">In still another example, a metal can be sputtered onto one or both of the bulk fill and the final fill. For instance, the metal can be sputtered onto the bulk fill prior to introducing the final fill particles <b>62</b><i>b </i>into the hole. The metal can be sputtered before the bulk fill has been compacted. Alternatively, the metal can be sputtered onto the bulk fill after the bulk fill has been compacted but before the particles have been sintered. Alternatively, the metal can be sputtered onto the bulk fill after the particles have been sintered. For instance, in some examples the bulk fill can be sintered prior to filling and subsequently sintering the final fill. In this regard, it is recognized that the bulk fill and the sputtered metal can be heated to elevated temperatures during downstream processes, such as application of the redistribution layer, that cause the sputtered material to melt. The melted sputtered material can then travel into the interstices of the bulk fill.

Thus, the sintering temperature can cause the sputtered metal to melt and travel into the interstices. Alternatively, the metal can be sputtered onto the final fill after the particles have been sintered. Further, the metal can be sputtered onto the final fill before the final fill has been surface finished, such that the sputtered metal can travel into the interstices, for instance when the redistribution layer is applied. Alternatively, the metal can be sputtered onto the final fill before the final fill has been surface finished. While it is recognized that the resulting surface finished final fill may lack the porosity for the sputtered metal to travel into the interstices, it is recognized that should porosity develop in the final fill, and in particular the end caps, during the application of the redistribution layer, the sputtered metal can melt and flow into the pores, thereby decreasing the porosity of the final fill including the end caps.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">Thus, conformal coating that is deposited into the interstices can further seal the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.

In particular, the flakes <b>25</b> can be deposited onto either or both of the opposed ends of the final fill. As will be appreciated below, the flakes can be hard pressed and sintered so as to define a substantially nonporous layer that provides a barrier with respect to ingress of either or both of liquid and gas into the hole <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">The flakes <b>25</b> can be irregularly shaped, and can be sized and shaped differently from each other. The flakes <b>25</b> can have an average specific surface area within a range from approximately 0.3 meter squared per gram up to approximately 1.5 meter squared per gram. For instance, the specific surface area can range from approximately 0.3 meter squared per gram up to approximately 1 meter squared per gram. In one example, the specific surface area can be approximately 0.76 meter squared per gram. It is recognized, of course, that the flakes <b>25</b> can have any suitable specific surface area as desired. Further, a majority of the flakes can have an average aspect ratio within a range from approximately 2:1 to approximately 10:1. In one example, the flakes can be ball milled. Alternatively, the flakes are attritor milled. Alternatively still, the flake particles can be planetary milled. Alternatively still, the flakes can be cryo-milled. In this regard, it should be appreciated that the flakes can be fabricated in any suitable manner as desired. The flakes <b>25</b> can be the same metal as the final fill. Alternatively, the flakes <b>25</b> can be or a different metal than the final fill.

The flake particles can, for instance, have a density from approximately 80 percent to approximately 98 percent. The flake particles can be sintered so as to define a dense substantially nonporous coating that extends along the outer ends of the final fill. For instance, the flakes <b>25</b> can be applied to the final fill before the sintering step <b>52</b> described above. Alternatively, the flakes <b>25</b> can be applied after the sintering step <b>52</b>. The flakes <b>52</b> can thus be sintered during the process of downstream operations, such as application of the redistribution layer.

The first layer <b>422</b> can have any suitable thickness as desired. For instance, the thickness can range from approximately 1 nanometer (nm) to approximately 100 nm.

Thus, the second layer <b>428</b> and the first layer <b>424</b> can be similarly patterned. The etching process can be a wet etching process, or any suitable alternative etching process as desired such as a dry etching process. Next, a metallic fourth layer <b>430</b> can be deposited onto the patterned third layer <b>428</b>. For instance, the fourth layer can be electrochemically deposited onto the third layer <b>428</b>.

Next, a metallic layer can be deposited directly onto the second layer <b>424</b>. For instance, the metallic layer can be electrochemically deposited onto the second layer <b>424</b>. The metallic layer can be one of copper, silver, aluminum, or any suitable alternative metal. Thus, the metallic layer can be the same metal as the second layer <b>424</b>.

The electrically conductive material of the particles <b>62</b> can define a scaffold matrix designed to have internal gaseous voids or pores that are arranged along a majority of a length of the hole substantially from the first surface <b>22</b> substantially to the second surface <b>24</b>. The sintered electrically conductive material defines an electrically conductive path substantially from the first surface substantially to the second surface. The pores can define at least 25% of a total volume of the via up to 75% of the via in certain examples. However, it is appreciated that the pores can define less than 25% of the total volume of the via in other examples.

The other electrically conductive materials can include one or more of electrically conductive polymers, electrically conductive metals, electrically conductive ceramics, electrically conductive compounds, or the like, such as graphene, electrically conductive carbides, and intermetallic composites. Alternatively or additionally, supercritical fluids have extremely low surface tension, and can be used to deposit metal. It is envisioned that they can at least partially fill the interstices in the vias after the sintering step. Supercritical fluid carries metal with low surface tension so metal can enter tight spaces. Accordingly, the metal can be deposited in the holes <b>26</b>.

The metal can be at least one or more of tungsten, copper, titanium, silver, and alloys thereof. In one example, the metal can be deposited using a chemical vapor deposition process. For instance, the chemical vapor deposition process can be a metal organic chemical vapor deposition process, a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process, or an atomic layer deposition process. The deposition can take place under vacuum. The deposition can be performed after the final fill has been packed. Further, the deposition can be performed prior to sintering the fill. Alternatively, the deposition can be performed after sintering.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0303">It is recognized that methods for cleaning the substrate <b>20</b> are provided as desired. For instance, residual suspension can be cleaned off, or removed from, the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> as desired, including before the compacting step, before the sintering step, and before the surface finishing step, and after the surface finishing step. The residual suspension can be removed, for instance, by driving a wand along one or both surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> using any suitable wand in the manner describe above. The wand can have a hardness greater than the residual suspension but less than that of the substrate <b>20</b>. For instance, the wand can be a Teflon wand or a rubber wand. Alternatively or additionally, an alcohol such as IPA alone or in combination with a soft semi-abrasive material can be placed on one or both of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, and the wand can be driven along the surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in the manner described above to remove residual powder.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0304">In another example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, and as described above, the electrically conductive via <b>34</b> can include the hole <b>26</b> that extends at least into or through the substrate <b>20</b>, and a sintered electrically conductive material <b>135</b> that establishes an electrical path from the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to the second surface <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.

Alternatively or additionally, one or more pores can be defined between the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> of the electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> and the internal surface of the substrate <b>20</b> that defines the hole <b>26</b>.

One example of such a thick film lead-free paste is described in PCT Publication No. WO 2018/094162 A1, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety herein. It is recognized that some electrically pastes can become porous after sintering. The sintered electrically conductive paste can at least partially define at least one gaseous pore, such as a plurality of pores. For instance, shrinkage of the pastes during sintering can create pores that are disposed between the internal surface of the substrate <b>20</b> and the sintered paste. If a coating is applied to the internal surface of the substrate <b>20</b>, then the pores can be defined between the coating and the sintered paste. In still other examples, pores can be defined by the sintered paste itself. The at least one pore defined by the paste can be arranged between the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">It can be desirable to fill the pores with a non-gaseous material so as to remove gas, that would other occupy the pores, from the via. Removal of the gas limits or prevents expansion of gas inside the via during subsequent processing, such as application of a redistribution layer which occurs at elevated temperatures. The non-gaseous material can be a flowable viscous polymer <b>137</b> that hardens when cured. The polymer <b>137</b> can be an electrically conductive polymer. For instance, the polymer can include a plurality of suspended metallic particles. The metallic particles can be silver, copper, gold, or any suitable electrically conductive metal. Alternatively, the polymer can be an electrically nonconductive polymer, recognizing that the electrically conductive fill <b>35</b> can establish an electrically conductive path from the first surface <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to the second surface <b>24</b> whether the polymer is electrically conductive of nonconductive. When the resulting electrically conductive via <b>34</b> includes the coating <b>210</b>, the coating <b>210</b> and the polymer <b>137</b> can combine to define a barrier to one or both of gas and liquid with respect to the penetration of one of gas and liquid, respectively, into the via <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0307">When the electrically conductive material <b>135</b> is defined by the electrically conductive particles <b>62</b> of the fill <b>35</b>, the fill <b>35</b> can include a bulk fill and a final fill that extends from the bulk fill to either or both of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> as described above. The pores of the fill <b>35</b> can be networked so as to establish a path from the first end of the via to the second end of the via. Similarly, when the electrically conductive material <b>135</b> is a paste, the pores of the paste can be networked so as to establish a path from the first end of the via to the second end of the via. In such examples, the polymer can be introduced into the hole <b>26</b> under a pressure differential. For instance, the polymer can be applied to one of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the substrate <b>20</b>, including the first and second ends of the via, and a negative pressure, or vacuum, can be applied to the other of the first and second surfaces that draws the polymer into the hole <b>26</b> through the pores. In other examples, it is recognized that the pores might not establish a path from the first end of the via to the second end of the via. Therefore, a vacuum would be insufficient to draw the polymer into the hole <b>26</b>. In such examples, the polymer can be applied to either or both of the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, including the first and second ends of the via, and pressed into the hole <b>26</b>. For instance, forces from an isostatic press or hard press can cause the polymer to be introduced into the hole.

In this regard, the bulk fill can be sintered prior to introducing the polymer <b>137</b> into the hole <b>26</b>. Next, the polymer <b>137</b> can be cured. Because the polymer reduces or substantially eliminates the porosity of the bulk fill, a vacuum may be insufficient to draw suspension including the final fill into the hole <b>26</b>. Accordingly, it may be desirable to introduce the final fill into the hole <b>26</b> under centrifugal or electrostatic forces in the manner described above. The final fill can then be sintered in the manner described above. The final fill can be planarized at the first and second surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> before and/or after the final fill is sintered as described above. If desired, the polymer can be introduced into pores of the final fill under an isostatic or hard press as described above. Alternatively, metal can be introduced into the pores of the final fill in any suitable manned described above. For example, the metal can be electroplated onto the final fill so as to occupy the at least one pore that is at least partially defined by the final fill.
