These disorders are characterized by the accumulation of a misfolded isoform of the prion protein (PrP Scrapie; PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) leading to spongiform changes to the brain associated with neuronal loss and gliosis. The term prion, short for proteinatious infectious particle, refers to the protein-only nature of these pathogenic isoforms. The abnormally shaped protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) can subsequently bind and convert the abundantly expressed physiological form of the prion protein (cellular PrP; PrP<sup>C</sup>) to the disease-causing isoform PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. This phenomenon is known as self-templating. Although identical in protein sequence, PrP<sup>Sc </sup>is drastically different from PrP<sup>C </sup>biophysically in terms of solubility, structure, and stability (Riesner, Brit Med Bull. (2003) 66:21-33). Propagation of the PrP<sup>Sc </sup>isoform is followed by aggregation, causing neuronal cell death in the central nervous system. Human prion diseases can be genetic (accounting for 10-15% of cases), sporadic or acquired and include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome (GSS), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI), and Kuru. In humans, prion disease impairs brain function, causing progressive cognitive decline and abnormal movements. Prion disease is always fatal, and typically results in death within a few months to several years of onset of illness.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The precise function of PrP is still controversial in the field, but among many phenotypes, PrP has been hypothesized to play a role in neurogenesis and neuroprotection, circadian rhythm, myelin maintenance, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition to the familial forms, prion disease can also be sporadic or acquired. People with sporadic prion disease have no family history of the disease or identifiable mutation in the PRNP gene. Sporadic prion disease occurs when PrP<sup>C </sup>is spontaneously transformed into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Sporadic forms of prion disease include sporadic CJD (sCJD), sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI), and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr). Acquired prion disease results from exposure to PrP<sup>Sc </sup>from an outside source. For example, variant CJD (vCJD) is a form of acquired prion disease resulting from consumption of beef products containing PrP<sup>Sc </sup>from cattle with prion disease. In cattle, this form of the disease is known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or &#x201c;mad cow disease.&#x201d; Another example of an acquired human prion disease is Kuru, which was identified in the South Fore population in Papua New Guinea. Kuru was transmitted when individuals ate affected human tissue during cannibalistic funeral rituals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Reduction of PrP expression is a therapeutic strategy supported by numerous genetic proof of concept studies as well as by the in vivo efficacy of PrP-lowering antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) shown to prolong the survival of prion-infected mice. See, e.g., B&#xfc;eler et al., Cell (1993) 73(7):1339-47; B&#xfc;eler et al., <i>Mol Med Camb Mass</i>. (1994) 1(1):19-30; Fischer et al., <i>EMBO J</i>. (1996) 15(6):1255-64; Mallucci et al., <i>Science </i>(2003) 302(5646):871-4; and Safar et al., <i>J Gen Virol</i>. (2005) 86(Pt 10):2913-23, Minikel et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res</i>. (2020) 10.1093/nar/gkaa616. While ASOs achieving 50% PrP knockdown have been shown to delay the onset of prion disease in mice by more than two-fold, greater levels of PrP knockdown may offer further therapeutic benefit. Distribution of PrP knockdown beyond what is achievable with ASOs may also be important for efficacy. Thus, there remains a need for an effective treatment of prion disease by targeting PrP expression.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides zinc finger protein (ZFP) domains that target sites in or near the mammalian (e.g., human, non-human primate, rodent, or murine) PRNP gene.

A ZFP domain as described herein may be attached or fused to another functional molecule or domain. The ZFP domains of the present disclosure may be fused to a transcription factor to repress the transcription of the mammalian PRNP gene into RNA. The fusion proteins are called zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs). These ZFP-TFs comprise a zinc finger protein (ZFP) domain that binds specifically to a target region (i.e., target site) in or near the PRNP gene and a transcription repressor domain that reduces the transcription of the gene. Reducing the level of PrP in neurons by introducing the ZFP-TFs into the brain of a patient is expected to inhibit (e.g., reduce or stop) the formation and spread of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, thereby treating prion disease (e.g., alleviating symptoms, preventing onset or worsening of symptoms, and increasing survival).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Our ZFP-TF approach to PRNP inhibition has several advantages over the current approaches being tested by others. ZFP-TFs can achieve higher levels of PrP repression than what has been reported for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Further, ZFP-TFs may need to be administered only once (by introducing to the patient a ZFP-TF expression construct such as recombinant viruses, e.g., recombinant AAV), while ASOs require repeated dosing. In addition, the ZFP-TF approach only needs to engage the two alleles of the PRNP gene in the genome of each cell. By contrast, ASOs need to engage numerous copies of the PRNP mRNA in each cell. In addition, with the use of recombinant viruses such as recombinant AAV, ZFP-TFs can be delivered to any brain region of interest.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Our approach to prion disease treatment is expected to be safe. About 1:18,000 humans are estimated to be heterozygous for loss-of-function PRNP mutation and yet there are no discernible deleterious effects in these individuals.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">I. Targets of the ZFP Domains</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ZFP domains of the present fusion proteins bind specifically to a target region in or near the mammalian (e.g., human, non-human primate, or murine) PRNP gene. The DNA-binding ZFP domain of the ZFP-TFs directs the fusion proteins to a target region of the PRNP gene and brings the transcription repressor domain of the fusion proteins to the target region. The repressor domain then represses the PRNP gene's transcription by RNA polymerase. The target region can be any suitable site in the PRNP gene that allows repression of gene expression. By way of example, the target region includes, or is adjacent to (either downstream or upstream of) a PRNP transcription start site (TSS), or a PRNP transcription regulatory element (e.g., promoter, enhancer, RNA polymerase pause site, and the like). For example, the target region may be within about 500-1,000 bp upstream and/or downstream of the TSS.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the genomic target region is at least 8 bps in length. For example, the target region may be 8 bps to 40 bps in length, such as 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, or 36 bps in length. The targeted sequence may be on the sense strand of the gene, or the antisense strand of the gene. To ensure targeting accuracy and to reduce off-target binding or activity by the ZFP-TFs, the sequence of the selected PRNP target region preferably has less than 75% homology (e.g., less than 70%, less than 65%, less than 60%, or less than 50%) to sequences in other genes.

ZFP Domains</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A &#x201c;zinc finger protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;ZFP&#x201d; refers to a protein having a DNA-binding domain that is stabilized by zinc. ZFPs bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The individual DNA-binding unit of a ZFP is referred to as a zinc &#x201c;finger&#x201d;. Each finger contains a DNA-binding &#x201c;recognition helix&#x201d; that is typically comprised of seven amino acid residues and determines DNA binding specificity. A ZFP domain has at least one finger, each finger binds from two to four base pairs of DNA, typically three or four base pairs of DNA. Each zinc finger typically comprises approximately 30 amino acids and chelates zinc. An engineered ZFP can have a novel binding specificity, compared to a naturally-occurring ZFP. Engineering methods include, but are not limited to, rational design and various types of selection. Rational design includes, for example, using databases comprising triplet (or quadruplet) nucleotide sequences and individual zinc finger amino acid sequences, in which each triplet or quadruplet nucleotide sequence is associated with one or more amino acid sequences of zinc fingers that bind the particular triplet or quadruplet sequence. See, e.g., ZFP design methods described in detail in U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments, the linker is a standard inter-finger linker such that the finger array comprises one DNA binding domain comprising 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 or more fingers. In other embodiments, the linker is an atypical linker such as a flexible linker. For example, two ZFP domains may be linked to a transcription repressor TF in the configuration (from N terminus to C terminus) ZFP-ZFP-TF, TF-ZFP-ZFP, ZFP-TF-ZFP, or ZFP-TF-ZFP-TF (two ZFP-TF fusion proteins are fused together via a linker).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the ZFP-TFs are &#x201c;two-handed,&#x201d; i.e., they contain two zinc finger clusters (two ZFP domains) separated by intervening amino acids so that the two ZFP domains bind to two discontinuous target sites. An example of a two-handed type of zinc finger binding protein is SIP1, where a cluster of four zinc fingers is located at the amino terminus of the protein and a cluster of three fingers is located at the carboxyl terminus (see Remade et al., EMBO J. (1999) 18(18):5073-84). Each cluster of zinc fingers in these proteins is able to bind to a unique target sequence and the spacing between the two target sequences can comprise many nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, the DNA-binding domain may be derived from a nuclease.

The targeted brain regions can be reached directly through intrastriatal injection, intrathalamic injection, intracerebral injection, intra-cisterna <i>magna </i>(ICM) injection, or more generally through intraparenchymal injection, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection, intrathecal injection, or intravenous injection. Other routes of administration include, without limitation, intracerebral, intraventricular, intranasal, or intraocular administration. In some embodiments, the viral vector spreads throughout the CNS tissue following direct administration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), e.g., via intrathecal and/or intracerebral injection, or intracisterna-<i>magna </i>injection. In other embodiments, the viral vectors cross the blood-brain-barrier and achieve wide-spread distribution throughout the CNS tissue of a subject following intravenous administration. In other embodiments, the viral vectors are delivered directly to the target regions via intraparenchymal injections. In some cases, the viral vectors may undergo retrograde or anterograde transport to other brain regions following intraparenchymal delivery. In some aspects, the viral vectors have distinct CNS tissue targeting capabilities (e.g., CNS tissue tropisms), which achieve stable and nontoxic gene transfer at high efficiencies.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition may be provided to the patient through intraventricular administration, e.g., into a ventricular region of the forebrain of the patient such as the right lateral ventricle, the left lateral ventricle, the third ventricle, or the fourth ventricle. The pharmaceutical composition may be provided to the patient through intracerebral administration, e.g., injection of the composition into or near the striatum, caudate, putamen, substantia nigra, midbrain, olfactory bulb, cerebrum, medullar, pons, cerebellum, locus coeruleus, pons, medulla, brainstem, globus pallidus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebrum, intracranial cavity, meninges, dura mater, arachnoid mater, or pia mater of the brain. Intracerebral administration may include, in some cases, administration of an agent into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">In some cases, intracerebral administration involves injection using stereotaxic procedures. Stereotaxic procedures are well known in the art and typically involve the use of a computer and a 3-dimensional scanning device that are used together to guide injection to a particular intracerebral region, e.g., a ventricular region. Micro-injection pumps (e.g., from World Precision Instruments) may also be used. In some cases, a microinjection pump is used to deliver a composition comprising a viral vector. In some cases, the infusion rate of the composition is in a range of 0.1 &#x3bc;l/min to 100 &#x3bc;l/min. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, infusion rates will depend on a variety of factors, including, for example, species of the subject, age of the subject, weight/size of the subject, serotype of the AAV, dosage required, and intracerebral region targeted. Thus, other infusion rates may be deemed by a skilled artisan to be appropriate in certain circumstances.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Delivery of rAAVs to a subject may be accomplished, for example, by intravenous administration. In certain instances, it may be desirable to deliver the rAAVs locally to the brain tissue, the spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuronal cells, glial cells, meninges, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, interstitial spaces, and the like. In some cases, recombinant AAVs may be delivered directly to the CNS by injection into the ventricular region, as well as to the parenchyma, striatum, substantia nigra, cortex, cerebellar lobule, thalamus, hippocampus or other brain region or combination of brain regions. AAVs may be delivered with a needle, catheter or related device, using neurosurgical techniques known in the art, such as by stereotactic injection (see, e.g., Stein et al., <i>J Vir</i>.

The target regions of the ZFP-TFs are denoted by arrowheads in the two figures, with the direction of the arrowhead indicating the strand of DNA that the ZFP-TF binds to (5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;). 192 of the ZFP-TFs were parental proteins, while the other half were variants of the parental proteins containing three R-to-Q mutations (Miller et al., Nat Biotechnol. (2019) 37(8):945&#x2212;52). In this study, a KRAB domain sequence (SEQ ID NO: 262) was used as the transcription repressor and fused to the C-terminus of the ZFP domain.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Messenger RNA encoding each ZFP-TF was produced and aliquoted into 96-well plates in a 6-dose dilution. Mouse Neuro2a cells were transfected with the mRNA using the Amaxa&#xae; Nucleofector&#xae; device (Lonza, Switzherland). After 24 hours, total RNA was extracted from the cells and the expression of PRNP and two reference genes (ATP5b, EIF4A2) was monitored using real-time RT-qPCR. To do so, the cells were lysed and reverse transcription was performed using the C2CT kit following the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure the expression levels of PRNP. PRNP expression levels were normalized to the geometric mean of the expression levels of the housekeeping genes EIF4A2 and ATP5B.
