In particular the disclosure relates to a tool for removing grease and food remnants from a barbeque grill. Specifically, the disclosure relates to a kit for steam cleaning a barbeque grill that includes a brush, a heat resistant cloth that is engageable with the brush, and a dipping tray for moistening the cloth, and to a method of utilizing the kit to steam clean a barbeque grill.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background Information</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">When food is cooked on a barbeque grill it is common for pieces of the food to become stuck on the surface of the grill. The grill also tends to become coated in grease. It is desirable to remove this stuck food and grease from the grill surface before cooking the next meal thereon. Wire brushes and scrapers were typically used to try and remove these stuck materials from the grill's surface. In recent years people became aware that some traditional grill-cleaning tools tend to shed small pieces of metal. These small pieces of metal tend to become embedded in the grease and food stuck on the grill bars and can be transferred to uncooked food placed on the grill bars. These metal pieces may then be inadvertently ingested and cause injury to people who eat food cooked on the grill. A variety of non-metal barbeque cleaning tools have therefore been proposed by the art to avoid this issue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Regardless of the tool used to clean barbeque grills, whether metal or non-metal in construction, it remains a problem to adequately remove food pieces and grease from grill surfaces.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The barbeque cleaning kit and method of using the same disclosed herein provides a way to more adequately remove food remnants and grease from barbeque grills. The kit for cleaning a barbeque grill includes a grill brush having a base, a handle extending upwardly from the base, and a support member extending downwardly from the base; a heat-resistant cloth which is releasably engageable about the support member of the grill brush; and a dipping tray adapted to retain a quantity of liquid therein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a method of cleaning a barbeque grill comprising engaging a heat-resistant cloth about a support member of a grill brush; absorbing a quantity of liquid with the heat-resistant cloth; placing the grill brush with heat-resistant cloth engaged therewith onto previously-heated grill bars of the barbeque grill; generating steam as the quantity of liquid is heated by the grill bars; moving the grill brush with heat-resistant cloth engaged therewith back and forth along the grill bars; removing food matter and grease from the grill bars; and transferring the removed food matter and grease to the heat-resistant cloth.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the removal of food matter and grease is accomplished by a combination of applying the generated steam to the food matter and grease and moving the grill brush with heat-resistant cloth engaged therewith back and forth along the grill bars. In one embodiment, the method further comprises disengaging the heat-resistant cloth from the grill brush. In one embodiment the method further includes washing the disengaged heat-resistant cloth.

The method, indicated by the reference character <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, includes a plurality of steps. In a first step <b>30</b>, the barbeque is switched on and the grill is heated to a temperature of about 350&#xb0; F. (about 175&#xb0; C.). The grill is then switched off. In a second step <b>32</b>, brush <b>12</b> is used to scrape the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d; to remove any burnt-on food particles. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which shows the brush <b>12</b> oriented at an angle to bring the edge <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the scraper <b>24</b> into contact with the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;. The brush <b>12</b> is moved along the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d; in the direction of arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d; while keeping the edge <b>24</b><i>a </i>of scraper <b>24</b> in contact with grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;. The edge <b>24</b><i>a </i>scrapes at least some of the material (burnt-on food and grease) from the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;. The figure shows this scraped-off food matter &#x201c;FM&#x201d; flying off the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;. As is evident from the figure, some food matter &#x201c;FM&#x201d; is not able to be removed with the scraper <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a third step <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the heat-resistant cloth <b>14</b> is attached to brush <b>12</b>. This is accomplished by the user turning cloth <b>14</b> over on a flat surface so that the inner surface <b>14</b><i>b </i>is facing upwardly. The brush <b>12</b> is moved to a position over a central region of the inner surface <b>14</b><i>b </i>of cloth <b>14</b> and is moved downwardly to place the support member <b>26</b> thereof in direct contact with inner surface <b>14</b><i>b</i>. As is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a region of cloth <b>14</b> lays on either side of the support member <b>26</b>. These regions of the cloth <b>14</b> are folded upwardly over a portion of the top surface of the support member <b>26</b> and over a portion of the base <b>18</b> of the brush <b>12</b>. Using their index finger, for example, the user will push downwardly on the portions of the cloth <b>14</b> which overlay each of the fastener elements <b>22</b>. The downward pushing force on the fastener elements <b>22</b>, indicated by arrows &#x201c;B&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>, causes a deflection in part of the top <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the respective fastener element <b>22</b>. This deflection causes the slit <b>22</b><i>b </i>in the fastener element <b>22</b> to open up slightly. Some of the cloth <b>14</b> is forced to enter into an interior space located beneath the top <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the fastener element <b>22</b> as the slit <b>22</b><i>b </i>opens up and the user's finger continues to push downwardly. The user will then lift his or her finger off the top <b>22</b><i>a </i>of fastener element <b>22</b>. This allows the deflected part of the top <b>22</b><i>a </i>to return to its original position, closing the slit <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and thereby grippingly engaging part of the cloth <b>14</b> therein. When this process is repeated on all four of the fastener elements <b>22</b>, the cloth <b>14</b> is tightly retained around an exterior surface of support member <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a fourth step <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), a quantity of liquid &#x201c;L&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), such as water, is placed in the dipping tray <b>16</b>. In a fifth step <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), the brush <b>12</b>, with grill cloth <b>14</b> engaged therewith is lowered into the liquid &#x201c;L&#x201d; of the dipping tray <b>16</b>. The user will hold brush <b>12</b> in dipping tray <b>16</b> until a quantity of the liquid &#x201c;L&#x201d; soaks into cloth <b>14</b>. The user will then remove the brush <b>12</b> with engaged cloth <b>14</b> from within the liquid &#x201c;L&#x201d; retained in dipping tray <b>16</b>. The dunking motion of the brush <b>12</b> and engaged cloth <b>14</b> into dipping tray <b>16</b> is indicated by arrow &#x201c;C&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a sixth step <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), the user will substantially immediately place the brush <b>12</b> with engaged cloth <b>14</b> onto the previously heated grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Holding handle <b>20</b>, the user will move the brush <b>12</b> with engaged cloth <b>14</b> back and forth along the previously-heated grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d; as indicated by arrow &#x201c;D&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The heat from the metal grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d; will heat the water retained in the cloth <b>14</b>, created steam &#x201c;S&#x201d;. As the brush <b>12</b> with engaged cloth <b>14</b> is moved back and forth along the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;, the generated steam &#x201c;S&#x201d; will penetrate the built-up food matter &#x201c;FM&#x201d; that remains on the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;. The steam &#x201c;S&#x201d; in conjunction with the brushing motion will loosen and lift the food matter &#x201c;FM&#x201d; from off the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;. The lifted food matter &#x201c;FM&#x201d; will then be transferred to the part of the cloth <b>14</b> that is in contact with the grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d;, leaving cleaner grill bars &#x201c;GB&#x201d; behind.
