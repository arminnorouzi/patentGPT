In order to connect an optical fiber external to the chip to the optical components of the substrate, it would be desirable to be able to form, in the stack of layers covering the substrate, a cavity with dimensions that are substantial enough to receive an end of the optical fiber, for example a cavity with horizontal dimensions that can reach a few millimeters and a depth of several micrometers.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partial and schematic sectional view illustrating the result of a phase of an embodiment of a method for forming a cavity with relatively substantial dimensions in a chip.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">During this phase, electronic components (not illustrated) are formed in and/or on a substrate <b>2</b>, for example a semiconductor substrate, for example made of silicon. These components are, for example, optical, electronic or optoelectronic components. An insulating layer <b>4</b> (PMD&#x2014;Pre-Metal Dielectric), for example made of silicon oxide, is formed on the upper face of the substrate <b>2</b>. This phase further comprises a step of forming a stack <b>10</b> on the upper face of the insulating layer <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The stack <b>10</b> comprises, for example, an alternation of layers <b>6</b> (<b>6</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>6</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>6</b><sub>3</sub>, <b>6</b><sub>4</sub>) each made solely of a first insulating material and of layers <b>8</b> (<b>8</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>8</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>8</b><sub>3</sub>) each made solely of a second insulating material. The first material is, for example, silicon nitride. The second material is, for example, silicon oxide. More specifically, in the illustrated example, the stack <b>10</b> comprises, in order, starting from the upper face of the layer <b>4</b>: a layer <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>made of silicon nitride, a layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>made of silicon oxide, a layer <b>6</b><sub>2 </sub>made of silicon nitride, a layer <b>8</b><sub>2 </sub>made of silicon oxide, a layer <b>6</b><sub>3 </sub>made of silicon nitride, a layer <b>8</b><sub>3 </sub>made of silicon oxide and a layer <b>6</b><sub>4 </sub>made of silicon nitride.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The layer <b>6</b><sub>1</sub>, i.e., the bottom layer of the stack <b>10</b>, comprises a portion <b>24</b> presenting an excess thickness relative to a portion of layer <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>on opposite sides of (perhaps surrounding) the portion <b>24</b>, in other words there is a portion laterally outside of the portion <b>24</b>. The upper surface of portion <b>24</b> extends parallel to the upper surface of the underlying layer <b>4</b>, with lateral side edges of the portion <b>24</b> generally extending perpendicular to the upper surface of layer <b>4</b>. The portion <b>24</b> is located facing (i.e., vertically aligned with) an opening <b>22</b> in a mask <b>20</b>. In the embodiment described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the surface size and shape in a horizontal plane of the portion <b>24</b> is substantially equal to the surface size and shape in a horizontal plane of the opening <b>22</b>. As a variant, the surface size and shape of the portion <b>24</b> could be greater than that of the opening, although the portion <b>24</b> may not constitute the entire layer <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>in the final chip.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">More generally, the stack comprises a minimum of a layer <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>of the first material, constituting the bottom layer of the stack, and a layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>of the second material, formed on and in contact with the layer <b>6</b><sub>1</sub>. The layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>can then be covered with any number of alternating layers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, the top layer of the stack potentially being a layer <b>6</b> of the first material or a layer <b>8</b> of the second material. Preferably, the stack comprises at least two layers <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>6</b><sub>2 </sub>of the first material separated by the layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>of the second material. The total thickness of the stack is, for example, comprised between 1 and 20 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As a variant, the stack <b>10</b> can comprise layers made of other materials above the included layers <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>8</b><sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The stack <b>10</b> is, for example, a stack of interconnecting layers comprising, in addition to the insulating layers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, conductive interconnection paths (not shown in the figure) by means of which it is possible to couple components of the chip with one another and/or to terminals for connecting the chip to a device external to the chip. In this example, the cavity will be formed in a zone of the stack <b>10</b> that does not comprise conductive interconnection paths. The portion <b>24</b> thus extends in this zone only. The thickness of the layer <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>outside the portion <b>24</b> is, for example, chosen so as to correspond to the characteristics of an interconnecting stack.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The thickness of the portion <b>24</b> is, for example, is greater than the thickness of the layer <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>laterally outside the portion <b>24</b> and may, for example, be as thick as three times the thickness of the layer <b>6</b><sub>1 </sub>laterally outside the portion <b>24</b>. For example, the thickness of the portion <b>24</b> is greater than 30 nm and less than 200 nm. As a variant, the portion <b>24</b> can have a thickness such that the upper surface of portion <b>24</b> reaches the lower surface of layer <b>6</b><sub>2</sub>, in other words, the thickness of portion <b>24</b> extends completely through the thickness of layer <b>8</b><sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The step of forming the stack <b>10</b> is followed by the deposition of a mask <b>20</b> on the top layer of the stack <b>10</b>, here on the layer <b>6</b><sub>4</sub>. The mask <b>20</b> comprises an opening located at the site where a cavity will be formed and the horizontal dimensions of which, i.e., the dimensions when viewed from above, are substantially equal to those of the opening of the cavity it is desired to form. For example, the horizontal dimensions of the opening <b>22</b> are all greater than 100 &#x3bc;m, for example greater than 500 &#x3bc;m, for example greater than 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate schematically an example of a part of the process for making the result of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

This first etching step is a non-selective etching, that is to say that the layers of the stack <b>10</b>, here the layers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, are etched substantially at the same speed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first etching step is, for example, configured to be stopped so that the floor of the cavity is located in only one layer of the stack <b>10</b>, for example in a layer <b>8</b>, preferably in the layer <b>8</b><sub>1</sub>. As a result of the etching process, the floor of the cavity is not, at this stage, flat. The obtained cavity comprises trenches <b>32</b> in a peripheral area of the floor of the cavity <b>30</b>. Preferably, the trenches <b>32</b> do not reach the portion <b>24</b>. For instance, during this etching step, 60 to 95% of the thickness of the stack <b>10</b> is removed. In addition, the central part of the floor of the cavity is not flat.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The mask <b>20</b> has been partially etched by the first etching. The thickness of the mask <b>20</b> after the first etching is thus less than that of the mask <b>20</b> as deposited.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">This etching could be used alone to form a cavity, the etching time being set so as to come as close as possible to the layer <b>4</b> without etching the same. A drawback would be that the etching of the stack <b>10</b> would be performed faster in a peripheral area of the cavity than in a central area of the cavity. Thus, at the conclusion of the etching, the peripheral area of the cavity would be deeper than its central area and would comprise trenches (like those shown at reference <b>32</b>). This is a phenomenon generally referred to as &#x201c;trenching&#x201d;. The floor of the cavity would, by contrast, be substantially flat in the central area of the cavity. For instance, for a cavity having a central area with a depth of approximately 8 &#x3bc;m, the peripheral area could have an additional depth of approximately 400 nm with respect to the central area. With the etching being interrupted before the cavity reaches the layer <b>4</b> in its peripheral area, the floor of the cavity will be relatively far away from the layer <b>4</b> in the central area of the cavity.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a partial and schematic sectional view illustrating the result of a further phase of an embodiment of a method for forming a cavity.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">During this phase, a second etching is performed to produce a second portion of the cavity <b>30</b>. The second etching is a selective etching of the material of the layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>with respect to the material of the portion <b>24</b>. For example, during this second etching, the material of the layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>is etched between 8 and 10 times faster than the material of the portion <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The second etching is sustained until the portion of the layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>located at the floor of the cavity <b>30</b> is etched and the portion <b>24</b> forms the floor of the cavity. More specifically, the portion of the layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>located between the trenches <b>32</b> is etched. The floor of the cavity <b>30</b> is thus substantially flat. The portion <b>24</b> can be partially etched by the second etching step, some parts of the layer <b>8</b><sub>1 </sub>being etched more quickly than others. By means of the excess thickness of the portion <b>24</b>, it is possible to ensure that the second etching does not reach the layer <b>4</b>, the etching of which is not desired. This is all the more important in cases where, as in this example, the layer <b>4</b> is made of the same material as the layer <b>8</b><sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As a variant, the first etching described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> can be stopped in a layer other than the layer <b>8</b><sub>1</sub>, for example a further layer <b>8</b>.

The third etching is a selective etching of the material of the portion <b>24</b> with respect to the material of the layer beneath the stack, here the layer <b>4</b>. The third etching is sustained during a relatively short period of time and makes it possible to etch the part of the portion <b>24</b> located at the floor of the cavity <b>30</b> in a substantially plane manner until the layer <b>4</b> is reached.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The layer <b>4</b> is not etched by the third etching. Indeed, the portion <b>24</b> has a substantially constant thickness and is etched at substantially the same speed at every point.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The third etching does not etch the portion <b>24</b> entirely, and parts <b>50</b> of the portion <b>24</b>, having an excess thickness, remain after the third etching. These parts <b>50</b> are located at the walls of the cavity <b>30</b> and form a part of the walls of the cavity <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Another possibility would be to provide an etching method comprising the successive etching of the layers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> by selective etching methods, i.e., suitable for successively etching each layer of the stack in a selective manner with respect to the material of the underlying layer, for example for etching each layer <b>6</b> in a selective manner with respect to the material of the underlying layer <b>8</b>, and each layer <b>8</b> in a selective manner with respect to the material of the underlying layer <b>6</b>. Selective etching should be understood as an etching method that is adapted to selectively etch a first material with respect to a second material, i.e., adapted to etch the first material at least twice as fast as the second material, preferably at least three times as fast. This method has the advantage of reducing the magnitude of the trenching phenomenon, but has the drawback that it is slow and expensive.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">An advantage of the described embodiments is that they make it possible to form a cavity with substantial dimensions and with a substantially flat floor.
