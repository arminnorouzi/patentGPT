Further, among the various non-contrast enhanced imaging methods, a Time-SLIP (time-spatial labeling inversion pulse) method is known as an imaging method in which an RF pulse (for example, an inversion pulse) is applied prior to data acquisition to control depiction of blood flow. The Time-SLIP method is an imaging method that can clearly depict or visualize the blood flow of a target blood vessel with high contrast, while suppressing the background of the imaging region. By using the Time-SLIP method, not only blood flowing through arteries or veins but also fluid such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be imaged.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, ECG (electrocardiogram) gating and respiratory gating are used to suppress body-motion artifacts caused by body motions due to heartbeat and/or respiration. The ECG gating is an imaging method in which data (i.e., MR signals) are acquired within a predetermined period of a desired cardiac time phase, in synchronization with an ECG signal, for example, an R-wave. On the other hand, the respiratory gating is an imaging method in which data are acquired within a predetermined period of a predetermined time phase during expiration in a cycle consisting of inspiration and expiration, in synchronization with the respiratory signal indicating the respiratory motion detected by a respiratory sensor, for example.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional MRI apparatus, the Time-SLIP method has been used in combination with the ECG gating and/or respiratory gating to suppress body motion artifacts. When the Time-SLIP method and gating imaging, such as ECG gating and respiratory gating, are used in combination, the total imaging time tend to be long.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the accompanying drawings:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a configuration diagram illustrating overall configuration of the MRI apparatus of the present embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration related to setting of pulse-sequence in the MRI apparatus of the present embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating the concept of the Time-SLIP method;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating the concept of the Time-SLIP method;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> are sequence diagrams illustrating a conventional Time-SLIP pulse sequence using actual gating (respiratory gating and/or ECG gating);</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating processing to be executed by the MRI apparatus according to the present embodiment;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating Cartesian sampling;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating two-dimensional radial sampling;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating three-dimensional radial sampling;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating processing related to execution of a Time-SLIP pulse sequence using virtual gating;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> are sequence diagrams of a Time-SLIP pulse sequence using virtual gating;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a concept for determining a waiting time;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams showing that a recovery time of longitudinal magnetization differs depending on magnitude of the flip angle;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref> are timing charts illustrating comparison of imaging time between virtual gating according to the present embodiment and conventional respiratory gating; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating comparison of imaging time between virtual gating according to the present embodiment and conventional respiratory gating.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereinafter, an MRI apparatus <b>1</b> of the present embodiment will be described by referring to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, an MRI apparatus includes: a scanner that includes a static magnetic field magnet configured to generate a static magnetic field, a gradient coil configured to generate a gradient magnetic field, and a WB (Whole Body) coil configured to apply an RF pulse to an object; and processing circuitry.

When the imaging site of the object is a chest or an abdomen, body-motion artifacts are likely to occur because the body motions due to respiration and heartbeat are large. Contrastively, when the imaging site is a part away from the chest and abdomen such as a head and inferior limb, body-motion artifacts are less likely to occur because such a part is less susceptible to the body motions due to respiration or heartbeat.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">From the above viewpoint, the MRI apparatus <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is configured to select either of actual gating (such as respiratory gating and ECG gating) or virtual gating (without using actual gating) for executing a pulse sequence, depending on the sampling method of k-space data and/or the imaging site of the object (or, the imaging site of the patient).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating processing of the MRI apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the step ST<b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the imaging conditions or the imaging sequence are set by the user-interface control function F<b>01</b> and the imaging sequence setting function F<b>02</b>.

For example, even when the transverse relaxation time is moderate, such as T2=40 to 80 ms, if the flip angle &#x3b1; is smaller than, for example, 5&#xb0;, the waiting time WT is determined to be a relatively small value of 10 ms or less, for example, WT=5 to 10 ms.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">Meanwhile, as shown in the step S<b>4</b>, when the transverse relaxation time T2 of the imaging target tissue is relatively long, for example, when the imaging target tissue is the synovial fluid or the CSF, the transverse relaxation time T2 shows a relatively long value such as T2=200 to 1000 ms. In such a case, the waiting time WT also must be determined to be a relatively long value.
