As is well known, the vomer in this case also occurs in a bent or twisted state. If such an abnormal development or position of a cleft lip, jaw and palate remains untreated, an obstruction of the nasal airways can occur, meaning that those affected can only breathe on one side or live with a significant respiratory deficit or have to undergo surgery to correct the nasal impairment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A cleft lip, jaw and palate is usually present when there is a continuous cleft in the upper lip, maxilla, and palate. In this application, however, the term cleft lip, jaw and palate should also be used for forms of cleft in which, for example, only one or two of these structures are affected. Examples of this are cleft lip, cleft lip and jaw or cleft palate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Devices and methods for treating the misalignments that occur in a cleft lip, jaw and palate are known in the prior art. These procedures aim to move or displace the position of the premaxilla of the infant and vomer in the first few days after birth of an infant with cleft lip, jaw and palate by using a palatal plate without surgery. Generally, such treatment with the palatal plate occurs in the first few days of the infant. That is because just a few days after birth, the maxilla of the infant begins to grow together and just a few weeks after birth, it is almost impossible to displace the premaxilla and vomer with a palatal plate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The plate according to Hotz (T. Fuchigami et al., Comparison of short-term effects of presurgical nasoalveolar molding and Hotz's plate on maxillary arch form in unilateral cleft lip and palate, Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medicine, and Pathology, Volume 31, Issue 1, January 2019, pages 25-30) is known, for example, as such a removable palatal plate. This custom-made plate can be placed in the oral cavity of the infant during the first few days of life to control the growth of the maxillary segments. With the Hotz plate inserted, the mandible of the infant is taken out of the resting position, so that a therapeutic muscle imbalance is created. Growth stimuli or growth blockages can be stimulated in a targeted manner depending on the design of the plate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another known example from the prior art is the method of nasoalveolar molding (NAM) according to Grayson (Grayson B H, Shetye P R, Presurgical nasoalveolar moulding treatment in cleft lip and palate patients, Indian J Plast. Surg., October 2009, 42 Suppl., p. 56-p. 61). In this method, a removable palatal plate is custom-made based on an impression of the maxilla of the infant. Inserting the NAM palatal plate in the oral cavity of the infant reduces misalignments of the premaxilla through the application of force. In addition, the Grayson palatal plate has extraorally protruding supports, which, in addition to the correction of the premaxilla, also enable a correction of nasal cartilage deformities. This allows additional bending of the vomer. However, correcting or straightening the shape of the vomer is not possible when treated with a NAM palatal plate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, it has been shown that treatment with the known palatal plates can indeed reduce the misalignment of the premaxilla of an infant with a cleft lip, jaw and palate, however, a straightening of the vomer or an avoidance of the curvature of the vomer is not achieved, or at least not always to a sufficient extent.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore the object of the present invention to develop an orthodontic appliance for treating a cleft lip, jaw and palate that can improve the quality of life of the patient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is achieved by a plate for insertion into the palate and by a method for producing a plate for insertion into the palate according to the independent claims and by a set of plates for sequentially straightening the vomer of an infant with cleft lip, jaw and palate. Specific embodiments are described in the description, in the subclaims and in the figures.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The plate proposed here for insertion into the palate has wings on both sides of an imaginary center plane running perpendicular to the plate, the wings being designed such that they bear against the palate at least in regions. The wings cause the plate to be insertable in a specific position in the palate of the infant. In addition, the wings of the proposed plate promote a tight fit of the plate in the palate of the infant when the plate is inserted into the palate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the plate proposed here comprises at least two webs running at least in sections on both sides of the center plane, so that a free space running between the webs is formed for receiving the vomer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The plate proposed here for insertion into the palate is based on the insight that straightening a curved vomer or avoiding a curvature of an uncurved vomer when treating a cleft lip, jaw and palate with a palate plate can prevent consequential damage, being able to significantly reduce the breathing difficulties of the patient in the nasal region.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The two webs of the proposed plate run at least in sections on both sides of the center plane such that they form a free space between them for receiving the vomer. When inserting the plate into the palate, the vomer is received into the free space and caught between the two webs. The shape of the plate is adapted to the palate of the infant such that the plate is supported on the palate in particular by the wings and is fixed to the palate in a plurality of directions. For example, the plurality of directions can comprise at least one direction along the center plane of the plate and at least one direction transverse to the center plane. The free space defines a displacement in the course of the vomer and is suitable for receiving a vomer. The center plane of the plate can correspond to the sagittal plane of the palate when the plate is inserted into the palate. Due to the firm fit of the plate on the palate and an offset of the course of the webs to the current course of the vomer, a new course can be imposed on the shape of the course of the vomer enclosed in the free space by means of a therapeutic force. The therapeutic force is considered to be the force exerted by the proposed plate on components of the palate of the infant, such as the vomer or premaxilla, or both, when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">During treatment with the proposed plate, a change in the course of the vomer can be achieved by a therapeutic force in which the course of the webs of the plate deviate at least in sections from the course of the vomer when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant and the webs displace the vomer at least in regions, that is, the therapeutic force. The course of the vomer can be displaced, for example, if the free space on a first side of the vomer transverse to the center plane is smaller than the free space on a side of the vomer opposite the first side transverse to the center plane. As a result, as the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant, the vomer is forced toward the side of the vomer having more free space, that is, displaced. In particular, a displacement of the course of the vomer can be provided, in which the free space is formed at least in sections only on the second side of the vomer transverse to the center plane. The webs can have a curvature adapted to the vomer. The curvature of the webs can be less pronounced compared to the curvature of the vomer, for example. Particular advantages result from the fact that the webs can reduce the curvature of the vomer through the therapeutic force. The direction of the therapeutic force can be selected through the shape and arrangement of the webs such that an individual misalignment of the vomer can be specifically reduced and additionally or alternatively corrected. As a result, a targeted change in the course of the vomer and a targeted straightening of a curved vomer are made possible by the proposed plate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The webs of the proposed plate can be designed to run in a straight line along the center plane and additionally or alternatively to run next to one another along the center plane. Webs running next to one another in a straight line and additionally or alternatively along the center plane are particularly advantageous in exerting a therapeutic force on the vomer until the course of the vomer corresponds to the course of the free space running between the webs.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It can be provided that an initial state of the course of the vomer and additionally or alternatively a desired final state of the course of the vomer are defined and the course of the vomer is changed gradually by successive treatment with a plurality of proposed plates. The initial state of the course of the vomer can correspond to the initial course of the vomer of the infant with cleft lip, jaw and palate prior to treatment with the plurality of proposed plates. A free space of a first plate of the plurality of proposed plates defined by a course of the webs can cause a first displacement of the course of the vomer in the initial state when the first plate is inserted into the palate of the infant. The course of the webs of the first plate has a first offset with respect to the course of the vomer in the initial state. After the course of the webs of the first plate has been forced onto the course of the vomer, the first plate of the plurality of proposed plates can be replaced with a second plate of the plurality of proposed plates. The second plate of the plurality of proposed plates can cause a second displacement of the course of the vomer when the second plate is inserted into the palate of the infant through a free space defined by a course of the webs of the second plate. The course of the webs of the second plate has a second offset with respect to the course of the vomer in the initial state, the second offset being greater than the first offset. The second plate can also be replaced by further plate with a further displacement in the course of the vomer. The plates can be successively exchanged until the last plate of the plurality of proposed plates is inserted, the last plate of the plurality of proposed plates having a course of the webs which corresponds to the desired end state of the course of the vomer, so that the course of the desired final state can be imposed on the vomer by means of the last plate. By gradually changing the course of the vomer per plate, smaller displacements of the vomer can be made and thus pain for the infant can be reduced by the treatment using a respective plate. In addition, the potential displacement of the course of the vomer by only one plate is limited to a maximum displacement. Successive treatment with a plurality of plates can overcome the maximum displacement of a single plate and achieve a greater total displacement.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, the course of the vomer can be maintained by a course of the webs adapted to the course of the vomer. This is useful, for example, if the course of the vomer is already in the desired shape and should be kept in this shape.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The wings of the proposed plate running on both sides of the imaginary center plane perpendicular to the plate, which are configured such that they bear at least in regions against the palate, can be designed in particular to fix the plate in the palate of the infant. Due to their shape, the wings with their upper sides can conform to the palate of the infant, at least in regions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the wings can be designed such that upon insertion of the plate into the palate, they each contact a lateral maxillary segment of the infant. That is, the upper sides of the wings can be configured to contact maxillary, that is, cranial, with the mandibular, that is, caudally, directed surfaces of the lateral maxillary segments. Furthermore, the upper sides of the wings and additionally or alternatively the shape of the wings can be designed to fit, preferably with a precise fit, to the surface of the maxillary segments. This has the advantage that the hold of the plate on the maxilla of the infant can be supported when inserting the plate and that the appropriate shape of the wings improves the wearing comfort of the infant.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Typically, the plate can be made in one piece and additionally or alternatively consist of plastic. Examples are polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and/or synthetic resin.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the plate can have a receptacle for receiving the premaxilla, the receptacle comprising at least one trough-like depression. The receptacle can preferably serve to receive the premaxilla of the infant and reduce misalignment of the premaxilla of the infant. The trough-like depression is designed such that the premaxilla of the infant is arranged in the trough-like depression when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It can be provided that the shape and arrangement of the trough-like depression is selected such that the trough-like depression has an offset with respect to the center plane of the plate, so that a therapeutic force can be exerted on the premaxilla of the infant through the trough-like depression when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant. The shape and arrangement of the trough-like depression can be selected such that an individual misalignment of the premaxilla can be reduced in a targeted manner and additionally or alternatively corrected by the therapeutic force.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The trough-like depression can be so pronounced that the shape and arrangement of the trough-like depression corresponds to the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla. This is useful, for example, if the current shape and arrangement of the premaxilla already corresponds to the desired shape and arrangement and should be kept in said shape and arrangement.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Depending on the shape and arrangement of the trough-like depression and the course of the webs, various misalignments of the vomer and premaxilla can be treated in a targeted manner by means of the proposed plate. A proposed plate having, for example, an offset of the trough-like depression to the center plane of the plate and an offset of the course of the webs to the center plane of the plate can simultaneously change the course of the vomer and the arrangement of the premaxilla when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant. Provision can also be made for the proposed plate to only have an offset in the course of the webs with respect to the center plane, as a result of which only a displacement in the course of the vomer is brought about. In this case, the trough-like depression can be arranged without offset to the center plane or can correspond to the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla. This can prevent displacement of the premaxilla by the trough-like depression while allowing displacement of the course of the vomer when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant. In an analogous manner, the plate can have a course of the webs without offset to the center plane or a course of the webs corresponding to the course of the vomer, and an offset of the trough-like depression to the center plane of the plate. It is thus possible to maintain the course of the vomer and change the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla. This makes it possible to treat a plurality of misalignments in the maxilla of the infant by means of the proposed plate.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the receptacle can be arranged on an end of one of the webs or both webs running in a direction along the center plane. One of the two webs can be rounded off at said end. Preferably, the end of this web can be designed such that it is adapted to the respective anatomical condition of the palate, such as the nasal concha. However, both webs can also be rounded off at said ends. Both webs can preferably be designed at these ends such that the respective end is adapted to the respective anatomical condition of the palate, such as the nasal concha. The ends of the webs running in the direction along the center plane can merge directly into the receptacle or have a spacing from the receptacle. The transition between the ends of the webs running along the center plane and the receptacle can preferably be designed such that the transition is adapted to the respective anatomical condition of the palate, such as the nasal concha, for example. Such adaptations to the web or the transition of the webs to the receptacle can improve the fit of the plate to the palate of the infant and reduce pain in the infant when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The trough-like depression can be formed such that an inner surface of the trough-like depression circumferentially surrounds the premaxilla when the plate is inserted into the palate. Typically, the end of one of the webs running along the center plane can point forward in the direction of the body, that is, in anterior, when the plate is inserted into the palate. Such an arrangement of the receptacle in the plate offers the advantage that the receptacle and thus the trough-like depression can be arranged at the level of the premaxilla when the plate is inserted into the palate. Furthermore, circumferentially surrounding the premaxilla by the trough-like depression enables the premaxilla to be held in a particularly advantageous manner when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant. In addition, the premaxilla can be prevented from slipping out of the trough-like depression.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, it can be provided that a maximum width, determined transversely to the center plane, of a receiving region of the plate containing the receptacle is at most 80 percent, preferably at most 70 percent, particularly preferably at most 60 percent of a maximum width of the plate determined transversely to the center plane. The maximum width of the plate can be, for example, at most 8 cm, preferably at most 6 cm, particularly preferably at most 5 cm. A reduced width of the plate in the region of the receiving region is advantageous in that the position of the premaxilla can be changed by the plate independently of the front regions of the lateral jaw segments when the plate is inserted into the palate. However, it can also be provided that the plates are designed such that the lateral segments can be moved independently of the premaxilla when the plate is inserted into the palate. For example, displacements of the lateral segments can be simulated independently of the vomer by means of a digital or analog model operation. In the model operation, the lateral segments can be relocated individually, in particular such that the position of the lateral segments relative to one another can be adjusted for optimal insertion of the premaxilla. By individually adjusting the lateral segments, misalignments in the palate of the infant can be corrected or at least reduced better and, above all, in a more targeted manner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further embodiment, the wings can have a contact surface of the plate with the palate. The webs can protrude on one side of the plate so that they are raised above the contact surface. The contact surface can typically extend across the upper side of the wings. The webs can preferably protrude cranially from the contact surface. The webs can, for example, protrude cranially in a step-like manner from the contact surface. The contact surface can prevent the webs from extending too far cranially into the nasal region of the infant. This is because webs that extend too far cranially can block the nasal airways of the infant and pose a serious risk of death for the infant through suffocation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a further embodiment, a height of the webs, determined perpendicularly to the contact surface and starting from the contact surface, can be at least 0.4 cm, preferably at least 0.8 cm, particularly preferably at least 1.2 cm and additionally or alternatively at most 2 cm, preferably at most 1.8 cm, particularly preferably at most 1.5 cm. Alternatively, the height of the webs along the center plane can change by at most 50 percent, preferably by at most 30 percent, particularly preferably by at most 10 percent of a minimum or a maximum height of the webs. A maximum height of a first web can deviate, for example, by at most 50 percent, preferably by at most 30 percent, particularly preferably by at most 10 percent, from a maximum height of a second web. Alternatively or additionally, the height of the webs can be at least three times, preferably at least twice, particularly preferably at least once, a minimum width of the webs determined transversely to the center plane. Webs that are too low can, for example, mean that the vomer cannot be supported laterally to a sufficient extent, so that a curvature or, respectively, a straightening of the vomer cannot be prevented or, respectively, cannot take place. Webs that do not exceed a maximum height can avoid obstruction of the nasal airway and serious hazard to the infant from suffocation when the plate is inserted into the palate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further embodiment, the webs can be spaced apart from one another transversely to the center plane, wherein a minimum spacing of the webs from one another can be at least 0.3 cm, preferably at least 0.5 cm, particularly preferably at least 0.7 cm and/or at most 2 cm, preferably at most 1.5 cm, particularly preferably at most 1 cm. Alternatively, the spacing of the webs from one another along the center plane can change by less than twice, preferably by less than once, particularly preferably by less than half the minimum spacing of the webs. Typically, a minimum spacing of the webs from one another can be provided to allow the vomer to fit in the free space running between the webs when the plate is inserted into the palate.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternatively, the webs can each have a specific length along the center plane and a specific width transverse to the center plane, wherein the length of each web can be at least twice, preferably at least three times, particularly preferably at least four times its width. Furthermore, it can be provided that the width of each web changes by less than twice, preferably by less than once, particularly preferably by less than half the minimum width of the webs.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further embodiment, the wings can be arranged on sides of the webs facing away from the center plane. For example, the wings can be designed such that they reach up to the webs. Wings that reach up to the webs offer the advantage, for example, for the plate to have a high degree of stability. This allows the plate to withstand forces applied when the plate is inserted without breaking.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, a maximum length of the wings determined along the center plane can be at most 100 percent, preferably at most 90 percent, particularly preferably at most 80 percent of a length of one of the webs or alternatively all webs determined along the center plane. By limiting the length of the wings, the lateral jaw segments can be left out of the plate at least in regions. This allows the premaxilla to be displaced independently of the lateral jaw segments or the lateral jaw segments to be displaced independently of the premaxilla through use of the plate.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The maximum length of the wings can define a longitudinal section aligned along the center plane. In the longitudinal section, a maximum width of the plate determined transversely to the center plane can be reduced by at least 40 percent, preferably by at least 50 percent, particularly preferably by at least 60 percent, wherein a length of the longitudinal section determined along the center plane can be at most 25 percent, preferably at most 15 percent, particularly preferably at most ten percent of a maximum length of the plate determined along the center plane.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further embodiment, the plate can comprise a holding device for clamping a tensioning device for applying force to the plate along the center plane, wherein the holding device can be arranged on an end of the receptacle facing away from the webs and running in a direction along the center plane. For example, the holding device can protrude anteriorly from the receptacle when the plate is inserted into the palate. The tensioning device can be coupled to the plate at the holding device. A force can be transmitted to the plate via the holding device via a tensile stress of the tensioning device. Typically, the tensile stress or force transfer can be applied posteriorly when the plate is inserted into the palate. However, the effects of force can also be provided in anterior. In addition, however, a myofunctional force exerted by the tongue of the infant on the plate can also be taken into account and utilized when the plate is placed in the palate of the infant. Examples of a tensioning device can be rubber bands or springs. For example, the force can be transmitted as a therapeutic force to the vomer and additionally or alternatively to the premaxilla. This allows the vomer and additionally or alternatively the premaxilla to be displaced along the center plane through use of the plate. In this way, any misalignments of the premaxilla and the vomer that occur can be corrected and rectified in anterior or in posterior. The corrective effect of the inserted plate can be promoted here by the myofunctional force exerted by the tongue of the infant on the plate. In addition, therapeutic force can be applied to one or both of the lateral jaw segments to correct the position of the lateral jaw segment(s).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The holding device can have, for example, two fixing projections which protrude anteriorly when the plate is inserted into the palate. The fixing projections can be arranged on both sides of the center plane, for example. The arrangement of the fixation projections can affect the direction of the therapeutic force transverse to the center plane. This enables further adjustability of the therapeutic force, which means, for example, that the lateral jaw segments can be shifted more individually when the plate is inserted into the palate.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A set of plates for sequentially straightening the vomer of an infant with cleft lip, jaw and palate is further proposed. The set of plates can help treat misalignments of the vomer successively. The courses of the webs of the plates of the set of plates can have different offsets with respect to a course of the webs of a first plate of the set of plates. The respective offset of the course of the webs with respect to the course of the webs of the first plate can increase with each further plate, so that a therapeutic force of each subsequent plate gradually changes the course of the vomer.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The set of plates comprises at least a first plate described above and a second plate described above, a first spatial course of the webs of the first plate in a direction along the center plane of the first plate differing from a second course of the webs of the second plate in a direction along the center plane of the second plate. Different courses of the webs of the plates of the set of plates can bring about different therapeutic forces when the respective plate is inserted into the palate. This allows the vomer to be sequentially straightened by using the first plate and then replacing the first plate with the second plate. It can be seen that further plates for the sequential straightening of the vomer with different courses of the webs of the respective plate can be provided to reduce a misalignment of the vomer. With the sequential use of a set of plates having a plurality of plates, it can be provided that a spacing between the webs and thus the free space for receiving the vomer of the respective plate increases with each subsequent plate. This offers the advantage that the increasing volume of the vomer of the infant as the infant grows can be taken into account with each successive plate of the set of plates. In addition, misalignments of the premaxilla and the lateral jaw segments can also be corrected or at least reduced by the set of plates.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, the webs of the first plate can comprise a first and a second web. The webs of the second plate can comprise a first web and a second web. Each of the webs can have a first end running in a direction along the center plane and a second end opposite the first end. The first end of the first web of the first plate can be arranged offset by a first transverse offset transverse to the center plane of the first plate with respect to the second end of the first web of the first plate. The first end of the second web of the first plate can be arranged offset by a second transverse offset transverse to the center plane of the first plate with respect to the second end of the second web of the first plate. The first end of the first web of the second plate can be arranged offset by a third transverse offset transverse to the center plane of the second plate with respect to the second end of the first web of the second plate. The first end of the second web of the second plate can be arranged offset by a fourth transverse offset transverse to the center plane of the second plate with respect to the second end of the second web of the second plate. The first transverse offset can be at least 30 percent, preferably at least ten percent, particularly preferably at least five percent smaller than the third transverse offset. Additionally or alternatively, the second transverse offset can be at least 20 percent, preferably at least ten percent, particularly preferably at least five percent smaller than the fourth transverse offset. Additionally or alternatively, the first end of the first web of the first plate can be arranged offset by a first longitudinal offset along a direction parallel to the center plane of the first plate with respect to the second end of the first web of the first plate. The first end of the second web of the first plate can be arranged offset by a second longitudinal offset along a direction parallel to the center plane of the first plate with respect to the second end of the second web of the first plate. The first end of the first web of the second plate can be arranged offset by a third longitudinal offset along a direction parallel to the center plane of the second plate with respect to the second end of the first web of the second plate. The first end of the second web of the second plate can be arranged offset by a fourth longitudinal offset along a direction parallel to the center plane of the second plate with respect to the second end of the second web of the second plate. The first longitudinal offset can be at least 15 percent, preferably at least ten percent, particularly preferably at least five percent smaller than the third longitudinal offset. Additionally or alternatively, the second longitudinal offset can be at least 15 percent, preferably at least ten percent, particularly preferably at least five percent smaller than the fourth longitudinal offset.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The longitudinal offset or the transverse offset enables a targeted reduction of the misalignment of the premaxilla. Typically, this makes it possible to displace the premaxilla along the center plane and additionally or alternatively along the plane orthogonal to the center plane. The targeted reduction per plate can usually be at most 0.3 cm, preferably at most 0.2 cm, particularly preferably at most 0.1 cm and additionally or alternatively at least 0.05 cm.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further proposed is a method for producing a plate for insertion into the palate of an infant with a cleft lip, jaw and palate for straightening the vomer of the infant, comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0042">making and measuring an impression of the maxilla of the infant for determining a spatial arrangement of the vomer, the premaxilla and the two lateral maxillary segments of the infant relative to one another,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0043">determining a transverse vomer misalignment of the end of the vomer directed toward the premaxilla, determined transversely to the sagittal plane of the infant, and additionally or alternatively</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0044">determining a vomer longitudinal misalignment of the end of the vomer directed toward the premaxilla, determined along the sagittal plane of the infant, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0045">producing a previously described plate,<br/>the webs of the plate being designed as a first web and as a second web, each having a first end running in one direction along the center plane and a second end opposite the first end such that</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0046">(i) the first end of the first web is arranged offset by a first transverse offset determined transversely to the center plane of the plate with respect to the second end of the first web and that the first end of the second web is arranged offset by a second transverse offset determined to the center plane of the plate with respect to the second end of the second web,<br/>the first transverse offset and the second transverse offset each being selected depending on the previously determined vomer transverse misalignment; and additionally or alternatively</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0047">(ii) the first end of the first web being arranged offset by a first longitudinal offset determined along a direction parallel to the center plane of the plate with respect to the second end of the first web and the first end of the second web being arranged offset by second longitudinal offset determined along a direction parallel to the center plane of the plate with respect to the second end of the second web,<br/>the first longitudinal offset and the second longitudinal offset each being selected depending on the previously determined vomer longitudinal misalignment.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">Typically, in the method of production, prior to production of the plate, an impression of the maxilla of the infant is first made.

By sequentially using the set of plates, the vomer of the infant can be straightened and the vomer of the infant can be prevented from being curved, and the misalignment of the premaxilla of the infant can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an oblique view of a digital impression <b>10</b> of a maxilla of an infant with a cleft lip, jaw and palate. The impression <b>10</b> has a circular outer contour and defines an impression center plane <b>19</b> along its diameter. The impression center plane <b>19</b> corresponds to the sagittal plane of the infant. Two raised lateral maxillary segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, which are each formed in an opposite outer region of the impression <b>10</b>, are depicted running along the impression center plane <b>19</b> on both sides. The vomer <b>13</b> of an infant is depicted between the maxillary segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> as a web-like elevation. A first end of the vomer <b>13</b> depicted is arranged midway between the maxillary segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. Starting from the first end, the vomer <b>13</b> extends along the impression center plane <b>19</b> at an angle of approximately 10 degrees to the impression center plane <b>19</b>. The premaxilla of the infant <b>12</b> is depicted raised at a second end of the vomer <b>13</b> opposite the first end. The premaxilla <b>12</b> is connected to the second end of the vomer <b>13</b> and comprises two spherical formations. The spherical formations are arranged on a side of the premaxilla <b>12</b> facing away from the second end of the vomer <b>13</b>. Furthermore, the premaxilla <b>12</b> extends in a direction at an angle of approximately 30 degrees to the impression center plane <b>19</b>. The premaxilla <b>12</b> and the second end of the vomer <b>13</b> at least in regions surround a first <b>14</b> of the two lateral maxillary segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> at a short spacing. Such a short spacing typically promotes rapid growing together of the premaxilla <b>12</b>, the vomer <b>13</b> and the first maxillary segment <b>14</b>. However, a large spacing from a second maxilla element <b>15</b> opposite the first maxilla element <b>14</b> resulting from this misalignment of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> delays the growing together of the premaxilla <b>12</b>, the vomer <b>13</b> and the second maxillary segment <b>15</b>. Said misalignment usually results in a cleft lip, jaw and palate in the maxilla of the infant. Such a misalignment can be treated with the proposed set of plates.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0062">The spatial arrangement and extent of the misalignment of the premaxilla <b>12</b>, the vomer <b>13</b> and the lateral jaw segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> can be measured by means of an impression <b>10</b> of the maxilla of an infant with a cleft lip, jaw and palate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The points shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be used for the measurements. Said points describe a base point B&#x2032;, a posterior point Vp or a midpoint V of the vomer <b>13</b>, a gingival sulcus point K or K&#x2032; of the first or second maxillary element <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, alveolar gap pole points P<b>1</b> or P<b>1</b>&#x2032;, anterior points of the alveolar crest P and P&#x2032; and an interincial point I of premaxilla <b>12</b>. Subsequently, a vomer transverse misalignment determined transversely to the impression center plane <b>19</b> and a vomer longitudinal misalignment of the end of the vomer <b>13</b> directed towards the premaxilla <b>12</b>, determined along the impression center plane <b>19</b> can be determined. Furthermore, a misalignment of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the lateral jaw segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> can be determined from the impression <b>10</b>. The vomer transverse misalignment and/or the misalignment of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the lateral jaw segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> can be described and determined, for example, by the spacings of the various points illustrated in Table 1 transverse to the impression center plane <b>19</b>. The first impression described in Tables 1 and 2 was taken from the palate of the infant. The remaining impressions are designed by model operations. However, it can also be provided that the individual impressions are each taken from the palate of the infant. The vomer longitudinal misalignment can be determined, for example, by the spacings listed in Table 2 from the base point B&#x2032; to the posterior point Vp of the vomer <b>13</b> along the impression center plane <b>19</b>. The corresponding spacings for seven digital impressions are shown as an example. The specified values are rounded to the decimal place. Depending on the extent of the particular misalignment, a number of plates of the type suggested can be planned and defined to produce a set of plates for sequentially straightening the premaxilla <b>12</b> and vomer <b>13</b> of the infant with cleft lip, jaw and palate and sequentially reducing the misalignment the premaxilla <b>12</b>, the vomer <b>13</b> and the lateral jaw segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the infant.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Spacings of different points of the impressions</entry></row><row><entry>transverse to the center plane of the impression</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Spacing</entry><entry>Spacing</entry><entry>Spacing</entry><entry>Spacing</entry><entry>Spacing</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Vp &#x2212;

The length of the plates of the set of plates can increase, for example, from the first to the second plate in order to encompass the vomer of the infant <b>13</b> over as large an area as possible by the webs <b>3</b>, thereby making it easier to straighten up the vomer of the infant <b>13</b>. For example, beginning with the third plate of the set of plates, the length of the individual plates can progressively decrease from plate to plate, since the vomer of the infant <b>13</b> tends to straighten as the number of plates increases, and less surface area for the webs <b>3</b> to encompass the vomer <b>13</b> may be required. Insertion of the plate into the palate of the infant and comfort for the infant can be improved without affecting the function of the plate by progressively reducing the length of the plates from plate to plate of the set of plates.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Exemplary dimensions of the individual plates</entry></row><row><entry>and their webs of the proposed set of plates</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Length of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>the plate</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(without</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Height of</entry><entry>Width of</entry><entry>Width of</entry><entry>Width of</entry><entry>holding</entry></row><row><entry>Set of</entry><entry>the webs</entry><entry>the first</entry><entry>the second</entry><entry>the plate</entry><entry>device) in</entry></row><row><entry>plates</entry><entry>in cm</entry><entry>web in cm</entry><entry>web in cm</entry><entry>in cm</entry><entry>cm</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>First</entry><entry>0.8</entry><entry>0.9</entry><entry>0.3</entry><entry>4.5</entry><entry>3.5</entry></row><row><entry>plate</entry></row><row><entry>Second</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0.8</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>4.6</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry>plate</entry></row><row><entry>Third</entry><entry>1.2</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>0.8</entry><entry>4.6</entry><entry>3.7</entry></row><row><entry>plate</entry></row><row><entry>Fourth</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>0.8</entry><entry>4.6</entry><entry>3.4</entry></row><row><entry>plate</entry></row><row><entry>Fifth plate</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>0.7</entry><entry>4.6</entry><entry>3.2</entry></row><row><entry>Sixth plate</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>0.7</entry><entry>4.6</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry>Seventh</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>0.7</entry><entry>4.6</entry><entry>2.8</entry></row><row><entry>plate</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">When inserting the plate <b>1</b> into the palate, the vomer <b>13</b> is received into the free space <b>6</b> and caught between the two webs <b>3</b>. The shape of the plate <b>1</b> is adapted to the palate of the infant such that the plate <b>1</b> is supported on the palate in particular by the wings <b>4</b> and is fixed to the palate in a plurality of directions. Due to the firm fit of the plate <b>1</b> on the palate and an offset of the course of the webs <b>3</b> to the current course of the vomer <b>13</b>, a new course can be imposed on the shape of the course of the vomer <b>13</b> enclosed in the free space <b>6</b> by means of a therapeutic force. The therapeutic force is considered to be the force exerted by the proposed plate <b>1</b> on the palate of the infant when the plate <b>1</b> is inserted into the palate of the infant.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">The webs <b>3</b> of the plate <b>1</b> are formed in a straight line along the center plane <b>9</b> and run alongside one another along the center plane <b>9</b>. Webs <b>3</b> running in a straight line and next to one another are particularly advantageous for exerting a therapeutic force on the vomer <b>13</b> until the course of the vomer <b>13</b> corresponds to the course of the webs <b>3</b> running in a straight line and next to one another along the center plane <b>9</b>. A curved course of the vomer <b>13</b> can be straightened by a therapeutic force, or a curve of the unbent vomer <b>13</b> can be prevented by using the plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>3</b>A</figref>. A non-curved vomer <b>13</b> can decisively reduce the occurrence of consequential damage, in particular obstructions to the breathing of the patient in the nasal region.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">Furthermore, the webs <b>3</b> each have a first end pointing in the same direction as the first end of the plate <b>1</b>. A receptacle <b>2</b> having a trough-like depression is arranged on a second end of the webs <b>3</b> opposite the first end of the webs <b>3</b>. The trough-like depression has two spherical bulges and is designed such that an inner surface of the trough-like depression can circumferentially surround the premaxilla <b>12</b> when the plate <b>1</b> is inserted into the palate. A circumferential surrounding of the premaxilla <b>12</b> by the trough-like depression enables the premaxilla to be held in a particularly advantageous manner when the plate is inserted into the palate of the infant. A maximum width, determined transversely to the center plane <b>9</b>, of a receiving region of the plate <b>1</b> containing the receptacle <b>2</b> is 80 percent of a maximum width of the plate <b>1</b>, determined transversely to the center plane <b>9</b>. Due to the shape and arrangement of the receptacle <b>2</b> of the plate <b>1</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the premaxilla <b>12</b> can be arranged in a straight shape and in equal parts on both sides of the central axis <b>9</b> by means of the therapeutic force of the plate <b>1</b>. In addition, the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b> can be maintained by using the plate <b>1</b>. The plate <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> can be a last plate in a set of plates for sequential treatment which can be used for a desired final state of the course of the vomer <b>13</b> and the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">Furthermore, the plate <b>1</b> has two wings <b>4</b> running on both sides of the center plane <b>9</b>, which are designed such that they bear against the palate at least in some regions. With their upper sides, the wings <b>4</b> form a contact surface of the plate <b>1</b> with the palate when the plate <b>1</b> is inserted into the palate. The wings <b>4</b> cause the plate <b>1</b> to be insertable in a specific position in the palate of the infant. In addition, the wings <b>4</b> support a tight fit of the plate <b>1</b> in the palate of the infant when the plate <b>1</b> is inserted into the palate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">The webs <b>3</b> are raised above the contact surface and protrude perpendicularly, that is, cranially, from the contact surface with a height of, for example, 0.8 cm. The contact surface ensures that the webs <b>3</b> do not penetrate too far cranially into the nasal region of the infant, to avoid breathing difficulties for the infant due to the webs <b>3</b> when the plate <b>1</b> is inserted into the palate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">In addition, the wings <b>4</b> are arranged on the sides of the webs <b>3</b> facing away from the center plane <b>9</b>, so that the respective wings <b>4</b> reach up to the respective web <b>3</b>. A maximum length of the wings <b>4</b> determined along the center plane <b>9</b> is 80 percent of a length determined along the center plane <b>9</b>. In addition, the maximum length of the wings <b>4</b> defines a longitudinal section aligned along the center plane <b>9</b>, so that a maximum width of the plate <b>1</b> determined transversely to the center plane <b>9</b> is reduced by 50 percent in the longitudinal section, a length of the longitudinal section determined along the center plane <b>9</b> being 15 percent of a maximum length of the plate <b>1</b> determined along the center plane <b>9</b>. The plate thereby forms a T-shaped structure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">Furthermore, the plate has a holding device <b>5</b> for clamping a tensioning device for the application of force to the plate along the center plane with two fixing projections. The fixing projections are arranged on both sides of the center plane <b>9</b> on an end of the receptacle <b>2</b> facing away from the webs <b>3</b> and running in a direction along the center plane <b>9</b>. The fixing projections protrude from the receptacle <b>2</b> to the front, that is, in anterior.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">When the plate <b>1</b> is inserted into the palate of the infant, the fixing projections usually protrude from the mouth of the infant. Rubber bands can be clamped to the protruding fixing projections in order to generate a force on the plate <b>1</b> along the center plane <b>9</b> in order to displace the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> along the center plane <b>9</b>. Thus, by means of the plate <b>1</b>, misalignments of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> can also be corrected in the anterior and in the posterior and a curvature of the vomer <b>13</b> can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>B</figref> depict in front view an embodiment of a second plate <b>1</b> for insertion into the palate of an infant with cleft lip, jaw and palate for straightening the vomer <b>13</b> of the infant of the proposed set of plates. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows the second plate <b>1</b> in a perspective front view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows the second plate <b>1</b> in a perspective rear view.

The second plate <b>1</b> can cause a first displacement in the course of the vomer <b>13</b> in the initial state and the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b> in the initial state in which the second plate has a first transverse displacement in the course of the webs <b>3</b> and the shape and arrangement of the receptacle <b>2</b> with respect to the course of the vomer <b>13</b> and the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b> in the initial state, and are first inserted into the palate of the infant. After the course of the webs <b>3</b> of the second plate <b>1</b> has been imposed on the course of the vomer <b>13</b> and the shape and arrangement of the receptacle <b>2</b> on the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b>, the second plate <b>1</b> can be exchanged for a further plate <b>1</b> of the set of plates. The further plate <b>1</b> can cause a second displacement of the course of the vomer <b>13</b> and the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b>, in which the further plate <b>1</b> has a second transverse offset of the course of the webs <b>3</b> and the shape and arrangement of the receptacle <b>2</b> with respect to the course of the vomer <b>13</b> and the shape and configuration of the premaxilla <b>12</b> in the initial state, the second transverse offset being greater than the first transverse offset, and being inserted second into the palate of the infant. The further plate <b>1</b> can also be replaced by a new plate <b>1</b> having a further transverse offset of the course of the webs <b>3</b> and the shape and arrangement of the receptacle <b>2</b> with respect to the course of the vomer <b>13</b> and the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b> in the initial state, the further transverse offset being greater than the second transverse offset. The direction of the transverse offsets is represented by a directional arrow <b>8</b>. Such a successive exchange of the plates of the set of plates can take place until the course of the vomer <b>13</b> and the shape and arrangement of the premaxilla <b>12</b> are displaced so far that the last plate <b>1</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> can be inserted and the last treatment step for straightening the vomer <b>13</b> and the premaxilla <b>12</b> can be completed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows in front view a perspective representation of the first plate <b>1</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> with a superimposition of the course of the webs <b>3</b> and the shape and arrangement of the receptacle <b>2</b> of the second plate <b>1</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> of the proposed set of plates represented by a dashed contour.

Analogous to the transverse offsets, however, longitudinal offsets of the courses of the second ends of the webs <b>3</b> and the receptacle <b>2</b> of the second plate <b>1</b> are also possible, transverse offsets with respect to the courses of the second ends of the webs <b>3</b> and the receptacle <b>2</b> of the first plate <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">Typically, the transverse offsets are determined by means of misalignments of the premaxilla <b>12</b>, the vomer <b>13</b> and the lateral jaw segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> calculated from the impression <b>10</b> of the maxilla of the infant with cleft lip, jaw and palate. The transverse offsets are designed such that upon insertion of the second plate <b>1</b> into the palate of the infant, a therapeutic force is exerted by the second plate <b>1</b> on the premaxilla <b>12</b> and vomer <b>13</b> of the infant. This is typically achieved in that the courses of the webs <b>3</b> of the second plate <b>1</b> have a smaller transverse offset than a transverse offset given by a misalignment of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b>. Advantageously, the therapeutic force should be applied in a direction opposite to that indicated by the directional arrow <b>8</b> so that the misalignments of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> can be reduced by the inserted second plate <b>1</b>. By inserting the second plate <b>1</b> into the palate of the infant with a cleft lip and jaw, a force can be applied to the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> until they are displaced such that they are arranged in the shape predetermined by the webs <b>3</b> and the receptacle of the second plate <b>1</b>. The second plate <b>1</b> inserted into the palate can now be exchanged for the first plate <b>1</b> in order to provide renewed force acting on the displaced premaxilla <b>12</b> and the displaced vomer <b>13</b>. The premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> are displaced again by the first plate <b>1</b> inserted into the palate until they have assumed the shape specified by the first plate <b>1</b>. The premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> are then positioned in a position midway between the maxillary segments <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> in a straight line along the center plane <b>9</b>. With such a sequential treatment by the set of plates, the misalignments of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b> can thus be corrected and the curvature of the vomer <b>13</b> can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0078">Depending on the severity of the misalignment, further plates <b>1</b> from the set of plates can be provided which are successively inserted into the palate of the infant and sequentially reduce the misalignment of the premaxilla <b>12</b> and the vomer <b>13</b>.
