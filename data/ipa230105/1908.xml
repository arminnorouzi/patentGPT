Furthermore, the present invention relates to a vehicle comprising an electromechanically drivable brake pressure generator of this kind.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Future drive concepts for automotive vehicles need alternative devices for brake pressure generation, since a negative pressure is no longer available for operation of a conventional vacuum brake booster. The electromechanical brake pressure generators which are under consideration here have been developed for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the case of an electromechanical brake pressure generator of the kind under consideration here, the braking force is generated at the piston-and-cylinder unit with the aid of an electric motor or another suitable electrical drive. Brake pressure generators of this kind may be used not only to provide an auxiliary force but also, in so-called brake-by-wire systems, as the sole way of generating the brake actuation force. For this reason, electromechanical brake pressure generators are particularly advantageous in respect of autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the related art relating to electromechanical brake pressure generators of this kind, when the brake pedal is actuated, the manually effected travel of the pedal is measured by way of an electronic pedal travel sensor, and forwarded to an electronic control device. From this, the electronic control device calculates corresponding trigger signals for an electric drive motor. With the aid of a multi-stage transmission, the motor torque is converted to power assistance for the driver. A hydraulic piston-and-cylinder unit converts the force supplied by this booster into hydraulic pressure for braking. In this arrangement, the electromechanical brake pressure generator provides a braking &#x201c;feel&#x201d; that is comparable with conventional vacuum brake boosters. In this way, with the aid of the electronic control device, software allows the braking feel to be adapted to marque-specific characteristics of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PCT Patent Application No. WO 2017/045804 A1 describes a generic electromechanical brake pressure generator. The brake pressure generator comprises an electric drive motor that is operatively connected to a spindle drive unit by way of a multi-stage spur gear such that rotation of the electric drive motor causes a translational movement of a spindle of the spindle drive unit for the purpose of operating a main brake cylinder. However, in the radial direction relative to the spindle drive unit, the multi-stage spur gear generates a quite considerable spacing with a relatively small transmission ratio, with the result that the overall assembly of this electromechanical brake pressure generator is of quite considerable bulk.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide an electromechanically drivable brake pressure generator that is characterized by space-saving transmission of the electromotive drive power for transfer to the spindle drive unit, and a low-cost construction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object may be achieved by an electromechanically drivable brake pressure generator for a hydraulic brake system of a vehicle, in accordance with the present invention. Advantageous developments and embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. A vehicle having a hydraulic brake system which comprises the electromechanical brake pressure generator according to the present invention is also provided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention includes the technical feature that a drive motor axis and an axis of the spindle drive unit are arranged radially offset from one another, and the piston-and-cylinder unit and the electric drive motor are arranged on axially opposite sides of the gear unit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, the axis of the spindle drive unit is arranged parallel, but radially adjacent to the drive motor axis. An arrangement of this kind provides the structural unit with greater compactness in the axial direction. In contrast to the piston-and-cylinder unit, which is arranged for example in a valve housing, the electric drive motor is provided outside the valve housing. In this case, the gear unit is arranged between the drive motor and the piston-and-cylinder unit, as seen in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The electric drive motor is provided as an external motor, which consequently does not need any space within the valve housing. As a result, the valve housing can be of smaller construction, thus saving on the space occupied and the material of the valve housing, which is typically made from solid material. As a result, an electromechanically drivable brake pressure generator of this kind can be made smaller and at lower cost.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred specific example embodiment of the present invention, the gear unit features a planetary gear which is arranged coaxially in relation to the drive motor axis. A planetary gear has the advantage that it is possible to achieve a high transmission ratio, while the space occupied is reduced because of the high power density. In addition, a planetary gear makes little noise.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Because of the rotational degrees of freedom of the gear elements comprising sun wheel, planet wheel, planet carrier and ring gear, a planetary gear is very versatile in respect of its design and transmission ratio.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further preferred specific example embodiment of the present invention, the planetary gear features a ring gear on the output side, and this cooperates with a spur gear that drives a spindle of the spindle drive unit. Preferably, the ring gear features an external set of teeth, with the aid of which the ring gear engages with the spur gear. There is thus no need for further spur gears. The number of parts is accordingly reduced. It also becomes possible to make a gear unit of this kind more compact.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, planet wheels of the planetary gear are configured as stepped planets. A stepped planet is a planet wheel that features at least two different sets of teeth, with different pitch diameters. In this case, the sets of teeth are arranged on particular portions of the stepped planet. The stepped planet may in this case be made in one part or multiple parts. A planetary gear with stepped planets has the advantage here that the number of parts can thus be reduced. In addition, stepped planets have the advantage that the volume of a gear of this kind is smaller than alternative solutions with a comparable overall transmission ratio.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further advantageous development of the present invention, the planetary gear is configured to have two stages. The two-stage planetary gear has the advantage that in this case the planet carrier can be configured to float, as a result of which the complexity of the bearing is reduced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously, the piston-and-cylinder unit is received in a valve housing opposite which the electric drive motor is mounted. Thus, because of the mounting relative to the valve housing, there is no need to provide any additional option for mounting. For this reason, the electric drive motor and the piston-and-cylinder unit have the same reference point. As a result, there is only negligible relative movement between the two elements. Consequently, wear in the path between the electric drive motor and the piston-and-cylinder unit, resulting from relative movement, is avoided.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further advantageous specific example embodiment of the present invention, the electric drive motor features a motor housing which is secured to the valve housing and on which the planet carrier is secured such that it cannot rotate in relation thereto. Thus, the planet carrier is fixedly connected to the motor housing. Accordingly, there is no need to provide additional securing for the planet carrier. In addition, the motor shaft may be mounted on the motor housing. Thus, the motor housing fulfills a number of functions in addition to receiving the drive motor. As a result of securing the motor housing to the valve housing, the above-described single reference point, and the concomitant advantages, can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a favorable specific example embodiment of the present invention, a motor shaft of the electric drive motor is prolonged to extend into the valve housing, in which a speed sensor is arranged at an opposite axial end to the electric drive motor. The speed sensor is preferably mounted directly on a circuit board. In this case, the speed sensor preferably detects signals of a magnetic element at an axial end face of the motor shaft. Thus, the electronic components may be grouped together and arranged in the region of the electronic control device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Specific example embodiments of the present invention are presented in the figures and explained in more detail in the description below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of an exemplary embodiment of a drive train of an electromechanical brake pressure generator in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of a drive train of an electromechanical brake pressure generator in accordance with the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of an exemplary embodiment of a drive train <b>14</b> of an electromechanical brake pressure generator in accordance with the present invention.
