The bowl <b>8</b> is intended to guide at the outlet of the injection system <b>1</b> a mixing of air and fuel intended to ignite in the primary area of the combustion chamber. The centering member <b>5</b> (or sliding lead-through) consists of an annular part flared upstream in order to facilitate the introduction of the injection head during its mounting. The air intake ring <b>7</b> includes fins (not represented) to impart to the air passing through this ring a gyration movement about a longitudinal axis AA&#x2032; of the mixing device <b>3</b>. This ring comprises a primary gimlet <b>71</b> and a secondary gimlet <b>72</b>. In addition, the mixing device <b>3</b> is equipped with a venturi <b>9</b> in order to accelerate the flow of the fluids at its level.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the head of the injector <b>12</b> comprises an injection nose <b>13</b> through which the fuel is intended to be supplied. The head <b>12</b> is inserted into the mixing device <b>3</b> via the centering member <b>5</b>. Preferably, the head <b>12</b> of the injector is in contact with the inner annular wall <b>10</b> of the mixing device <b>3</b> along a spherical portion <b>11</b> which allows having a swivel connection between the inner annular wall <b>10</b> and the head <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a connection allows authorizing movements of the head <b>12</b> of the injector during the operation of the turbomachine to avoid damaging this area which could lead to breakdowns with negative consequences.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, in operation, relative displacements can be observed between the injector and the mixing device <b>3</b> as well as manufacturing defects. That is to say the spherical portion <b>11</b> of the head of the injector <b>12</b> can move upstream or downstream (along the general direction <b>4</b>).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, such displacements can be problematic:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">If the head <b>12</b> of the injector is shifted downstream, then depending on the case, it is possible that the head <b>12</b> obstructs the primary <b>71</b> and secondary <b>72</b> gimlets and then be detrimental to the volume of air brought into the mixing device <b>3</b>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">If the head <b>12</b> of the injector is shifted upstream then the fuel spray derived from the head <b>12</b> can affect the venturi <b>9</b> and the bowl <b>8</b>. Indeed, the role of the head <b>12</b> of the injector is to generate a mist of fine droplets, if these droplets affect the venturi <b>9</b>, they will run off and be transformed into relatively larger droplets. In addition, the fuel spray angle must not be reduced by the venturi <b>9</b>.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Presentation of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009"

id="p-0020" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an air and fuel injection system <b>21</b> of a turbomachine according to one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">Such an injection system comprises an injector <b>22</b> and a mixing device <b>25</b> disposed downstream of the injector <b>22</b> along a flow direction of the fuel in the injection system.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0031">It is specified here that the upstream and downstream are defined in relation to the flow direction of the fuel (from left to right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">The injector <b>22</b> comprises a fuel supply pipe <b>23</b> ending with an injection nose <b>24</b>. This pipe <b>23</b> is in the extension of an upstream duct and bends with the latter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">The pipe <b>23</b> extends from upstream to downstream along a longitudinal axis AA&#x2032; of the air and fuel injection system. The injector <b>22</b> further comprises an air injection ring <b>26</b>, downstream of the pipe <b>23</b>. The air injection ring <b>26</b> comprises a first gimlet <b>261</b> and a second gimlet <b>262</b>. The ring <b>26</b> surrounds the injection nose <b>24</b>. The first and second gimlets of the air injection ring <b>25</b> comprise air passages disposed all around.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">A bushing <b>28</b> for connecting the injector <b>22</b> to the mixing device <b>25</b> extends from the air injection ring <b>26</b>. This bushing <b>28</b> comprises an annular portion <b>281</b> which is extended by a divergent portion <b>282</b> flared downstream.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">The mixing device <b>25</b> is disposed downstream of the injection nose <b>24</b>. The mixing device <b>25</b> consists in particular of a bowl <b>27</b> comprising an annular inlet <b>30</b> which is extended by a conical portion <b>33</b> flared downstream. The annular inlet <b>30</b> constitutes the inlet of the mixing device</p><p id="p-0027" num="0036">Thus, the mixing device <b>25</b> defines an annular cavity <b>29</b> in which, in operation, the mixing of air and fuel takes place.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0037">In addition, the injector is partly disposed in this annular cavity <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0038">The injector must be in fluid communication with the mixing device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0039">It is through the bushing <b>28</b> of the injector that the injector <b>22</b> is in communication with the mixing device <b>25</b>. The connection bushing <b>28</b> is advantageously disposed around the inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device <b>25</b>. Furthermore, the connection bushing <b>28</b> has an internal diameter greater than that of the inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device <b>25</b> such that this connection bushing <b>28</b> encompasses the inlet of the mixing device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0040">In addition, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this bushing <b>28</b> is flared downstream in order to facilitate the insertion of the mixing device <b>25</b> inlet, at the bowl <b>27</b>, into the connection bushing <b>28</b> during the assembly of the injector to the mixing device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0041">The inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device <b>25</b> comprises an outer surface <b>31</b> which takes the form of a truncated sphere and the bushing <b>28</b> is in contact with the inlet of the bowl via this truncated sphere. The injector and the mixing device have at this contact area a connection that authorizes a relative displacement of the injector relative to the mixing device. Particularly, the injector and the mixing device have at this contact area a swivel connection. As will be understood, compared to the arrangement of the prior art as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, now the sphere is located on the outer surface of the inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device <b>25</b> and the inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device is located downstream of the injection nose <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">As will be seen later, this arrangement allows, during the operation of the injection system, authorizing relative displacements of the injector relative to the mixing device without impact on the operation of the injection system. Indeed, as presented in the introduction during the operation of the turbomachine, the injection system is subjected to very strong movements which are applied to the different elements constituting the injection system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">Advantageously, the injector <b>22</b> comprises a venturi <b>32</b> located axially in the vicinity of the injection nose <b>24</b>. Compared to the arrangement of the prior art, it is noted here that the venturi <b>32</b> forms part of the injector and not of the mixing device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">The venturi <b>32</b> is disposed between the first and second gimlets of the air injection ring <b>26</b> of the injector <b>22</b>. Thus, unlike the arrangement of the prior art as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the injection head is now axially disposed at the venturi <b>32</b> and is closer to the inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device. The mixing is therefore better.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">Advantageously, the duct <b>23</b>, the bushing <b>28</b> and the venturi <b>32</b> are formed in one piece that is to say all the parts constituting them are machined in the same part. These parts can be obtained by an additive manufacturing process and are preferably integrally formed. Also, the air injection ring and the injector connection bushing are formed in one piece, preferably obtained by an additive manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">Preferably, the inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device is located in the air passage of the second gimlet <b>262</b>. Indeed, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the air arriving through the second gimlet <b>262</b> and guided by the venturi will directly arrive into the inlet <b>30</b> of the mixing device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">Thanks to the new arrangement of the elements of the injection system, it is observed that the fact of having the connection authorizing a displacement between the injector and the mixing device limits the area of recirculation at the venturi <b>32</b> and of leakage due to wear (particularly thanks to the swivel connection on the outer surface of the inlet of the mixing device and downstream of the venturi). Now, the leaks will spout into the gimlet.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">Furthermore and advantageously, the injection nose <b>24</b> is arranged relative to the venturi <b>32</b> so as to open the fuel spray angle to the maximum without affecting the venturi <b>32</b> or the bowl <b>27</b> while maintaining a passage section between the nose <b>24</b> and the venturi <b>32</b>. Indeed, when the whole is integrally formed, it is easier to position the different elements relative to each other since in this case there is no relative displacement between the parts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates the fuel spray S derived from the injection nose <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">Furthermore, when the injector moves relative to the mixing device <b>25</b>, the fact that the venturi and the air injection ring are formed with the injector then there are no obstructions at the air injection ring, the operation of the injection system is then not affected by these displacements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrate two cases of displacement of the injector relative to the mixing device. It seen in these figures that the venturi <b>32</b> and the ring move but are not obstructed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">The dimensions of the different elements are fixed according to the margins of displacement to be authorized.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">The injection system <b>22</b> described above is advantageously implemented in a combustion chamber <b>40</b> of a turbomachine as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
