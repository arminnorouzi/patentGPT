In some embodiments, the devices, systems, and methods described herein can be included in or used in conjunction with robotic medical systems configured to facilitate control and operation of the medical instrument.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Endovascular medical procedures are common. During an endovascular procedure, a tool or medical instrument that is generally configured as a long, thin, flexible body is inserted into and navigated through a lumen or other cavity of the body.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some instances, the tools or medical instruments are articulable or controllable, for example, using one or more pull wires, to allow an operator to navigate the tool or medical instrument within the body. Such navigation is often accomplished through deflection (for example, bending) of the distal tip of the tool or medical instrument.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some tools or medical instruments are configured for manual control, for example, using knobs or levers mounted on a proximally located handle of the tool or medical instrument. In other instances, the tools or medical instruments can be configured for robotic control, for example, control by a robotic medical system. In some embodiments, an operator can use the robotic medical system (for example, a controller, user interface, and/or the like) to robotically control the tool or medical instrument.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application describes devices, systems, and methods for controlling endovascular or other intraluminal tools during a medical procedure. In some embodiments, control inputs are provided with respect to a plane of a two-dimensional medical image such as an X-ray. For example, control inputs can be provided to adjust a heading of an instrument within the plane of the medical image, adjust an incline of the instrument into or out of the plane of the medical image, and/or to insert or retract the medical instrument. Providing a control scheme in which control inputs are provided by a user with respect to the plane of the medical image can advantageously facilitate intuitive and natural control of the instrument. In some instances, such a control scheme is referred to herein as &#x201c;image space control&#x201d; because control inputs are provided with respect to the plane of a two-dimensional medical image.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Articulating the instrument, either to adjust the heading of the instrument within the two-dimensional plane of the medical image or to adjust the incline of the instrument into or out of the plane of the medical image, typically requires an accurate understanding of the current roll angle of the instrument about its longitudinal axis. During a medical procedure it can be difficult for a human user controlling the instrument to keep track of or understand the current roll of the instrument, especially as the instrument is navigated through generally tortuous paths, such as luminal networks of the body. In some embodiments, the control scheme described herein allows for determination or estimation of the current roll angle of the instrument based on an appearance of one or more radio-opaque fiducials that are included on the medical instrument, and which are visible within the medical image.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, computer vision can be used to analyze a two-dimensional medical image to determine the position and/or orientation (including, in some examples, current roll) of a catheter based on radio-opaque markers that are included on the catheter. In some instances, five degrees of freedom for the catheter can be determined: two positional degrees of freedom (e.g., x and y position) and three degrees of freedom relating to orientation (e.g., heading, incline, and roll). Various example configurations for the radio-opaque markers are disclosed. The use of other configurations for the radio-opaque markers is also possible, and this disclosure should not be limited to only the disclosed configurations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The devices, systems, and methods described herein can provide several notable advantages over existing technologies. For example, position and orientation can be determined using minimally sophisticated medical imaging (e.g., single plane X-ray). Suitable medical imaging devices are widely available, allowing the devices, systems, and methods described herein to be widely available. Additionally, position and orientation can be determined without the additional hardware that is often required by other systems. For example, existing systems often determine position and orientation using electromagnetic sensors and electromagnetic field generators. Such systems are cumbersome and relatively inaccurate, requiring precise registrations with other forms of data (e.g., medical imaging data, computer models, robotic movement data, etc.) in order to be useful. With the principals described herein, the need for such systems can be avoided. Finally, the devices, systems, and methods of the present application can allow for safer and more precise control of a catheter. This can, in turn, facilitate remote or autonomous control of the catheter. Additionally, the control schemes described herein can facilitate natural and intuitive control of an instrument, allowing the user to provide inputs with respect to the plane of the medical image that the user is currently viewing, and in some cases, without requiring the user to actively consider the current roll of the instrument. These and other benefits and advantages of the application will become more apparent after considering the disclosure and drawings in the Detailed Description section below.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a first aspect, a computer-implemented system comprises at least one processor and at least one electronic storage medium, the electronic storage medium storing instructions configured to cause the at least one processor to: receive, from a medical imaging device, a two-dimensional medical image including a view of at least a distal portion of a medical instrument, the distal portion of the medical instrument including one or more fiducials positioned thereon, the one or more fiducials being radio-opaque and visible in the medical image;

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">This application describes devices, systems, and methods for detecting or determining the position and/or orientation of endovascular or other intraluminal tools or medical instruments, such as catheters. In some instances, the term &#x201c;pose&#x201d; is used herein to refer to the position and orientation of a catheter. In some embodiments, determination of pose can be made based on a two-dimensional medical image, such as a single plane X-ray image, and one or more radio-opaque markers included on a catheter. Computer vision models can be employed to detect the radio-opaque markers in the two-dimensional medical image and to determine the pose of the catheter therefrom. In some instances, the pose can be defined by five degrees of freedom for the catheter. The five degrees of freedom can include two positional degrees of freedom (e.g., x and y position) and three degrees of freedom relating to orientation (e.g., heading, incline, and roll). In other embodiments, the pose can comprise greater (e.g., six) or fewer (e.g., four or fewer) degrees of freedom. The pose of an instrument can be defined in many different ways. While this application primarily describes examples of pose in terms of x, y, and z for position, and heading, incline, and roll for orientation, other methods for describing or defining the pose (e.g., alternative coordinate systems, alternative naming conventions, etc.) are possible, and the principles of this application extend to all methods for defining pose. Further, in some embodiments, the methods and systems of this application may be used to determine one, more than one, or all elements of pose.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">This application also describes devices, systems, and methods for controlling endovascular or other intraluminal tools or medical instruments, such as catheters, wherein control inputs are provided with respect to a plane of a two-dimensional medical image. For example, a user can provide control inputs to change a heading of an instrument within the plane of the medical image and/or to change an incline of the instrument into or out of the plane of the medical image. A computer system can determine appropriate motor commands to cause the desired movement/articulation of the instrument based on the control inputs and an estimate of a current roll of the instrument. The estimate of the current roll of the instrument can be determined based on an appearance of one or more radio-opaque markers or fiducials that are included on a distal end of the image and which are visible within the medical image. In some instances, the estimate of current roll is determined by the system based on a computer vision analysis of the medical image. In some instances, the estimate of the current roll is determined and input by the user based on a user-identified appearance of the fiducials.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">This type of control system is referred to herein as &#x201c;image space control&#x201d; because control inputs are provided with respect to the plane of the image (e.g., adjust heading within the plane or adjust inclination into or out of the plane). This type of control system is intuitive as the user may provide such inputs while viewing the medical image. That is, the user can provide control inputs relative to the current appearance of the instrument within a medical image and without, in some embodiments, needed to specifically understand which pull wires of the instrument need to be actuated to achieve a desired motion.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The principals described herein can be applicable to robotic medical procedures, for example, where the catheter is robotically controlled by a robotic medical system that is configured to insert, retract, roll, and/or articulate the catheter based on inputs received from a physician or in an autonomous or semi-autonomous manner. In some instances the principals of this disclosure may also be applicable to manually controlled catheters.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The principles of this disclosure are described below with primary reference to examples wherein the medical instrument or tool is an endovascular catheter configured to navigate within the vasculature of the patient. These examples, however, should not be construed as limiting of the principles of the disclosure. Those of skill in the art, upon consideration of the principles disclosed herein, will appreciate that the devices, systems, and methods for detecting or determining position and/or orientation described herein have application in other contexts. For examples, the principles described herein can be useful with other endoluminal, endoscopic, or laparoscopic tools, instruments, procedures and/or the like. For ease of illustration, however, a primary example related to an endovascular catheter is provided. Accordingly, it should be realized that any of the following description of an endovascular catheter or catheter may also be applied to other endoluminal, endoscopic, and/or laparoscopic tools or the like. Additionally, it should be realized that while this application provides several example configurations for tools or medical instruments that include specific configurations of radio-opaque markers, other configurations of radio-opaque markers can also be used.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Safe navigation of a catheter within a patient's body generally requires an accurate understanding of the current pose of the catheter. It can be difficult to gain an accurate understanding of pose from a single two-dimensional medical image. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> provides an example X-ray image of a catheter <b>100</b> navigating through an aortic arch of a patient. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> alone, however, a person would have difficulty understanding the exact pose of the catheter <b>100</b>. For example, does the catheter <b>100</b> lie completely within the plane of the image, or is it inclined into or out of the plane of the image? Highly skilled physicians may be able to make educated guesses with respect to these questions based on their understanding of human anatomy. Still, however, uncertainty exists, which increases the risk of damage to the patient during a medical procedure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Perhaps even more critically, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> alone, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for even skilled physicians to determine the current roll angle of the catheter <b>100</b> (i.e., the rotational angle of the catheter about its longitudinal axis). Understanding the current roll of the catheter <b>100</b> can be critical for safe navigation, especially considering how most articulable catheters are controlled. Most articulable catheters include pullwires that can be actuated (e.g., tensioned or pulled) to cause deflection of a distal tip of the catheter. See, for example, the catheter <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> described below. Commonly, catheters include four pullwires, each configured to cause deflection of the catheter in one of four cardinal directions. For example, one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip of the catheter up, one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip down, one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip right, and one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip down. However, in order to know which pullwire to actuate to cause a given deflection requires an understanding of the current roll position of the catheter. For example, if the distal tip of the catheter is rolled by 90 degrees, actuating the pullwire generally associated with an upward deflection of the tip would instead cause the catheter to articulate (possibly unexpectedly) to the right or left. Unintended articulation can frustrate navigation and cause injury to a patient. Moreover, the distal tip of a catheter often rolls (in unexpected ways) as the catheter is navigated through complex anatomy, such as through a vascular network of a patient, even if roll inputs are not provided at the proximal (e.g., external) end of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As will be described in more detail below, the systems, methods, and devices provide for accurate determination of the pose of a catheter (including its roll) based on detection of radio-opaque fiducials included on the catheter. In some embodiments, detection of the radio-opaque fiducials is achieved using computer vision analysis of a two-dimensional medical image of the catheter. The methods and systems described herein can also be used with biplane imaging systems to determine six degree of freedom pose estimates of the catheter. In such cases, determination of incline may (in some instances) be determined from the biplane images, while roll angle can be determined based on computer vision analysis of the radio-opaque fiducials included on the catheter.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> illustrate an example coordinate system for three-dimensional image pose estimation or determination. As noted above, the term &#x201c;pose&#x201d; is used herein to refer to the different combinations of positions and/or orientations of an endovascular tool, intraluminal tool, medical instrument and/or the like. Position can refer to, for example, an x, y, and z position (for example, a location within three-dimensional space). In some embodiments, position can refer to the x and y position within the two-dimensional image plane of a medical image, such as an X-ray. Orientation can be represented in many different ways. In general, in this application, orientation is referred to using three Euler angles: (1) heading, which can be a measure of angulation or articulation about the z-axis and/or where the device is pointing in the image plane; (2) incline, which can be a measure of rotation about the x-axis and/or where the device is pointing out of the image plane (e.g., pitch); and (3) roll which can be a measure of rotation about the longitudinal or central axis of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> provide additional illustrations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> represents two-dimensional position within the x-y plane of the medical image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates the heading angle, measured about the z-axis, which generally corresponds to the apparent heading or direction of the catheter within the x-y plane of the image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates the incline angle, measured about the x-axis, which generally corresponds to a measurement of the angle into or out of the plane of the image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> illustrates the roll of the catheter, measured about the catheter's longitudinal or central axis. The methods and systems described herein are also applicable to determination of one, more than one, or all elements of pose, regardless of the manner in which pose is defined (e.g., regardless of coordinate system, nomenclature, etc.).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As will be further described herein, the use of computer vision algorithms and unique radio-opaque markings or fiducials can be included on the catheter that may be used to quantitatively estimate the endovascular tool's five-dimensional pose (for example, two-dimensional position (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), as well as its heading (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), incline (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), and roll (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). The use of radio-opaque markings can preserve the readily visible dimensions, for example, the position of the endovascular tool on the image plane (the x and y position) and the direction the endovascular tool points in the image plane (the heading), and further, the use of unique radio-opaque markings can further allow the sign of the incline dimension, the degree of incline dimension, and the roll to be quantitatively estimated or determined. While many different radio-opaque materials may be used, in some embodiments, it may be preferable to use platinum, tungsten, and/or gold because of their superior X-ray attenuation properties. In some embodiments, the radio-opaque material may be a piece of wire, metal, radio-opaque ink and/or the like that is place within a layer of the catheter or other tool. Examples are provided below.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a distal end of an embodiment of an endovascular catheter <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the catheter <b>100</b> includes a long, thin, and flexible body <b>101</b> that extends to a distal end <b>103</b>. The body <b>101</b> can be configured to be navigated through the patient's vasculature. In some embodiments, a channel may be formed through the body <b>101</b> such that other tools or instruments can be passed through the catheter <b>100</b> and gain access to the patient's anatomy through an opening that can be included on the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter. In some embodiments, one or more tools can be integrated directly into the catheter <b>100</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">To facilitate navigation, in some embodiments (such as the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), the catheter <b>100</b> or a distal portion thereof can be configured to be articulable or deflectable. To achieve articulation, the catheter <b>100</b> includes one or more pull wires <b>105</b> that extend on, in, or through the body <b>101</b> and attach at or near the distal end <b>103</b>. Actuation (e.g., pulling or shortening) the pull wires <b>105</b> at or near their proximal end can be configured to cause a distal portion of the catheter <b>100</b> to deflect or articulate. Depending on the number and arrangement of pull wires <b>105</b>, the catheter <b>100</b> can be configured for one-way, two-way, three-way, or four-way deflection, although other configurations providing different degrees of articulation or deflection are also possible.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The catheter <b>100</b> can be configured such that control thereof (e.g., control of the deflection of the distal portion of the catheter <b>100</b>) can be accomplished manually or robotically. For example, in some embodiments that are configured for manual control, the body <b>101</b> and pull wires <b>105</b> extend proximally to a handle located on a proximal end of the catheter <b>100</b> (not shown). The handle can be configured to by operated by hand (e.g., manually) to actuate the pull wires <b>105</b>. For example, the handle can include one or more manual inputs such as levers, buttons, dials and/or the like that allow a user to manually actuate the pull wires <b>105</b> to cause deflection of the distal portion of the catheter <b>100</b>. In some robotically controllable embodiments, the body <b>101</b> and pull wires <b>105</b> extend proximally to a base located on a proximal end of the catheter <b>100</b> (not shown). The base can be configured to connect to and be operated by a robotic medical system to actuate the pull wires <b>105</b>. For example, the base can include one or more robotic inputs configured to engage with robotic outputs or actuators on the robotic medical system. In some embodiments, other methods and configurations for manual and robotic control may be used.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> also illustrates that, in some embodiments, the catheter <b>100</b> can include a marker (or fiducial) <b>107</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the marker <b>107</b> is positioned at the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>. The marker <b>107</b> can be configured to facilitate identification of the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> in a medical image captured during a medical procedure. For example, the marker <b>107</b> can be radio-opaque so as to be readily identifiable within a fluoroscopic image. In some embodiments, the marker <b>107</b> comprises a radio-opaque ring positioned on the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>. When the marker <b>107</b> comprises a radio-opaque material, it can be more easily identified within, for example, a fluoroscopic image such as an X-ray. Identification of the distal end <b>103</b> within a medical image during a procedure can greatly facilitate navigation and control of the catheter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> provides an example medical image of a catheter <b>100</b>, such as the catheter <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, navigating within the vasculature of the patient. In particular, the image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a fluoroscopic X-ray image. As shown, both blood vessels <b>109</b> of the patient's vasculature, as well as the catheter <b>100</b> itself, are visible in the image. The marker <b>107</b> included at the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> helps a user (or a computer-vision algorithm) viewing the image to identify the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>. Because the marker <b>107</b> comprises a radio-opaque material, it shows up well within the image.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In general, during an endovascular procedure, a physician or other operator, attempts to guide the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> to a specific location, such as, for example a treatment site. For example, one such procedure is a mechanical thrombectomy. A large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke occurs when a blood clot lodges in at least one of the internal carotid, proximal middle cerebral artery, proximal anterior cerebral artery, basilar artery, or vertebral artery. Such a clot can partially or completely occlude downstream blood supply to brain tissue resulting in neuronal infarction and subsequent neurological impairment or death. During a mechanical thrombectomy, a physician gains access to the patient's vasculature and inserts a catheter, such as catheter <b>100</b>. The catheter <b>100</b> is guided to the obstruction using, for example, one or more medical images similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. Once the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> is positioned near the obstruction, tools are passed through the working channel of the catheter <b>100</b> to remove the obstruction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">While medical images, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, may help the physician guide the catheter <b>100</b> to the treatment site, it is still difficult to fully determine the orientation or pose of the catheter <b>100</b> from the medical image alone. This occurs, for example and among other reasons, because the medical image often provides only a two-dimensional view of the patient's anatomy (e.g., the vasculature) and the catheter <b>100</b>, each of which, in actuality, comprise three-dimensional shapes. In the past (for example, without the systems, methods, and devices described herein), physicians needed to rely on their knowledge of anatomy as well as various other assumptions (such as an assumption that the catheter <b>100</b> is located within the vasculature) to interpret the two-dimensional medical image in a three-dimensional way. While many specialists are able to do this to a limited extent, this can provide a barrier to the availability of such procedures. Further, because different patients have different anatomies, the results are not always precise.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Considering <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, for example, one can relatively easily understand the shape of the catheter <b>100</b> within the plane of the two-dimensional of the image. However, the shape of the catheter <b>100</b> out of the plane of the image (e.g., the incline of the catheter) is harder to discern. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, it is difficult to determine whether the catheter <b>100</b> is moving in a direction that is into or out of the plane of the image. While an understanding of anatomy can inform the answer to this question, the result is still not wholly determinable. As will be described in more detail below, this application offers new devices, systems, and methods for determining an out of the plane angle of the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>. Increasing a physician's understanding of the out of the plane angle of the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> can greatly facilitate navigation and improve the experience of driving or controlling the catheter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, the catheter <b>100</b> may include an articulable portion that is actuated via pull wires. To accurately control the articulation of the catheter <b>100</b>, one must understand the roll orientation of the catheter <b>100</b>. As a simplified example, if the physician actuates the right most pull wire <b>105</b> expecting that this will cause the catheter <b>100</b> to deflect to the right, the catheter <b>100</b> may move unexpectedly to the left if the catheter <b>100</b> is rolled 180 degrees such that the right most pull wire <b>105</b> is positioned on the left side of the catheter <b>100</b>. The physician may estimate the roll position of the catheter <b>100</b> based on the roll position of the proximal end of the catheter <b>100</b>. However, due to the complex shape of the vasculature, the roll position at the proximal end of the catheter <b>100</b> may not (and often does not) directly correspond to the roll position at the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b>. Thus, to understand how actuation of the pull wires <b>105</b> will cause the distal portion of the catheter <b>100</b> to deflect, one must generally understand the roll position at the distal portion of the catheter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Considering <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> further, one can see that the roll position of the distal portion of the catheter <b>100</b> is not readily discernible.

Increasing a physician's understanding of the roll position of the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> can greatly facilitate navigation and improve the experience of driving or controlling the catheter <b>100</b>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Out-of-Plane or Incline Angle Detection for Endovascular and Other Intraluminal Tools</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As discussed in the preceding section, in some embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a catheter <b>100</b> can include a marker <b>107</b> (or a plurality of markers) positioned on the distal end <b>103</b> thereof. In some embodiments, such as the illustrated embodiments, the marker <b>107</b> comprises a ring positioned on the distal end <b>103</b>. The marker <b>107</b> can be radio-opaque such that it can be easily identifiable within a medical image, such as, for example, the medical image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. As described in this section and throughout this application, the shape of the marker(s) <b>107</b> within the two-dimensional image can be analyzed to determine the out of the plane angle or incline of the catheter <b>100</b>. In other words, the two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional shape of the marker <b>107</b> can be analyzed to determine the out of the plane angle of the catheter <b>100</b>. The term &#x201c;incline,&#x201d; as referred to herein, can refer to the degree of angulation of the catheter towards or away from the X-ray source (e.g., into or out of the imaging plane), for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. In some examples, a positive degree of angulation indicates that the catheter is angled towards the X-ray emitter, with a maximum incline of +90-degrees. A negative degree of angulation indicates that the catheter is angled away from the X-ray emitter, with a maximum incline of &#x2212;90-degrees.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Considering the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in the illustrated orientation, the ring-shaped marker <b>107</b> presents or appears as a rectangle having a straight edge at the distal most tip within the two-dimensional plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. With this orientation, it can be determined that the distal portion of the catheter <b>100</b> lies in the plane of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> (e.g., in the illustrated orientation, the catheter <b>100</b> is not curving into or out of the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">To further illustrate the principles and concepts, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref> illustrate the marker <b>107</b> in different orientations. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>, the distal most end of the marker <b>107</b> is illustrated with a double line. As before, the marker <b>107</b> comprises a ring shape that can be positioned on the end of a catheter, such as the catheter <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, one can see that, within the plane of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the marker <b>107</b> is generally pointed up and to the left. One can further see that the distal end of the marker <b>107</b> presents as an ellipse within the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. Because the entire ellipse is visible, it can be determined that the marker <b>107</b> is pointed out of the plane of the page. In contrast, consider <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, within the plane of the page, one can see that the marker <b>107</b> is pointed straight up. Considering the distal edge of the marker <b>107</b>, one can only see half of the ellipse (the other half being blocked from view). From this, it can be determined the marker <b>107</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref> is angled into the page.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> presents a similar example to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, except, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the entire ellipse is visible. From this it can be determined that the marker is angled out of the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> presents an example where the marker <b>107</b> is pointed up and to the right within the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> and angled slightly out of the page based on the shape of the ellipse. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> illustrates another example where the marker <b>107</b> is angled out of the plane of the page. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>D</figref>, one can see that the length of the minor axis of the ellipse is shorter in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> as compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. This indicates that the degree of the angle out of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is less than the degree of the angle out of the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">If one considers that the marker <b>107</b> continues to turn out of the plane of the page, the minor axis of the ellipse will continue to increase in length until the minor and major axes are equal and the distal end of the marker <b>107</b> will present as a circle in the plane of the page. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> illustrates an example similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in which the marker is pointed upwards, within the plane of the page. At this orientation, the minor axis has decreased to zero, indicating that the marker <b>107</b> is pointed upwards within the plane of the page.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">From the examples provided, it can be seen that one can analyze the two-dimensional shape created by the ring or circled-shaped marker <b>107</b> within a two-dimensional imaging plane to determine the orientation of the marker <b>107</b> into and out of the page. Other shapes for marker <b>107</b> are possible. For example, the marker <b>107</b> need not always comprise a ring shape.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, a computer system, such as or which can include a computer vision system, can be used to (1) detect the shape (e.g., the visible, ellipse, circle, curve, or line) created by the distal end of the ring-shaped marker <b>107</b> within the two-dimensional image, and (2) extract or determine the out of the plane angle of the marker <b>107</b> or the tool incline from the detected shape. In some embodiments, the computer system may utilize artificial intelligence or machine learning to perform such functionality. In some embodiments, for example, a neural network can be trained to detect the shape created by the distal end of the ring-shaped marker <b>107</b> within the two-dimensional image, and extract or determine the out of the plane angle of the marker <b>107</b> from the detected shape. In some embodiments, computer vision can be used to define the orientation of the tool along the z-axis.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As mentioned above, determination of the out of the plane angle of the catheter <b>100</b> can be important in improving and/or facilitating navigation through a luminal network, such as the vasculature. In general, the vasculature of a patient will not lie within a single plane. This is apparent considering the model example vasculature provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for example, the arch of the aorta does move slightly from left to right, but it moves or arches predominately from front to back. Thus, if the patient (on an operating table) is imaged from the top down, a tool navigating through the arch of the aorta will be moving significantly out of the plane of the imaging device. To fully understand this motion, the angle of the catheter <b>100</b> out of the page can be determined as described above.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> provide additional example medical images of a catheter, such as the catheter <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, navigating through vasculature. These figures illustrate how the catheter <b>100</b> moves at an angle into and out of the plane of the medical image based on the portion of the anatomy through which the catheter <b>100</b> passes. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, which illustrates the catheter <b>100</b> navigating through a portion of the carotid artery, the distal end <b>103</b> of the catheter <b>100</b> lies generally within the plane of the medical image, and thus the distal end <b>103</b> of the marker <b>107</b> does not form an ellipse. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates the catheter <b>100</b> navigating through a portion of the aortic arch. As shown, the distal end <b>103</b> of the marker <b>107</b> does forms an ellipse which indicates that the catheter <b>100</b> is moving with at an angle that is moving out of the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>F</figref> provide additional examples of detecting the shape (e.g., the visible, ellipse, circle, curve, or line) created by the distal end of the ring-shaped marker <b>107</b> within the two-dimensional image and extracting or determining the out of the plane angle of the marker <b>107</b> from the detected shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> illustrate three example images, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>D-<b>6</b>F</figref> illustrate the same images with the shape of the ring-shaped marker <b>107</b> that has been detected and highlighted.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Alternatively or in addition to detecting the shape of the distal tip of the catheter <b>100</b> within the plane of the image, other methods or mechanisms may also be employed for determining the out of the plane angle of the catheter <b>100</b>. For example, in some embodiments, a degree of angulation may be presumed for each vessel through which the catheter <b>100</b> passes, for example, based on the general or average angulation of that vessel across the population. In some embodiments, the angulation of a vessel can be determined based on a CT scan. In some embodiments, an additional medical image at a different orientation than the first medical image (e.g., a lateral angiographic view) can be provided. In some embodiments, the medical imager can be moved so as to gain an understanding of the out of the plane angulation.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although many of the preceding examples have described the use of a ring-shaped marker <b>107</b>, other types of markers or fiducials can be used as described further below.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Incline Sign Detection for Endovascular and Other Intraluminal Tools</heading><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As discussed in the preceding section, the magnitude of the incline of endovascular and other intraluminal tools can, in some embodiments, be determined by analysis of the elliptical shape of the tool mouth (or a marker, such a ring-shaped marker, included thereon). However, the sign of the degree of angulation is not always readily identifiable solely from analysis of the marker <b>107</b> because the elliptical shape may look the same when imaged in two dimensions for both positive angulation and negative angulations of the same degree of incline.

For example, the magnitude of the incline could be determined to be 45-degrees using a method such as the ring-shaped marker method described above. The semicircular marker <b>110</b> in combination with helical fiducial <b>111</b> could then be used to determine the signed incline. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the catheter tip is inclined at negative 45-degrees, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, the catheter tip is inclined at positive 45-degrees.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, a computer system, such as a computer vision system, can be used to (1) detect the position of the semicircular marker <b>110</b> in combination with helical fiducial <b>111</b> within the two-dimensional image, and (2) extract or determine the sign of the tool incline from the detected position.

In some embodiments, the non-circumferential rings <b>113</b> can be radio-opaque such that it can easily be identifiable within a medical image. The appearance of the non-circumferential rings <b>113</b> can be analyzed to determine the sign and magnitude of the incline of the catheter <b>100</b>. The sign and magnitude of the incline of catheter <b>100</b> can be determined by the unique appearance of the non-circumferential rings <b>113</b> in the two-dimensional image at varying degrees of incline, both positive and negative. In some embodiments, non-circumferential rings <b>113</b> are arranged in an asymmetrical design. That is, in some embodiments, the non-circumferential rings <b>113</b> are each positioned at a different rotational position around the catheter <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the non-circumferential rings are positioned at 90-degree offsets. In some embodiments, non-circumferential rings <b>113</b> are multiple ellipses offset from each other.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> illustrates how an example arrangement of non-circumferential rings <b>113</b> positioned on a distal end of a catheter may provide a unique appearance at different inclination and roll angles.

As shown, each of the 36 different illustrated positions provides a unique appearance. By detected, for example, using computer vision, this appearance within a medical image, the incline (including its sign) and the roll of the catheter can be determined. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> illustrates how the radio-opaque markers provide different two-dimensional appearances for different roll positions at 30-degree increments and for different positive, neutral (zero), and negative inclines, the illustrated increments are not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the radio-opaque markers provide unique or visually distinguishable two-dimensional appearances at all different roll or incline positions. In some embodiments, the radio-opaque markers provide unique or visually distinguishable two-dimensional appearances at different roll or incline positions within increments of about, at least, or at most 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3 degrees, 4 degrees, 5 degrees, 7.5 degrees, 10 degrees, 12.5 degrees, 15 degrees, 17.5 degrees, 20 degrees, 25 degrees, 30 degrees, or 40 degrees. That is, in some embodiments, the radio-opaque markers are configured with a three-dimensional shape that, when viewed within the two-dimensional plane of a two-dimensional medical imaging device, provides a unique or visually distinguishable appearance that can be distinguished at the different incremental roll or incline angles listed above. The above listed increments can be considered minimum resolutions for the system or the minimum change in roll or incline that is detectable by the system. Tool Position and Heading for Endovascular and Other Intraluminal Tools</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates examples of projections of three-dimensional generated catheters onto real world two-dimensional X-ray images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>B-<b>9</b>C</figref> illustrate an example prediction of the trained deep neural network for predicting where the catheter body is. As noted above, position can refer to translation of endovascular and/or other intraluminal tools along the x, y, and z directions. In some embodiments, instead of determining the three-dimensional position of the instrument (z, y, and z), only the two-dimensional (x and y) position is used. This can be because estimating the z position (i.e., depth) may require calibrating the X-ray camera to obtain determine intrinsic parameters thereof. While this is feasible, it would likely (1) add a burdensome pre-operative image calibration step, (2) may not help that much because motion planning is primarily done in two-dimensions, and (3) we the C-arm can be rotated to obtain a Z position estimate.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, the system may be configured to predict where the full tool body is, and then from this tool body we the two-dimensional tip location can be extracted. This approach may be beneficial because the tool body provides a very strong training signal for learning deep neural network segmentation models. That is, in some instances, it may be easier for a neural network of computer vision algorithm to detect the body of a catheter and then extract the location of the tip from there. In some embodiments, catheter kinematics are further used refine this estimate.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">For example, a deep neural network can be used to estimate the two-dimensional centerline position of the catheter based on one or more images of the catheter navigating within the body. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref> illustrates an example, in which the neural network has identified the catheter within the image, superimposed its estimated centerline onto the image, and highlighted the catheter. Once the centerline of the catheter has been identified within the image, the two-dimensional position can be directly extracted by computing the most distal position along the centerline. Similarly, the heading of the catheter can also be directly extracted from the body estimate by computing the vector of the tip of the body line. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref> illustrates an example in which the distal tip position and heading angle have been determined and the image has been updated to include a highlight identifying the position and an arrow indicating the heading.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, a machine learning algorithm for estimating the position of a catheter and/or other tool may use the following approach. First, the image generation procedure is modified by drawing the catheter on top of tangible X-ray images (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). This process may have the advantage of training the deep neural network with realistic noise and occlusions that would be seen in actual X-rays, making the system robust to real world conditions.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Second, the two-dimensional x and y position is estimated. In some embodiments, radio-opaque markings may be added to the tool body, such as, for example, a full-length helix, to assist with the identification. In some embodiments, the three-dimensional x, y, and z position may be estimated instead. However, estimation of the Z position may require calibration of the X-ray camera to obtain its camera intrinsic, which requires an additional step of a pre-operation image calibration. In some instances, the two-dimensional position estimation will be preferable so the pre-operation image calibration step does not need to be completed and because the z position may not be necessary because motion planning is primarily conducted in two-dimensions. Further, a z position estimate can be obtained by rotating the C-arm. Using this method, the two-dimensional x and y position of the full tool body may be predicted. Thereafter, the two-dimensional x and y position location of the tool tip (such as, for example, the distal end <b>103</b> of catheter <b>100</b>) can be determined. This approach may be used because the tool body provides a very strong training signal for learning deep neural network segmentation models. In some embodiments, catheter kinematics may be used to further refine the position estimate.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As noted above, heading can refer to a measure of angulation or articulation about the z-axis and/or where the device is pointing in the image plane. To determine the heading of endovascular and/or other intraluminal tools, such as a catheter, the deep neural network prediction of the catheter body position may be used. Based on the prediction of the two-dimensional x and y position of the catheter tip, a second position located on the catheter body may be determined. The second position may be an infinitesimal distance from the tool tip in a direction along the catheter body. The heading angle of the catheter may then be calculated using trigonometry based on the x and y position of the tool tip and the second position along the catheter body.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Roll Angle Detection for Endovascular and Other Intraluminal Tools</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As noted above, radio-opaque markers can be placed at the distal tip <b>103</b> of a catheter <b>100</b> to improve the visibility of the catheter <b>100</b> in a medical image (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>). In some embodiments, these markers are symmetric about the tools axis and thus do not provide any information related to the roll angle of the catheter. As described in this section, the degree of rotation of a tool about its centerline may be informed by the addition of radio-opaque rotation fiducials. Numerous configurations of radio-opaque rotation fiducials can be utilized to determine the degree of tool rotation, provided the configurations result in a unique X-ray appearance of the tool at differing degrees of rotation. While multiple configurations will be disclosed with reference to certain embodiments, it will be understood that various changes may be made, and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For example, markers <b>108</b> that are rotationally asymmetric can be utilized on the catheter <b>100</b> and configured to provide information from which the roll angle of the catheter <b>100</b> can be determined. In some embodiments, a computer vision algorithm can be used to detect and analyze the positions of the markers <b>108</b> to determine the rotation or roll of the catheter <b>100</b> about its longitudinal axis. As described above, the rotation of the catheter <b>100</b> determines how an actuation of a given pull wire will move the catheter <b>100</b>.

For example, because each marker <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>D is placed at a different distance from the distal tip <b>103</b>, they can each be uniquely identified by that distance. This can allow the machine learning model and/or loss to be much more robust and/or generalizable. Use of four markers <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>D may also prevent against or eliminate angle aliasing, for example, allowing for full determination of roll between 0 and 360 degrees. Because the markers <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>D are equidistantly spaced along the longitudinal axis, the markers <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>D can be analyzed to determine out-of-of plane rotations. Further, use of four markers <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>D can allow for determination of the centerline of the catheter <b>100</b>.

The term &#x201c;unexpected motion,&#x201d; as referred to herein, describes any movement or behavior of the distal end of a catheter that is not predicted based on the movement and/or control of the proximal end of the catheter. An example of unexpected motion may be a poor torque response where an unexpected roll motion occurs at the distal end of a catheter. The unexpected roll motion may occur when the rotation at the distal end of the catheter does not correlate to the rotation at the proximal end. For example, sometimes when the proximal end of the catheter is rotating, the distal end of the catheter may be rotating at a slower rate or may not be rotating at all. As the proximal end of the catheter continues to rotate and the distal end rotates at a slower rate or does not rotate at all, torque builds up in the catheter. If the proximal end of the catheter continues to rotate, eventually the torque in the catheter may cause the distal end of the catheter to rotate very quickly to catch up with the rotation imposed on the proximal end of the catheter and the quick rotation may be characterized as unexpected motion which could cause harm to the patient. For example, the unexpected motion at the distal end could cause damage to or a tear in a vessel wall.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">As previously described, the degree of rotation of the distal end of a tool about its centerline may be informed by the addition of radio-opaque rotation fiducials. Using the methods described herein, unexpected motion at the distal end of a catheter may be prevented by tracking and comparing the rotation rate and roll of the distal and proximal ends of a catheter. In some embodiments, the comparison may be performed at discrete steps. In some embodiments, the comparison may be performed continuously. In some embodiments, rotation at the proximal end of a catheter may be prevented when there is a difference of more than a specific number of degrees of rotation between the proximal and distal ends of the catheter. By preventing further rotation after the difference in rotation is calculated at a specific amount, the system may prevent unexpected motion (for example, snapping and/or whipping of the distal end) to increase the safety of the procedure.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments, a computer vision system may be used to identify the fiducials to model how far the distal catheter tip has rotated in relation to how far the motors controlling rotation at the proximal end of the catheter have moved. In some embodiments, this method may be paired with other safety information such as, for example, force detection and/or the like. In some embodiments, a similar method may be applied to detect discrepancies in expected advancement and retraction of the catheter as compared to actual advancement and retraction of the catheter. Use of this method may be used to identify potential obstructions to catheter motion. For example, using the methods described herein to determine the actual position a catheter tip can be compared to the expected position of a catheter tip based on how the catheter was controlled.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Automated Tool Tracking</heading><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The automated identification of a tool, tool tip and/or tool orientation may be used to control movement of a decoupled imaging source to maintain optimal viewing. For example, in an endovascular procedure, movement of an angiography system could be precisely controlled and/or centered on the tool in question without manual manipulation. In another example, in a laparoscopic surgery, movement of a camera could be precisely controlled and/or centered on the tool in question without manual manipulation. Being able to maintain optimal viewing in this manner may have the advantage of significantly better imaging for the surgeon. In some cases, automated tool tracking may improve the speed and efficiency of procedures, for example, the procedure would be faster and more efficient because the surgeon does not have to put down the tools and move the camera intermittently. In some cases, automated tool tracking may reduce the number of personal required in the operation room because no one needs to control the camera.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Automated tool tracking may be most useful for interventional and/or surgical applications where the source of input imaging is decoupled from the navigating and/or interventional tool. In these procedures, generally an assistant must manually track the surgeon's tools which may result in both lag and imprecision. For example, in an angiographic procedure, the automated tool tracking system may be used to maintain the tool tip halfway across and one third up the image screen for the entire procedure instead of the current method of having the physician put down the tools and manually readjust the screen to focus on the tool. In another example, in a laparoscopic or thoracoscopic procedure, the automated tool tracking system may be used to enable an external camera source to be automatically adjusted to maintain the tools in the center of the image, thus improving the focus and positioning of the camera.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Example Endovascular and Other Applicable Procedures</heading><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The various technologies disclosed herein related to determination of position and/or orientation determination can be used to facilitate the treatment of various diseases and other conditions where a robotic or manual device is advanced through an intraluminal (e.g., intravascular) network of a subject to reach the site of intravascular pathology (e.g., thrombosis, embolus, occlusion, aneurysm, rupture, bleeding, dissection, etc.).

For example, a user, such as a physician that is controlling a robotic medical instrument or a medical instrument that is coupled to a robotic system, can provide user inputs to change a heading of the instrument within the plane of the medical image (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) and/or to change an incline of the instrument into or out of the plane of the medical image (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). This type of control system can be referred to herein as &#x201c;image space control&#x201d; because the user inputs are provided with respect to the plane of the image (e.g., adjusting the heading within the plane or adjusting the inclination into or out of the plane).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">This type of control system is intuitive as the user may provide such inputs while viewing the medical image which includes at least a representation of a distal portion of the instrument. That is, the user can provide control inputs relative to the current appearance of the instrument within a medical image.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, many articulable medical instruments or catheters use one or more pull wires to control articulation (bending or deflection) of a distal tip of the instrument. For example, some catheters include four pullwires, each configured to cause deflection of the catheter in one of four directions: one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip of the catheter up, one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip down, one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip right, and one pullwire can be associated with deflecting the tip down. However, knowing which pullwire to actuate to cause a given deflection requires an understanding of the current roll position of the catheter. If the distal tip of the catheter is rolled by <b>90</b> degrees, actuating the pullwire generally associated with an upward deflection of the tip would instead cause the catheter to articulate (possibly unexpectedly) to the right or left.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">However, without the fiducials described in this application, which allow for vision-based determination of, among other things, the current roll of the instrument (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>F</figref>), it can be extremely difficult or even impossible to determine the current roll of a medical instrument from an X-ray image. Thus, a physician controlling the instrument will have great difficulty in deciding which pullwires to actuate in order to cause a desired motion.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The image space control systems and methods described herein reduce or eliminate these difficulties and provide a natural and intuitive way to control a medical instrument by providing simplified user inputs with respect to a medical image, such as a two-dimensional X-ray. Specifically, in some embodiments, a computer system can determine appropriate motor commands to cause the desired movement/articulation of the instrument based on user provided control inputs and an estimate of a current roll of the instrument. The estimate of the current roll of the instrument can be determined based on an appearance of one or more radio-opaque markers or fiducials that are included on a distal end of the image and which are visible within the medical image. In some instances, the estimate of current roll is determined by the system based on a computer vision analysis of the medical image. In some instances, the estimate of the current roll is determined and input by the user based on a user-identified appearance of the fiducials.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In this way, the user can provide natural and intuitive inputs with respect to the current position and orientation of the instrument within a medical image, and the system can determine appropriate motor commands (e.g., commands for actuating one or more of the pullwires of the instrument) to cause the desired motion. In some embodiments, this can allow the user to control the catheter in one or more of the following three directions: forward and back (insertion), left and right (heading), and/or into and out of the image (incline). These directions move with respect the plane of the image regardless of how the X-ray is moved or how the catheter is rolled in the body. This control mode is intuitive and provides a large advancement over the current standard of care, which requires the user to frequently guess and check which way the catheter will move on screen. Using these controls, the user can easily access tricky vessels and ensure safe navigation of the instrument through the vessels in an atraumatic fashion.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">A user may provide user inputs in various ways. For example, in some embodiments, the user can specify desired targets for insertion, heading, and/or incline. Once specified, the system can determine the appropriate motor commands for causing the instrument to move from its current position and orientation to the desired position and orientation. Providing such absolute targets (e.g., desired targets for insertion, heading, and/or incline) may advantageously provide some resiliency and safety in the event in a lag in communication between the user and the robotic medical system. This can be advantageous for situations wherein the user is remotely located from the robotic system and patient and communication occurs of a computer network, such as the internet.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">As another example, a user may provide user inputs that are indicated relative to the current position or orientation of the instrument. For example, a user can specify that the instrument adjust its heading to the right relative to the current heading of the instrument, While such a system may be less tolerant to high latency and communication lag, it still allows user to navigate in a simple and intuitive manner.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">To enable image space control, it is necessary that the robotic system that is controlling the instrument have an accurate estimate of the current roll of the instrument in order to determine which pullwires to actuate to cause a desired movement. In some embodiments, the roll estimate is determined automatically the system based on the appearance of one or more fiducials on the instrument in the image. In some embodiments, the roll estimate may be determined with assistance from the user. For example, the user may select or provide a roll estimate by comparing the current appearance of the one or more fiducials in the image to one or more sample images representative of the appearance of the one or more fiducials at different roll angles.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Another advantage to image space control is that it continues to function even if the imaging device, for example, a C-arm of an X-ray machine, is moved. This is because control inputs are provided with respect to the plane of the image. If the imaging device is moved, the plane will move also, and control inputs will be provided with respect to the moved plane.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>D</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a graphical user interface <b>200</b> for providing image space control of a medical instrument.

This is necessary to ensure that the appropriate pullwires are actuated to cause the specified motion. In some embodiments, the system determines the roll of the instrument automatically, for example, using computer vision analysis of the appearance of one or more of the fiducials in the image as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In other embodiments, the system may determine the roll of the instrument based upon a user input. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>B</figref> illustrate two example embodiments for roll estimate determination. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>, the user is presented with both the medical image and a plurality of sample images. Each of the sample images illustrates the appearance of a fiducial at a specified roll value (e.g., similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>F</figref>). The user is prompted to select which images most closely corresponds to the appearance of the fiducial in the medical image. By increasing the number of sample images, the accuracy of the roll estimate can be improved. In some instances, the sample images are presented to the user in a series of steps (e.g., a first set of images at roll increments of 30 degrees, a second set of images at roll increments of 5 degrees, and a third set of images at roll increments of 1 degree).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref> provides an alternative embodiment, wherein a user is asked to adjust a position of a slider (or provide another input) that causes a sample image that includes a representation of the fiducial at a given roll angle to change.

In this example, the user input device is configured to provide absolute or target-based inputs for heading and incline. That is, using the wheel for heading and the slider for incline, the user can select desired angles. By selecting confirm move, the system can determine the appropriate motor commands and cause movement of the instrument until the specified angles are reached. In some embodiments, the system only moves while the user holds down the confirm move button, although this need not be the case in all embodiments.
