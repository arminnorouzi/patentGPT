The primary coil <b>11</b> is supplied with an ignition voltage of electricity stored in the capacitor <b>13</b>, and a spark plug <b>3</b> is connected to the secondary coil <b>12</b>. An induced voltage generated by the generator coil <b>21</b> of the power generator <b>20</b> is rectified by the diode <b>14</b> and stored in the capacitor <b>13</b>.

The power generator <b>20</b> accumulates electricity in the capacitor <b>13</b> with the induced voltage of the generator coil <b>21</b>. The waveform shaping circuit <b>22</b> shapes the waveform of the induced voltage of the generator coil <b>21</b>.

The waveform shaped by the waveform shaping circuit <b>22</b> can be treated as a pulse signal having period T as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, which becomes an input signal to the controller <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The controller <b>30</b> controls the ignition timing of the ignition circuit <b>10</b>, that is, the timing at which the thyristor <b>16</b> becomes conductive by the input signal from the waveform shaping circuit <b>22</b> which is generated by the induced voltage of the generator coil <b>21</b>. For this timing control, the controller <b>30</b> includes a speed computation part <b>31</b> and an ignition timing calculation part <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The speed computation part <b>31</b> computes an engine rotational speed or frequency as operating information, based on the input signal from the waveform shaping circuit <b>2</b>. The input signal can be treated as a pulse signal having the period T as described above, and therefore it is possible to obtain the engine rotational speed by calculating the reciprocal of the period T (1/T).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The ignition timing calculation part <b>32</b> calculates and outputs the ignition timing according to the engine rotational speed obtained by the speed computation part <b>31</b>. The ignition timing is calculated for each rotation of the engine, and a signal to make the thyristor <b>16</b> conductive is outputted at a predetermined timing.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The sensor <b>2</b> of the ignition coil unit <b>1</b> detects load information and inputs the load information to the controller <b>30</b>. The load information provides the knowledge of what load state of the engine with the ignition coil <b>1</b>, or the working machine equipped with this engine during the operation, which is, for example, temperature information, vibration information, and sound information. The sensor <b>2</b> is a temperature sensor when used to detect the temperature information, is a vibration sensor when used to detect the vibration information, and is a sound sensor when used to detect the sound information. Hereinafter, an example where the temperature sensor is used as the sensor <b>2</b> and the temperature in the unit is detected as the load information will be described. However, this is by no means limiting as the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The controller <b>30</b> includes a temperature measurement part <b>33</b> configured to measure the temperature from a detection signal of the sensor <b>2</b>. The controller <b>30</b> also includes a memory <b>34</b> configured to store the engine rotational speed as the operating information outputted from the speed computation part <b>31</b> and the temperature in the unit as the load information outputted from the temperature measurement part <b>33</b> in chronological order by using a time stamp function of the controller <b>30</b>. Moreover, the controller <b>30</b> includes a timer <b>35</b> configured to allow the memory <b>34</b> to store working time information corresponding to the engine rotational speed as the operating information and the temperature in the unit as the load information described above.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The controller <b>30</b> includes a matrix determination part <b>36</b> configured to allow the memory <b>34</b> to store the working time information corresponding to the engine rotational speed (hereinafter &#x201c;speed&#x201d;) as the operating information and the temperature in the unit (hereinafter &#x201c;temperature&#x201d;) as the load information, as matrix data composed of the operating information, the load information, and the time data.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a constitutional example of the matrix data produced by the matrix determination part <b>36</b>. Here, two axes of the sections of the matrix constituting the matrix data indicate speed (r/min) and temperature (&#xb0; C.), respectively.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The matrix determination part <b>36</b> determines which of 25 sections of the matrix (An, Bn) {(A1, B1), (A1, B2), . . . , (A1, B5), (A2, B1), . . . , (A2, B5), . . . , (A5, B5)} corresponds to the speed and the temperature of the engine during the operation. The timer <b>35</b> measures the working time of the corresponding section to obtain a cumulation of the working time of each of the sections. Then, the controller <b>30</b> causes the memory <b>34</b> to store the obtained cumulative time.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, the controller <b>30</b> also causes the memory <b>34</b> to store operating status data. This operating status data includes at least one of the total operating time of the working machine, the maximum value of the operating information such as the engine rotational speed, the maximum value of the load information such as the temperature in the unit, the number of times of trying recoil to start the engine, the number of times of starting (number of start) of the engine, and the number of times the engine rotational speed exceeds a set value. The controller <b>30</b> updates the operating status data as needed, and causes the memory <b>34</b> to store the data.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The operation of the controller <b>30</b> described above will be explained in detail with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. First, when the waveform of the input signal (pulse signal) generated by a waveform shaping part <b>22</b> of the power generator <b>20</b> is inputted (step S<b>01</b>), the controller <b>30</b> causes the speed computation part <b>31</b> to compute the engine rotational speed with the period T of the input signal (the time difference from the previous input) (step S<b>02</b>), and determines whether the computed speed exceeds a set value (step S<b>02</b>A). When determining that the computed speed exceeds the set value (step S<b>02</b>A; YES), the controller <b>30</b> counts up the number of times the computed speed exceeds the set value (step S<b>02</b>B).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Then, the controller <b>30</b> determines whether to update the maximum speed by comparison between the presently obtained speed and the maximum speed previously obtained (step S<b>03</b>). When determining to update the maximum speed (step S<b>03</b>; YES), the controller <b>30</b> causes the memory <b>34</b> to store the presently obtained speed as the maximum speed (step S<b>04</b>). In the step S<b>03</b> of the comparative determination, when the waveform is inputted the first time, the presently obtained speed is stored as is in the memory <b>34</b> as the maximum speed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the other hand, when determining not to update the maximum speed (step S<b>03</b>; NO) or after the maximum speed is saved in the memory <b>34</b>, the controller <b>30</b> causes the ignition timing calculation part <b>32</b> to calculate the ignition timing with the presently obtained speed (step S<b>05</b>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition, upon receiving the input signal described above, the controller <b>30</b> causes the temperature measurement part <b>33</b> to obtain a detection signal from the sensor <b>2</b> to measure the temperature (step S<b>06</b>). Then, the controller <b>30</b> determines whether to update the maximum temperature by comparison between the presently obtained temperature and the maximum temperature previously obtained (step S<b>07</b>). When determining to update the maximum temperature (step S<b>07</b>; YES), the controller <b>30</b> causes the memory <b>34</b> to store the presently obtained temperature as the maximum temperature (step S<b>09</b>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">On the other hand, when determining not to update the maximum temperature (step S<b>07</b>; NO), the controller <b>30</b> determines whether to update the minimum temperature by comparison between the presently obtained temperature and the minimum temperature previously obtained (step S<b>08</b>). When determining to update the minimum temperature (step S<b>08</b>; YES), the controller <b>30</b> causes the memory <b>34</b> to store the presently obtained temperature as the minimum temperature (step S<b>10</b>). In the step S<b>07</b> and the step S<b>08</b> of the comparative determination, when the waveform is inputted the first time, the presently obtained temperature is stored as is in the memory <b>34</b> as the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">After determining to update the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature, the controller <b>30</b> causes the matrix determination part <b>36</b> to perform matrix determination, based on the presently obtained speed and temperature (step S<b>11</b>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the matrix determination, the controller <b>30</b> determines which of the preset matrix sections (An, Bn) corresponds to the presently obtained speed and temperature; obtains the timer value from the timer <b>35</b> having counted the period T of the input signal (step S<b>12</b>); and cumulates the obtained timer value for each of the corresponding matrix sections (step S<b>13</b>). After that, the controller <b>30</b> outputs an output signal to the ignition circuit <b>10</b> at the ignition timing obtained in the step S<b>05</b> to make the thyristor <b>16</b> of the ignition circuit <b>10</b> conductive, and performs ignition for each of the input signals (step S<b>14</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The controller <b>30</b> discriminates the continuity of the input signals to obtain the number of times of trying recoil and the number of times of starting the operating status data, and saves the data in the memory <b>34</b> as needed (not illustrated in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Here, the controller <b>30</b> determines the starting when the engine continues to be rotated a set number of times at an engine rotational speed equal to or higher than a set value, and counts up the number of times of the starting, and determines the recoil when the input signals continue to be inputted after the controller <b>30</b> is powered on before the engine is started.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, the controller <b>30</b> sums the cumulative time for each of the matrix sections stored as the matrix data to obtain the total operating time as the operating status data.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The controller <b>30</b> can cause the memory <b>34</b> to save log data of the speed and the temperature obtained for each of the input signals by adding a step to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In this case, for example, the controller <b>30</b> causes the memory <b>34</b> to continuously save the log data every several seconds for several minutes, and after a set period of time has elapsed, overwrites the old data to save new log data. By this means, the controller <b>30</b> can cause the memory <b>34</b> to save significant log data such as the log data just before the engine stop with a limited memory capacity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to this ignition coil unit <b>1</b>, it is possible to precisely determine the time for maintenance or replacement and diagnose failure by an appropriate evaluation index, by referring to the matrix data and the operating status data stored in the memory <b>34</b> which is built in the ignition coil unit <b>1</b>. In addition, it is possible to understand the operation characteristic of the user of the individual engine or working machine, and the status of use of the working machine by analyzing the data stored in the memory <b>34</b> built in the ignition coil unit <b>1</b> of the individual engine, and therefore to provide service to each user with the personalized menu for the user. Moreover, the memory function of the ignition coil unit <b>1</b> essential to the engine is enriched, and therefore it is possible to solve the problems with precise maintenance and so forth at lower cost.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, an example of practical use of this ignition coil unit <b>1</b> will be specifically described. For example, at the time for maintenance, the user of the working machine brings the working machine to a dealer or store. Then, the ignition coil unit <b>1</b> is removed from the engine, and the memory <b>34</b> of the ignition coil unit <b>1</b> is connected to a diagnostic system. The diagnostic system includes, for example, a display device configured to display the matrix data and the operating status data stored in the memory <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this case, the memory <b>34</b> has already stored user information such as user ID, and therefore it is possible to refer to or analyze the matrix data and the operating status data retrieved from the memory <b>34</b> in association with the user information. By employing this diagnostic system, the dealer can provide the individual user with service corresponding to the characteristic of the user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Understanding the status of use from the matrix data can be used as a material for determining how the user is using the engine. When the matrix data of the engine rotational speed and the temperature indicates that the engine is operated within a predetermined range of rotational speeds and a predetermined range of temperatures, it can be information to understand that the user ideally uses the engine, and, on the other hand, when the matrix data of the engine rotational speed and the temperature indicates that the engine is operated out of the predetermined range of rotational speeds and the predetermined range of temperatures, it can be information to understand that the user does not ideally use the engine.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, in the case of understanding the status of use of the engine by the operating status data, the maximum rotational speed, the number of times the rotational speed exceeds the set value, and the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature in use can be information for the dealer to determine whether the user ideally uses the engine. In particular, in the case of analyzing the cause of a failure, when the number of times of rotation exceeds a value equal to or higher than the set value, it is possible to analyze that the failure is caused by a high rotational speed. In addition, it is possible to analyze that the failure is caused by the temperature, by inspecting from the maximum or minimum temperature in use whether the engine is used under a condition in conformity to the requirement of the service temperature of electronic parts in the ignition coil unit <b>1</b>. Moreover, in particular, when the engine fails many times, the matrix data and the operating status data presented from the dealer to the user, can be used as information to teach the user about the operation getting close to the ideal use.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the case of understanding the status of use of the engine by another operating status data, it is possible to evaluate the starting capability of the working machine by the number of times of trying recoil and the number of times of starting. The starting capability of the working machine can be information for the dealer to know the state of the working machine, for example, the deterioration of the working machine. In addition, the starting capability of the working machine has a cause-and-effect relationship with the operating environment, and therefore the dealer can understand the effect of the operating environment on the starting capability of the working machine, by analyzing the correlation of the number of times of trying recoil or the number of times of starting with the matrix data or the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, by employing the ignition coil unit <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the invention, it is possible to understand the operating characteristic (operating status) of the user, and the state and the operating environment of the working machine, by the matrix data and the operating status data (total operating time, the maximum temperature in use, the maximum rotation frequency, the number of times of trying recoil, and the number of times of starting). Therefore, the dealer can propose the next time for maintenance to the individual users, based on the operating characteristic of each of the users.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, the dealer can determine whether the user is a heavy user who frequently uses the working machine or a light user who infrequently uses the working machine, based on the operating status data such as the total operating time. Therefore, when introducing a new product or article to the user, the dealer can provide the product or article corresponding to the status of use of the user, and after that, provide maintenance corresponding to the status of use of the user.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, the ignition coil unit <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the invention allows understanding the status of use of the user, the cause of failure, and the state and the operating environment of the working machine, by the matrix data and the operating status data. Therefore, it is possible to provide precise evaluation for the maintenance of the engine and the working machine, and consequently to provide service to the individual users which corresponds to the operating characteristic of each of the users.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, the embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail with reference to the drawings. However, the specific configuration is not limited to the embodiments, and the design can be changed without departing from the gist of the present invention.
