APPLICATION(S)</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Australian provisional patent application no. 2020900693 filed 6 Mar. 2020, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a paving device for the formation of ground structures, and in particular, to a paving device for creating a paved surface which is water permeable, safe and of sufficient strength to support a significant load.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the increase in world population and as the effects of global warming become more understood, the ability of communities to manage water, especially waste or run-off water, is becoming especially important. As residential and public spaces become more densely populated, paved walkways and roads for handling traffic are replacing many grassed areas and ground spaces. Thus, especially in new residential developments where large houses are being built on small blocks in close proximity to other houses, rain water is more likely to be captured in drains or to flow into gutters or other dedicated water drainage systems than to be captured in the ground surface and be retained in the soil.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such water drainage systems remove the water from the site into dedicated stormwater collection systems which ultimately deliver the rainwater back into the neighbouring rivers or oceans. As a result, the groundwater or water table in the region becomes diminished, minimising the amount of water present in the ground to support plants and trees. In many new developments, especially those in drought areas or in areas where rain water is largely collected and removed from the site, the soil structure is becoming increasingly dry and is beginning to contract and subside. Such a phenomena will result in foundation slabs for houses and other buildings becoming stressed and fracturing, compromising the integrity of such buildings and requiring significant costs and expertise to resolve. Thus, there is a social and an environmental benefit in allowing rainwater to be captured in the ground so as to infiltrate into the water table or, alternatively, to be harvested for re-use in irrigation, rather than merely removing it from the site.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of water permeable paving systems have been proposed to address this problem and to facilitate capture and release of water into the underlying ground soil. However, most such paving systems rely upon a gap between adjacent paving bricks of the paved surface to act as a water permeable medium, through which water is able to flow to the underlying ground soil. In such arrangements, aggregate material is typically used to fill a space between adjacent paving bricks such that water passing over the paving bricks will flow into the spaces there between and be absorbed into the ground surface or water collection system below the paving.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Whilst such a system is able to provide a means for capturing water for release to the underlying ground surface, the amount of water captured largely relies upon the size of the spacing between pavers, with larger spacing sizes capturing the most water. Therefore, the paving system must have pavers separated by aggregate which can significantly limit the aesthetic appeal and safety of the walking surface of such paving. Most importantly, the gaps or joints between the paving bricks invariably become clogged with debris within a short time, thereby eliminating or substantially compromising the permeability. As each paver is not, in itself, pervious, permeability can only be restored by regularly cleaning the installation using commercial-grade vacuuming equipment. The maintenance regime is labour intensive and costly and often neglected.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need to provide a paving system whereby the individual pavers are configured to be permeable to water such that the paving can form, not only a path for traffic and pedestrians, but also capture water for release into a harvesting system or underlying ground surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above references to and descriptions of prior proposals or products are not intended to be, and are not to be construed as, statements or admissions of common general knowledge in the art. In particular, the above prior art discussion does not relate to what is commonly or well known by the person skilled in the art, but assists in the understanding of the inventive step of the present invention of which the identification of pertinent prior art proposals is but one part.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">STATEMENT OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention according to one or more aspects is as defined in the independent claims.

The present invention also has application to walkways, footpaths and the like, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. However, it will be appreciated that the paver of the present invention could be used in a variety of different applications still fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a paver <b>10</b> is depicted in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. As is more clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the paver <b>10</b> has been formed to assume a shape that enables it to interlock with a similarly shaped pavers to form a paved surface in the manner as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Such a shape enables pavers <b>10</b> to be positioned in close proximity such that any torsional force applied to the upper surface <b>12</b> of the paver <b>10</b> is transmitted and resisted by the adjacent pavers <b>12</b> which have multiple contacting surfaces to ensure that the pavers do not move or cause other pavers to move. This is important in such instances where the paved surface created by the pavers <b>10</b> supports vehicles such as cars, trucks and forklifts, as the turning wheels of a vehicle when in contact with the upper surface <b>12</b> of a paver <b>10</b> can cause the pavers to become dislodged if not configured in such an interlocking manner.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">One embodiment depicting a manner in which the pavers <b>10</b> may be installed for use is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the ground surface <b>32</b> may be prepared such that it is excavated to an appropriate depth, as shown. An edge restraint <b>31</b> positioned in the excavated hole to define an edge to which the pavers <b>10</b> abut against. A base layer <b>34</b> of aggregate is then deposited on the ground surface <b>32</b> having a typical depth of around 80 mm. The base layer <b>34</b> typically comprises a course aggregate having a diameter of between 20-25 mm to maximise drainage therethrough. A bedding layer <b>36</b> is then formed atop the base layer <b>34</b> which may have a depth of around 30 mm. The bedding layer <b>36</b> may comprise aggregate having a diameter of between 2-5 mm and may constitute course sand or pea gravel.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">The bedding layer <b>36</b> may then be levelled to form a base upon which the pavers <b>10</b> may be supported. As is shown, the pavers <b>10</b> are positioned in close proximity to each other with a small gap <b>37</b> formed therebetween. The gap <b>37</b> may be at least partially filled with sand to stabilise any movement between pavers <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">In such a configuration as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, water is able to penetrate through the body of the pavers <b>10</b> and through the subsequent layers <b>36</b> and <b>34</b> to be received in the ground surface <b>32</b>. Water can then accumulate in the ground surface <b>32</b> to provide a rich source of water for local trees and other plant life. It will be appreciated that a water collection or harvesting system may be provided between the ground surface <b>32</b> and the base layer <b>34</b> or between the base layer <b>34</b> and the bedding layer <b>36</b>. Such a harvesting system may include a storage vessel, or a pipe or conduit that collects the water and delivers it to a remote storage vessel for further use, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">The paver <b>10</b> is porous and is formed from a concrete and aggregate mixture. The aggregate may be a natural stone such as basalt, granite, or marble. In one embodiment, the aggregate is crushed marble which is mixed with cement at a ratio of 5:1. The crushed marble typically comprises varying sizes of marble stone varying from pieces having a diameter of between 1 mm-7 mm. In order to provide a variety of aesthetic options, a coloured oxide may also be added to the surface level part of the mixture as desired. Water is used to create the appropriate consistency of mix to form the paver <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">A method <b>40</b> for forming the paver <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. As a first step <b>41</b>, the materials are mixed within a large mixing chamber at the above mentioned ratio. In step <b>42</b>, water is added to the mixture to form the appropriate consistency of the mix, namely a mixture having a plastic concrete state. In step <b>43</b>, the mixture is then poured into a mould to form the desired shape of the paver. In step <b>44</b> the mould is then pressed and vibrated to ensure that the aggregate is freely dispersed throughout the paver, to facilitate the porous and water permeable characteristics of the finished paver. In a preferred form, the vibration applied in step <b>44</b> has a frequency of between 50-100 Hz, preferably around 65 Hz and is conducted over a period of between 15-60 seconds duration, preferably in two periods of around 30 seconds duration each. In this regard, when the mould is filled with mixture for forming the base of the paver, the mixture is compressed and is vibrated for the first period of 30 second duration. Any coloured aggregates and materials to form the top portion of the paver are then introduced on top of the base material and the combined material is compressed and the combined material is vibrated for the second period of 30 second duration. The material is then cured to form the final paver product in step <b>45</b>. The pavers are cured within a curing chamber for between 24-48 hours to accelerate the curing process.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">The manufacturing process <b>40</b> can be varied to create pavers <b>10</b> with different properties. In a first embodiment, the aggregate and the cement may be mixed to provide an even consistency of aggregate throughout the paver <b>10</b>. To pour the moulds, this is typically done in a two-part process whereby a base layer is initially poured into the mould, followed by the surface layer having a depth of between 5-7 mm and which contains a colouring agent. In this embodiment, whilst the surface layer of the finished paver may have a different colour than the rest of the paver, all of the aggregate size is substantially the same throughout the paver, namely between 1-2 mm in diameter. This process produces a paver <b>10</b> having a consistent finish with all aggregate substantially the same size, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">In another form, the paver <b>10</b> may be also formed from a two-part process whereby the surface layer <b>12</b> and the base layer <b>14</b> have different aggregate sizes. In one example of this process, the base layer has a coarser aggregate than the surface layer. In this regard, in one embodiment the base layer <b>14</b> may have aggregate of between 2-7 mm in diameter, preferably of between 2-3 mm in diameter, whilst the surface layer comprises aggregate of 1-2 mm in diameter and also contains the colouring agent. As a result, the aggregate is mixed to contain the different proportions and is then added to the mould at different times to create the different layered effect. A paver <b>10</b> formed from the two-part process is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">An alternative embodiment of a paver <b>20</b> in accordance with the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. In this embodiment the paver <b>20</b> is a conventional rectangular paver and is not configured with the interlocking shape. Such a paver may be used in a variety of applications whereby foot traffic is required, such as paths and borders. The paver <b>20</b> has a surface <b>22</b> and a base <b>24</b> for supporting the paver <b>20</b> on a surface to be paved.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">Due to the manner in which the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> is formed, it has sufficient porosity so as to be water permeable such that water that is contact on the surface of the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> will permeate through the body of the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> and into the ground surface below, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">The paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> has a minimum permeability rate of 300 mm per hour and as the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> absorbs water it's body does not change shape. Thus, the entire surface area of the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> is able to collect water and retain the water as it passes through the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> to be absorbed into the underlying ground surface. This enables the surface <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> of the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> to be configured to have a high resistance to abrasion to ensure durability, and still be permeable to water. Without the need for any additional treatment, the surface <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> of the paver will also be slip resistant to the required standards, without compromising its' ability to be permeable to water. Similarly, the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> is formed in such a manner that it has a breaking load strength suitable to support industrial and commercial traffic loads.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">The pavers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> may be manufacture to a variety of sizes, as required by the end user. For the interlocking paver <b>10</b>, the paver may have a length of 225 mm and a width of 112 mm, and a thickness of 60 mm. For the rectangular paver <b>20</b>, the paver may have a length of around 200 mm and a width of 100 mm with a thickness of around 60 mm. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the dimensions of the paver <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> may vary, together with the thickness to suit a variety of different types of applications.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">It will be appreciated that the paver of the present invention offers a variety of benefits that has not been achievable with conventional permeable paving systems that rely upon the spacing between pavers to capture the water. By having the entire surface of the paver acting as a water permeable surface, water will not tend to flow across the pavers of the present invention, but rather be consumed by the pavers, thereby reducing the flow of water collecting in drains and other conventional rainwater collection systems. This then reduces the onset of flash flooding in such regions, as the pavers themselves will hold/retain water that would have otherwise flowed into the drains.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">The pavers of the present invention can also be installed about trees/plants in footpaths and roadways so as to collect water and release the water to the underlying ground surface adjacent the tree/plant root system. This ensures that as rainfall or water provided to the tree/plant will not flow away from the plant but will be retained and released to the plant, increasing the health of the tree/plant and reducing the need to install root watering systems and other such devices, which generally require dedicated watering.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">Throughout the specification and claims the word &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; and its derivatives are intended to have an inclusive rather than exclusive meaning unless the contrary is expressly stated or the context requires otherwise. That is, the word &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; and its derivatives will be taken to indicate the inclusion of not only the listed components, steps or features that it directly references, but also other components, steps or features not specifically listed, unless the contrary is expressly stated or the context requires otherwise.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">Orientational terms used in the specification and claims such as vertical, horizontal, top, bottom, upper and lower are to be interpreted as relational and are based on the premise that the component, item, article, apparatus, device or instrument will usually be considered in a particular orientation, typically with the paver uppermost.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0054">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that many modifications and variations may be made to the methods of the invention described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
