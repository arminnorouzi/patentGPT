Linear hydrostatic bearings include a carriage and a guide rail upon which the carriage moves or slides. Typically, the rail is longer than the carriage, and has straight surfaces for the carriage to move along, creating single degree-of-freedom linear motion. The carriage contains bearing pads which each include a bearing pocket and a bearing land. The bearing pocket contains pressurized fluid which flows across the bearing land to separate the carriage and the rail by a thin film of the pressurized fluid preventing mechanical contact. The bearing lands have a width over which the pressure of the film drops from the pressure in the bearing pocket to atmospheric pressure. The film provides stiffness and reduced-friction motion between the carriage and rail. The fluid may be oil, water, or any other incompressible fluid that will separate the carriage and rail when placed under pressure in the bearing pocket.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As the carriage moves along the rail, the carriage follows the geometry of the rail surface. For example, if a rail surface has the general shape of an arc, rather than a straight line, then the carriage will follow the arc. Precision motion applications require straight, linear motion, and motion deviating from a straight line is classified as error motion. While error motion is undesirable, manufacturing a perfectly straight rail surface is not practical. Typically, rail surfaces are manufactured by machines that contain intrinsic error motions which directly affect the geometry of the rail surface. The machine error motions are typically not random but rather periodic in nature. For example, the arc discussed above could be described by a rail surface exhibiting a sinusoidal pattern with a certain spatial wavelength. If the wavelength sinusoidal pattern is small, error motion of the carriage is small due to an averaging effect of the fluid film stiffness, for instance, if the wavelength is much smaller, or shorter, than the bearing land width. Therefore, precise motion can be achieved by maintaining a low amplitude of periodic patterns in a rail surface, with wavelengths of the patterns being much smaller than the bearing land widths, in some examples. Achieving low amplitude periodic patterns is not always practical for manufacturing processes like surface grinding. Also, the bearing land width could be increased to reduce the effect of the periodic pattern, but increasing the bearing land width reduces bearing stiffness and is, therefore, not desired.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate an example of a hydrostatic linear bearing having six pairs of opposed bearing pads <b>18</b>, said bearing pads <b>18</b> having a rectangular shape. The bearing pads <b>18</b> are oriented parallel and opposed such that the force applied to the carriage <b>30</b> by the bearing pad <b>18</b> is equal and opposite creating zero force on the carriage <b>30</b> in the plane orthogonal to motion. The bearing pad <b>18</b> is of a rectangular shape with all pads <b>18</b> having an opposing pair, but other arrangements and numbers of the bearing pads <b>18</b> may be utilized to achieve zero force, such as dovetail rails and carriages. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are isometric views of a carriage <b>30</b> of the hydrostatic bearing, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is an isometric view of a carriage <b>30</b> combined with a guide rail <b>31</b> of the hydrostatic bearing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The hydrostatic bearing includes the carriage <b>30</b> and the guide rail <b>31</b>. The carriage <b>30</b> includes bearing pads <b>18</b> containing pressurized fluid. The fluid may be oil or water, or any incompressible fluid. The rail <b>31</b> may be any straight object that has a cross section about which the carriage <b>30</b> translates. The cross section may be a square, triangle, circle, or any shape such that the bearing pads <b>18</b> can be oriented so that the sum of forces created by the bearing pad <b>18</b> may sum to zero (an example of which is seen in European Patent No. 0 304 090).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The pressurized fluid flows over a bearing land <b>21</b> to create high stiffness and squeeze film damping. The gap between the bearing land <b>21</b> and the rail <b>31</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is, typically, on the order of 8 to 25 micrometers, but may be as small or large as necessary to create high stiffness and squeeze film damping. The pressurized fluid in the bearing pocket <b>20</b> may be restricted from a capillary restrictor <b>50</b>, orifice restrictor, or any type of restriction method. An example of a bearing pad <b>18</b> restricted by a capillary restrictor <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>. The restrictor <b>50</b> is placed between the supply pressure and the bearing pocket <b>20</b>. The bearing pocket <b>20</b> may be of any depth such that high stiffness and squeeze film damping is achieved across the bearing land <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For precision motion applications, such as the linear axis of a machine tool, the motion of the carriage <b>30</b> should be as straight as possible. The carriage <b>30</b> may have undesired motion, or error motion, if the rail surface is not geometrically straight in the direction of motion. The error motion may be a combination of two linear error motions, which are orthogonal to each other and orthogonal to the direction of travel, and three angular error motions termed roll, pitch, and yaw.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> are a simplified representation of a linear hydrostatic bearing that includes a carriage and rail. The bearing pad <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> is rectangular in shape, which is known in the prior art. The bearing rail surface has a periodic pattern of wavelength l and amplitude a. The nominal gap of the bearing being defined as h<sub>0</sub>, the bearing land width defined as B, the bearing land length defined as L, the supply pressure defined as p<sub>s</sub>, the atmospheric pressure defined as p<sub>a</sub>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the geometry of a rail surface is assumed to be a summation of periodic patterns <b>40</b> (an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>), then the error motion of the carriage <b>30</b> will be a summation of the error motions resulting from each periodic pattern <b>40</b>. The total error motion of the carriage <b>30</b>, therefore, will vary with the amplitudes and wavelengths of the periodic patterns <b>40</b>. The error motions occur when the carriage <b>30</b> traverses along the rail <b>31</b>, passing over the periodic pattern <b>40</b> in the rail <b>31</b> which, as a result, causes the effective force created by the squeeze film to change. The change in force results in a change in position of the carriage <b>30</b>, which is termed error motion.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The periodic pattern <b>40</b> of the rail <b>31</b> may derive from various sources. For instance, the rail <b>31</b> may be manufactured on a machine tool which itself has error motions. Those error motions will influence the rail <b>31</b> surface. Also, the tool shape utilized to manufacture the rail <b>31</b> may influence the rail <b>31</b> surface geometry. For example, a milling tool with a given number of cutting edges may create a pattern on the rail <b>31</b> surface as the milling tool machines the rail <b>31</b> surface. In another example, a grinding wheel on a surface grinding machine tool may not be round, therefore the oscillations of the wheel cause periodic structures on the rail <b>31</b> surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One approach to reducing the influence of the periodic patterns <b>40</b> on a rail <b>31</b> is to rotate, or skew, the rail <b>31</b> on the machine such that the straightness errors are not orthogonal to the rail <b>31</b> linear direction. But this approach is not always practical due to the space and size constraints of a machine tool. For instance, as the rail <b>31</b> is skewed, the required length of travel of a machine axis increases, which may exceed the machine tool length of travel. Also, the size of the mounting surface on the machine tool may not be adequate since the effective width of the rail <b>31</b> is increased as the rail <b>31</b> is skewed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another approach to minimizing the effect of periodic patterns <b>40</b> on the rail <b>31</b> surface is to position the periodic patterns <b>40</b> on opposing sides of rail <b>31</b> such that the changes in force are canceled. This technique is utilized for long wavelength errors, such as wavelengths longer than the rail <b>31</b> length. For example, the rail <b>31</b> surface may have an arc-like shape and the mirror image of the arc-like shape on the opposing rail surface. The force applied by each opposed pad <b>18</b> changes as the carriage <b>30</b> travels along the rail <b>31</b>, but the forces are always equal and opposite and therefore no error motion occurs, in some examples. This strategy is possible for long wavelengths, but for shorter wavelengths (e.g., shorter than the bearing land <b>21</b> width), this strategy is challenging. The alignment, or phase, of the periodic error is difficult to align on the machine tool.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The hydrostatic bearing of the present disclosure may address one or more of these deficiencies. According to one example, the hydrostatic bearing includes a carriage <b>30</b>, and a guide rail <b>31</b> that, when combined with the carriage <b>30</b>, provides for linear motion of the carriage <b>30</b> with respect to the guide rail <b>31</b>. The hydrostatic bearing is configured to transfer forces between the carriage <b>30</b> and the guide rail <b>31</b> without mechanical contact between the carriage <b>30</b> and the guide rail <b>31</b> by supplying pressurized, incompressible fluid to bearing pockets <b>20</b> in the carriage <b>30</b>. Each of the bearing pockets <b>20</b> is enclosed by a bearing land <b>21</b> of a bearing pad <b>18</b>, and the bearing pad <b>18</b> comprises the general shape of a parallelogram, a trapezoid, an arrow, or any other shape where the edges are generally not orthogonal to the direction of motion. The shape of the bearing pad <b>18</b> minimizes carriage error motion due to periodic patterns <b>40</b> in a bearing rail surface, in some examples. The shape also distributes the pressure intrinsically to minimize carriage error motion while maintaining stiffness, in some examples. Furthermore, the bearing pad <b>18</b> is for linear bearings, as opposed to rotary bearings.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate examples of linear hydrostatic bearing pad <b>18</b> shapes which may reduce the carriage error motion due to periodic rail straightness errors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the bearing pad <b>18</b> is in the shape of a parallelogram with no right angles. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the bearing pad <b>18</b> is in the shape of a trapezoid. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the bearing pad <b>18</b> is in the shape of an arrow.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As is mentioned above, in some examples, the shape of the bearing pad <b>18</b> (where the bearing pad <b>18</b> includes a bearing land <b>21</b> and a bearing pocket <b>20</b>) is such that the edges are generally not orthogonal to the direction of motion. For example, the rectangle can have a skew in the direction of travel to create a parallelogram shaped bearing pad <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). The skew of the bearing pad <b>18</b> is defined as the skew ratio, m, multiplied by the bearing land width, B. In some examples, the skew ratio, m, must be greater than zero to achieve shapes with edges that are not orthogonal to the direction of motion. A typical value of skew ratio is 1.0, but the value could be higher, such as 10.0. As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the bearing pad <b>18</b> has lines parallel to the direction of motion, but no lines orthogonal to the direction of motion. Furthermore, the bearing land <b>21</b> and the bearing pocket <b>20</b> may follow the shape of the bearing pad <b>18</b>, and therefore, the bearing land <b>21</b> and/or the bearing pocket <b>20</b> may also have no edges that are orthogonal to the direction of motion.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other examples, the bearing pad <b>18</b> can have a trapezoidal shape, which has no lines orthogonal to the direction of motion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. In further examples, the skew mB can have multiple occurrences across the bearing land <b>21</b> length, such as the arrow shape in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> which has 2 sections over the bearing land <b>21</b> length.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other bearing pad <b>18</b> shapes may be possible while still achieving lines that are generally not orthogonal to the direction of motion. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example linear hydrostatic bearing pad <b>18</b> shape that may reduce the carriage error motion due to periodic rail straightness errors where the bearing pad <b>18</b> is in the shape of an arrow with a small segment <b>42</b> oriented normal to the direction of travel. The skew of the bearing is defined as the skew ratio, m, multiplied by the bearing land width, B. As is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the bearing pad <b>18</b> is in the shape of an arrow with a small segment <b>42</b> of the bearing land <b>21</b> oriented normal (i.e., orthogonal) to the direction of travel such that the error motion of the carriage due to periodic patterns is still reduced. Therefore, a small amount of the bearing pad <b>18</b> can be orthogonal and still achieve the desired effect, in some examples.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref> are a simplified representation of an example linear hydrostatic bearing that includes a carriage and rail.

Example shapes of the bearing pad also shown on the graph with corresponding line type. The plot shows that as m increases, the change in force is reduced. The bearing can be assumed to have linear stiffness, therefore a reduction in the change in force results in a reduction of the error motion of the carriage.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This specification has been written with reference to various non-limiting and non-exhaustive examples.
