Hereinafter, user's inhalation of the material generated by the inhaler device is also referred to simply as &#x201c;inhalation&#x201d; or &#x201c;puff&#x201d;. A configuration example of the inhaler device will be described below.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An inhaler device according to the present configuration example generates an aerosol by heating a liquid aerosol source and heating a substrate including an aerosol source. The present configuration example will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a configuration example of the inhaler device according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an inhaler device <b>100</b> according to the present configuration example includes a power supply <b>111</b>, a sensor <b>112</b>, a notifier <b>113</b>, a memory <b>114</b>, a communicator <b>115</b>, a controller <b>116</b>, a liquid guide <b>122</b>, a liquid storage <b>123</b>, a heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b>, a heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>, a holder <b>140</b>, and a heat insulator <b>144</b>. Furthermore, the inhaler device <b>100</b> has an airflow path <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b>, the liquid guide <b>122</b>, and the liquid storage <b>123</b> are included in a cartridge <b>120</b>. The cartridge <b>120</b> is detachable from the inhaler device <b>100</b>. A user inhales in a state where the cartridge <b>120</b> is attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> and a stick substrate <b>150</b> is held by the holder <b>140</b>. The structural elements will be described below in order.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The power supply <b>111</b> stores electric power. The power supply <b>111</b> supplies electric power to the structural elements of the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The power supply <b>111</b> may be, for example, a rechargeable battery such as a lithium ion secondary battery. The power supply <b>111</b> may be charged by being connected to an external power supply by a universal serial bus (USB) or the like. Alternatively, the power supply <b>111</b> may be charged without connection with a power transmission side device by a wireless power transmission technology. Furthermore, only the power supply <b>111</b> may be detachable from the inhaler device <b>100</b> and may be replaced with a new power supply <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sensor <b>112</b> detects various items of information regarding the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The sensor <b>112</b> outputs the detected information to the controller <b>116</b>. In an example, the sensor <b>112</b> is a pressure sensor such as a condenser microphone, a flow sensor, or a temperature sensor. In a case where the sensor <b>112</b> detects a value generated in accordance with user's inhalation, the sensor <b>112</b> outputs information indicative of the user's inhalation to the controller <b>116</b>. In another example, the sensor <b>112</b> is an input device that receives information input by the user, such as a button or a switch. In particular, the sensor <b>112</b> can include a button for starting/stopping generation of an aerosol. The sensor <b>112</b> outputs the information input by the user to the controller <b>116</b>. In another example, the sensor <b>112</b> is a temperature sensor that detects a temperature of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. The temperature sensor detects the temperature of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>, for example, on the basis of an electric resistance value of a conductive track of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. The sensor <b>112</b> may detect a temperature of the stick substrate <b>150</b> held by the holder <b>140</b> on the basis of the temperature of the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The notifier <b>113</b> provides information to the user. In an example, the notifier <b>113</b> is a light-emitting device such as a light emitting diode (LED). In this case, the notifier <b>113</b> emits light in different patterns of light, for example, in a case where the power supply <b>111</b> needs to be charged, a case where the power supply <b>111</b> is being charged, and a case where an abnormality has occurred in the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The pattern of light is a concept including a color, a timing of ON/OFF, and the like. The notifier <b>113</b> may be a display device that displays an image, a sound output device that outputs sound, or a vibration device that vibrates together with or instead of the light-emitting device. In addition, the notifier <b>113</b> may provide information indicating that the user has become able to inhale. The information indicating that the user has become able to inhale is provided in a case where the temperature of the stick substrate <b>150</b> heated by the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> has reached a predetermined temperature.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The memory <b>114</b> stores various items of information for operation of the inhaler device <b>100</b>. The memory <b>114</b> is, for example, a non-volatile storage medium such as flash memory. An example of the information stored in the memory <b>114</b> is information concerning an Operating System (OS) of the inhaler device <b>100</b> such as contents of control of the structural elements by the controller <b>116</b>. Another example of the information stored in the memory <b>114</b> is information regarding user's inhalation such as the number of times of inhalation, an inhalation time, and an accumulated inhalation time period.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The communicator <b>115</b> is a communication interface for transmitting and receiving information between the inhaler device <b>100</b> and another device. The communicator <b>115</b> performs communication in conformity with any wired or wireless communication standard. Such a communication standard may be, for example, a wireless local area network (LAN), a wired LAN, Wi-Fi (registered trademark), or Bluetooth (registered trademark). In an example, the communicator <b>115</b> transmits information regarding user's inhalation to a smartphone to display the information regarding user's inhalation on the smartphone. In another example, the communicator <b>115</b> receives information regarding a new OS from a server to update information of the OS stored in the memory <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The controller <b>116</b> functions as an arithmetic processing unit and a control circuit, and controls the overall operations of the inhaler device <b>100</b> in accordance with various programs. The controller <b>116</b> includes an electronic circuit such as a central processing unit (CPU) or a microprocessor, for example. In addition, the controller <b>116</b> may include a read only memory (ROM) that stores programs and operation parameters to be used and a random access memory (RAM) that temporarily stores parameters that change as appropriate. The inhaler device <b>100</b> performs various kinds of processing under control of the controller <b>116</b>. Supply of electric power from the power supply <b>111</b> to the other structural elements, charging of the power supply <b>111</b>, detection of information by the sensor <b>112</b>, notification of information by the notifier <b>113</b>, storing and reading out of information by the memory <b>114</b>, and transmission and reception of information by the communicator <b>115</b> are examples of processing controlled by the controller <b>116</b>. Other processing performed by the inhaler device <b>100</b> such as input of information to the structural elements and processing based on information output from the structural elements is also controlled by the controller <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The liquid storage <b>123</b> stores an aerosol source. The aerosol source is atomized to generate an aerosol when heated. The aerosol source is, for example, a liquid such as polyhydric alcohol or water. Examples of the polyhydric alcohol include glycerine and propylene glycol. The aerosol source may further include a tobacco raw material or an extract derived from a tobacco raw material that emits a flavor component when heated. The aerosol source may further include nicotine. For the inhaler device <b>100</b> that is a medical inhaler such as a nebulizer, the aerosol source may include a medicine to be inhaled by a patient.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The liquid guide <b>122</b> guides, from the liquid storage <b>123</b>, the aerosol source that is the liquid stored in the liquid storage <b>123</b>, and holds the aerosol source. The liquid guide <b>122</b> is, for example, a wick formed by twining fiber material such as glass fiber or porous material such as porous ceramic. The liquid guide <b>122</b> is liquid-communicated with the liquid storage <b>123</b>. Accordingly, capillary action spreads the aerosol source stored in the liquid storage <b>123</b> to the whole liquid guide <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> heats the aerosol source to atomize the aerosol source and thus generate the aerosol. The heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> has any shape such as a coil shape, a film shape, or a blade shape and is made of any material such as a metal or a polyimide. The heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> is disposed close to the liquid guide <b>122</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> includes a coil wound around the liquid guide <b>122</b>. When the heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> produces heat, the aerosol source held by the liquid guide <b>122</b> is heated and atomized to generate the aerosol. The heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> produces heat when receiving electric power from the power supply <b>111</b>. In an example, the electric power may be supplied and the aerosol may be generated while user's inhalation is being detected by the sensor <b>112</b>. In another example, the electric power may be supplied and the aerosol may be generated in response to the sensor <b>112</b> detecting a predetermined user's input (e.g., pressing of the button for starting/stopping generation of the aerosol). Subsequently, the supply of the electric power may be stopped in response to the sensor <b>112</b> detecting a predetermined user's input (e.g., next pressing of the button for starting/stopping generation of the aerosol).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The holder <b>140</b> has an internal space <b>141</b> and holds the stick substrate <b>150</b> in a manner partially accommodated in the internal space <b>141</b>. The holder <b>140</b> has an opening <b>142</b> that allows the internal space <b>141</b> to communicate with outside. The holder <b>140</b> holds the stick substrate <b>150</b> that is inserted into the internal space <b>141</b> through the opening <b>142</b>. For example, the holder <b>140</b> is a tubular body having the opening <b>142</b> and a bottom <b>143</b> as a bottom surface, and defines the pillar-shaped internal space <b>141</b>. The holder <b>140</b> is configured such that an inside diameter thereof is smaller than an outside diameter of the stick substrate <b>150</b> at least at a part in a height direction of the tubular body, and can hold the stick substrate <b>150</b> in a manner such that the stick substrate <b>150</b> inserted into the internal space <b>141</b> is pressed from an outer circumference. The holder <b>140</b> also defines a flow path of air passing through the stick substrate <b>150</b>.

The aerosol source is atomized by heating, and thus the aerosol is generated. The aerosol source may be, for example, one derived from tobacco such as shredded tobacco or a tobacco raw material processed in a granular shape, a sheet shape, or a powder shape. Furthermore, the aerosol source may include one not derived from tobacco created from a plant (e.g., mint or a herb) other than tobacco. In an example, the aerosol source may include a flavor component such as menthol. In a case where the inhaler device <b>100</b> is a medical inhaler, the aerosol source may include a medicine to be inhaled by a patient. Note that the aerosol source is not limited to a solid and may be, for example, a liquid such as polyhydric alcohol or water. Examples of the polyhydric alcohol include glycerine and propylene glycol. At least a part of the substrate <b>151</b> is accommodated in the internal space <b>141</b> of the holder <b>140</b> in a state where the stick substrate <b>150</b> is held by the holder <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The inhalation port <b>152</b> is a member held in a user's mouth during inhalation.

When the user inhales with the inhalation port <b>152</b> protruding from the opening <b>142</b> in his/her mouth, air flows into the holder <b>140</b> through the air inlet hole (not illustrated). The air passes through the internal space <b>141</b> of the holder <b>140</b>, that is, passes through the substrate <b>151</b>, and the air and an aerosol generated from the substrate <b>151</b> reach inside the mouth of the user.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> heats the aerosol source to atomize the aerosol source and thus generate the aerosol.

In particular, the inhaler device <b>100</b> generates the aerosol by using two substrates, that is, a first substrate and a second substrate. Hereinafter, a user's action of inhaling the aerosol generated by the inhaler device <b>100</b> by using the inhaler device <b>100</b> is also referred to simply as inhalation (puff) or an inhaling action. An example of the puff is inhaling with the inhalation port <b>152</b> of the stick substrate <b>150</b> inserted into the inhaler device <b>100</b> in his or her mouth. The user can inhale the aerosol generated by the inhaler device <b>100</b> by puffing.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> is an example of a first heater that heats the aerosol source contained in the first substrate. When the aerosol source contained in the first substrate is heated by the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>, the aerosol is generated. The stick substrate <b>150</b> is an example of the first substrate. The stick substrate <b>150</b> contains a flavor source that emits a flavor component when heated. An example of the flavor component is an extract of tobacco leaves. Hereinafter, the heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> is also referred to as a stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> is an example of a second heater that heats the aerosol source contained in the second substrate. When the aerosol source contained in the second substrate is heated by the heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b>, the aerosol is generated. The cartridge <b>120</b> is an example of the second substrate containing the liquid aerosol source. The cartridge <b>120</b> can contain a flavor source that emits a flavor component when heated. An example of the flavor component is menthol. Hereinafter, the heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> is also referred to as a cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The aerosol generated by the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> is also referred to as a stick-side aerosol. Meanwhile, the aerosol generated by the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> is also referred to as a cartridge-side aerosol. In a case where the stick-side aerosol and the cartridge-side aerosol need not be distinguished from each other, the stick-side aerosol and the cartridge-side aerosol are collectively referred to simply as an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the user puffs, the cartridge-side aerosol passes through the stick substrate <b>150</b> and reaches the inside of the mouth of the user.

The heating profile is information that defines a relationship between an elapsed period from start of heating by the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> and a temperature of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. The controller <b>116</b> controls the heater <b>121</b> so that a temperature change similar to a temperature change in the heating profile is realized in the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. The stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> may include a conductive track including a resistor, and the sensor <b>112</b> may detect the temperature of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> on the basis of electric resistance of the conductive track. The control of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> can be realized, for example, by controlling supply of electric power from the power supply <b>111</b> to the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. The control of the supply of electric power may be performed, for example, by pulse width modulation (PWM) control.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Heating performed by the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> can be classified into preliminary heating and main heating. The preliminary heating is heating performed until a predetermined period elapses from start of heating according to the heating profile or until the temperature of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> reaches a predetermined temperature. The main heating is heating performed after the preliminary heating. Note that the preliminary heating and the main heating may be the same or may be different in terms of contents of PWM control. For example, the preliminary heating and the main heating may be the same or may be different in terms of a duty ratio.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It is assumed that the aerosol is sufficiently generated from the stick substrate <b>150</b> at a timing of end of the preliminary heating. Accordingly, the user can inhale a sufficient amount of aerosol by inhaling with the stick substrate <b>150</b> in his or her mouth after the preliminary heating (that is, during the main heating). Note that the aerosol can be generated from the stick substrate <b>150</b> even during the preliminary heating.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The controller <b>116</b> starts heating of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> in a case where a predetermined condition (hereinafter also referred to as a first predetermined condition) is satisfied. An example of the first predetermined condition is a condition that the sensor <b>112</b> has detected a predetermined user's operation. An example of the predetermined user's operation is an operation of pressing a button provided on the inhaler device <b>100</b>.

The atomization setting is information that defines an amount of atomization per puff. The amount of atomization is an amount of generated cartridge-side aerosol. The amount of atomization depends on an amount of heating (that is, an amount of supplied electric power). Therefore, the control of the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> can be realized, for example, by controlling supply of electric power from the power supply <b>111</b> to the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b>. The control of the supply of electric power is performed, for example, by controlling an amount of supplied electric power per puff. The amount of supplied electric power per puff is calculated as a product of an electric power supply period and an amount of supplied electric power per unit time. Therefore, the atomization setting may be defined by the electric power supply period and the amount of supplied electric power per unit time.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The controller <b>116</b> controls the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> to perform heating in a case where a predetermined condition (hereinafter also referred to as a second predetermined condition) is satisfied. For example, the controller <b>116</b> supplies electric power to the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> in a case where the second predetermined condition is satisfied. An example of the second predetermined condition is a condition that the user has puffed. According to this configuration, the aerosol can be efficiently generated only when the user puffs.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The puff can be detected by the sensor <b>112</b> on the basis of a value generated in accordance with user's inhalation acquired by a pressure sensor such as a condenser microphone, a flow sensor, or a temperature sensor.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, the second predetermined condition may include a condition that the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> has started heating. In particular, it is desirable that the second predetermined condition includes a condition that the main heating is being performed. According to this configuration, the cartridge-side aerosol is not generated until the temperature of the stick substrate <b>150</b> rises. It is therefore possible to prevent a situation where the cartridge-side aerosol is cooled and condensed while passing through the stick substrate <b>150</b> and the stick substrate <b>150</b> is wetted and deteriorates. Furthermore, it is possible to keep electric power consumption small.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Needless to say, the second predetermined condition may be a combination of the plurality of conditions described above. For example, the second predetermined condition may be a condition that the main heating is being performed and the user has puffed. In this case, the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> performs heating at a timing of a puff during a period after start of the main heating and before the end of the main heating.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">(2) Control According to Substrate Pair</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The controller <b>116</b> controls operation of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> and operation of the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> on the basis of a combination (hereinafter also referred to as a substrate pair) of the stick substrate <b>150</b> and the cartridge <b>120</b>. Specifically, the controller <b>116</b> controls supply of electric power to the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> and the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> by the power supply <b>111</b> on the basis of the substrate pair. In particular, the controller <b>116</b> controls operation of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> and operation of the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> on the basis of the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> (that is, used for generation of the aerosol). Compatibility between the flavor component contained in the stick-side aerosol and the flavor component contained in the cartridge-side aerosol may be good or may be poor. According to the above configuration, flavor of the aerosol which the user tastes can be made appropriate since control can be performed according to whether the compatibility is good or poor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Some substrate pairs may be appropriate, while others may be inappropriate. It is assumed that in a case where the substrate pair is appropriate, flavor of the aerosol is appropriate. Note that the appropriate flavor is flavor pleasant to the user such as flavor palatable to the taste of the user. On the other hand, it is assumed that in a case where the substrate pair is inappropriate, the flavor of the aerosol is inappropriate. Note that the inappropriate flavor is flavor unpleasant to the user such as unbalanced miscellaneous flavor.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In view of this, the controller <b>116</b> determines whether or not the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> is appropriate. For example, the controller <b>116</b> compares the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> with a substrate pair regarded as being appropriate stored in advance. This determination can be made by referring to a look-up table including information indicative of the substrate pair regarded as being appropriate. In a case where the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> matches the substrate pair regarded as being appropriate stored in advance, the controller <b>116</b> determines that the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> is appropriate. On the other hand, in a case where the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> does not match the substrate pair regarded as being appropriate stored in advance, the controller <b>116</b> determines that the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> is inappropriate. In a case where the stick substrate <b>150</b> or the cartridge <b>120</b> is not attached, it is determined that the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b> is inappropriate.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Hereinafter, this determination is also referred to as authentication processing.

According to the configuration, the authentication processing is not performed in a case where the power button is pressed accidentally, for example, in a case where the power button is pressed momentarily. It is therefore possible to keep electric power consumption small.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">A period it takes to perform the authentication processing is also referred to as an authentication time. It is desirable that a difference (1 second in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) between the first period and the second period is equal to or more than the authentication time. According to this configuration, the authentication time can be included in the period of the holding down of the power button originally required for start of the preliminary heating. As a result, the authentication time elapses while the user is holding down the power button to start the preliminary heating, and therefore a user's waiting period can be shortened since the authentication processing has been already performed.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Note that in a case where the predetermined user's input is no longer detected before the period for which the predetermined user's input is continuously detected reaches the first period, a result of the authentication processing is made invalid even in a case where the authentication processing has been completed. For example, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in a case where it is determined that authentication has succeeded and the holding down of the power button is interrupted before elapse of 3 seconds from start of the holding down of the power button, the success of the authentication is made invalid. Accordingly, to start the preliminary heating, it is necessary to hold down the power button for 3 seconds again, and the authentication processing is also performed again.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The controller <b>116</b> may perform the authentication processing after start of heating by the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, the controller <b>116</b> regularly performs the authentication processing after start of the preliminary heating. According to this configuration, in a case where the stick substrate <b>150</b> or the cartridge <b>120</b> is replaced after start of the preliminary heating, it can be determined whether or not the substrate pair after the replacement is appropriate.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The controller <b>116</b> may stop heating by the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> in a case where the authentication processing has failed. According to this configuration, in a case where the substrate pair becomes inappropriate as a result of replacement of the stick substrate <b>150</b> or the cartridge <b>120</b> after start of the preliminary heating, generation of the aerosol is stopped. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the user from tasting the inappropriate flavor and to keep electric power consumption small. Furthermore, it is also possible to prevent the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> from performing heating although the stick substrate <b>150</b> is not inserted, that is, prevent heating in an empty state.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">(4) Identification of Substrate</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The stick substrate <b>150</b> may be given identification information for identifying the stick substrate <b>150</b>.

It is apparent that a person skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains can arrive at various changes or modifications within the technical idea described in the claims, and it should be understood that these changes or modifications are encompassed within the technical scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">For example, although an example in which whether or not to permit heating is controlled in accordance with a result of the authentication processing has been described in the above embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this example. For example, the controller <b>116</b> may control at least one of an amount of electric power supplied to the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> when heating by the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> is performed and/or an amount of electric power supplied to the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> in a case where heating by the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> is performed on the basis of the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b>. That is, the controller <b>116</b> may control at least one of the heating profile and/or the atomization setting on the basis of the substrate pair attached to the inhaler device <b>100</b>. An appropriate mixture ratio of the cartridge-side aerosol and the stick-side aerosol may vary depending on the substrate pair. In this respect, according to this configuration, it is possible to realize an appropriate mixture ratio of the cartridge-side aerosol and the stick-side aerosol and thereby make the flavor of the aerosol appropriate.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">For example, although an example in which the inhaler device <b>100</b> has both of the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b> and the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> has been described in the above embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this example. For example, the inhaler device <b>100</b> may have the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> and may be configured not to have the stick heater <b>121</b>-<b>2</b>. In this case, the inhaler device <b>100</b> may control operation of the cartridge heater <b>121</b>-<b>1</b> on the basis of the substrate pair. According to this configuration, the cartridge-side aerosol can take in the flavor component derived from the stick substrate <b>150</b> while passing through the stick substrate <b>150</b>.

In another example, supply of electric power to structural elements such as the sensor <b>112</b> and the communicator <b>115</b> may be permitted or prohibited on the basis of the substrate pair. By thus switching operation of the inhaler device <b>100</b> regarding any control target in accordance with whether or not the substrate pair is appropriate, operation of the inhaler device <b>100</b>, which is a hybrid inhaler device, can be made more appropriate.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Note that the series of processes performed by each device described herein may be realized by using software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware.
