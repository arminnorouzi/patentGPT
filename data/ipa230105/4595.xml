Selecting an appropriate image to pair with text provided by a user may be a challenging and laborious process, given the large number of images available to an internet user.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other methods of searching for images require the user to select or identify discrete search terms to find the image and/or search amongst all images on the internet. Those methods do not account for the themes or emotions associated with the sentiment or subject of the text and, as a result, fail to find appropriate images best paired with the user's text. Additionally, such image searches are ad hoc and one-off, not taking into account the prior activity of the user and/or others relating specifically to publishing user's thoughts.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, an automated method for choosing images to pair with a user's text may be desirable. A service to publish and share such thoughts, and to track them so that images for future thoughts may be better chosen, may be similarly desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system for selecting an image to accompany text from a user in connection with a social media post.

A &#x201c;post&#x201d; may be text displayed along with media, where the text and/or media may be supplied by the user. The media may be an image, video, and/or audio. The post may include associated search terms that may be supplied by the user and/or generated by the system. Some or all of the post may be created by a user and may be published so as to be viewable by the user and possibly others. In Step <b>1</b> of the post creation process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the user may input text. In one aspect, the user may optionally also input one or more search terms relating to the post. In another aspect, the system may select search terms based on the text, and the user may optionally edit or add search terms. Each search term may be one or more words included in or associated with the post. In Step <b>2</b>, based on one or more of the text, the search terms, and posts by the user and/or other users, the system may identify candidate images to accompany the post. This identification process is described in more detail below. In Step <b>3</b>, the user may select one of the candidate images or may select or input another image. In Step <b>4</b>, the user finalizes the post and publishes it using the system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart of a configuration process wherein a corpus of posts are built that may be used to identify one or more candidate images to associate with text in future posts. In Step <b>11</b>, the system may access or compile posts, for example posts for which the system has text and search terms. The text and corresponding search terms for a post may be stored in a document. In Step <b>12</b>, each post may be tokenized into the individual words in the post. Step <b>12</b> may include the removal of stop words (which may include certain short or less critical words such as &#x201c;the,&#x201d; &#x201c;is,&#x201d; &#x201c;at,&#x201d; &#x201c;which,&#x201d; and &#x201c;on&#x201d;) and/or may include the normalization of ASCII emoticons in the post. In one aspect of the invention, the system may perform stemming to reduce words to their stem (or base, or root) form for better evaluation. In Step <b>13</b>, each word may be assigned a positive integer value. In one aspect, the words may be assigned an integer value without regard to the case of the letters with which the word was written (e.g. Sample, sample, and SAMPLE would receive the same integer value). In Step <b>14</b>, each document d may be mapped to a vector v=&#x192;(d) in an N-dimensional vector space V, where N may be, in one aspect, the number of distinct positive integers in the document or any set of unique values could be used as a vector space. &#x192; may be a function that receives a sentence/document d and outputs a vector where the value of each word b_i may be the number of times b_i appears in d multiplied by the fraction of 1/(the number of times b_i appears in the entire corpus). This process is known as bag-of-words representation, weighted by TF-IDF, also known as term frequency-inverse document frequency. This process helps identify unusual or less-common words that may be indicative or unique thoughts in the text, while ignoring more commonly occurring words.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Once the corpus is built, it may be used to find prior posts similar to the new post currently being submitted to the system, so that similar images can be located and presented to the user creating the new post. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting the image identification and selection process after text for a new post has been submitted by the user. In Step <b>21</b>, the text of the post may be sent from the user client to the server. In one aspect, the system, including the methods depicted herein, may run on a server, and the server may periodically communicate with a plurality of clients allowing users to read and write posts. In Step <b>22</b>, the text of the submitted post may be mapped to vector space V to identify similar posts. This may be the same vector space as discussed with reference to Step <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In Step <b>23</b>, the system searches for similar posts in the corpus. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, this list may include a predetermined number of most similar posts, e.g., <b>100</b>, or may use another threshold determining factor to identify similar posts. The similar posts may be limited to those with known search terms. In accordance with one aspect, similar posts are identified using cosine similarity as the distance function (i.e., the measure of the angle between the two vectors representing the two posts). In Step <b>24</b>, the system determines whether a threshold number of similar posts exist. If not (&#x201c;No&#x201d;, Step <b>24</b>), then in Step <b>32</b> the system may perform a sentiment analysis on the post text that will output a sentiment of the content of the text. In one aspect, if the sentiment analysis deems the text to have a positive emotional sentiment, then the sentiment analysis may output positive emotional terms such as &#x201c;sunlight&#x201d; and &#x201c;smile&#x201d;. If the sentiment analysis deems the text to have a negative emotional sentiment, then the sentiment analysis may output negative emotional terms such as &#x201c;cold&#x201d; and &#x201c;dark&#x201d;. The output of the sentiment analysis may be saved as search terms to correspond with the post. Once those search terms are known, the system may perform a search on one or more image provider databases using the search term(s) in Step <b>30</b>, and the resulting candidate images are received in Step <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">If similar, the results from a similarity search exist (&#x201c;Yes&#x201d;, Step <b>24</b>), then in step <b>25</b>, a list of the most similar posts with known search terms may be retrieved. Once the list of similar posts is received, the least similar posts are removed from the list in Step <b>26</b>. This may be done by generating a similarity score. In one aspect, posts with a similarity score below a predetermined threshold, e.g., less than 0.5, will be removed. In another aspect, relative thresholds may be used such that posts are only considered similar if they are within a relative threshold of similarity to the best matching similar post. In another aspect, a post can be considered to have a greater degree of similarity to another post based on multiple appearances of the same search term. For each post with a similarity score over the threshold, the search terms of that post, which may have been defined by the user who published the post or by another entity, are retrieved in Step <b>27</b>. In Step <b>28</b>, the list of search terms may be sorted by the number of times each search term occurs in all of the remaining similar posts and the list may be de-duplicated. In Step <b>29</b>, a number (e.g., four) of search terms present most often in the most similar posts may be returned. Once those search terms are selected, a search may be run on image provider databases using the search term(s) with the highest similarity score(s) in Step <b>30</b>, and the resulting candidate images are returned in Step <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Candidate images may be displayed to the user on the client device, during the search and/or after the search is completed. The user may preview a candidate image with the user's accompanying text. In one aspect, the system may track the use of images. The system may eliminate as candidates certain images, for example, images that have been selected by users for use with posts more than a predetermined number of times, within a predetermined time period and/or geographic region.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one aspect, the system presents the user with one or more alternative candidate images from which the user may further choose. Alternative candidate images may be presented in the order they are returned from the image service. In another aspect, the alternative candidate images may be derived from the search terms and may be sorted by characteristics such as accessibility, size, and/or speed of retrieval. For example, images may be retrieved faster via HTTP than HTTPS, and smaller images may load faster than larger images. Accessibility may be determined, for example, by retrieving the image, by sending a &#x201c;HEAD&#x201d; HTTP command, or by making a TCP socket connection to the server.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Once the user selects an image, the user may decide to publish the post, after which the post may be added to the corpus of posts in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The image that was published with the post, or a link (e.g., a URL) thereto, may also be stored. As discussed above, the source image (and/or a link) may also be stored for the purposes of prohibiting repeated frequent use of that image, e.g., by region and/or by user.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting another image identification and selection process after text for a new post has been submitted by the user. In Step <b>41</b>, the text of the post may be sent from the user client to the server. In one aspect, the system, including the methods depicted herein, may run on a server, and the server may periodically communicate with a plurality of clients allowing users to read and write posts. In Step <b>42</b>, the text of the submitted post may be mapped to vector space V to identify similar posts. This may be the same vector space as discussed with reference to Step <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In Step <b>43</b>, the system searches for similar posts in the corpus. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, this list may include a predetermined number of most similar posts, e.g., <b>100</b>, or may use another threshold determining factor to identify similar posts. The similar posts may be limited to those with known search terms. In accordance with one aspect, similar posts are identified using cosine similarity as the distance function (i.e., the measure of the angle between the two vectors representing the two posts). In Step <b>44</b>, the system selects search terms from the similar posts. In so doing, the system may not select as search terms certain words deemed unhelpful or non-informational. Once search terms are selected, a search may be run on image provider databases using the search term(s) with the highest similarity score(s) in Step <b>30</b>, and the resulting candidate images are returned in Step <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a general purpose computer on which the system and method of the present disclosure may be implemented.
