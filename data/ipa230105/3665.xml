The following description of background art will cite reference signs in Patent Document 1 in parentheses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1 discloses a technique for causing an application unit (<b>20</b>) to apply a coating agent to a target surface (<b>91</b>), causing an image capture device (<b>40</b>) to capture an image of the coating agent applied to the target surface (<b>91</b>), and inspecting the state of the coating agent based on the thus captured image.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this type of inspection, the image capture device (<b>40</b>) captures an image while an illumination device emits light toward the coating agent applied to the target surface (<b>91</b>). If it is detected that a shadow is cast on the surface of the coating agent based on the captured image, it is determined that the surface of the coating agent is uneven and the coating agent has not been appropriately applied to the target surface (<b>91</b>).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If the target surface has an uneven portion, such as a welded portion or a joint between members, a shadow may be cast on the surface of the coating agent due to the uneven portion. For this reason, a technique such as that described above may lead to an erroneous determination that a failure has occurred in the application of the coating agent even though the coating agent was appropriately applied to the target surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is, therefore, a desire for a technique that enables appropriate inspection of the state of a coating agent applied to a target surface even if the target surface has an uneven portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing, a characteristic configuration of an inspection device lies in that</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">an inspection device for inspecting a state of a coating agent applied to a target surface having an uneven portion includes:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">an image capture device configured to capture an image of a predetermined inspection target region of the target surface; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">an illumination device configured to emit light possible to be captured by the image capture device, toward the inspection target region,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">wherein the illumination device includes:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">a first light source configured to emit diffuse light toward an entirety of the inspection target region; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">a second light source configured to emit direct light toward a shadow that is cast by the uneven portion due to emission of the diffuse light by the first light source.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">According to this characteristic configuration, the first light source emits diffuse light toward the entire inspection target region of the target surface with the coating agent applied thereto. The second light source emits direct light to the shadow that is cast by the uneven portion of the target surface due to the emission of diffuse light. This reduces the shadow that is cast by the uneven portion of the target surface due to the emission of diffuse light by the first light source. It is, therefore, possible to reduce the likelihood of erroneously determining that a failure has occurred in the application of the coating agent despite the coating agent having been appropriately applied to the target surface. Accordingly, the state of the coating agent applied to the target surface can be appropriately inspected even if the target surface has an uneven portion.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an inspection device and a coating apparatus equipped with the same according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a main part of the inspection device and the coating apparatus equipped with the same according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a control block diagram of the coating apparatus according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a captured image of an inspection target region that includes an uneven portion in a target surface that is captured with a first light source emitting diffuse light, and a captured image that is captured with the first light source emitting diffuse light and a second light source emitting direct light.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0020">A coating apparatus <b>100</b> according to the embodiment is described below with reference to the drawings.

The control device <b>10</b> in this example calculates the relative position of the inspection device <b>3</b> with respect to the current target surface S, based on the captured image IM. Here, a movement path of the drive unit <b>2</b> is preset through teaching, for example, and the appropriate relative position of the inspection device <b>3</b> with respect to the target surface S is set. For this reason, the control device <b>10</b> in this example controls the drive unit <b>2</b> through the position correction control such that the relative position of the inspection device <b>3</b> with respect to the current target surface S is the preset relative position. It is preferable that the position correction control is performed based on the distance to the target surface S that is measured by the distance measuring device <b>6</b> in addition to the captured image IM.

The plurality of second light-emitting units <b>521</b> in this example are light-emitting diodes.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">In the present embodiment, the second light source <b>52</b> can change the direction in which direct light is emitted. More specifically, the second light source <b>52</b> can change the direction in which direct light is emitted, relative to the direction in which the image capture device <b>4</b> captures an image. In this example, the second support <b>92</b> of the support member <b>9</b> supports a holder <b>53</b>, which holds the second light source <b>52</b>, such that the holder <b>53</b> can rotate about an axis Ax that is parallel to the first direction X. Note that the control device <b>10</b> controls the rotation of the holder <b>53</b> in this example. Here, it is preferable that the direction in which the second light source <b>52</b> emits direct light is set to be parallel to a direction orthogonal to, or almost orthogonal to, the region of the target surface S in which a shadow is cast due to the emission of diffuse light by the first light source <b>51</b>. It is preferable that, if the region where a shadow is cast is a curved surface, the direction in which the second light source <b>52</b> emits direct light is set to be parallel to a direction orthogonal to, or almost orthogonal to, the center region of the shadow. The control device <b>10</b> controls the angle of the holder <b>53</b> such that the direction in which the second light source <b>52</b> emits direct light is as close as possible to a direction orthogonal to the region where a shadow is cast due to the emission of diffuse light by the first light source <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">In the present embodiment, the direct light illuminance, namely the illuminance of direct light emitted by the second light source <b>52</b> is set in accordance with the uneven portion (e.g., the protruding portion Sa, the step portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the target surface S. Further, the diffuse light illuminance, namely the illuminance of diffuse light emitted by the first light source <b>51</b>, is set in accordance with the direct light illuminance. The direct light illuminance is set based on the height (the dimension in the third direction Z) and/or the widths (the dimensions in the first direction X and the second direction Y) of the protruding portion Sa, for example. The diffuse light illuminance is set to a value that is smaller than the value of the direct light illuminance, for example. Note that the control device <b>10</b> changes the direct light illuminance and the diffuse light illuminance in this example. Note that the direct light illuminance and the diffuse light illuminance are set within a range in which lens flare does not occur in the image capture device <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">The second light source <b>52</b> in the present embodiment is located at a position that allows the second light source <b>52</b> to emit light from the plurality of second light-emitting units <b>521</b> toward the inspection target region A through the light guiding plate <b>511</b>.

The image capture device <b>4</b> in this example faces the diffusion face <b>511</b><i>b </i>of the light guiding plate <b>511</b> in the third direction Z. In other words, the image capture device <b>4</b> overlaps the light guiding plate <b>511</b> as viewed in a direction parallel to the third direction Z.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">The first light source <b>51</b> in the present embodiment covers at least a portion of the opening <b>7</b><i>a </i>in the housing <b>7</b>.

The second light source then emits direct light toward a shadow that is cast by the uneven portion of the target surface due to the emission of diffuse light. This reduces the shadow that is cast by the uneven portion of the target surface due to the emission of diffuse light by the first light source. Thus, it is possible to reduce the likelihood of an erroneous determination indicating that a failure has occurred in the application of the coating agent despite the coating agent having been appropriately applied to the target surface. Accordingly, the state of the coating agent applied to the target surface can be appropriately inspected even if the target surface has an uneven portion.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">Here, it is preferable that the direct light emitted by the second light source has a direct light illuminance that is determined in accordance with the uneven portion, and</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">the diffuse light emitted by the first light source has an illuminance that is determined in accordance with the direct light illuminance.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">According to this configuration, an appropriate lightness for image capture by the image capture device can be set in the inspection target region.

This reduces the influence of ambient light on the image capture device. Further, the inspection target region can be easily covered by the housing when the image capture device captures an image of the inspection target region. This reduces the influence of ambient light on the inspection target region.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">In addition, this configuration enables the first light source for emitting diffuse light toward the inspection target region to be brought closer to the inspection target region than the second light source for emitting direct light toward the inspection target region. Thus, the inspection target region can easily be set in an appropriate state for image capture by the image capture device.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0085">It is preferable that the second light source includes a plurality of second light-emitting units in a linear arrangement,</p><p id="p-0083" num="0086">the first light source includes:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0087">a light guiding plate that is translucent and has a flat plate shape; and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0088">a plurality of first light-emitting units located around the light guiding plate and configured to emit light toward the light guiding plate, and</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0084" num="0089">the light guiding plate is configured to diffuse the light from the plurality of first light-emitting units toward the inspection target region.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0090">According to this configuration, the first light source includes a light guiding plate having a flat plate shape, and a plurality of first light-emitting units located around the light guiding plate.

This enables diffuse light of the first light source and direct light of the second light source to be appropriately emitted toward the inspection target region.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0095">According to this configuration, the image capture device captures an image of the inspection target region through the light guiding plate.
