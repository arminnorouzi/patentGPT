No. 16/811,782, filed on Mar. 6, 2020, which is a continuation of prior International Application No. PCT/JP2018034480 filed on Sep. 18, 2018; the entire contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments relate to a photoelectric conversion element.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An organic/inorganic hybrid semiconductor such as an organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite compound is expected to be applied to photoelectric conversion elements such as a photovoltaics, a light emitting element, a photosensor, and an electromagnetic-wave sensor. An example of the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite compound is a compound having a composition expressed, for example, by ABX<sub>3</sub>. A B site is a divalent cation, and its examples include lead, tin and the like. In particular, a photoelectric conversion element using an organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite compound using lead has high photoelectric conversion efficiency. Further, a photoelectric conversion element using the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite compound as an active layer can be manufactured at low temperature, and thus a substrate made of resin or the like can be used. Therefore, a light-weight and flexible photoelectric conversion element can be realized, thereby making it possible to install, for example, a conventional heavy silicon photovoltaics using a glass substrate which is insufficient in load-bearing capacity, on a building on which the photovoltaics was not able to be installed so far.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, since lead is harmful, it is necessary to prevent lead from leaking due to, for example, breakage of the photovoltaics installed on the building. In particular, in the case of using resin or the like for a substrate, the substrate is likely to break and an encapsulating material is likely to peel off due to the influence of hailstorm or typhoon, resulting in leakage of lead. Further, the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite compound is high in solubility in water, so that lead is likely to dissolve out, for example, by rainfall. ABX<sub>3 </sub>is known to be easily decomposed into BX<sub>2 </sub>due to the presence of water, and BX<sub>2 </sub>being a decomposition product is also high in solubility in water. Examples of the harmful substance constituting the photoelectric conversion element include CdS, CdTe, CGS, GaAs and the like which are used as an active layer material, and lead and the like contained in solder used for a wiring material. The solubility of CdS with respect to 100 ml of neutral water is about 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>g, whereas the solubility of BX<sub>2 </sub>being the decomposition product of the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite compound by water is about 1-10- to 1-10<sup>0 </sup>g, which is high solubility as compared with those of the other harmful substances constituting the photoelectric conversion element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a dye-sensitized photovoltaics using an electrolytic solution, the electrolytic solution is liquid, so that it is necessary to prevent leakage of the harmful substance due to, for example, breakage of the photovoltaics installed on the building. As explained above, a technique is demanded which prevents the leakage of the harmful substance due to the breakage of the photoelectric conversion element containing the harmful substance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of a photoelectric conversion element:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of a photoelectric conversion layer;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of a compound layer:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view illustrating a breakage example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a chart illustrating a typical chemical reaction formula of foaming polyurethane;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a chart illustrating a typical chemical reaction formula of foaming polyurea;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a chart illustrating a typical chemical reaction formula of one-component moisture-curing polyurethane;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element; and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a view illustrating a structure example of the photoelectric conversion element.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A photoelectric conversion element in an embodiment comprises: a photoelectric conversion layer; a first compound layer including a first supporting member and a first compound, the first compound being supported by the first supporting member, being not in contact with the photoelectric conversion layer, and being liquid or gelatinous in an environment to use the element; and a second compound layer including a second supporting member and a second compound, the second compound being supported by the second supporting member, being not in contact with the photoelectric conversion layer and the first compound, and being liquid or gelatinous in the environment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, embodiments will be explained with reference to the drawings.

For example, in the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the substrate <b>11</b><i>b </i>is provided on the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b> in the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b>, and the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>is provided on the side opposite to the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b> in the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b>. Thus, in the case where the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>contains a substance absorbing the light <b>2</b>, a decrease in light entrance/exit efficiency (namely, photoelectric conversion efficiency) can be suppressed. Further, since the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>is not irradiated with light, a deterioration due to light irradiation of the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>can be suppressed. Further, prevention of the direct contact of the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>with the active layer <b>103</b> can suppress a deterioration of performances even in the case of the combination in which they deteriorate their performances with each other due to the contact.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">In the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>is provided on the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b> in the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b>, and the substrate <b>11</b><i>a </i>is provided on the side opposite to the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b> in the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b>. The photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> is often installed such that the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b> faces the front side. For example, in the case of installing the photovoltaics on the roof, the photovoltaics is installed such that the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b> faces the front side so that the sunlight is likely to be incident thereon. Accordingly, when the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> is flawed due to the hailstorm or the like, the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> is more likely to be flawed from the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b>. In the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, since the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>is provided on the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b>, namely, the side where the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> is more likely to be flawed, the probability of closing the broken part of the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> can be increased. Further, in the case of installing the photoelectric conversion element <b>1</b> with the main entrance/exit side of the light <b>2</b> directed in the direction opposite to the gravitational direction, for example, in the case of installing the photovoltaics to be directed in the direction of the sum (the direction opposite to the gravitational direction), and when the compound layer <b>12</b><i>d </i>is flawed and the compound <b>126</b> flows out, the compound flows toward the broken part of the photoelectric conversion layer <b>10</b> according to the gravity.
