In some embodiments, each CORESET may be semi-statically configured (or otherwise configured) with one or more TCI states, and a MAC CE may dynamically indicate an active TCI state from the configured TCI states for the CORESET. In certain embodiments, the TCI states provide information on QCL relationships between the DL RS in one RS set and PDCCH DMRS ports. In one embodiment, each CORESET has a configuration parameter tci-PresentInDCI. If at least spatial QCL is configured and/or indicated, the configuration parameter tci-PresentInDCI may indicate whether a TCI field is present in DL related DCI (e.g., a TCI indication in DCI to be applied to PDSCH scheduled by the DCI).

In certain embodiments, if one or more PDCCHs carrying the same DCI content have a same CCE aggregation level (e.g., the same or similar channel coding rate), a UE may soft combine channel bit LLRs to improve a decoding accuracy. In various embodiments, if one or more PDCCHs carrying the same DCI content have different CCE aggregation levels, a UE may soft combine channel bit LLRs in a soft buffer because the DCI is encoded using a same base or mother channel code with a different level of rate matching resulting in different coded bit sizes corresponding to the different aggregation levels. In some embodiments, a UE may combine information bit LLRs of one or more corresponding PDCCH decoder outputs. In certain embodiments, if a UE is equipped with an advanced receiver performing iterative decoding and demodulation and two PDCCHs carrying the same DCI content have the same CCE aggregation level, channel bit extrinsic LLRs of one PDCCH decoder output may be fed to another PDCCH decoder input as priority information.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In various embodiments, a UE determines a PDCCH monitoring occasion from a PDCCH monitoring periodicity, a PDCCH monitoring offset, and a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot.

Moreover, the UE may select a HARQ-ACK resource from the indicated HARQ-ACK resources that has the earliest starting symbol and still provides enough time budget for UE's processing delay.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In certain embodiments, for improving reliability of PDSCH DL data transmission, a gNB may repeat the PDSCH DL data transmission multiple times (e.g., in multiple slots and/or mini-slots), referred to as &#x2018;n&#x2019; herein. The number of repetitions (e.g., including the initial transmission) may be configured by higher layer signaling. In some embodiments, a PDSCH-Config IE may be used to configure UE specific PDSCH parameters such as pdsch-AggregationFactor that indicates &#x2018;n&#x2019;. As used herein, a PDSCH transmission duration over multiple TTIs is referred to as a reception window (e.g., a PDSCH reception window).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In some embodiments, if a UE is configured with aggregationFactorDL&#x3e;1, the same symbol allocation is applied across the aggregationFactorDL consecutive slots. In such embodiments, the UE may expect that a TB is repeated within each symbol allocation among each of the aggregationFactorDL consecutive slots and the PDSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. It should be noted that the parameter &#x2018;n&#x2019; is referred to as aggregationFactorDL in TS 38.214 and pdsch-AggregationFactor in TS 38.331.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In certain embodiments, PDSCH repetitions are enabled by RRC configuration. In various embodiments, there may be a field in DCI that indicates a number of PDSCH transmissions k associated with the DCI, where k&#x3e;=1. In some embodiments, PDCCH indicates a number of PDSCH transmissions associated with the PDCCH. As may be appreciated, PDCCH may or may not be transmitted with a PDSCH repetition. In certain embodiments, PDSCH transmissions may be soft combined after a PDCCH is successfully received. In such embodiments, the UE may discard any PDSCH assignment for TTIs in a serving cell with CRC scrambled with C-RNTI if PDSCH is being received (e.g., by repetition or blind repetition) in the TTIs in the same serving cell.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In various embodiments, a subset of TCI states defined in TCI states are used for providing QCL relationships between the DL RS in one RS set (e.g., TCI state) and the PDCCH DMRS ports. In some embodiments, a network configures at most maxNrofTCI-StatesPDCCH entries. In certain embodiments, if a UE has received a MAC CE activation command for one TCI state, the UE applies the activation command 3 msec after a slot in which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">In some embodiments, if a UE has started reception of a PDSCH in a reception window, a DCI indicates reception of PDSCH (e.g., the same TB) in multiple TTIs (e.g., slots and/or mini-slots) in the reception window. In such embodiments, the UE does not apply an activation command in the middle of the reception window. In such embodiments, the UE may apply the activation command at least 3 msec after a slot in which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the activation command, and not during a reception window. As may be appreciated, such an embodiment may be useful if PDCCH scheduling multiple PDSCH repetitions is transmitted in multiple TTIs and multiple of those PDCCHs (transmitted in different TTIs) may be soft combined.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">In certain embodiments, a UE RX beam for PDSCH may be QCLed with the TCI state indicated in DCI if a time duration between an end of PDCCH and a beginning of PDSCH is longer than the threshold value (e.g., if the UE has enough time to switch RX beams). In such embodiments, if there is not enough time to switch RX beams, the UE RX beam may be the same as the TCI state of PDCCH of the lowest CORESET ID in the latest slot. In one example, if there is not enough time to switch RX beams, the UE RX beam is the same as the TCI state of PDCCH of the CORESET in which the PDCCH DCI is received in the latest slot. If there is no QCL configured, the UE RX beam may not be relevant. Thus, a time duration between an end of PDCCH and a beginning of PDSCH may not matter for applying QCL information. In some embodiments, given a UE RX beam switching time (e.g., {7, 14, 28} symbols for 60 KHz SCS and {14, 28} symbols for 120 KHz SCS), it may be assumed that the UE does not switch RX beams during reception of PDSCH repeated over consecutive symbols and/or slots. Therefore, in certain embodiments, if there is PDSCH repetition, one or more of the following may apply during the PDSCH repetition: the UE may not expect and/or perform a TCI change; the UE is not expected to receive a PDCCH indicating a TCI change; a gNB is not expected to change the TCI; and/or the UE is not expected to receive indications of different values of TCI-StateId (e.g., identify of a TCI-State configuration) for PDSCH or different TCI-State configuration for PDSCH in the multiple PDCCH DCI associated with the PDSCH repetitions. In some embodiments, the UE may apply a recently indicated TCI update after an end of a PDSCH repetition window.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">In some embodiments, a UE may switch RX beams during reception of PDSCH repeated over consecutive slots in certain beam change time units (e.g., every slot or every two slots). For example, if the PDSCH is repeated over two slots in TTIs having mini-slots units (e.g., a mini-slot TTI can be four symbols, and PDSCH can be repeated over two slots 6 times&#x2014;in 6 mini-slots), the UE may be able to change its RX beam in the second slot of the two repetition slot.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">In certain embodiments, a UE may get a physical layer signal (e.g., a PDCCH at the beginning of each slot of the PDSCH repetitions for PDSCH repetition using mini-slot TTIs), to indicate if a TCI needs to be updated for PDSCH repetitions in TTIs within a slot.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">In various embodiments, a network may activate and/or deactivate configured TCI states for PDSCH of a serving cell by sending a TCI states activation and/or deactivation command for UE-specific PDSCH MAC CE. In some embodiments, configured TCI states for PDSCH may be initially deactivated upon configuration and after a handover.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">In certain embodiments, if there is a TCI state with a TCI state ID &#x2018;i&#x2019;, this field may indicate an activation and/or deactivation status of the TCI state with TCI state ID &#x2018;i&#x2019;. If there is not a TCI state with a TCI state ID &#x2018;i&#x2019;, a MAC entity may ignore the T<sub>i </sub>field. In some embodiments, the T<sub>i </sub>field is set to &#x201c;1&#x201d; to indicate that the TCI state with TCI state ID &#x2018;i&#x2019; is to be activated and mapped to a codepoint of the DCI Transmission Configuration Indication field.

In certain embodiments, the codepoint to which the TCI state is mapped is determined by its ordinal position among all the TCI states with T<sub>i </sub>field set to &#x201c;1&#x201d; (e.g., the first TCI state with T<sub>i </sub>field set to &#x201c;1&#x201d; may be mapped to the codepoint value 1, second TCI state with Tl field set to &#x201c;1&#x201d; may be mapped to the codepoint value 2, and so forth). In various embodiments, a maximum number of activated TCI states is 8.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">In some embodiments, an activation and/or deactivation MAC CE may change an interpretation (e.g., update a mapping of the TCI state with TCI state ID to codepoint in the DCI TCI field) of the TCI field in the DCI scheduling the PDSCH. In certain embodiments, a time that a UE applies the MAC CE may be dependent on the time that the UE acknowledges the PDSCH carrying the MAC CE plus a certain fixed time (e.g., 3 msec after the UE sends the acknowledgment). In various embodiments, a UE is not expected to change an interpretation of the TCI field in DCI in the middle of a PDSCH reception window. In certain embodiments, a UE is not expected to acknowledge an indication that would change a downlink RS set that is used as a QCL reference with a PDSCH in the middle of a PDSCH reception window (e.g., in case of PDSCH repetition over multiple TTIs).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">In various embodiments, a UE is not expected to receive indications of different values of TCI-StateId (e.g., identify of a TCI-State configuration) for PDSCH or different TCI state configuration for PDSCH in the multiple PDCCH DCI associated with the PDSCH repetitions.

In this example, the first value is different from the second value. In another example, a first PDCCH is in a first search space and/or first CORESET, and a second PDCCH is in a second search space and/or second CORESET. In a further example, a first PDCCH is received in a first time instance (e.g., slot and/or mini-slot) and a second PDCCH is received in second time instance. The first PDSCH transmission and the second PDSCH transmission may be overlapping or non-overlapping in time.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">In certain embodiments, a network transmits: 1) a first PDCCH in a first TTI scheduling a PDSCH; and 2) a second PDCCH in a second TTI scheduling the PDSCH; such that a) the TCI field in the DCI of the first PDCCH indicates an RS set (or beam) that is QCL with the first PDSCH; and b) the DCI of the second PDCCH indicates the RS set (or beam) that is QCL with the second PDSCH. In such embodiments, as a result that the DCI of the first PDCCH may indicate a first TCI field value and the DCI of the second PDCCH may indicate a second TCI field value, and the first and the second TCI field values may be different because of changing the interpretation of the TCI field in the DCI, but both first and second PDCCHs point to the same RS set (or beam) or the same TCI-StateId or TCI-State configuration.

Such embodiments may be useful, for example, if the gNB schedules the UE for multiple TTIs, and sends the PDCCH scheduling the UE in some of the multiple TTIs, and does not know in which TTI the UE would receive the PDCCH (the number of PDSCH repetitions &#x2018;k&#x2019; may be different depending on which TTI of the multiple TTIs with PDCCH the scheduling DCI is correctly received by the UE).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">In certain embodiments, for PDSCH mapping type B, a DMRS location may be dependent on a CORESET duration (e.g., span of the CORESET in number of OFDM symbols).
