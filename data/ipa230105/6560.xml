Most electronics are typically charged with a power adapter. There is an ever-increasing demand to reduce charging speed while also reducing the size of the power adapter. Therefore, power density of the power adapter needs to be increased. The power density is a magnitude of output power per unit volume.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If the power density of the power density increases, a current or a voltage increases, and consequently, more energy is used to generate heat. However, a natural heat dissipation capability of the power density per unit volume is limited. To meet a heat dissipation requirement, how to reduce an energy loss of the power density becomes an urgent problem to be solved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide a converter and a power adapter, to reduce an energy loss of the power adapter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first aspect of this application provides a converter, including a direct current power supply, a main power transistor, an auxiliary power transistor, a first capacitor, a transformer, and a control circuit. The first capacitor and the transformer are connected in series to form a series circuit, the series circuit is connected to a first terminal and a second terminal of the auxiliary power transistor in parallel, a first terminal of the main power transistor is connected to the second terminal of the auxiliary power transistor, a second terminal of the main power transistor is connected to one of a positive electrode or a negative electrode of the direct current power supply, the first terminal of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the other electrode of the direct current power supply, and the negative electrode is grounded. The control circuit is configured to: when the main power transistor is in a cutoff state and a target voltage reaches a target valley voltage, control the main power transistor to be conducted. The target voltage is a voltage between the first terminal of the main power transistor and the ground, and the target valley voltage is a voltage of at least one waveform valley in the target voltage when the converter operates.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It should be noted that when the converter operates, the target voltage is in a form of a wave. In other words, the target valley voltage is a voltage of at least one waveform valley in an operating waveform of the target voltage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the first aspect, the converter is applied to a power adapter, or may be applied to a vehicle-mounted power supply, or another product related to direct current-direct current switching control. The direct current power supply is configured to supply a direct current voltage to another electronic component in the converter. The main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor each are a switching transistor, for example, may be a metal-oxide-semiconductor (metal oxide semiconductor, MOS) field-effect transistor. The first terminal of the auxiliary power transistor and the first terminal of the main power transistor each may be a source (source, S) or a drain (drain, D). If the first terminal is a source, the second terminal is a drain; and if the first terminal is a drain, the second terminal is a source. The direct current power supply includes a positive electrode and a negative electrode. The positive electrode is similar to a positive electrode of a power supply, and the negative electrode is similar to a negative electrode of the power supply. If one electrode is a positive electrode, the other electrode is a negative electrode; or if one electrode is a negative electrode, the other electrode is a positive electrode. In this converter, a source of the main power transistor may be connected to the negative electrode, or a source of the auxiliary power transistor may be connected to the negative electrode. A function of the first capacitor is to resonate with an inductor in the transformer and parasitic capacitors of the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor after the auxiliary power transistor is cut off.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this application, in an operating process of the converter, the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor are not simultaneously conducted, but may be simultaneously cut off. There is a different path in the converter when each the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor is conducted, to control voltage output of the transformer. The voltage between the first terminal of the main power transistor and the ground is referred to as a &#x201c;target voltage&#x201d; in this application, and the target voltage changes with time. The operating waveform of the target voltage is a waveform including a voltage that changes with an operating time sequence of the converter, and the operating time sequence of the converter is a time sequence existing after the converter starts to operate. The target voltage changes continuously with operating time of the converter, and forms a waveform. The waveform includes a waveform valley. In this application, a voltage of the waveform valley in the waveform of the target voltage is referred to as a &#x201c;valley voltage&#x201d;, and the &#x201c;target valley voltage&#x201d; in this application may be each of valley voltages in the waveform, or may be one or more of the valley voltages in the waveform. A plurality of valley voltages include two or more valley voltages.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this application, because a conduction voltage of the main power transistor is directly proportional to an energy loss of the main power transistor, when the target voltage is the target valley voltage, the main power transistor is conducted, so that the main power transistor operates. In this case, the main power transistor has a smallest energy loss. It can be learned that the converter provided in the first aspect can be used to reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor, to reduce an energy loss of each of the converter and the power adapter.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the control circuit is specifically configured to: detect the target voltage when the main power transistor is in the cutoff state; determine, based on a preset policy, whether the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage; if the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage, control the main power transistor to be conducted; and after the main power transistor is cut off and a dead time period passes, control the auxiliary power transistor to be conducted. The dead time period is a time period in which the main power transistor is cut off and the auxiliary power transistor is not conducted.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this possible implementation, the target voltage may be detected in a plurality of manners. The control circuit may be directly connected to the first terminal of the main power transistor and grounded, to measure the target voltage. Alternatively, the target voltage may be detected indirectly. For example, the target voltage may be detected by using the transformer. There may also be a plurality of preset policies, provided that it can be determined that the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage. A specific determining manner is not limited. For example, in a determining manner, the target voltage is equal to a preset valley voltage. Alternatively, whether the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage is determined by using some mathematical algorithms to calculate whether the target voltage is in the waveform valley of the waveform. In this possible implementation, a speed of detecting whether the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage can be increased, to flexibly control conduction of the main power transistor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the control circuit is further configured to: determine a comparison result between the target voltage and a preset voltage threshold, and adjust conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor based on the comparison result.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this possible implementation, the preset voltage threshold may be an empirical value obtained based on a plurality of experimental results. In the converter, a preset voltage threshold used when the source of the main power transistor is connected to the negative electrode is different from a preset voltage threshold used when the source of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the negative electrode. The comparison result between the target voltage and the preset voltage threshold may be that the target voltage is greater than the preset voltage threshold or that the target voltage is less than the preset voltage threshold. Adjusting the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor may be lengthening the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor, or may be shortening the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor. In this possible implementation, the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor is adjusted, to change a magnitude of an excitation current in a negative direction in the transformer. The exciting current affects the target voltage of the main power transistor, to reduce the valley voltage in the waveform of the target voltage, so that the main power transistor can be conducted at a lower voltage, to further reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the second terminal of the main power transistor is connected to the negative electrode, and the first terminal of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the positive electrode. The control circuit is specifically configured to: lengthen next conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor based on current conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor when the comparison result indicates that the target voltage is greater than the preset voltage threshold; or shorten next conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor based on current conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor when the comparison result indicates that the target voltage is less than the preset voltage threshold.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this possible implementation, the second terminal is a source, the first terminal is a drain, a drain of the main power transistor is connected to the source of the auxiliary power transistor, the source of the main power transistor is connected to the negative electrode, and a drain of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the positive electrode. In such a connection structure, the preset voltage threshold is usually 0. If the preset voltage threshold is represented by V<sub>th </sub>and the target voltage is represented by V<sub>dssw</sub>, the comparison result may be V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3e;V<sub>th</sub>, or V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3c;V<sub>th</sub>. If V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3e;V<sub>th</sub>, it indicates that the target voltage needs to be further reduced. In this case, the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor needs to be lengthened, to further increase the excitation current in the negative direction in the transformer, so that the target voltage is reduced accordingly. On the contrary, if V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3c;V<sub>th</sub>, it indicates that the target voltage needs to be increased. In other words, the excitation current in the negative direction in the transformer needs to be reduced, so that the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor is shortened, to increase the target voltage. Regardless of a specific comparison result, the target voltage can be close to the preset voltage threshold as much as possible through corresponding adjustment, so that the target voltage reaches the valley voltage as early as possible. In this way, the main power transistor can be conducted at a lower voltage, to further reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the second terminal of the main power transistor is connected to the positive electrode, and the first terminal of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the negative electrode. The control circuit is specifically configured to: shorten next conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor based on current conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor when the comparison result indicates that the target voltage is greater than the preset voltage threshold; or lengthen next conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor based on current conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor when the comparison result indicates that the target voltage is less than the preset voltage threshold.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this possible implementation, the second terminal is a drain, the first terminal is a source, the source of the main power transistor is connected to a drain of the auxiliary power transistor, the source of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the negative electrode, and a drain of the main power transistor is connected to the positive electrode. In such a connection structure, the preset voltage threshold is usually a voltage V<sub>in </sub>between two terminals of the direct current power supply. If the preset voltage threshold is represented by V<sub>th </sub>and the target voltage is represented by V<sub>dssw</sub>, the comparison result may be V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3e;V<sub>th</sub>, or V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3c;V<sub>th</sub>. If V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3c;V<sub>th</sub>, it indicates that the target voltage needs to be increased. In this case, the excitation current in the negative direction needs to be increased, so that the target voltage increases accordingly. The exciting current can be increased only by lengthening the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor. Therefore, when V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3c;V<sub>th</sub>, the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor needs to be lengthened. On the contrary, if V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3e;V<sub>th</sub>, it indicates that the target voltage needs to be reduced. In this case, the excitation current in the negative direction needs to be reduced, so that the target voltage is reduced accordingly. The magnitude of the excitation current can be reduced only by shortening the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor. Therefore, when V<sub>dssw</sub>&#x3e;V<sub>th</sub>, the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor needs to be shortened. Regardless of a specific comparison result, the target voltage can be close to the preset voltage threshold as much as possible through corresponding adjustment, so that the target voltage reaches the valley voltage as early as possible. In this way, the main power transistor can be conducted at a lower voltage, to further reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the control circuit is configured to: repeatedly adjust the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor based on an adaptive policy, and adjust the target voltage to the preset voltage threshold when the target voltage reaches a first valley voltage in an operating waveform of the target voltage.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this possible implementation, V<sub>dssw </sub>may be adjusted by repeatedly adjusting the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor, so that V<sub>dssw </sub>is gradually close to V<sub>th</sub>. At the first valley voltage, V<sub>dssw</sub>=V<sub>th</sub>, and a subsequent valley voltage is reduced accordingly. In this way, it can be ensured that when the target voltage reaches the subsequent valley voltage, the main power transistor can be conducted at a lower voltage, to further reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the control circuit is further configured to: detect an excitation current in the transformer when the excitation current in the transformer is discontinuous and the auxiliary power transistor is conducted; and when the excitation current is equal to 0, control the auxiliary power transistor to be cut off.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this possible implementation, when the excitation current is equal to 0, the auxiliary power transistor is cut off, to reduce oscillation of the target voltage, so that noise in the converter can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, in the operating time sequence of the converter, an operating waveform of the excitation current in the transformer includes at least one of a continuous waveform or a discontinuous waveform. If the operating waveform of the excitation current is a continuous waveform when the target voltage reaches the first valley voltage, the control circuit controls, when the target voltage reaches the first valley voltage, the main power transistor to be conducted. If the operating waveform of the excitation current is a discontinuous waveform when the target voltage reaches the first valley voltage, the control circuit maintains the main power transistor in the cutoff state, and when the target voltage reaches an m<sup>th </sup>valley voltage, controls the main power transistor to be conducted, where m is an integer greater than 1.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this possible implementation, if the operating waveform of the excitation current is a continuous waveform when the target voltage reaches the first valley voltage, it indicates that the transformer still outputs the excitation current. In this case, when the target voltage reaches the first valley voltage, the control circuit may control the main power transistor to be conducted. If the operating waveform of the excitation current is a discontinuous waveform, the main power transistor is maintained in the cutoff state at the first valley voltage. In other words, the main power transistor is not conducted, and the main power transistor is conducted at each valley voltage starting from the second valley voltage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the control circuit includes a detection circuit, a power transistor control circuit, a first drive circuit, and a second drive circuit.

The target voltage is a voltage between the first terminal of the main power transistor and the ground, and the target valley voltage is a voltage of at least one waveform valley in the target voltage when the converter operates.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be noted that when the converter operates, the target voltage is in a form of a wave. In other words, the target valley voltage is a voltage of at least one waveform valley in an operating waveform of the target voltage.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The direct current power supply is configured to supply a direct current voltage to another electronic component in the converter. The main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor each are a switching transistor, for example, may be a metal-oxide-semiconductor (metal oxide semiconductor, MOS) field-effect transistor. The first capacitor may be used to prevent a path including the direct current power supply, the main power transistor, the first capacitor, and the transformer from being short-circuited when the main power transistor is conducted. The first terminal of the auxiliary power transistor and the first terminal of the main power transistor each may be a source (source, S) or a drain (drain, D). If the first terminal is a source, the second terminal is a drain, and if the first terminal is a drain, the second terminal is a source. The direct current power supply includes a positive electrode and a negative electrode. The positive electrode is similar to a positive electrode of a power supply, and the negative electrode is similar to a negative electrode of the power supply. If one electrode is a positive electrode, the other electrode is a negative electrode; or if one electrode is a negative electrode, the other electrode is a positive electrode. In this converter, a source of the main power transistor may be connected to the negative electrode, or a source of the auxiliary power transistor may be connected to the negative electrode. A function of the first capacitor is to resonate with an inductor in the transformer and parasitic capacitors of the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor after the auxiliary power transistor is cut off.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this application, in an operating process of the converter, the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor are not simultaneously conducted, but may be simultaneously cut off. There is a different path in the converter when each the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor is conducted, to control voltage output of the transformer. The voltage between the first terminal of the main power transistor and the ground is referred to as a &#x201c;target voltage&#x201d; in this application, and the target voltage changes with time. The operating waveform of the target voltage is a waveform including a voltage that changes with an operating time sequence of the converter, and the operating time sequence of the converter is a time sequence existing after the converter starts to operate. The target voltage changes continuously with operating time of the converter, and forms a waveform. The waveform includes a waveform valley. In this application, a voltage of the waveform valley in the waveform of the target voltage is referred to as a &#x201c;valley voltage&#x201d;, and the &#x201c;target valley voltage&#x201d; in this application may be each of valley voltages in the waveform, or may be one or more of the valley voltages in the waveform. A plurality of valley voltages include two or more valley voltages.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operating time sequence of the converter and the operating waveform of the target voltage may be understood with reference to a diagram of a time sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in the operating time sequence, the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor are in a conducted state or a cutoff state in different time periods. Whether the main power transistor and the auxiliary power transistor are conducted or cut off may affect the target voltage, and the waveform of the target voltage changes accordingly. The waveform of the target voltage includes a waveform valley, and a valley bottom of the waveform of the target voltage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is the waveform valley.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this application, because a conduction voltage of the main power transistor is directly proportional to an energy loss of the main power transistor, when the target voltage is the target valley voltage, the main power transistor is conducted, so that the main power transistor operates. In this case, the main power transistor has a smallest energy loss. It can be learned that the converter provided in this application can be used to reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor, to reduce an energy loss of each of the converter and a power adapter.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The control circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be directly connected to the first terminal of the main power transistor and grounded, to measure the target voltage. Alternatively, the control circuit may detect the target voltage indirectly. For example, the target voltage may alternatively be detected by using the transformer. Regardless of a manner of detecting the target voltage, the control circuit in this application may determine, based on a preset policy, whether the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage. If the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage, the main power transistor is controlled to be conducted. There may also be a plurality of preset policies, provided that it can be determined that the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage. A specific determining manner is not limited. For example, in a determining manner, the target voltage is equal to a preset valley voltage. Alternatively, whether the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage is determined by using some mathematical algorithms to calculate whether the target voltage is in the waveform valley of the waveform. In this possible implementation, a speed of detecting whether the target voltage reaches the target valley voltage can be increased, to flexibly control conduction of the main power transistor.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the foregoing described content, the control circuit may control the main power transistor to be conducted or cut off. In this application, the control circuit may further control the auxiliary power transistor to be conducted or cut off. The control circuit may determine a comparison result between the target voltage and a preset voltage threshold, and adjust conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor based on the comparison result. The preset voltage threshold may be an empirical value obtained based on a plurality of experimental results. In the converter, a preset voltage threshold used when the source of the main power transistor is connected to the negative electrode of the direct current power supply is different from a preset voltage threshold used when the source of the auxiliary power transistor is connected to the negative electrode of the direct current power supply. The comparison result between the target voltage and the preset voltage threshold may be that the target voltage is greater than the preset voltage threshold or that the target voltage is less than the preset voltage threshold. Adjusting the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor may be lengthening the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor, or may be shortening the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor. The conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor is adjusted, to change a magnitude of an excitation current in the transformer. The exciting current affects the target voltage of the main power transistor, to reduce the valley voltage in the waveform of the target voltage, so that the main power transistor can be conducted at a lower voltage, to further reduce the energy loss of the main power transistor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Because there may be two connection relationships among the main power transistor, the auxiliary power transistor, and the direct current power supply, when the control circuit adjusts the conduction duration of the auxiliary power transistor, there are different execution processes for different connection relationships. With reference to diagrams of circuits, the following separately describes the two different connection relationships and execution processes of the control circuit in cases of different connection relationships.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">1.
