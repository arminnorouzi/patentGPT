However, with the increasing popularity of extended-reach drilling, multi-lateral wells, and horizontal well applications, the stress and bending moments that are placed on the threaded connections in a drill-string are increased. The increased number of pipe connections and increased stresses contribute to an increased chance of a downhole failure of the drill-string. The cost of repairing a single downhole failure may exceed one million dollars.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cold root-rolling is the process of burnishing the root radius of a freshly-cut or previously-cut thread in a rotary shouldered connection. A hardened roll, similar in profile to the thread being burnished, is forced into contact with the thread. Pressure is applied to cause the hardened roll to penetrate into the surface of the thread. This deforms and cold-works the material, imparts an improved surface finish to the thread, and compacts and displaces the grains of the thread material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Industry experience has suggested that cold root-rolling may increase the fatigue life of a threaded connection from three to five times over a similar unrolled threaded connection under the same working conditions. One industry study has noted laboratory results suggesting that an improvement in fatigue life of up to twenty-seven times may result from the cold root-rolling process. See, e.g., Knight, M. J., Brennan, F. P. and Dover, W. D., &#x201c;Fatigue Life Improvement of Threaded Connections by Cold Rolling&#x201d;, <i>Journal of </i>Strain <i>Analysis</i>, vol. 40, pp. 83-93 (Sep. 30, 2004). This study has attributed the increase in fatigue life to one or more of the following factors:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">(1) Cold root-rolling creates a thin zone of residual compressive stress in the root region of the thread. This residual compressive stress may offset tensile stresses produced in service, and may lower the overall stress in the critical stress region of the thread root.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(2) The burnishing effect of the smooth and hardened roll causes small scratches and ridges left by the thread-cutting operation to flatten into a more-uniform surface. These scratches may have small tip radii, and are believed to be the source of considerable stress concentrations. As a result, these scratches appear to be crack propagation starting points for fatigue failures.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(3) Scratches provide prime locations for chemical erosion. The microscopic surface of a scratch is very jagged and porous. This exposes a large surface area, and numerous molecular bonding sites, to the corrosive effects of liquids and gasses used in a drill-string environment. Burnishing smoothes the scratched surface, and reduces outcroppings and inclusions. It tends to reduce the area of the surface, and densely compresses the same.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">(4) Cold root-rolling has a work-hardening effect of the surface of the material. On an atomic scale, compressive displacement of the crystalline lattice within the steel grain structure is believed to cause the crystal structure to change from a repetitive and uniform atomic structure to one with many dislocations in the pattern. These dislocations are believed to cause the crystal structure to interlock, and to become more resistant to further deformation. This increased resistance to further deformation helps to prevent cracks from starting, and helps to arrest microscopic cracks from growing into structural flaws that might threaten the integrity of the threaded joint. In laboratory studies, cracks that have occurred in cold root-rolled threaded joints have exhibited significantly-lower crack aspect ratios (i.e., the ratio of crack length to crack depth). A 30%-50% reduction in this ratio suggests that cracks that have occurred in cold root-rolled joints are more likely to be deep and short, rather than long and shallow. A long and shallow crack is believed to be more likely to lead to a sudden and complete structural failure of the threaded joint. A deep crack that partially penetrates the section wall is detectable via the pressure drop of circulating drilling fluids, and allows for an early recovery of a damaged drill-string prior to a complete structural failure of the joint.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Because of the foregoing advantages, cold root-rolling is now commonly performed on many freshly-cut and re-cut threads used on drill-string pipes used in the petroleum and natural gas industries. It is a money-saving process. It can dramatically increase the fatigue life of each rotary-shouldered threaded connection in a typical drill-string. It can also reduce the frequency of repairing connections in the field, and of having to fish for downhole drill-string failures.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One line of cold root-rolling products is the 11069 Series Internal Thread Bar-Style Tools, available from Brinkman Products, Inc., 167 Ames Street, Rochester, N.Y. 14611. Such tools are designed for root-rolling pipes having an inner diameter as small as about 3&#xbd; inches. However, even smaller diameter pipes are commonly used in the natural gas industry.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 9,539,697 B2, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, discloses cold root-rolling devices that are adapted for use with relatively large diameter pipes typically used in the off-shore petroleum industry. While these devices are very useful in cold root-rolling threads of larger diameter pipes (e.g. those having diameters on the order of 3&#xbd; to 8&#x215d; inches), the physical size of such devices preclude their use on internal threads of smaller diameter pipes (e.g., those having diameters on the order of 2&#x215c; to 2&#x215e; inches), such as those used in on-shore gas drilling operations.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, it would be generally desirable to provide improved devices that are particularly adapted for use in, but not limited to, cold root-rolling freshly-cut or re-cut threads on objects having smaller diameters.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With parenthetical reference to the corresponding parts, portions or surfaces of the disclosed embodiment, merely for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the present invention provides improved devices (<b>10</b>) for burnishing, and, more particularly, for cold root-rolling, a surface (<b>111</b>, <b>112</b>) on a smaller diameter object (<b>108</b>), such as threaded surface in a pipe used in an on-shore gas drilling operation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one form, the improved device (<b>10</b>) broadly includes a body (<b>11</b>) having a passageway (<b>25</b>), and having a cylindrical opening (<b>41</b>) communicating with the passageway; an accumulator piston (<b>65</b>) mounted on the body for sealed sliding movement within the passageway; a coarse adjustment screw (<b>13</b>) threadedly mounted on the body; a resilient member (<b>14</b>) acting between the coarse adjustment screw and the accumulator piston; a lever (<b>12</b>) pivotally mounted on the body, with the lever having a forward portion (<b>49</b>) extending beyond the body and having a rearward portion (<b>48</b>) generally aligned with the cylindrical opening; a chamber (<b>32</b>) communicating with the accumulator piston; an actuator piston (<b>78</b>) mounted on the body for sealed sliding movement within the cylindrical opening toward and away from the rearward portion (<b>48</b>) of the lever; and a roll (<b>15</b>) rotatably mounted on the forward portion (<b>49</b>) of the lever. The chamber is completely filled with liquid. The position of the coarse adjustment screw relative to the body may be selectively adjusted to controllably vary the fluid pressure within the chamber. The device may be mounted on a machine tool and selectively moved toward the object to burnish a surface (<b>111</b>, <b>112</b>) with controllable force along a length of the surface when the object and device are rotated relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The roll (<b>15</b>) may be a thread roll for burnishing the threads of an object, or the roll may be configured to burnish a non-threaded surface on an object. The non-threaded surface may be adjacent to a threaded surface. The roll may have an asymmetric configuration. The forward portion of the lever may have a pocket adapted to receive a holder (<b>16</b>) for the asymmetric roll. The roll holder may have an asymmetric configuration complementary to the asymmetric configuration of the roll such that the roll may only be inserted into the holder when the roll is in a proper orientation relative to the actuator piston.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The object may be configured to have an internal thread with an inner diameter of between about 2&#x215c; inches and about 2&#x215e; inches. However, this size range should not be viewed as a limitation to the scope of the appended claims unless a range to that effect appears explicitly therein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The device may further comprise a pressure gauge (<b>18</b>) arranged to measure and indicate the liquid pressure (in psi) within the chamber. The device may be arranged such that the lever is so dimensioned and configured that the pressure gauge will also indicate the force (in lb<sub>f</sub>) exerted by the roll on the object.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The body and/or lever of the improved device may have a slot (<b>38</b>), and the other of the body and lever may have a pin (<b>40</b>) arranged in the slot to limit pivotal motion of the lever relative to the body. The lever may be an intermediately-pivoted lever.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The resilient member may be a Belleville spring stack. The Belleville spring stack may be preloaded to a range having a substantially-constant force-to-displacement characteristic.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, the general object of the disclosure is to provide improved devices for burnishing a surface on an object. In some embodiments, the devices may be configured and arranged to burnish approximately the entire length of the surface of the object.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another object is to provide improved device for cold root-rolling a thread on a smaller diameter pipe.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">These and other objects and advantages will become apparent from the foregoing and ongoing written specification, the drawings, and the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a fragmentary side elevation of one embodiment of the improved devices for burnishing a surface on an object.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a right end elevation of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a fragmentary longitudinal vertical sectional view thereof, taken generally along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and showing the pressure gauge partly in section and partly in elevation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged fragmentary detail view of the body, taken within the indicated circle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, depicting the actuator piston.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side elevation of a portion of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, showing the body and the lever in exploded aligned relation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a fragmentary longitudinal vertical section of the parts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, showing the body and the lever in exploded aligned relation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an isometric view of the lever shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, looking at the right front corner thereof.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an enlarged top plan view of the roll holder, showing the asymmetric angle of the roll holder.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an enlarged isometric view of the roll holder shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, looking at the right front corner thereof.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is an enlarged fragmentary side elevation of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> being inserted into an object, showing the object in section, and showing the lever as having been moved in a counterclockwise direction prior to the engagement of the roll with a surface on the object.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> is an enlarged fragmentary side elevation of the device, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, but showing the device as having been moved upwardly to engage the surface of the object, and showing the lever as having been moved in a clockwise direction relative to the body to a maximum pivot position, with the roll forcibly bearing against the surface of the object.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At the outset, it should be clearly understood that like reference numerals are intended to identify the same structural elements, portions or surfaces consistently throughout the several drawing figures, as such elements, portions or surfaces may be further described or explained by the entire written specification, of which this detailed description is an integral part.

In particular, Applicants' improved attachment uses an asymmetric roll holder, along with asymmetric hub geometry on the rolls themselves, to insure that the rolls will only mount on the attachment in the proper orientation. The preferred embodiment uses a slight step in the lateral wall of roll mounting hole <b>93</b> of approximately 0.015 inch, located at some radial distance away from the centerline of the roll mounting axis. The opposing wall has no such step. The preferred embodiment uses a roll <b>15</b> with two different hub diameters on its opposite faces. One hub has a radius slightly less than the radial distance. The other hub has a radius slightly greater than radial distance. When a roll with these asymmetric hubs is inserted into a hole with the step, the roll will only align properly with the roll pin axis if the smaller hub is adjacent to the step. If the roll is inserted such that the larger hub is adjacent the step, the hub will make contact with the step prior to alignment of the roll axis with the roll pin hole axis, thus preventing the roll pin form being inserted improperly.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">While the preferred embodiment uses two differently-sized hubs on the opposite faces of the roll, persons skilled in this art will readily appreciate that other forms might achieve the same objective; namely, of preventing the roll from being improperly inserted into the pocket.

This may be done to preserve the use of the current gauges and hydraulic parts found in other cold roll tools. Also, when combined with a one square inch actuator piston <b>78</b>, the numerical values of pressure as read on the pressure gauge <b>18</b> will be the numerical value of pounds of force, with no scaling factor or conversion required. One psi of pressure will be equal to one lb<sub>f</sub>. This simplifies the operation of the devices, and eliminates a potential source of calculation error.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, the present invention broadly provides improved devices adapted to be mounted on a machine tool and burnish a surface on an object with controllable force along the required length of the surface. The surface may be the thread of a pipe and areas adjacent thereto. The devices may include a body having a passageway, and having a cylindrical opening communicating with the passageway; an accumulator piston mounted on the body for sealed sliding movement within the passageway; a coarse adjustment screw threadedly mounted on the body; a resilient member acting between the coarse adjustment screw and the accumulator piston; a lever pivotally mounted on the body, the lever having a forward portion extending beyond the body and having an rearward portion aligned with the cylindrical opening; a chamber communicating with the accumulator piston; an actuator piston mounted on the body for sealed sliding movement within the cylindrical opening toward and away from the rearward portion of the lever; a roll rotatably mounted on the forward portion of the lever; wherein the chamber is completely filled with liquid; wherein the position of the coarse adjustment screw relative to the body may be selectively adjusted to controllably vary the fluid pressure within the chamber; and whereby the devices may be selectively moved toward the object to burnish the surface with controllable force along a length of the surface when the object and device are rotated relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Upon information and belief, the present invention has a number of points of patentable distinction over the prior art root-rolling devices for smaller diameter pipes. These include: (i) a combination of a lever arm and hydraulics to impart rolling pressures on surfaces of smaller diameter objects, and (ii) the use of a lever from the tip of the roll to the actuator piston that is configured and arranged to provide gauge measurements that directly correspond to what the roll sees, while utilizing a self-contained pressurization system, thus allowing for conversion-free force measurement.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As to the first point, no known item of prior art uses a self-contained pressure generation device, or a self-contained fluid accumulator, in a device designed to root-roll threads of smaller diameter objects. This obviates the need for an external pressure pump, an external accumulator, and various hose connections, disconnect fittings, and valves. This simplifies installation and use, and removes considerable clutter from the work zone of the machine tool.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As to the second point, no known item of prior art is constructed in such a way as to obviate the need to convert the numerical value of indicated pressure into pounds of burnishing force. The standards governing this cold root-rolling operation, specifically the T. H. Hill specification DS-1, require that a minimum force be applied for each of the various thread sizes. However, since the prior art devices for root-rolling smaller diameter threads have no means for measuring force directly, they usually measure the hydraulic pressure instead, and then use a chart to convert the pressure recorded to the calculated force. In Applicants' devices, pressure is also recorded. However, the working piston has been sized such that its surface area is exactly one square inch, combined with the use of a lever that is configured and arranged such that the numerical values of pressure will also be the numerical value of pounds of force, with no scaling factor or conversion required. One psi of pressure (as measured by the pressure gauge) will be equal to one pound of force (applied by the roll to the surface of an object). This simplifies the operation of the devices, and eliminates a potential source of calculation error.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Therefore, while the presently-preferred form of the devices have been shown and described, and several modifications and alternatives discussed, persons skilled in this art will readily appreciate that various additional changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined and differentiated by the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
