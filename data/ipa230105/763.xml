Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Athletes may suffer excessive fluid loss through perspiration during intense exercise, which would result in electrolyte deficiency in addition to dehydration. Low levels of electrolytes in the system can lead to cramping. Salt pills provide large salt doses to overcome this issue. This approach can oversupply the body with sodium to overcome the delay in bioavailability through the GI tract. A mechanism for delivering a smaller dose of electrolytes to the buccal mucosa may provide the needed electrolytes with more rapid bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During exercise, the body requires more oxygen than when the body is at rest. When oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles faster to replace the used oxygen, the muscles will begin to convert the available glucose to lactic acid. This will build up in the muscle, causing fatigue. More rapid delivery of oxygen to the system during exertion can reduce fatigue. Supplemental oxygen therapy has been demonstrated to improve athletic performance and decrease reaction times.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Proper hydration, electrolyte supplements, and supplemental oxygen therapy have proven to be able to improve athletic performance. Therefore, it is desirable to have a means to delivery water, supplements and oxygen without interrupting athletes' activities.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed herein is a chewable article for oral mucosa delivery of a composition.

The first and second portions are interconnected. In one embodiment, the chewable article comprises a chewable base with the composition embedded, encapsulated, coated, integrated or dispersed therein. The composition may be pressurized, oxygenated, and/or atomized. The composition may be released as an aerosol. In one embodiment, the chewable system comprises a pressurized capsule that dissolves or ruptures in the mouth to release a burst of the composition. The chewable system may be configured to allow the composition facing to the buccal mucosa. The following embodiments/examples are included to demonstrate some specifics of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the present disclosure, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of the chewable system <b>102</b> for oral mucosa delivery of an oxygenated nutritional supplement. The chewable system <b>102</b> may comprise a chewable base with a nutritional supplement matrix embedded therein to enable transmucosal delivery of the nutritional supplement matrix. The chewable <b>102</b> may comprise any soft and/or cohesive substance suitable for chewing, such as chewing gums, gummy candies, or other food-safe substances. Chewables <b>102</b>, such as gum, may contain sweeteners, flavors, colors, softeners, and/or plasticizers. The chewable <b>102</b> may comprise a chewable base with a void in the center to house the composition therein. The composition may comprise an active, such as nicotine or glucose, in the form of a liquid composition embedded inside a chewing gum. Transmucosal delivery of nutrient supplements offers advantages over oral delivery when oral delivery is impossible or negatively impacted by various issues in the gastrointestinal tract, stomach, substance digestion, absorption, swallowing, protocol compliance, substance effectiveness, or any other gastrointestinal metabolism issues.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The composition may include any one or any combinations of (i) a nutritional supplement matrix fraction, (ii) a gas fraction, (iii) an enhancer fraction, (iv) a liquid fraction, and (v) a preservative fraction. In one embodiment, the fractions are all mixed or combined and treated to allow oxygen molecules suspended therein for a specific duration of time before being released from a chewable <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, a chewable <b>102</b> may contain 2 ml of the composition. Furthermore, the composition may be in a compressed state in a chewable <b>102</b> before being released. The composition may be delivered to a user via one or more perforations <b>104</b>. A perforation <b>104</b> may be any intentional weak point in the chewable <b>102</b> designed to rupture when bite pressure is applied to the chewable <b>102</b>, thus releasing the composition. In one embodiment, the chewable <b>102</b> has one or more perforations <b>104</b> on one side. The user may place the chewable <b>102</b> in their mouth with the perforations <b>104</b> facing their cheek. In this example, when the user applies bite pressure to the chewable <b>102</b>, the composition may be released towards the buccal mucosa. In one embodiment, pressure built inside of the chewable <b>102</b> may be sufficient to spray, or otherwise atomize the composition, thus facilitating the absorption of the composition through the buccal mucosa. In one embodiment, the chewable <b>102</b> may be a gum. In one embodiment, the chewable <b>102</b> maybe a lozenge or a chewable with a hard or candy shell. In one embodiment, the chewable <b>102</b> may dissolve in the mouth without chewing. In those embodiments, the perforations <b>104</b> may dissolve faster.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of the instant system in the form of a mouthguard <b>200</b>. A mouthguard <b>200</b> may be any protective shield designed to be worn in the mouth to protect a user's teeth, lips, gums, as well as reducing the risk of oral injuries during a sport actvities. A mouthguard <b>200</b> may be customized to a user's teeth, such as made from impressions of the user's teeth, vacuum forming, bite molding, or pressure lamination. A mouthguard <b>200</b> may have a chamber <b>202</b> that houses a composition to be applied to an user's buccal mucosa. The chamber may break and releases the composition when a minimum threshold of bite pressure is applied to the mouthguard <b>200</b>. The mouthguard <b>200</b> may have one or more perforations <b>104</b> positioned to release the composition from chamber <b>202</b> towards the buccal mucosa. In one embodiment, the composition may be stored in chamber <b>202</b> along with a sufficient amount of supplemental oxygen to create a burst, a blast, or an atomized spray of the composition into the user's mouth. In one embodiment, a user may wear a mouthguard <b>200</b> during an athletic event. The composition may provide the user with electrolyte supplement to sustain hydration without taking a break from the athletic activity, such as drinking from a water bottle. In one embodiment, there may be multiple chambers <b>202</b>, which may be situated between the user's molars, to allow the perforations <b>104</b> adjacent to the buccal mucosa.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment in the form of a porous bead gum <b>300</b>. Gum may be impregnated with or coated with a pharmaceutical active or other biologically beneficial ingredients. Porous polymeric beads <b>302</b> may be incorporated into the gums. The porous polymeric beads <b>302</b> may act as reservoirs for housing the desired ingredient. The porous polymeric beads may quickly release the housed ingredient when the porous polymeric beads <b>302</b> are ruptured by bite pressure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The composition, or an oxygenated portion of the composition, may be incorporated into the reservoirs and may be released from the porous bead gum <b>300</b> when chewed upon. In one embodiment, a chewable <b>102</b> may contain 2 ml of the composition in the form of 25 porous polymeric beads <b>302</b> that each contains 0.08 ml of the composition. In one embodiment, one portion of the composition may be contained in the porous polymeric beads <b>302</b>. A second portion of the composition may be incorperated in the porous beads as either a coating or an ingredient. In one embodiment, the two portions of the composition may have the same ingredients with different release rates. In one embodiment, the first portion of the composition may contain a partial list of the composition's fractions. The second portion of the composition may contain the remaining fractions of the composition. For example, an electrolyte supplement may be a powder coating the porous bead gum <b>300</b>, and an oxygenated flavoring may be contained in the porous polymeric beads <b>302</b>. This approach may allow the user to supplement electrolytes on the go while also to receive bursts of oxygen when the porous polymeric beads <b>302</b> are ruptured.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foregoing detailed description of the technology has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
