The inner surfaces of the mold can be coated with a coating composition to obtain molded structured articles further comprising a flexible and durable coating layer. The present invention also relates to a structured molded article, preferably a shoe sole, which is obtained by the inventive process.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A wide variety of different components with variable layer thicknesses are nowadays mostly produced by means of molding processes, like injection molding and casting processes. A greatly used material in molding processes are polymer foams. Polymer foams belong to the solid foam family which are versatile materials, extensively used for a large number of applications such as automotive, packaging, sport products, thermal and acoustic insulators, tissue engineering or liquid absorbents. Composed of air bubbles entrapped in a continuous solid network, they combine the properties of the polymer with those of the foam to create an intriguing and complex material. Polymer foams not only allow to use the wide range of interesting properties that the polymers offers, but also permit to profit from the advantageous properties of foams, including lightness, low density, compressibility and high surface-to-volume ratio.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Structural foam molded thermoplastics exhibit a characteristic swirl pattern or a mottled surface that can be attractive on durable outdoor, industrial or factory applications. However, the as-molded structural foam appearance isn't appropriate for all products. Particularly in the area of the production of footwear soles or in the area of the furniture industry, there is a sustained demand for foam components produced by molding process having an attractive appearance. One way of providing such an attractive appearance is by post-treatment of the molded parts, for example by sanding, coating and texturizing. Textured surfaces can be applied for aesthetic purposes or to reduce finger prints when the finished product will receive a lot of handling. A textured finish also assists in hiding blemishes in the surface created during the molding process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such processes, however, are inefficient, since they necessitate a further process step after production. Moreover, prior to further coating with a basecoat, for example, or to adhesive bonding to other components, it is necessary to remove the external release agent used when producing the components, and permitting demolding of the components from the molding tool without damage; such removal entails costly and inconvenient cleaning processes. Furthermore, the tools used must also be subjected to ongoing cleaning.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Of advantage accordingly would be a process for preparing structured molded articles preferably made from polymer foam, especially structured shoe soles made by molding processes using polymer foams, wherein the texturization and optionally coating of the polymer foam can be obtained during the molding process, thus rendering post-treatment of said articles superfluous. The texture transfer from the structured mold to the polymer foam should be highly accurate. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide a process where coating of the texturized polymer foam can be performed during the molding process in order to reduce the post-treatment steps of the texturized molded article.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Object</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the present invention, accordingly, was that of providing a process which allows texturization and optionally coating of a molded material, preferably foam material, during the molding process, thus rendering post-texturization and post-coating superfluous. The structure of the inner mold surface(s) should be transferred to the molded material with a high molding accuracy without negatively influencing the removal of the molded article from the mold. Despite the texturization of the material, the coating should have a high adhesion and a sufficient flexibility to allow repeated bending of the molded material without detachment of said coating layer. The process should also allow the production of components of complex geometry without any defects occurring during the molding process.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The objects described above are achieved by the subject matter claimed in the claims and also by the preferred embodiments of that subject matter that are described in the description hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A first subject of the present invention is therefore a process for preparing a molded article comprising at least one structured surface, said process comprising the following steps in the stated order:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">(1) providing a closable, three dimensional mold (MO) having at least two mold parts which are movable relative to each other and which form a mold cavity, wherein at least one micro- and/or nanostructured silicone containing layer comprising a plurality of micro-scale and/or nano-scale surface elements is attached to at least a part of the inner surface (SU) facing the mold cavity of at least one of the mold parts;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">(2) optionally applying a composition (C2a) comprising at least one binder (B) and optionally at least one crosslinker (CL) on at least a part of at least one inner surface (SU) facing the mold cavity of the closable, three dimensional mold (MO) and flashing off said applied composition (C2a);</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0011">(3) optionally inserting at least one material (M1) into the mold (MO), wherein the at least one material (M1) is preferably not in contact with the inner surface (SU) of the mold parts comprising the silicone containing layer, and heating the mold (MO);</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0012">(4) optionally closing the mold (MO);</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0013">(5) applying a composition (C3a) into the closed mold (MO) or applying a composition (C3a) into the open mold (MO) and closing said mold (MO);</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0014">(6) at least partially curing of the composition (C3a) and optionally of the composition (C2a);</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0015">(7) optionally applying at least one further composition (C4a) and at least partially curing of said composition (C4a);</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0016">(8) opening of the mold (MO) and removing the molded article comprising at least one structured and optionally coated surface;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0017">(9) optionally post-treating of the article obtained after step (8).</li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0018">The above-specified method is hereinafter also referred to as method of the invention and accordingly is a subject of the present invention. Preferred embodiments of the method of the invention are apparent from the description hereinafter and also from the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0019">In light of the prior art it was surprising and unforeseeable for the skilled worker that the object on which the invention is based could be achieved by using mold parts which have at least one inner surface structured with a silicone layer or a composite comprising a substrate and a structured coating layer. The use of said mold results in an excellent transfer of the structure of the silicone layer or the composite to the molded article without negatively influencing the excellent demolding of the article after curing of the applied composition. Additionally, a simultaneous coating can be performed, thus resulting in textured and coated molded articles. Despite the texturization, the coating has an excellent adhesion to the textured molded article and is highly endurable with regard to bending of the article. The simultaneous texturization and coating renders subsequent and labor intensive post-treatment steps superfluous, thus resulting in a highly economic and environmentally friendly process. Since the structuring of the mold parts is performed by using structured layers which can be easily exchanged, the inventive process is highly versatile and easily adaptable with respect to the use of different structures without exchanging the mold as such. Additionally, the structured layer can be easily removed if said layer is worn out, thus rendering mold cleaning superfluous and prolonging the lifetime of the mold. Moreover, the structured layers can be produced far easier and cost-effective than structured metallic molds.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0020">A further subject of the present invention is a structured molded article, produced by the inventive process.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0021">First of all a number of terms used in the context of the present invention will be described in more detail.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0022">The term &#x201c;three dimensional mold&#x201d; is to be understood as referring to molds having a three dimensional inner cavity which is formed by at least two mold parts that can be moved relative to each other to open and close the mold. The inner cavity of the mold therefore has three dimensions, i.e. a length, width and depth. The mold can have a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity molds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0023">The term &#x201c;inner surface (SU)&#x201d; refers in accordance with the invention to the surface of the mold parts that comes into contact with composition (C2a) and also with the composition (C3a) and, optionally, further materials and compositions used in the process, during the production of the article. The inner surface (SU) is therefore facing the mold cavity which is formed when closing the mold parts.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0024">In step (1) of the inventive process, at least one of the mold parts can be structured on its inner surface (SU) by using a micro- and/or nanostructured silicone containing layer. The term &#x201c;micro- and/or nanostructured silicone containing layer&#x201d; refers to a layer comprising micro- and/or nanostructures as well as at least one silicone compound. Such layers can, for example, be made of cured silicone elastomers or can be made of a material containing at least one silicone compound. In the latter case, such layers can be mono- or multilayers. In case of multilayers, at least the outer structured layer being adjacent to the inner cavity formed by the mold parts contains the at least one silicone compound.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0025">The silicone containing layer used in step (1) contains a plurality of micro-scale and/or nano-scale surface elements. Microstructures here are structures&#x2014;in terms of structure width and/or of structure height&#x2014;having characteristics in the micrometer range. Nanostructures here are structures&#x2014;in terms of structure width and/or of structure height&#x2014;having characteristics in the nanometer range. Microstructures and nanostructures here are structures which have a structure width in the nanometer range and a structure height in the micrometer range or vice-versa. The terms &#x201c;structure height&#x201d; and &#x201c;structure depth&#x201d; are interchangeable here. The structure width and structure height of the respective surface are preferably determined by production of a cross section of the surface and determination of the structure height and structure width of said cross section by means of an optical microscopy.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0026">In step (2) of the inventive process, the applied composition (C2a) is flashed off. This means the active or passive evaporation of solvents present in the composition (C2a), usually at a temperature which is higher than the ambient temperature, for example at 40 to 140&#xb0; C. Flash off in step (2) can be performed by heating the mold prior or after application of the composition (C2a). The composition (C2a) is still flowable directly after application and at the start of the flashing off and can therefore form a uniform, smooth coating film during the flash off phase. The layer obtained from coating composition (C2a) after flashing, however, is not yet in the ready-to-use state. While it is indeed, for example, no longer fluid, it is still soft or tacky, and may have undergone only partial drying. In particular, the layer obtained from coating composition (C2a) is not yet crosslinked, as described in the following.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0027">In process step (6) and optionally (7), the composition (C2a), the composition (C3a), and any further compositions (C4a) are at least partially crosslinked. This refers to the curing of these compositions, in other words the conversion of these compositions into the ready-to-use state, meaning a state in which the article comprising said cured compositions can be used as intended. The at least partially crosslinked compositions are, therefore, in particular no longer soft or tacky, having instead been conditioned to a solid coating film or solid article, respectively. Even on further exposure to crosslinking conditions as described later on below, the film or article no longer exhibits any substantial change in its properties such as hardness or adhesion to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0028">At least partial curing of the compositions (C2a), (C3a) and further compositions (C4a) used in the inventive process can be effected physically and/or chemically, depending on the components included, such as binders and crosslinking agents. The compositions are in particular at least partially cured chemically. Chemical curing comprehends thermochemical curing and actinic-chemical curing. Thermochemically curable compositions can be self-crosslinking and/or externally crosslinking. The mechanisms involved and also the binders and crosslinking agents (film-forming components) that can be used are described later on below. In the context of the present invention, &#x201c;thermochemically curable&#x201d; and, respectively, the term &#x201c;thermochemical curing&#x201d; refer to the crosslinking of the composition (formation of a cured composition) that is initiated by chemical reaction of reactive functional groups, with the possibility of energetic activation of this chemical reaction by means of thermal energy. Here, different functional groups, which are complementary to one another, may react with one another (complementary functional groups), and/or the formation of the cured composition is based on the reaction of autoreactive groups, these being functional groups which react with groups of their own kind. Examples of suitable complementary reactive functional groups and autoreactive functional groups are known from German patent application DE 199 30 665 A1, page 7, line 28 to page 9, line 24, for example. This crosslinking may be self-crosslinking and/or external crosslinking. Where, for example, the complementary reactive functional groups are already present in an organic polymer used as binder, as for example in a polyester, a polyurethane or a poly(meth)acrylate, the crosslinking involved is self-crosslinking. External crosslinking is involved if, for example, a (first) organic polymer or a first compound containing particular functional groups, hydroxyl groups for example, reacts with a conventional crosslinking agent, as for example with a polyisocyanate and/or with a melamine resin. The crosslinking agent therefore contains reactive functional groups which are complementary to the reactive functional groups present in the (first) organic polymer used as binder. In the case of external crosslinking in particular, the systems contemplated are the conventional multicomponent systems, especially two-component systems. In these systems, the components to be crosslinked, as for example the organic polymers as binders and the crosslinking agents, are present separately from one another in at least two components, which are not combined until shortly before the application. This form is selected when the components to be crosslinked react with one another effectively even at ambient temperatures or slightly elevated temperatures of 40 to 90&#xb0; C., for example. A combination which may be stated by way of example is that of hydroxy-functional polyesters and/or polyurethanes and/or poly(meth)acrylates with free polyisocyanates as crosslinking agents. It is also possible for an organic polymer as binder to have not only self-crosslinking but also externally crosslinking functional groups and to then be combined with crosslinking agents.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0029">In the at least partial curing of a composition labeled as being chemically curable, there will of course always be some physical curing, referring to the interlooping of polymer chains. The physical curing may even account for the major proportion. Nevertheless, a composition of this kind, if it comprises at least proportionally film-forming components that are chemically curable, is referred to as being chemically curable. It follows from the above that, according to the nature of the coating composition and the components it comprises, at least partial curing is brought about by different mechanisms, which of course also necessitate different curing conditions&#x2014;in particular, different curing temperatures and curing times. In principle and in the context of the present invention it is the case that the at least partial curing of thermochemically curable two-component or three-component systems can be carried out at temperatures of, for example, 40 to 90&#xb0; C., such as, in particular, 40 to 90&#xb0; C., for a duration of 5 to 80 min, preferably 4 to 10 min. Accordingly it is the case that there is a pre-cure flashing phase at lower temperatures and/or for shorter times. A pre-cure flashing phase may run, for example, at 15 to 90&#xb0; C. for a duration of, for example, 0.2 to 6 min, but in any case for shorter times and/or at lower temperatures than the subsequent curing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0030">All of the temperatures elucidated in the context of the present invention should be understood as the temperature of the molding tool in which the compositions are situated. It does not mean, therefore, that the compositions must themselves have the corresponding temperature.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">The measurement methods to be employed in the context of the present invention for determining certain characteristic variables can be found in the Examples section. Unless explicitly indicated otherwise, these measurement methods are to be employed for determining the respective characteristic variable. Where reference is made in the context of the present invention to an official standard without any indication of the official period of validity, the reference is implicitly to that version of the standard that is valid on the filing date, or, in the absence of any valid version at that point in time, to the last valid version.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">The term &#x201c;poly(meth)acrylate&#x201d; refers both to polyacrylates and to polymethacrylates. Poly(meth)acrylates may therefore be composed of acrylates and/or methacrylates and may comprise further ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene or acrylic acid, for example.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">All film thicknesses reported in the context of the present invention should be understood as dry film thicknesses. It is therefore the thickness of the cured film in each case. Hence, where it is reported that a coating material is applied at a particular film thickness, this means that the coating material is applied in such a way as to result in the stated film thickness after curing.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Inventive Process:</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0034">The inventive process can be used to produce molded articles comprising at least one structured surface being optionally coated by at least one coating layer in a single molding process.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0035">In the process of the invention, a molded article comprising at least one structured surface, i.e. a structured article, is produced. A &#x201c;structured article&#x201d; in the sense of the present invention is an article, preferably a workpiece or an assembled product, which comprises on at least a part of at least one surface a plurality of micro-scale and/or nano-scale surface elements. The structured article can optionally be coated with at least one coating on at least a part of at least one surface of said article during the molding process. In accordance with the invention, the texture and optionally coating of at least a part of at least one surface of the article is achieved by using at least one structured mold part and optionally at least one coating composition during the production of said article by the molding process.

However, the term &#x201c;manual process&#x201d; in the sense of the present invention does not mean that such processes cannot include automated process steps, an example being the use of robots.

For example, a frequency-doubled (532 nm) or frequency-tripled (355 nm) Nd-YAG laser can be used, or else an excimer laser (248 nm for example). The laser-engraving operation may utilize for example a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser having a wavelength of 10,640 nm. It is particularly preferable to use lasers having a wavelength in the range from 600 to 2,000 nm. Nd-YAG lasers (1,064 nm), IR diode lasers or solid-state lasers can be used for example. Nd/YAG lasers are particularly preferred since a considerably higher resolution can be obtained so that substantially finer structures can be engraved into the surface of the cured silicone layer.

In thermochemically curable one-component systems, the components to be crosslinked, in other words binder and crosslinking agent, are present alongside one another, in other words in one component. A condition for this is that the components to be crosslinked react with one another effectively only at relatively high temperatures, of more than 100&#xb0; C., for example, so as to prevent premature at least proportional thermochemical curing. Such a combination may be exemplified by hydroxy-functional polyesters and/or polyurethanes with melamine resins and/or blocked polyisocyanates as crosslinking agents.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0188">In thermochemically curable two-component or multicomponent systems, the components to be crosslinked, in other words binders and the crosslinking agents, are present separately from one another in at least two components, which are not combined until shortly before the application.

Such a combination may be exemplified by hydroxy-functional polyesters and/or polyurethanes and/or poly(meth)acrylates with free polyisocyanates as crosslinking agents.

Such an automatic mixing system can comprise a mixing unit, more particularly a static mixer, and also at least two devices for supplying the binder containing first component and the crosslinker containing second component, more particularly gear pumps and/or pressure valves. The static mixer may be a commercially available helical mixer, which is installed into the material supply line about 50 to 100 cm ahead of the atomizer. Preferably 12 to 18 mixing elements (for each element 1 cm in length, diameter 6 to 8 mm) are used in order to obtain sufficient mixing of the two components. Depending on the mixing energy, the pot life (doubling of the viscosity; determined according to DIN 53211) of the composition (C2a) when the above-described 12 to 18 mixing elements are used is 10 to 20 minutes. In order to prevent clogging of the material supply line, it is preferred if the mixing unit is programmed so that not only the helical mixer but also the downstream hose line and the atomizer are flushed with the first component every 7 to 17 minutes. Where the composition (C2a) is applied by means of robots, this flushing operation takes place when the robot head is in a pre-defined position of rest. Depending on the length of the hose line, about 50 to 200 ml are discarded into a catch vessel. A preferred alternative to this procedure is the semicontinuous conveying of mixed release agent composition. If composition (C2a) is forced out regularly (every 7 to 17 minutes, likewise into a catch vessel), it is possible to reduce the quantity of discard material to a minimum (about 10 to 50 ml). Furthermore, provision may be made for the hose line from the mixer to the atomizer, and also the atomizer, to be flushed. This flushing operation is preferred in particular after prolonged downtime of the system or at the end of a shift, in order thus to ensure a long lifetime of the equipment and continuous quality of the composition (C2a).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0190">Also possible in principle is the utilization of a three-component mixing system.

Accordingly, either the composition must be self-crosslinking, or the composition must include corresponding crosslinking agents. With particular preference, the composition (C3a) applied in process step (5) is a polymer foam material, more particularly selected from polyurethane foam materials, polystyrene foam materials, polyester foam materials, butadiene styrene blockcopolymer foam materials and aminoplast foam materials, very preferably from polyurethane foam materials. Polymer foam materials are, in the context of the present invention, thermosets, thermoplastics, elastomers, or thermoelastics from which polymer foams can be produced by a foaming process. In terms of their chemical basis, possible polymer foam materials include for example, but not exclusively, polystyrenes, polyvinyl chlorides, polyurethanes, polyesters, polyethers, polyetheramides, or polyolefins such as polypropylene, polyethylene, and ethylene-vinyl acetate, and also copolymers of the polymers stated. The polymer foams produced from composition (C3a) can include, among others, elastomeric foams, more particularly flexible foams, but also thermoset foams, more particularly rigid foams, and also integral foams. The foams may be open-cell, closed-cell or mixed-cell foams.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0224">The production of the polymer foam by the foaming process is achieved by curing (i.e. foaming) the applied foam material as described in connection with process step (6). Foaming processes are known, and will therefore be presented only briefly. A fundamental principle in each case is that blowing agents and/or gases in solution in the plastic or in a corresponding plastics melt, and formed in crosslinking reactions in the production of corresponding polymeric plastics, are released and so bring about the foaming of the hitherto comparatively dense polymeric plastics. For example, where a low-boiling hydrocarbon is employed as a blowing agent, it vaporizes at elevated temperatures and leads to foaming. Gases such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen as well can also be introduced into the polymer melt at high pressure and/or dissolved therein, as blowing agents. As a result of a later drop in pressure, the melts then foam during the escape of the blowing agent gas.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0225">Particularly preferred polymer foam materials are polyurethane foam materials. These are customarily produced from one or more polyols and one or more polyisocyanates. The blowing agent added to the polyol component to form the foam is usually water, which reacts with part of the polyisocyanate to form carbon dioxide, the reaction therefore being accompanied by foaming. Soft to elastic foams, especially flexible foams, are obtained using long-chain polyols. If short-chain polyols are used, highly crosslinked structures are formed, leading generally to the formation of rigid foams.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0226">The polyols used in producing the polyurethane foam materials preferably comprise polyester polyols, polyether polyols and/or polyester polyether polyols, and are accordingly selected preferably from the group of the aforesaid polyols.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0227">It is also possible first to produce pellets of thermoplastic polymers, for example thermoplastic polyurethanes. These pellets already contain a blowing agent and can be foamed in the mold, with the pellets increasing their volume, fusing with one another, and ultimately forming an article consisting of fused expanded foam beads (also called thermoplastic bead foam). The expandable pellets may be formed, for example, by extrusion and subsequent pelletizing of the polymer strand exiting the extruder. Pelletization is accomplished, for example, via appropriate chopping devices, operating under pressure and temperature conditions such that no expansion occurs.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0228">It is also possible to start from plastics pellets that have already been prefoamed when producing thermoplastic bead foams. These are pellets whose individual pellets or polymer beads, in comparison to pellets that have not been prefoamed, already exhibit substantially increased bead sizes with correspondingly reduced densities. The production of beads with controlled prefoaming can be realized by appropriate process control, as described in WO 2013/153190 A1, for example. Hence, on exiting the extruder, extruded polymer strands may be passed into a pelletizing chamber with a stream of liquid, the liquid being under specific pressure and having a specific temperature. Through adaptation of the operating parameters, it is possible to obtain specific expanded or preexpanded thermoplastic pellets, which can be converted into thermoplastic bead foam substrates by subsequent fusing and, optionally, further expansion with&#x2014;in particular&#x2014;steam.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0229">Thermoplastic bead foams and corresponding thermoplastic, expandable and/or expanded pellets from which such bead foams may be produced are described in WO 2007/082838 A1, WO 2013/153190 A1 or else WO 2008/125250 A1, for example.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0230">Fibers may be admixed to the polymer foam material. When such materials are foamed, the products are known as fiber-reinforced foams. Fibers are preferably used when producing rigid foams.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0231">Application may take place by means of devices known in principle. With particular preference the composition (C3a) is applied automatically in process step (5). Application of composition (C3a) in process step (5) may be performed by injecting the composition (C3a) into the closed mold or by spraying the composition (C3a) into the preferably open mold.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0232">The composition (C3a) can be applied in one step or in a plurality of steps into the mold. Application of composition (C3a) in a plurality of steps is preferably carried out when the mold comprises a plurality of mold cavities. In that case the composition (C3a) in a first stage is injected into the first mold cavity and in a second stage is injected into the second mold cavity. This technique is employed, for example, when the first mold cavity represents an outsole and the second mold cavity represents a self-contained sole frame.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">Step (6):</heading><p id="p-0197" num="0233">According to step (6) of the inventive process, the composition (C3a) and optionally the composition (C2a) are at least partially cured. At least partial curing of composition (C3a) represents the foaming process previously described in connection with process step (5). If the composition (C2a) is present, the at least partial crosslinking of said composition on the surface of the foam material formed in this step results in a high adhesion of the cured composition (C2a) to the foam produced from composition (C3a) and hence improves the mechanical and optical properties of the resultant coated and structured article.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0234">The in order to achieve sufficient crosslinking and foaming, elevated temperatures are preferably used in process step (6). It is therefore advantageous if the composition (C3a) and optionally the composition (C2a) are at least partially cured in process step (6) at a temperature of 45 to 120&#xb0; C., preferably 50 to 100&#xb0; C., more particularly 52 to 95&#xb0; C. for a period of 1 to 20 minutes, preferably after 3 to 15 minutes, more particularly after 4 to 10 minutes.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Optional Step (7):</heading><p id="p-0199" num="0235">In optional step (7), a further composition (C4a) can be applied into the mold and at least partially cured. The composition (C4a) can be injected into the closed mold.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0236">Alternatively, the mold can be opened after step (6) before composition (C4a) is applied. Afterwards, the mold is closed and composition (C4a) is cured.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0237">The composition (C4a) applied in process step (7) is preferably different from the composition (C3a) and is selected from (i) polymer foam materials, more particularly selected from polyurethane foam materials, polystyrene foam materials, polyester foam materials, butadiene styrene blockcopolymer foam materials and aminoplast foam materials, very preferably from polyurethane foam materials, (ii) powder compositions and (iv) mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0238">This process step may be repeated as often as desired. Accordingly, it is also possible for further compositions (C5a, C6a), etc., to be applied, preferably likewise being different from one another. The compositions may differ, for example, in density, in color, or in the material used. In this way, multilayer structured articles can be produced, the properties of the article being adapted through the choice of the compositions used in steps (6) and (7). If step (7) is carried out, the mold parts are preferably moved before application of the composition (C4a) in such a way that a further cavity is formed in which the composition (C4a) can be applied. This may be done, for example, by moving the core plate or the mold part that closes the mold at the top.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0239">The curing or crosslinking of the compositions applied in step (7) preferably takes place at a temperature of 45 to 120&#xb0; C., preferably 50 to 100&#xb0; C., more particularly 52 to 95&#xb0; C. for a period of 1 to 20 minutes, preferably after 3 to 15 minutes, more particularly after 4 to 10 minutes.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Step (8):</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0240">In process step (8) of the process of the invention, the mold is opened and the structured and optionally coated article is removed. Provision may be made in accordance with the invention for the position of at least one mold part of the mold to be altered, in particular hydraulically, before the mold is opened. The opening of the mold as well as the removal of the structured and optionally coated article can be performed manually or automatically. In order to facilitate removal of said article, one of the mold parts can be moved, preferably hydraulically.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Optional Step (9):</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0241">Following removal of the structured and optionally coated article in step (8), said article can to be post-treated. The post-treatment in step (9) preferably comprises trimming and/or polishing and/or coating of the structured article. The article may, if desired, be coated directly&#x2014;without an intermediate sanding procedure&#x2014;with further coating materials such as, for example, with at least one basecoat composition and/or at least one clearcoat composition, to form at least one colored basecoat film and/or at least one clearcoat film, respectively. Prior to application of the at least one basecoat and/or clearcoat composition, the article obtained after step (8) is preferably not coated with a surfacer or primer layer. The applied basecoat and/or clearcoat composition can be cured either separately or jointly.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0242">As basecoat and clearcoat compositions, all basecoat and clearcoat compositions commonly used to coat substrates can be used and which can be cured at temperatures that will not damage the structured article. Suitable basecoat and clearcoat compositions are, for example available from BASF Coatings GmbH. Clearcoat compositions which are particularly suitable are clearcoat materials of the EverGloss product line.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">Further Process Steps:</heading><p id="p-0207" num="0243">The inventive process may comprise further process steps in addition to the mandatory and optional process steps previously listed. For example, the structured silicone containing layer, preferably the silicone layer (SiL) and/or composite (S1C1), can be removed after step (8) or can be exchanged against a structured silicone containing layer, preferably silicone layer (SiL) and/or composite (S1C1), comprising the same or a different structure. Alternatively, a further structured silicone containing layer, preferably silicone layer (SiL) and/or composite (S1C1), can be attached to at least a part of the inner surface of the mold part not yet covered with a structured silicone containing layer, preferably silicone layer (SiL) and/or composite (S1C1).</p><p id="p-0208" num="0244">Moreover, the mold cavity can be cleaned after step (8). Cleaning can be performed either manually or automatically by the use of sandblasting or organic solvents. This cleaning step ensures that the surface of the mold parts and the structured silicone containing layer, preferably silicone layer (SiL) and/or composite (S1C1), has no unwanted residues which reduce the demolding of the molded article and/or the structure transfer to the molded article.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0245">The process of the invention results in three-dimensional molded articles having at least one structured and optionally coated surface. The process allows to transfer the structure of the mold to the article in a high molding accuracy. Additionally, the structured article can be simultaneously coated during the manufacturing process with a coating which as an excellent adhesion to the article and is highly elastic or flexible. Said coating also improves the demolding of the article from the mold, thus rendering the use of external release agents, which require costly and inconvenient removal before post-treatment, superfluous. Since the structuring of the mold ports is achieved by using structured inlays which can be produced at low costs and can be easily exchanged, the inventive process is highly flexible with respect to the structure transferred to the molded article. Additionally, said inlays can be easily removed and exchanged when they are worn out or soiled, thus avoiding labor-intensive cleaning of the molds or reshaping of the mold structures.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Inventive Article:</heading><p id="p-0210" num="0246">After step (8) or optional step (9) of the inventive process, a molded article comprising at least one structured and optionally coated surface is obtained.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0247">The structured molded article is preferably a shoe sole.

With regard to the stated formulation constituents and their quantities, the following should be borne in mind: any reference to a commercial product is to exactly that commercial product, irrespective of the particular principal name selected for the constituent.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="2">1) Description of Methods:</heading><heading id="h-0029" level="2">1.1. Solids Content (Solids, Nonvolatile Fraction)</heading><p id="p-0262" num="0322">The nonvolatile fraction is determined according to ASTM D2369 (date: 2015). In this procedure, 2 g of sample are weighed out into an aluminum dish which has been dried beforehand, and the sample is dried in a drying cabinet at 110&#xb0; C. for 60 minutes, cooled in a desiccator, and then reweighed. The residue, relative to the total amount of sample introduced, corresponds to the nonvolatile fraction.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">1.2. Determination of Acid Number</heading><p id="p-0263" num="0323">The acid number is determined according to DIN EN ISO 2114 (date: June 2002), using &#x201c;method A&#x201d;. The acid number corresponds to the mass of potassium hydroxide in mg required to neutralize 1 g of sample under the conditions specified in DIN EN ISO 2114. The acid number reported corresponds here to the total acid number as specified in the DIN standard, and is based on the solids content.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="2">1.3. Determination of OH Number</heading><p id="p-0264" num="0324">The OH number is determined according to DIN 53240-2. The OH groups are reacted by acetylation with an excess of acetic anhydride. The excess acetic anhydride is subsequently split by addition of water to form acetic acid, and the entire acetic acid is back-titrated with ethanolic KOH. The OH number indicates the quantity of KOH in mg that is equivalent to the amount of acetic acid bound in the acetylation of 1 g of sample. The OH number is based on the solids content of the sample.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="2">1.4. Determination of Number-Average and Weight-Average Molecular Weight</heading><p id="p-0265" num="0325">The number-average molecular weight (Mn) is determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) according to DIN 55672-1 (March 2016). Besides the number-average molecular weight, this method can also be used to determine the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and also the polydispersity d (the ratio of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to number-average molecular weight (Mn)). Tetrahydrofuran is used as the eluent. The determination is made against polystyrene standards. The column material consists of styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">1.5. Determining of Demoldability</heading><p id="p-0266" num="0326">The success of demoldability of the structured article from the three-dimensional mold is determined by removing the mold parts and visually assessing the obtained structured article. If the structured article could be fully demolded and no damage is detected visually, the demoldability is &#x201c;OK&#x201d;. If the structured article could not be demolded or the structured article was visually destroyed during demolding, the demoldability is rated &#x201c;not OK&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0000">1.6. Determination of Residues on Structured Surface of the Article after Demolding:</p><p id="p-0268" num="0327">Residues remaining on the structured surface after demolding were determined by scanning electron microscopy. Images of the structured surface of the demolded article were recorded with magnifications of up to 1000&#xd7; after demolding. If the structured surface of the article showed no visual additional residues using a 1000&#xd7; magnification, the rating is &#x201c;No&#x201d;. If the structured surface showed visual additional residues using a 1000&#xd7; magnification, the rating is &#x201c;Yes&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0034" level="2">2) Production of Structured Silicone Layer (SiL) and Composite (S1C1)</heading><heading id="h-0035" level="2">2.1 Production of Structured Silicone Layer (SiL)</heading><p id="p-0269" num="0328">A structured silicone layer (SiL) was prepared according to Example 5 of EP 2 057 000 B1 with the following deviation:</p><p id="p-0270" num="0329">Instead of the negative pattern disclosed in EP 2 057 000 B1, a negative honeycomb pattern was engraved by means of a laser.</p><heading id="h-0036" level="2">2.2 Production of Composite (S1C1)</heading><p id="p-0271" num="0330">Composites (S1C1) containing a plurality of microscale surface elements were prepared using a roll-to-roll or roll-to-plate embossing tool comprising microstructure A and coating composition E1a according to pages 58 to 59 of WO 2019/185833 A1.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="2">3) Used Compositions C2a</heading><p id="p-0272" num="0331">The following compositions C2a were used in the molding process described in point 4) below (all ingredients are given in % by weight):</p><p id="p-0273" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>C2a-1</entry><entry>C2a-2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>Parocryl 4085 <sup>1)</sup></entry><entry>8.24</entry><entry>8.24</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>Desmophen 670 BA <sup>2)</sup></entry><entry>56.24</entry><entry>56.24</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>1-Methoxy-2-propyl acetate</entry><entry>4.16</entry><entry>4.16</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>Butyl acetate</entry><entry>4.64</entry><entry>4.64</entry></row><row><entry>5</entry><entry>Additive MI-8010 <sup>3)</sup></entry><entry>3.76</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>6</entry><entry>Silmer OHT Di-10 <sup>4)</sup></entry><entry>2.24</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>7</entry><entry>Tinuvin 1130 <sup>5)</sup></entry><entry>0.72</entry><entry>0.72</entry></row><row><entry>8</entry><entry>Base color red <sup>6)</sup></entry><entry>9.76</entry><entry>9.76</entry></row><row><entry>9</entry><entry>Base color pearl white <sup>7)</sup></entry><entry>7.80</entry><entry>7.80</entry></row><row><entry>10</entry><entry>Base color white <sup>8)</sup></entry><entry>2.44</entry><entry>2.44</entry></row><row><entry>11</entry><entry>1-Methoxy-2-propyl acetate</entry><entry>29.92</entry><entry>29.92</entry></row><row><entry>12</entry><entry>K-Kat XK-651 <sup>9)</sup></entry><entry>1.12</entry><entry>1.12</entry></row><row><entry>13</entry><entry>Desmodur N 3800 <sup>10)</sup></entry><entry>25.52</entry><entry>25.52</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="left" id="FOO-00001"><sup>1) </sup>hydroxyl-functional poly(meth)acrylate having a hydroxyl number of 82.5 mg KOH/g, an acid number of 10 mg KOH/g, M<sub>n </sub>about 6800 g/mol, M<sub>w </sub>about 17 000 g/mol (BASFSE),</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="left" id="FOO-00002"><sup>2) </sup>polyester polyol having a hydroxyl number of 115 mg KOH/g and a hydroxyl functionality of about 3.5 (Covestro),</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="left" id="FOO-00003"><sup>3) </sup>mixture of compounds of the formula R<sup>1</sup>-(C=O)<sub>r</sub>-O-(AO)<sub>s</sub>-R<sup>2</sup>, composed of (a) R<sup>1 </sup>= mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, r = 0, AO = mixture of primarily ethylene oxide units and a few propylene oxide units, and R<sup>2 </sup>= H (M<sub>n </sub>&#x2248; 650 g/mol); and (b) R<sup>1 </sup>= unsaturated hydrocarbon radical having 21 carbon atoms, s = 0, and R<sup>2 </sup>= H (M&#xfc;nch Chemie International GmbH),</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="left" id="FOO-00004"><sup>4) </sup>hydroxy-modified polysiloxane of the formula (III) with the above-recited radicals (Siltec GmbH &#x26; Co.

In contrast, the use of an external release agent not comprising a binder (non-inventive process) does only result in partial demolding of the article from the mold.

Thus, the inventive process allows to simultaneously coat and structure three-dimensional foam articles. The coating layer shows a high adhesion to the structured surface. Moreover, the coating layer is highly flexible and does not show any delamination during bending or mechanical stress. Since also pigmented structured foam articles can be produced with the inventive process, said process renders time- and cost-intensive post-coating processes superfluous.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0345">Additionally, a good demolding of the structured article is also obtained in case of the use of a structured silicone layer (mold MO1) without the use of a composition (C2). Thus, the inventive process is highly versatile and allows to provide three dimensional articles having the desired structured surface which can optionally be coated with a flexible and highly durable coating layer.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230001609A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230001609A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230001609A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230001609A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
