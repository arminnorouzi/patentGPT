Communication technologies that rely on light propagating freely through the water provide high data rates and allow exchange of data between arbitrary pairs of transmitting and receiving devices (e.g. underwater monitoring units, nearby underwater vehicles, or other artificial underwater structures). The small carrier wavelengths for optical data signals allows construction of small units and communication components with high resolution (e.g. a factor 10,000 compared to acoustic communication), low latency, and fast update rates.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Propagation of light underwater is nevertheless severely limited compared to propagation in air or free space. For wireless communication transmission underwater, it is preferred to use optical signals with wavelengths ranging from 300 nanometres to 600 nanometres, to anticipate for the selective propagation behaviour of light through water resulting from absorption and scattering by the water and/or particulates in the water.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The maximum communication signal distance between an optical transmitter and receiver in an optical underwater communication system that can be bridged depends on available optical power, communication bandwidth, sensitivity of the receiver, directivity of the receiver and transmitter, and attenuation of the electromagnetic field along the propagation path. For any optical communication system, the required power is proportional to the data rate, but the gain of the system is inversely proportional to the required power.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It may be advantageous to use a directional communication system with high directivity in order to increase maximum communication range and data rate, and/or to improve power-to-range efficiency. The latter may be particularly desired in self-powered subsea communication devices, which may be designed to function autonomously underwater for a prolonged time to minimize deployment, calibration, and retrieval operations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In any case, the transmitter and/or receiver in directional systems need to be properly pointed and mutually aligned with a receiver and/or transmitter of another system, to establish a signal link. A small error in alignment of a transmitter of one unit and a receiver of another unit may mean that only a weak signal or even no signal will be received at the other unit. The correct pointing angles may be found by scanning the surroundings and searching for reception maxima with the transmitting and/or receiving units, but this requires considerable time, especially for highly directive transmitting and/or receiving units.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be desirable to provide an underwater wireless communication unit that allows rapid autonomous establishment of a high-bandwidth and/or high-range communication link with a nearby unit, vehicle, or structure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a communication unit for wireless optical communication in an underwater environment. The unit comprises a housing, a communication transceiver, an adjustment mechanism, and a processor device. The housing accommodates the communication transceiver. The communication transceiver includes an optical signal detector that has a directive gain with a main lobe centred on a receiver directivity axis, and is configured to receive an optical communication signal approaching the unit through the main lobe. Alternatively or in addition, the communication transceiver includes an optical signal generator that has a directive gain with a main lobe centred on a transmitter directivity axis, and is configured to emit an optical communication signal along the transmitter directivity axis and away from the unit. The adjustment mechanism is configured to adjust an orientation of the receiver directivity axis and/or an orientation of the transmitter directivity axis relative to the housing. The processor device is configured to determine at least one directional coordinate (e.g. azimuth and/or elevation angle) for a light signal approaching the communication unit from a light source located in the vicinity. The processor device is further configured to control the adjustment mechanism to automatically adjust and align the orientation of the receiver directivity axis with the determined at least one directional coordinate. Alternatively or in addition, the processor device is configured to control the adjustment mechanism to automatically adjust and align the orientation of the transmitter directivity axis with the at least one directional coordinate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The unit may include an optical communication transmitter and/or an optical communication receiver that are/is directional and repositionable relative to a stationary part of the housing. The processor device is configured to determine one or more directional coordinates of the received light signal, based on data acquired by another measurement source, for instance data from an on-board photogrammetric camera. Based on the determined coordinate(s), the optical communication receiver and/or transmitter can be realigned automatically, without wasting time and energy on scanning the surroundings for incoming signals with the directional receiver, or wasting power on optical transmissions towards directions where the recipient is not located. A communication link between the unit and the target can thus be quickly established or recovered after a link failure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The directivities of the optical signal generator and detector represent the maximal values of their respective directive radiation or detection gain functions. The directive gain is a ratio of the power per unit solid angle radiated/received in a particular direction to the average power value over all directions. An optical transmitter and/or receiver with a directivity D of 10 (D<sub>dB</sub>=10 dB relative to an isotropic reference radiator D<sub>i</sub>=1) or more may yield significant improvements in underwater communication channel performance. Transceiver and/or receiver directivities of 30 (D<sub>dB</sub>&#x2248;15 dB), 300 (D<sub>dB</sub>&#x2248;25 dB), or even 3000 (D<sub>dB</sub>&#x2248;35 dB) may be preferred.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In embodiments wherein the communication receiver and transmitter are both directional and repositionable, the optical signal generator and detector may be mechanically fixed to each other, and integrated to form one repositionable transceiver unit. This allows the use of a single actuator device for simultaneously repositioning the transmitter and receiver main lobes with the directional coordinate(s). Alternatively, the optical signal generator and detector, as well as their adjustment mechanisms, may be formed as distinct devices that are accommodated in distinct housings and which are independently repositionable. This allows the main lobes of the directional transmitter and receiver to be aligned with different targets (e.g. to relay received signals from a nearby underwater vehicle to another communication unit, or vice versa).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In embodiments, the communication unit comprises an underwater imaging device, configured to acquire image data of the light signal. The processor device may then be configured to receive the image data from the imaging device, to determine the directional coordinate(s) for the light signal relative to the imaging device, and to control the adjustment mechanism to automatically adjust and align the orientation of the respective directivity axis with the at least one directional coordinate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The imaging device and position detection capability allow imaging of a light emitting target in the vicinity, and determination of directional coordinate(s) for the target (e.g. azimuth and/or elevation angle, or direction cosines). The underwater imaging device may be formed by an omnidirectional photogrammetric camera with an ultra-wide field of view (UW-FOV), preferably with an azimuthal coverage of 360&#xb0; and an elevational coverage of at least &#x2212;20&#xb0; to +30&#xb0;, for instance of &#x2212;20&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, or even of &#x2212;50&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In embodiments, the housing extends along a nominal unit axis. The unit may comprise an optical system that defines a focal plane substantially parallel with the unit axis, such that the optical signal detector and/or generator of the communication transceiver is located in the focal plane, and the corresponding directivity axis is transverse to the unit axis. The adjustment mechanism may include a linear actuator for moving the optical signal detector and/or the optical signal generator in the focal plane relative to the optical system and parallel with the unit axis, to deflect the directivity axis along an elevation direction. The processor device may then be configured to determine an elevation angle for the received light signal relative to the housing, and to control the linear actuator to adjust the orientation of the respective directivity axis and align this orientation with the determined elevation angle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The optical system may be formed by a system of lenses, mirrors, or combination thereof. Power usage can be significantly reduced by using a linear actuator for moving the transmitting and/or receiving elements relative to the optical system and along the focal plane thereof, to change the directivity axis of the transceiver. Preferably, this actuator mechanism is used for adjusting the transceiver directionality in elevation directions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further embodiment, the housing comprises a base, and the adjustment mechanism further includes a rotary stage that supports the optical signal detector and/or generator of the communication transceiver in a rotatable manner about the unit axis and relative to the base. The processor device may then be configured to determine an azimuth angle for the received light signal relative to the housing, and to control the rotary stage to adjust and align the orientation (e.g. pan angle) of the respective directivity axis with the determined azimuth angle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the rotary stage supports both the imaging device and the optical signal detector and/or generator of the communication transceiver, in a jointly rotatable manner relative to the base. The unit may for instance define two opposite distal ends that are intersected by the nominal unit axis. The base may be located at one distal end, and the imaging device may be located at the opposite distal end and be rotatable relative to the base about this unit axis. The imaging device may be rotationally symmetric about the unit axis. The imaging device may for instance be formed by an omnidirectional photogrammetric camera with an azimuthal coverage of 360&#xb0; and an optical centre that faces along the unit axis and away from the base.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In embodiments, the main lobe of the optical signal detector and/or the optical signal generator corresponds to a pencil beam distribution that is centred on the corresponding directivity axis. The processor device may be configured to determine an azimuth angle and an elevation angle for the received light signal relative to the housing. The adjustment mechanism may then comprise a pan-tilt actuator for adjusting an orientation (e.g. pan and tilt angles) of the pencil beam distribution relative to the housing to substantially align the directivity axis with the determined azimuth and elevation angles.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The main lobe of the transmitter and/or the receiver may have a pencil beam profile, which has narrow beam widths in both angular directions (e.g. pan, tilt) relative to the central directivity axis. The optical signal generator may for instance comprise a laser source for emitting an optical communication signal with a pencil beam-shaped directive transmitter gain distribution.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In embodiments, the optical signal detector forms a multi-region detector defining multiple sensor regions, with each sensor region being configured to sense light and to generate a light detection signal proportional to the received light intensity independently of the other sensor regions. This detector may for instance be a quadrant detector with four sensor regions that are tiled in a mutually adjoining pattern, these regions having corners that meet in a central common vertex. A controller (e.g. the processor) may then be present and configured to adjust an orientation of the receiver directivity axis (e.g. by controlling the pan-tilt actuator), in order to centre a cross-sectional projection of the received beam associated with the optical communication signal onto the central common vertex of the sensor regions. The adjustment mechanism may be controlled based on comparison of the (potentially different) detection signals from the distinct sensor regions, and striving to reduce an imbalance between those detection signals. When all sensor regions (e.g. quadrants) generate the same detection amplitude, the device may be considered pointed at the transmitting light source. Advantageously, detection signals from the sensor regions of the multi-region detector will be correlated, whereas noise of the individual sensor regions will be uncorrelated.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further embodiment, the communication unit further includes an optical system (e.g. lenses and/or mirrors) for focussing an incoming beam associated with the optical communication signal onto the multi-region detector. The unit may also include a further actuator, which is configured to adjust a linear position of a focal point of the optical system along the receiver directivity axis and relative to the multi-region detector. The controller may then be configured to control the further actuator and to adjust this relative linear position, so that the incoming beam will be projected out of focus onto the multi-region detector and will cover all sensor regions to facilitate comparison between the detection signals.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In yet a further embodiment, the communication unit is configured to operate in a reception beam follower mode&#x3e; This mode may be activated in case the optical signal is coming from a source that is gradually moving relative to the communication unit (e.g. from a transceiver mounted on an ROV). In this mode, the controller continuously compares detection amplitudes generated by the sensor regions, and adjusts the position of the optical system relative to the multi-region detector in order to maintain an out-of-focus state and ensure that the received light beam will continue to impinge on all sensor regions of the detector and allow repeated comparison of the signal amplitudes from all sensor regions. The controller uses the signal differences resulting from the comparison to drive the actuator mechanism and adjust the orientation of the receiver and optical system relative to the base of the unit so as to stay pointed at the moving light source.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In embodiments, the main lobe of the optical signal detector and/or the optical signal generator corresponds to a fan beam distribution that is centred on the corresponding directivity axis and is strongly bundled in an azimuth direction. The processor device may be configured to determine only an azimuth angle for the received light signal relative to the housing. The adjustment mechanism may then comprise a pan drive for adjusting an orientation of the fan beam distribution relative to the housing to substantially align the fan beam distribution with the determined azimuth angle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The main lobe of the transmitter and/or the receiver may have a fan beam profile, which has a relatively narrow beam width in one angular direction and a relatively wide beam width in another angular direction, both directions defined relative to the directivity axis. The main lobe may be oriented such that the wide beam dimension extends substantially along the rotation axis of the pan drive, and that the narrow beam dimension substantially corresponds with the azimuthal repositionability by the pan drive. In this case, only a pan drive may suffice to align the fan beam with the determined azimuth angle associated with the observed target, to benefit from the increased transmitter and/or receiver sensitivity. The optical signal generator may for instance comprise a laser line generator for emitting an optical communication signal with a fanbeam-shaped gain distribution.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In embodiments, the optical signal detector and the optical signal generator are fixed relative to each other and form an integrated transceiver unit. The adjustment mechanism may then comprise an actuator for simultaneously adjusting the main lobes and aligning the orientations of the directivity axes with the at least one directional coordinate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In embodiments, the communication unit comprises a further light source that is configured to omnidirectionally emit at least one of an optical beacon signal and a further optical communication signal. The unit may include a separate omnidirectional light source for temporarily emitting light in all directions and allow a similar unit in the vicinity to initially localize this unit using its camera and processor, to allow the other unit to direct its communication transmitter and/or receiver towards the first unit. The further light source may be a beacon light that may radiate in a continuous manner, or be part of an additional omnidirectional optical communication transceiver.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a second aspect, and with the advantages and effects described herein above with reference to the first aspect, there is provided a method for using a communication unit according to the first aspect. The method comprises:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">deploying the communication unit and an underwater vehicle underwater, at non-coinciding positions and within optical communication range;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">emitting an optical signal with the underwater vehicle;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">determining at least one directional coordinate for the received optical signal;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">adjusting a directivity axis of the optical signal detector and/or optical signal generator of the communication transceiver relative to the housing, to align the orientation of the directivity axis with the at least one directional coordinate;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">establishing a wireless optical communication link between the communication transceiver of the unit and a communication transceiver of the underwater vehicle;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000">followed by at least one of:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">controlling the underwater vehicle (e.g. by a shore-based pilot) via the communication unit and the established communication link, to let the underwater vehicle execute intervention or inspection operations;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">transmitting data acquired by the communication unit via the established communication link to the underwater vehicle, and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">receiving, with the communication unit, data from the underwater vehicle, and streaming the received data with the communication unit to a remote control station.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">The underwater vehicle may for instance be an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) or a remotely operable vehicle (ROV). The unit may form part of a wireless network of deployed communication units, and/or be connected to a wired underwater network. The wireless optical link established between the vehicle and the communication unit allows data from the vehicle to be streamed via the unit back to shore. Alternatively or in addition, the link allows the vehicle to be remotely controlled to execute intervention or inspection tasks. Alternatively or in addition, the link allows the vehicle to access data acquired by the unit.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">In an embodiment, the communication unit comprises an underwater imaging device.

The vehicle may for instance be an ROV that is used to perform inspection, repair, or maintenance (IRM) on subsea oil and gas assets. The image data may be streamed in real time to the ROV via the communication link, which allows the ROV pilot to obtain additional visual information of the scene from another perspective.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Embodiments will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings in which corresponding reference symbols indicate corresponding parts.

The housing <b>1021</b> accommodates receiver <b>1027</b>, lens element <b>1060</b>, and lens actuator <b>1070</b>. At least part of the housing <b>1021</b> is rotatably mounted so as to allow joint rotation of the housing <b>1021</b> and optical components along azimuth and elevation directions relative to the base of the communication unit (e.g. using pan-tilt actuator <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The receiver <b>1027</b> includes a quadrant detector <b>1029</b> that is aligned with the lens <b>1060</b> and centred on its optical axis Ar. An incoming light beam with elliptical (e.g. circular) symmetry propagating close to and predominantly along the optical axis Ar will form an elliptical projection on the light-sensitive surface of the quadrant detector <b>1029</b>. The quadrant detector <b>1029</b> includes four distinct sensor regions, each region configured to provide a separate signal amplitude associated with an intensity of the light that impinges on this sensor region. The sensor regions have corners that meet in a central common vertex C. A processor of the communication unit may then be configured to continuously compare the detection amplitudes of these sensor regions, and to use the results of this comparison to drive the actuator mechanism and fine-tune the orientation of the housing <b>1021</b> with receiver <b>1027</b> and lens <b>1060</b> relative to the base of the unit, by keeping a cross-sectional projection of the received beam centred on the common vertex C. This signal comparison and fine-tuning may proceed as long as the quadrant detector <b>1029</b> receives a light signal and the signal amplitudes from the distinct sensor regions remain different, but may cease once the signal amplitudes from all sensor regions become substantially identical, implying that the optical axis Ar is pointed at the external light source. The lens actuator <b>1070</b> is configured to adjust a linear position of the lens <b>1060</b> back-and-forth along the optical axis Ar and relative to the housing <b>1022</b> and detector <b>1029</b>, to allow the transverse width of the reception field-of-view and the cross-sectional size of the elliptical signal projection on the detector <b>1029</b> to be adjusted.

After an optical signal has been detected by the quadrant detector <b>1029</b>, the communication unit may iteratively fine-tune the rotation angles and narrow the field-of-view, to improve alignment and signal strength for the received optical signal.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">The communication unit is further configured to operate in the follower mode, in case the optical signal originates from a source that is moving relative to the unit (e.g. coming from a transceiver <b>18</b> mounted on an ROV <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In this mode, the position of the lens <b>1060</b> is continuously or intermittently adjusted to ensure that the received light will continue to impinge on all sensor regions of the quadrant detector <b>1029</b>, to allow continuous comparison of the signal amplitudes from all sensor regions.
