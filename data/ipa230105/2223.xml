Steam reforming (sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming) is a type of methane reforming in which hydrocarbons are converted in the presence of steam to form syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide). In some cases, the syngas can react further to produce carbon dioxide and more hydrogen.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This disclosure describes technologies relating to reforming of hydrocarbons. Certain aspects of the subject matter can be implemented as a method. Within a reactor, a hydrocarbon is reacted with water in the presence of a catalyst to form hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. By a hydrogen separation membrane positioned within the reactor, hydrogen is selectively allowed to pass through the hydrogen separation membrane to a permeate side of the reactor, while preventing water and carbon-containing compounds from passing through the hydrogen separation membrane and remaining in a retentate side of the reactor. An outlet stream is flowed from the retentate side of the reactor to a first side of a heat exchanger. In the first side of the heat exchanger, the outlet stream is cooled to form a cooled stream. The cooled stream is separated by a separator into a liquid phase and a vapor phase. The liquid phase includes a portion of unreacted water from the reactor. The vapor phase includes a portion of hydrogen formed within the reactor, a portion of unreacted hydrocarbon from the reactor, carbon monoxide formed within the reactor, and carbon dioxide formed within the reactor. The liquid phase is flowed from the separator to a second side of the heat exchanger. In the second side of the heat exchanger, the liquid phase is heated to form steam. The vapor phase is cooled to form condensed water and a first offgas stream. The first offgas stream is cooled to form condensed carbon dioxide and a second offgas stream.

Hydrocarbons (such as methane, CH<sub>4</sub>) can react with water (in the form of steam, H<sub>2</sub>O) in the presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). A few reactions associated with steam methane reforming include:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CH<sub>4</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2194;3H<sub>2</sub>+CO&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0033" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CO+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2194;H<sub>2</sub>+CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CH<sub>4</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2194;4H<sub>2</sub>+CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">Reaction (2) is also known as the water-shift reaction. By Le Chatelier's Principle, increasing the amount of water (which is a reactant) in a steam methane reformer can shift both Reactions (1), (2), and (3) to the right toward the products, which can result in increased hydrogen and carbon dioxide production.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">The subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented in particular implementations, so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Steam can be re-generated and recycled to the steam methane reformer, thereby decreasing the need for new steam generation in comparison to existing systems. Hydrogen production can be increased within the steam methane reformer due to the increased injection of steam. In some implementations, the increased injection of steam to the steam methane reformer allows for omission of a separate water shift reactor, resulting in decreased capital and operating costs. The introduction of excess steam can mitigate the risk of catalyst coking. Furthermore, the steam can provide heat to the endothermic reaction(s).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a system <b>100</b><i>a </i>includes a methane reformer <b>102</b>.
