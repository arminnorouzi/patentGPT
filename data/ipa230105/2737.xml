Because of these characteristics, ES cells, including human ES cells, can become very specific cell types that perform a variety of functions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, human ES cells are highly homogeneous, have a capacity for self-renewal and have an ability to differentiate into any functional cell in the body. Self-renewal can, under appropriate conditions, lead to a long-term proliferating capability with a potential for unlimited expansion in cell culture. In addition, if human ES cells differentiate in an undirected fashion, a heterogeneous population of cells is obtained that express markers for a plurality of different tissue types (WO 01/51616; and Shamblott et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 113 (2001)). These features make human ES cells a unique, homogeneous, starting population for the production of cells having therapeutic utility.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Human ES cells can be used to make a variety of differentiated cells types for scientific and commercial research use. At present, differentiated human cells of many types are not readily available and cannot be expanded in significant numbers in vitro culture. Human ES cells, however, can expand indefinitely in culture and can differentiate into many, if not all, the differentiated cell types of the human body. As such, culture techniques are being developed to induce human ES cells to differentiate into any number of specific cell types of the human body. The availability of human ES cells has opened the possibility that many differentiated human cells will become available in significant numbers for scientific and commercial research.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One difficulty in working with human ES cells is the development of conditions for the standardized culture of human ES cells without the use of animal products or products such as serum, which tend to vary from batch to batch. As such, the art desires culture conditions of human ES cell culture to be as defined as possible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To work toward that desired goal, a set of culture conditions was recently described that permitted the long-term culture of undifferentiated human ES cells in defined conditions. Ludwig et al., Nat. Methods 3:637-646 (2006), incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Ludwig et al. described a medium, referred to herein as TeSR&#x2122; medium, for cultivation of human ES cells in which each constituent of the medium was fully disclosed and characterized. TeSR&#x2122; is therefore a fully defined and sufficient medium for human ES cell culture. TeSR&#x2122; has proven effective for use in the derivation of new human ES cell lines as well, which is an even more challenging constraint than the culture of undifferentiated human ES cells.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Human ES cells preferentially remain undifferentiated when grown in environments in which the cells are in direct contact with other cells or with physical structures in their environment. In other cellular environments, human ES cells begin to differentiate and become incapable of indefinite proliferation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This is significant in the process of cloning an ES cell culture. As used herein, &#x201c;cloning&#x201d; means a process of initiating an ES cell culture from a starting culture, ideally, from a single ES cell or at least from very few ES cells. Culture conditions that permit clonal culture of undifferentiated ES cells may be the most demanding conditions of all of those required in normal ES cell culture and proliferation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In spite of the progress in effectively culturing ES cells, several significant disadvantages with these methods still exist. For example, exposure to animal pathogens through MEF-conditioned medium or matrigel matrix is still a possibility. The major obstacle of the use of human ES cells in human therapy is that the originally described methods to propagate human ES cells involve culturing the human ES cells on a layer of feeder cells of non-human origin, and in the presence of nutrient serum of non-human origin. More recently, extensive research into improving culture systems for human ES cells has concentrated on the ability to grow ES cells under serum free/feeder-free conditions. For example, to ensure a feeder-free environment for the growth of human ES cells, a substitute system based on medium supplemented with serum replacement (SR), transforming growth factor &#x3b2;1 (TGF-&#x3b2;1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and a fibronectin matrix has also been tried (Amit et al (2004), Biol. Reprod. 70(3):837-45). As another example, despite substantial progress, most pluripotency reprogramming still requires at least one genome-integrated transcription factor, increasing risks of genome instability and tumor formation. A further example is formation of teratoma in the existing pluripotency reprogramming methods or systems.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a method of pluripotency reprogramming that reduces or minimizes the adverse effects associated with pluripotency reprogramming.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a pluripotency reprogrammed cell using a method of pluripotency reprogramming that reduces or minimizes the adverse effects associated with pluripotency reprogramming.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The embodiments below address the above identified issues and needs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect of the present invention, it is provided a cell culture medium composition comprising fibromodulin (FMOD) or a derivative or fragment thereof, wherein the composition is effective for reprogramming a cell to form a FMOD reprogrammed (FReP) cell, wherein the FReP cell expresses NANOG and does not form teratoma in vivo.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments of the cell culture medium, the FMOD has a concentration from about 200 nM to about 800 nM.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments of the cell culture medium, optionally in combination with any or all of the above various embodiments, the cell is a human cell, mouse cell, and rat cell.

Studies on Reprogramming Human Fibroblasts to Pluripotency Using a Single Protein, Fibromodulin</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Summary</heading><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Pluripotent and/or multipotent stem cell-based therapeutics are a vital component of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The generation or isolation of safer and readily available stem cell sources will significantly aid clinical applications. We report here a technique using a single molecule, recombinant human fibromodulin protein (FMOD), to reprogram human fibroblasts into multipotent cells. Like virally-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, FMOD reprogrammed (FReP) cells express pluripotency markers, form embryoid bodies (EBs), and differentiate into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm derivatives in vitro. Notably, FReP cells regenerate muscle and bone tissues but do not generate teratomas in vivo. Unlike iPS cells, undifferentiated FReP cells proliferate slowly and express low proto-oncogene c-MYC and unexpectedly high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15<sup>Ink4B </sup>and p2l<sup>WAF1/Cipl</sup>. Remarkably, in a fashion reminiscent of quiescent stem cells, the slow replicative phenotype of undifferentiated FReP cells reverses after differentiation induction, with differentiating FReP cells proliferating faster and expressing less p15<sup>Ink4B </sup>and p21<sup>WAF1/Cipl </sup>than differentiating iPS cells. Overall, single protein, FMOD-based, cell reprograming bypasses the risks of mutation, gene instability, and malignancy associated with genetically-modified iPS cells and provides an alternative strategy for engineering patient-specific multipotent cells for basic research and therapeutic applications.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">1. Introduction</heading><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Patient-specific stem cells bypass many ethical and immunologic concerns and may be created by reprogramming somatic cells into a pluripotent state. Previous studies show that a mammalian somatic cell can be reprogrammed by transferring its nucleus into an oocyte [1-3] or by fusion with an embryonic stem (ES) cell [4,5]. Recently, somatic cells were reprogrammed to gain pluripotency utilizing viral-mediated genomic integration of Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) in mouse cells, or Thomason factors (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28) in human cells [6,7]. These virally-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells resemble natural pluripotent stem cells such as ES cells in many aspects including stem cell surface markers and transcription factor expression profiles, doubling time, embryoid body (EB) formation, teratoma formation, and the capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm [6-10]. Despite significant promise for patient-specific cell therapy, cumbersome iPS cell reprogramming protocols as well as safety concerns over genome integrative approaches that increase iPS cell tumorigenicity have impeded clinical application [11,12]. Viral or DNA-based methodologies all exhibit varying degrees of genomic integration and insertional mutagenesis risks, making them potentially unsafe for human use [11-13].</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In this study, we describe a technically straightforward method to create induced multipotent cells from somatic cells based on extracellular delivery of a single extracellular matrix (ECM) component&#x2014;fibromodulin (FMOD). These FMOD reprogrammed (FReP) cells have the potential to differentiate into various therapeutic cells, but unlike iPS cells, they do not impose a risk of tumor formation from undifferentiated cells.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">2.

The 0.03% FMOD-mediated reprogramming efficiency is comparable to original retroviral-mediated iPS cell reprogramming rates [6, 7]. FMOD-induced ES cell-like colonies expressed several ES/iPS cell pluripotency markers, including core transcriptional regulators of pluripotent cells (NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4), and common pluripotent cell surface antigen (SSEA4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i></figref>). Besides BJ human fibroblasts, adult normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells similarly exposed to FMOD also formed ES cell-like colonies on MEF feeders with positive AP activity and pluripotency marker expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). To confirm induction of NANOG expression, a NANOG::EGFP reporter was introduced into BJ fibroblasts. As expected, NANOG::EGFP reporter was highly activated in FMOD-reprogrammed BJ (BJ-FReP) colonies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>). In addition, Western blotting and qRT-PCR revealed that besides NANOG, which is essential for embryonic and induced pluripotency [26, 27], SOX2 was also significantly upregulated starting at 2 weeks after FMOD treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>d</i>-<i>f</i></figref>). By week 3, NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4 were all markedly upregulated in fully-reprogrammed BJ-FReP cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>d</i>-<i>h</i></figref>). Meanwhile, continuous FMOD exposure substantially increased phosphorylated SMAD3 (pSMAD3) levels at weeks 2 and 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>i </i>and <i>j</i></figref>).

The spatial co-localization of human MHC Class I with either RUNX2 or OCN immunostaining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>) confirmed the engraftment, persistence, and differentiation of BJ-FReP cells into new bone tissue.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0185">In a separate study, to assess in vivo myogenic potential, BJ-FReP cells underwent 3-day myogenic pre-differentiation in vitro before injection into the gluteofemoral muscle pocket of SCID mice.

Discussion</heading><p id="p-0197" num="0191">Tumorigenesis remains a significant obstacle to safe clinical application of pluripotent stem cells, such as iPS and ES cells [13, 41]. At the genetic level, one crucial difference between iPS cells and ES cells is the introduction and integration of genes, which is essential for the reprogramming process, into the genome of somatic cells. As such, iPS cells are likely to carry a higher tumorigenicity risk than ES cells due to gene activation or interruption from viral integration during reprogramming [12, 13, 42-44]. Additionally, undesirable transgene reactivation is another problem of using viral iPS cells. For example, c-Myc reactivation has shown to significantly increase tumor formation in chimeric mice generated from iPS cells [8]. While c-MYC is dispensable for iPS cells generation, reactivation of the other reprogramming factors may also cause tumors [8, 12, 13, 19, 39, 44]. Meanwhile, apart from the extremely low efficiency [12, 44-46], using adenoviruses, plasmids and chemicals to generate iPS cells does not exclude the risk of teratoma formation since genetic alterations from integration of small virus/plasmid DNA fragments or chemically induced mutations can still occur [12, 44]. Moreover, non-integrative RNA- and protein-based iPS-generation approaches are complicated by the need for cell-penetrating, cytosolic delivery [11]. Although the minimal criteria for demonstrating successful human pluripotent stem cell reprogramming is teratoma formation, teratoma formation in and of itself does not guarantee pluripotency as there are instances of mouse ES-like cells that form teratomas but do not produce germline chimeras [44]. Concurrently, significant issues impede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of iPS cells for human use, including (i) undesirable use of oncogenes for reprogramming, (ii) undesirable use of retroviral or genome integrative approaches, and (iii) undesirable teratoma formation. Thus, reprogramming approaches that specifically concentrate on FDA safety issues are required [12, 47-49].</p><p id="p-0198" num="0192">To begin addressing FDA concerns, several groups have successfully reprogrammed fibroblasts into neurons and pancreatic exocrine cells into insulin-producing beta cells without an intermediate, potentially tumorigenic, pluripotent stage [50,51]. This reflects a recent focus on safer cellular reprogramming methodologies that generate curative cell types without teratoma formation [12,44,48]. In this respect, FReP cells may fulfill both goals of functional tissue generation and teratoma prevention.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0193">In this example, we disclose an approach that uses a single extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan&#x2014;FMOD, instead of genetic modifications [6,7,11,45,46], undefined embryonic stem cell extracts [4,52], or animal oocyte extracts [53,54] to generate multipotent cells useful for replacing, restoring, and/or regenerating tissue where disease or injury has caused irreparable damage to native tissues. After simple exposure to FMOD, human skin fibroblasts become at least partially reprogrammed as demonstrated by alterations in gene expression profiles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, <b>2</b><i>h</i></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b</i></figref>). Notably, a set of genes characteristic of undifferentiated ES cells, NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4 [12, 44,55-59] is activated during the FMOD reprogramming (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>d</i>-<i>g</i></figref>). NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4 regulate the ES potency network by acting on promoters of thousands of ES genes and serve as the major transcription factors that collectively define ES cell identity [12,57,59-61].</p><p id="p-0200" num="0194">We have demonstrated that the FReP cells are able to be differentiated into multiple functional cell types, including neurons, pancreatic lineage cells, cardiomyocytes, skeletal myocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes in vitro (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i>-<i>h </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i>-<i>g</i></figref>), suggesting a potential for multiple lineage differentiation and functional tissue regeneration. Thus far, FReP cells have generated functional tissues such as bone and skeletal muscle in vivo (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), confirming that the observed in vitro multipotency is at least partially translated in vivo. Overall reprogramming by FMOD on upregulating NANOG, SOX2, OC4 gene associated on ES pluripotency may mimic a functional transcriptional network towards cell multipotency [62-65].</p><p id="p-0201" num="0195">The fact that extracellular approaches can reprogram cells lends further support to our ability to reprogram fibroblasts using a single extracellular protein, FMOD [54]. The success of generating multipotent FReP cells using an extracellular protein approach has led us to explore the possible mechanism underlying FMOD-based reprogramming. Theoretically, only small molecules can freely penetrate into the cell for reprogramming. As a 59 kD ECM proteoglycan, passive entry of FMOD is unlikely. Alternatively, FMOD has been found to be a critical component for maintenance of endogenous stem cell niches [66]. Specific cellular niches or microenvironments are able to significantly modify epigenetic expression and lead to the altered cell fate [67, 68], while FMOD is known to modulate expression, organization, and function of various growth factors, cytokines, and ECM components [14, 69-75]. It is thus possible that FMOD significantly affects ECM microenvironment to promote signal pathways involved in cell reprogramming.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0196">For instance, FMOD induces a specific, biphasic TGF-&#x3b2;/ACTIVIN/NODAL signaling response characterized by significantly reduced pSMAD3 levels at week 1 followed by markedly increased pSMAD3 at weeks 2 and 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>i</i></figref>). Previous studies has shown that FMOD presence or absence profoundly alters TGF-&#x3b2; bioactivity in a fetal scarless wound repair model [14], and that TGF-&#x3b2;-stimulated SMAD signaling can directly upregulate NANOG expression [29]. While direct SMAD transactivation of OCT4 or SOX2 has not been described, NANOG itself can induce OCT4 or SOX2 expression [60,76]. Thus, FMOD modulation of SMAD signaling may explain the unique molecular phenotype of FReP cells wherein by week 2 of reprogramming, pluripotency genes NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 are concurrently upregulated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>d</i>-<i>g</i></figref>). Theunissen et al. have demonstrated that constitutive Nanog expression, although not sufficient for pluripotency induction, does promote transition of both MEF-derived pre-iPS and neural stem (NS) cells to pluripotency under serum-free conditions with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); this result suggests that Nanog is able to overcome reprogramming barriers and induce pluripotency in minimal conditions [77]. Hence, increased NANOG expression through stimulation of TGF-&#x3b2;/ACTIVIN/ODAL-responsive SMAD signaling is likely a significant permissive pathway for FMOD-based reprogramming. In addition, early combined chemical inhibition of TGF-&#x3b2; and MEK signaling between weeks 1 and 2 improves human cell reprogramming efficiency [78]. Thus, it is also possible that the initial FMOD-mediated pSMAD3 reduction facilitates early reprogramming.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0197">Unlike undifferentiated iPS cells, undifferentiated FReP cells exhibit minimal proliferation rates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) and c-MYC expression levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>) in vitro and do not form teratoma in vivo (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). It is noteworthy that TGF-&#x3b2;-stimulated SMAD signaling can directly upregulate p15<sup>Ink4B </sup>and p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1 </sup>expression [40]. Thus, FMOD modulation of SMAD signaling may explain the increase of p15<sup>Ink4B </sup>and p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1 </sup>in undifferentiated FReP cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <i>c</i></figref>). Meanwhile, active SMAD suppression of c-MYC is essential for TGF-&#x3b2; induced cytostasis since c-MYC interacts directly with SMAD2/3 to block SMAD and SP1 dependent transcription oiP15Ink4B and p21WAF1/CiP1 [40]. Since low c-MYC and high p15<sup>Ink4B </sup>and p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1 </sup>levels promote cytostasis [40], the expression profile of these genes in undifferentiated FReP cells may explain the absence of FReP-associated teratoma relative to undifferentiated iPS cells in which high c-MYC and low p15<sup>Ink4B </sup>and p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1 </sup>conditions favor teratoma formation. However, further studies are needed to address the specific mechanism underlying cell reprogramming by this simple exposure to FMOD.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0198">Remarkably, the slow proliferative rate of undifferentiated FReP cells is significantly reversed by culture in differentiation media, and differentiating FReP cells proliferate faster overall than differentiating iPS cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). In addition, p15<sup>Ink4B </sup>and p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1 </sup>which are critical in suppressing tumorigenesis and maintaining stem cell quiescence [79-82], are increased in undifferentiated FReP cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>b </i>and <i>c</i></figref>). Phenotypically, concomitant molecular multipotency and cytostasis marker expression coupled with low proliferation rates (unless stimulated to differentiate) as seen in the FReP cells are more typical of quiescent stem cells than iPS cells that require induction of cell proliferation for reprogramming [26,37,40]. Moreover, the lack of teratoma formation by FReP cells suggests that from a tumor avoidance perspective, undifferentiated or partially differentiated FReP cells do not need to be selected out before in vivo therapeutic implantation. Since incompletely differentiated ES and iPS cells are known to be tumorigenic and have to be removed before implantation [44,83], this would make FReP cells potentially safer and less cumbersome than ES or iPS cells for clinical applications. Lastly, although the degree of dedifferentiation of FReP cells may not be as complete as that of other reported pluripotent stem cells at least with respect to proliferation and teratoma formation, FReP cells may be a safer and more easily applied method for clinical human tissue regeneration.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="1">5. Conclusion</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0199">This study demonstrates that FMOD, a single ECM proteoglycan, can directly reprogram human fibroblasts to a minimally proliferative, multipotent state that resembles quiescent stem cells. Collectively, these results raise intriguing questions regarding FMOD's role in TGF-&#x3b2;/SMAD signaling and the molecular nexus governing cell reprogramming, stem cell quiescence, and tumorigenicity. Overall, additional detailed studies on FReP cell genetic stability, epigenetic memory, in vivo pluripotency, and long term viability are required. However, we believe that FMOD-based reprogramming may become a major enabling technology for cell-based therapies and tissue engineering applications due to its ease of application, non-integrative nature, and lack of teratoma formation.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0200">[1] Wilmut I, Schnieke A E, McWhir J, Kind A J, Campbell K H.

Using a newly developed, animal component-free and enzyme-free reagent ReLeSR&#x2122;, which was developed to passage human pluripotent stem cells without manual selection or scraping [18,19], these two subsets of cells were easily dissociated. Following the incubation with ReLeSR&#x2122;, monolayer cells (namely FReP-basal cells) remained attached to the culture plate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>c</i></figref>), while the reprogrammed FReP cell colonies were lifted off of the culture plate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>d</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0311">These FReP cells formed ESC-like colonies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>e</i></figref>) in the highly specialized, feeder-free mTESR&#xae;1 medium, which is widely used for human ESC and human iPSC maintenance [20]. In comparison with the manual scraping method, the ratio of ESC-like clone generation was 0.21% (209&#xb1;5.1 colonies/100,000 fibroblasts), which was almost 7-fold higher than our previously reported FMOD reprogramming efficacy (0.03%; 32&#xb1;2.6 colonies/100,000 fibroblasts [15]; Paired-sample t-test, N=6, P&#x3c;1.19&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>). Immunostaining demonstrated the expression of core pluripotent transcriptional regulators NANOG, POU5F1, and SOX2 in the yielded FReP cell colonies growth on Matrigel&#x2122; (data not shown). Additionally, podocalyxin (PODXL), the surface antigen of human pluripotent cells [25,26], was also identified on these FReP cell colonies by two different antibodies TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-80, which recognize proteoglycan epitopes on variants of the same protein (data not shown). In suspension culture, FReP cells harvested by ReLeSR&#x2122; reagent formed stable EBs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>130</b></figref> with the staining of NANOG, POU5F1, and SOX2 (data not shown). These FReP cell-derived EBs (FReP-EBs) also spontaneously presented the staining of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4; data not shown), which is essential for mesoderm formation [27,28], and flt-related receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (FLK1, aka. vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; data not shown), which is a lateral plate mesoderm marker [29]. Interestingly, although the early ectodermal marker NESTIN [30] was found throughout the entire FReP-EBs, neuron specific &#x3b2;III-tubulin was mainly observed at the surface of these FReP-EBs (data not shown). No significant expression of endoderm markers was observed in FReP-EBs (data not shown); however, FReP cells could differentiate into pancreatic lineage cells that were characterized with the expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1, aka. insulin promoter factor 1; data not shown), the marker and essential transcription factor of pancreatic differentiation [31]. These phenomena confirmed that ReLeSR&#x2122; reagent-lifted FReP cells have the same multiple lineage differentiation potential as FReP cells harvested by the scratching method reported previously [15]. Additionally, FReP-basal cells expressed only moderate NANOG but none of the other tested pluripotent markers (data not shown) and did not form stable EBs in suspension culture, which suggested that FReP-basal cells are likely a different type of cell to be further studied. Taken together, we successfully purified and significantly increased the reprogramming rate of the FReP cells by using ReLeSR&#x2122; reagent.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0312">m. Osteogenic Differentiation of FReP Cells In Vitro</p><p id="p-0235" num="0313">After cultivation in osteogenic differentiation medium in vitro for 4 weeks, both Alizarin Red staining and von Kossa staining demonstrated the mineralization of FReP cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i></figref>), which agreed with immunostaining against the broadly accepted major osteogenic markers including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), and bone sialoprotein II (BSPII), respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>c</i>-<i>d</i></figref>). However, under the same situation, no evidence indicated the osteogenic differentiation of their parental BJ-fibroblasts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0314">n. Expression of Pluripotent Genes in FReP Cells During In Vitro Osteogenic Differentiation</p><p id="p-0237" num="0315">In agreement with the immunostaining results presented previously (data not shown), qRT-PCR showed the elevated transcription levels of NANOG, POU5F1, SOX, and PODXL in FReP cells in comparison with those of their parental BJ-fibroblasts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>a</i></figref>). During the in vitro osteogenic differentiation, these genes were significantly reduced (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>a</i></figref>). gBiomaker&#x2122; Screening PCR Array also revealed that the other subset of pluripotent markers, including left-right determination factor 1 (LEFT1), developmental pluripotency associated 4 (DPPA4), and zinc finger protein 42 (ZFP 42) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>b</i></figref>), which were significantly increased in undifferentiated FReP cells, had been rapidly downregulated to the same levels of their parental BJ-fibroblasts due to the osteogenic differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i></figref>). Interestingly, another pluripotency marker growth differentiation factor 3 (GDF3), which was also dramatically induced in FMOD reprogramming, exhibited a specific, biphasic expression profile characterized by a sharp decrease in the first week of osteogenic differentiation followed by a slower elevation stage from then on (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>c</i></figref>). However, the general GDF3 levels were significantly higher than BJ-fibroblasts during the entire reprogramming and osteogenic differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>c</i></figref>). Western blotting results confirmed the expression of these pluripotent markers (data not shown), which demonstrated the loss of pluripotency of FReP cells during osteogenic differentiation.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0316">Surprisingly, DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNMT3/3), which was highly expressed in ESCs, exhibited consistently relatively low transcription levels in FReP cells regardless of reprogramming and osteogenic differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>d</i></figref>). This result supported the hypothesis that DNMT3&#x3b2; is dispensable for pluripotent/multipotent cell reprogramming and maintenance [32-34]. Moreover, since hypermethylation of genomic DNA by DNMT3a and DNMT3&#x3b2; is critical for ECSs to form teratomas in vivo [35], the consistently low level of DNMT3&#x3b2; during FMOD reprogramming may have contributed to the low tumorigenic potential of FReP cells in addition to low c-MYC and high p15 and p21 levels reported previously [15].</p><p id="p-0239" num="0317">o. Osteogenic Gene Profile of FReP Cells During In Vitro Osteogenic Differentiation</p><p id="p-0240" num="0318">PCR arrays are the most reliable tools for analyzing the expression of a focused panel of genes with reasonable costs. Using a commercially available Human Osteogenesis RT<sup>2 </sup>Profiler PCR Array, we evaluated the expression of 84 genes related to osteogenic differentiation in FReP cells with their parental BJ-fibroblasts as control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). Expression of certain specific sets of genes was described below:</p><p id="p-0241" num="0319">Osteoblast commitment and differentiation are regulated by diverse growth factors [36]. Among them, transforming growth factor (TGF)&#x3b2;s and their family members, such as BMPs, have been implicated in both maintenance and differentiation of pluripotent cells [37]. Thus, we first assessed the expression of TGF&#x3b2; family members during FReP cell osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In comparison with BJ-fibroblasts, undifferentiated FReP cells presented significantly higher levels of all three TGF&#x3b2; isoforms (data not shown). Expression of TGF/is sharply decreased in the FReP cells during the first week of osteogenic differentiation, and then maintained low levels throughout the entire in vitro osteogenic differentiation (data not shown). On the contrary, BJ-fibroblasts had consistent TGF&#x3b2;1 levels during the entire four-week cultivation, while the expression levels of TGF&#x3b2;2 and TGF&#x3b2;3 continually increased throughout weeks 2-4 (data not shown). Meanwhile, FReP cells had significantly higher BMP2 levels than their parental BJ-fibroblasts during the entire four-week osteogenic differentiation (data not shown). Interestingly, BMP2 presented a specific, triphasic expression pattern in FReP cells characterized by significantly reduced levels at week 1, followed by a moderate increase at week 2, and then maintained the same level during the last two weeks (data not shown). Undifferentiated FReP cells have lower levels of BMP4 than fibroblasts, but BMP4 expression was significantly upregulated in FReP cells in week 1 of osteogenic differentiation and kept at that level thereafter (data not shown). In addition to the TGF&#x3b2; family, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family also stimulates osteoblast function and bone matrix deposition [38]. In this study, we found that expression of IGF1 was reduced in BJ-fibroblasts during week 1 of cultivation and kept at an extremely low level afterwards (data not shown). In FReP cells, IGF1 maintained consistent levels throughout weeks 1-3 of osteogenic differentiation followed by a significant increase in the last week (data not shown). On the other hand, BJ-fibroblasts had a stable IGF2 expression, while FReP cells had a continually elevated expression of IGF2 during the entire osteogenic differentiation (data not shown). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 (aka. basic fibroblast growth factor) also plays an essential role in promoting the conversion of uncommitted pluripotent/multipotent cells to osteochondroprogenitors and the subsequent osteogenic differentiation via multiple pathways [28,39-45]. Transcription of FGF2 was markedly reduced in week 2 when BJ-fibroblasts were cultured in the osteogenic medium (data not shown). On the contrary, the transcription of FGF2 significantly increased in FReP cells during weeks 1 and 2 of osteogenic differentiation followed by an obvious drop in weeks 3 and 4 (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0242" num="0320">At the transcription factor level, FMOD reprogramming significantly downregulated the transcription of BMP-responsive transcription factor SMAD1 (data not shown). However, the expression of SMAD1 was recovered in FReP cells in week 1 of osteogenic differentiation and kept at higher levels than those of BJ-fibroblasts afterward (data not shown). Although expression of SMAD5, another essential BMP-responsive transcription factor, was not influenced by the FMOD reprogramming, FReP cells exhibited higher SMAD5 levels than parental BJ-fibroblasts when cultured in osteogenic medium (data not shown). The transcription of TWIST1 and SOX9, which are required for osteochondroprogenitor lineage specification [46-48], was significantly induced in FReP cells in week 1 of osteogenic differentiation and dropped back to basal levels in week 2, while expression of TWIST1 and SOX9 was kept at low levels in BJ-fibroblasts during the entire four-week in vitro cultivation (data not shown). As a master transcriptional activator of osteoblast differentiation [46,49], RUNX2 (originally called Cbfa1) was stimulated in FReP cells throughout the four-week osteogenic period, especially weeks 3-4 (data not shown). Interestingly, in FReP cells, the transcription factor osterix (OSX), which is regulated by RUNX2 and is required for mature bone formation [50], was down-regulated in week 1 of osteogenic differentiation, followed by an increase in weeks 2 and 3 before dropping back to the basal level in week 4 (data not shown). Meanwhile, the transcription of OSX decreased in BJ-fibroblasts during the entire four-week in vitro cultivation (data not shown). Vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors that is highly expressed during stem cell osteogenic differentiation [51], was also significantly induced in FReP cells throughout the in vitro osteogenic differentiation period (data not shown). At the same time, the transcription of VDR was continually decreased in BJ-fibroblasts (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0321">With regard to the extracellular matrix (ECM), type I collagen comprises approximately 80% of the total proteins present in bone [52], and its expression was constantly upregulated in FReP cells instead of BJ-fibroblasts during the in vitro osteogenic differentiation (data not shown). Interestingly, transcription of osteopontin (OPN; which is important for biomineralization [53] and anchoring osteoclasts to the mineral matrix of bones [54]) and ALP, a tissue-nonspecific isozyme (which is presumed to be involved in the calcification of bone matrix [55]; encoded by gene ALPL), in FReP cells was similar to that of OSX: decreased in week 1, up-regulated in weeks 2 and 3, and down-regulated again in week 4; while, in BJ-fibroblasts, both OPN and ALPL maintained low expression levels (data not shown). On the other hand, transcription of OCN (aka. bone &#x3b3;-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein; which is secreted solely by osteoblasts [56] and encoded by the gene BGLAP), was stimulated in FReP cells but not BJ-fibroblasts in weeks 3 and 4 of in vitro osteogenic differentiation (data not shown). Taken together, the gene profiling data agreed with our immunological staining data presented above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) and confirmed the osteogenic differentiation of FReP cells in vitro.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0322">p. Implantation of FReP Cells in a Critical-Sized Calvarial Defect Model</p><p id="p-0245" num="0323">Our previous studies have shown that implantation of FReP cells into a pocket in the gluteofemoral muscle of SCID mice with osteoinductive demineralized bone matrix (DBM) resulted in osteogenic differentiation in vivo [15]. As we noticed that DBM is an osteoinductive scaffold, which contains osteogenic growth factors, such as BMP2, and multiple undefined growth factors that hold the potential to induce osteogenesis as well as undesirable toxic side effects [57]. In order to test the feasibility of FReP cells as an alternative cell source for bone regeneration in a more challenging clinically relevant traumatic scenario, FReP cells were seeded on osteoconductive PLGA/HA scaffolds and implanted into a critical-sized SCID mouse calvarial defect. PLGA-HA scaffold was chosen in the current study instead of DBM scaffold to eliminate the osteoinductive stimulation of the growth factors on the DBM scaffold.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0324">i. Radiography</p><p id="p-0247" num="0325">As proof of concept in the critical-sized calvarial defect model, cell-free scaffold alone did not induce obvious bone regeneration at 8 weeks post-implantation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>a</i></figref>). As described above, all tested cell types (BJ-fibroblasts, BJ-iPSCs, and FReP cells) were seeded on the PLGA/HA scaffold and underwent a 3-day in vitro osteogenic initiation before implantation. By using MTT assay as previously described [58], we found no significant difference on adhesion cell numbers between the three groups prior to implantation (One-way ANOVA test, N=6, P=0.71).</p><p id="p-0248" num="0326">Although complete defect healing was not observed in any of the tested groups at 8 weeks post-implantation, significantly more bone formation was observed in the group implanted with FReP cells than the groups implanted with BJ-fibroblasts or BJ-iPSCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>a</i></figref>), which was further confirmed by the quantification of bone volume density (bone volume/total volume, BV/TV; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>b</i></figref>) and bone mineral density (BMD; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>c</i></figref>). It is worth noting that, while newly formed bone tissue was detected throughout the entire defect in both the BJ-fibroblast group and the FReP cell group, bone formation in the BJ-iPSC group was limited to the edge of the defects (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>a</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0249" num="0327">ii. Histological and IHC Analyses</p><p id="p-0250" num="0328">Consistent with radiographic analysis, there was minimal bone regeneration in the group implanted with cell-free scaffold alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>a</i></figref>). In the BJ-fibroblast group, bone formation was not restricted to the defect area, but also escaped the defect and extended underneath with obvious &#x2018;cyst-like bone voids&#x2019; in the newly generated bone tissue and the defect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>b</i></figref>), which contributed to the relative low BMD value (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>c</i></figref>). In agreement with the radiographic image, the new bone tissue was predominantly observed at the edge of the defects in the BJ-iPSC group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>c</i></figref>). However, a mineralized bony bridge connecting the two defect ends without ectopic bone formation was clearly identified by H&#x26;E and Masson's trichrome staining in the FReP cell group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>d</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0251" num="0329">Meanwhile, human cells (BJ-fibroblasts, BJ-iPSCs, and FReP cells) survived in newly generated bone tissue of SCID mouse calvarial defects at 8 weeks post-implantation and were identified by antibodies against human nuclei and human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). However, immunohistochemical staining revealed that there is no significant overlap between the human cell marker staining and osteogenic differentiation marker (RUNX2 and OCN) staining in the BJ-fibroblast group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>b</i></figref>), which indicated implanted fibroblasts may only function as a paracrine signal provider to support calvarial defect healing instead of engrafting into the newly formed bone tissue. On the contrary, the spatial co-localization of human cell markers with osteogenic markers was detected in the osteogenic regions of the defects in both BJ-iPSC group and FReP cell group (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>c,d</i></figref>), which confirmed the engraftment and differentiation of BJ-iPSCs and FReP cells in vivo. Considering the significantly more bone formation with higher density in the FReP cell group than that of the BJ-iPSC group, FReP cells presented a significant advantage in bone regeneration efficacy compared with parental BJ-fibroblasts and BJ-iPSCs.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0252" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0330">[1] H.
