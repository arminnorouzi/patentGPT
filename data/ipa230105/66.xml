No. 63/216,816, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, and entitled &#x201c;BIRD SAFE SCREENING FOR WINDOWS AND OTHER STRUCTURES,&#x201d; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present devices and apparatuses relate generally to an avian impact mitigation system, and more particularly to a protective screen to minimize impacts between birds and windows on buildings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Birds of all shapes and sizes travel at speeds high enough that a window collision almost always proves fatal. Birds that survive immediate impact are still stunned and often seriously injured, rendering them extremely vulnerable to predators like domestic cats, soon after a collision, or unable to fly and thus have diminished capacity to find or forage for food, ultimately leading to starvation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current solutions to the window-striking issue involve simply hanging a net or screen in front of a window on a residential building. These solutions typically have a static mass attached to the bottom of the screen to weigh the screen down. However, with a static mass attached to the screen, the current solutions may only stop a certain subset of birds from impacting the covered window, depending on the bird's mass and speed at impact. For example, if the static mass is too light, the screen will not prevent any but the smallest of birds or birds flying extremely slowly from impacting the window. However, if the static mass is too heavy, the impact of the bird on the screen may cause prove to be harmful or fatal to most birds, because the heavy static mass pulls the screen tight so that there is no give in the screen when the bird impacts the screen. Additionally, as these screens endure the outside environment, the screens degrade and become less reliable for preventing bird impact events.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These current solutions may also cause damage to the residence due to the static mass repeatedly impacting the residence. In even slightly windy conditions, the wind may cause lighter (by weight) static masses to repeatedly impact the residence, often at about the same location on the residence, which can cause damage over time. Heavier static masses may not repeatedly impact the residence as often as the lighter static masses, but the heavier static masses cause more damage per impact, and in heavy winds, the heavier static masses can cause significant residential damage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a long-felt but unresolved need for an avian impact mitigation system that consistently mitigates harm to birds of all sizes and flight speeds when birds impact the system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect, a system comprising: a pliable mesh having a main expanse and suspended relative to a window with the main portion arranged parallel to and offset from a transparent pane of the window;

It will, nevertheless, be understood that no limitation of the scope of the disclosure is thereby intended; any alterations and further modifications of the described or illustrated embodiments, and any further applications of the principles of the disclosure as illustrated therein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the disclosure relates. All limitations of scope should be determined in accordance with and as expressed in the claims.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Whether a term is capitalized is not considered definitive or limiting of the meaning of a term. As used in this document, a capitalized term shall have the same meaning as an uncapitalized term, unless the context of the usage specifically indicates that a more restrictive meaning for the capitalized term is intended. However, the capitalization or lack thereof within the remainder of this document is not intended to be necessarily limiting unless the context clearly indicates that such limitation is intended.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Aspects of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and apparatuses for a bird impact mitigation system for use on a building to prevent birds from striking a window of the building. In various embodiments, the bird impact mitigation system may be installed on the outside of a building in front of a window or a plurality of windows. In one or more embodiments, the bird impact mitigation system may be installed so that when a bird flies into the system, the system causes the bird to decelerate completely before striking the window, but does not cause the bird to decelerate so quickly that the bird is harmed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In multiple embodiments, the bird impact mitigation system may generally include a pliable mesh that has a main expanse disposed vertically in front of, and generally parallel to, a transparent pane of one or more windows by attaching to the building and hanging down from the attachment points. In at least one embodiment, the pliable mesh may be netting or an insect screen, or other similar screens. In a preferred embodiment, the pliable mesh may be a vinyl coated polyester yarn that is pet, puncture, and tear resistant. In some embodiments, the pliable mesh may also obscure reflections from the window glass, which may stop birds from perceiving a reflection of themselves in the glass as a rival bird and attacking the perceived rival bird, which lowers the amount of potential window impacts by birds. In many embodiments, the pliable mesh may have an open area of no greater than about (30%) and openings no larger than about 5 to 10 mm to provide weather resistance and durability. In at least one embodiment, the mesh may be made so as to not obscure the view from the window looking inside or outside. In certain embodiments, larger openings in the mesh can entangle and entrap the head, legs and wings of smaller birds, and thus only protect the structure, while unintentionally creating an additional hazard to the birds by ensnaring them.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one or more embodiments, the system also includes one or more weighted masses that are attached to a bottom portion of the pliable mesh via one or more deformable members. In many embodiments, the one or more weighted masses are suspended from the pliable mesh so that the one or more weighted masses do not touch the ground when the system is installed on the building. In some embodiments, the one or more deformable members that connect the one or more weighted masses to the pliable mesh are elastic cords or straps, such as bungee cords and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the one or more deformable members are marine polyurethane bungee cords that do not degrade rapidly, as compared to regular bungee cords or steel springs, in the outside environment. Marine bungee cords have metal hooks or ends coated with the cord in a pliable rubber jacket, such as a polyurethane coating to resist corrosion and environmental degradation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one or more embodiments, the combination of the one or more weighted masses attached to the pliable mesh by the one or more deformable members allows for a gentle and gradual transference of the bird's kinetic energy to the one or more weighted masses by absorbing and dispersing the kinetic energy to decelerate the bird safely and rebound the bird away from the window without making contact with the window. In at least one embodiment, utilizing the one or more deformable members to attach the one or more weighted masses to the pliable mesh creates a dynamic system, so that when a bird strikes the pliable mesh, the impact causes the one or more deformable members to temporarily elongate and cause the deceleration of the bird to be less sudden. In many embodiments, as the bird is impacting the pliable mesh and causing the one or more deformable members to elongate, the one or more weighted masses provide an opposite horizontal force that the bird is pushing against, which causes the deceleration of the bird. In certain embodiments, as the system causes the bird to decelerate, the one or more deformable members may rebound back to the unelongated state, which may cause the pliable mesh to pull back towards the one or more weighted masses, which causes additional deceleration of the bird.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In several embodiments, the one or more weighted masses may be any device having a mass. In at least one embodiment, the one or more weighted masses may be bags that are filled with material, such as sand, pea gravel, or other similar material. In certain embodiments, the weight of the one or more weighted masses may be adjustable. For example, in one embodiment, if the one or more weighted masses are bags filled with material, the bags may be opened so that material may be added or removed from the bags, to change the weight of the bag. In some embodiments, depending on the type of birds that live in the geographic region, a user may adjust the weight of the weighted material to accommodate those types of birds. For example, in one embodiment, a large city may have mostly smaller birds living in the city, and so the weight of the weighted masses for systems installed in the large city may be lighter than systems installed in rural areas. In certain embodiments, the combined weight of the weighted masses may be in the range of five pounds to 50 pounds. In a preferred embodiment, the combined weight of the one or more weighted masses may be 10 pounds to 25 pounds.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to the figures, for the purposes of example and explanation of the fundamental processes and components of the disclosed systems and methods, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which illustrates an exemplary, bird impact mitigation system <b>100</b>.

Further, the upper side edge <b>110</b><i>u </i>and may be connected to and extend integrally from each of the two side edges <b>110</b><i>s </i>such that a first of the side edges <b>110</b><i>s </i>and the upper side edge <b>110</b><i>u </i>define a third corner, and a second of the side edges <b>110</b><i>s </i>and the upper side edge <b>110</b><i>u </i>define a fourth corner opposite the third corner. The upper side edge <b>110</b><i>u</i>, the lower side edge <b>1101</b>, and the side edges <b>110</b><i>s </i>may cooperate to define a main expanse of the pliable mesh <b>110</b>. The main expanse of the pliable mesh <b>110</b> may be, or include, a continuous, or generally uninterrupted run of the vinyl coated polyester yarn or other material that is used to form the pliable mesh <b>110</b>. For example, the main expanse of pliable mesh <b>110</b> may be a generally rectangular span of the vinyl coated polyester yarn or other material that extends between each corner of the mesh <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, at least two tarp clamps <b>140</b>, anchors <b>902</b>, or grommets (or other connection device that has defined an opening that the deformable member <b>130</b> may attach onto) are located in the top corners of the mesh <b>110</b> that enable two chains <b>170</b> to fasten to the mesh <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, one chain <b>170</b> is fastened or connected to each tarp clamp <b>140</b> at a first end of the chain <b>170</b>, and a second end of the chain <b>170</b> is connected to a first end of a deformable member <b>130</b>. In one or more embodiments, each deformable member <b>130</b> attached to a chain <b>170</b> is attached at a second end of the deformable member <b>130</b> to the building. In some embodiments, the lateral expanse of a pliable mesh <b>110</b> is spaced apart from the window or structure <b>10</b> by at least about 10-18 inches.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In at least one embodiment, one or more weighted masses <b>120</b> may be suspended via one or more deformable members <b>130</b> from a portion of the lower side edge <b>1101</b>. For example, a first of the deformable members <b>130</b> may be coupled with a first corner of the pliable mesh <b>110</b> and extending away therefrom such that weighted mass <b>120</b> may be coupled to the pliable mesh <b>110</b> via the first of the deformable members <b>130</b> at the first corner. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, multiple weighted masses may be used. For example, a second of the deformable members <b>130</b> may be coupled with a second corner or the pliable mesh <b>110</b> and extending away therefrom such that another weight mass may be coupled to the pliable mesh <b>110</b> via the second of the deformable members <b>130</b> at the second corner. As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the one or more weighted masses <b>120</b> may preferably be sandbags <b>121</b>, though it will be understood that any weighted mass that may be hung and have its weight adjusted is included in this disclosure. In many embodiments, the points of attachment of the weighted masses <b>120</b> and the deformable members <b>130</b> are preferably proximal to each lower corner of the pliable mesh <b>110</b>, that is adjacent the intersection of sides <b>110</b><i>s </i>and lower side edges <b>1101</b>. The weighted masses <b>120</b> may be suspended from the pliable mesh <b>110</b> (via the deformable members <b>130</b>) and spaced apart or separated from a ground surface. For example, the weighted masses <b>120</b> may define floating anchors that are fully supported via the respective weighted masses connection to the pliable mesh <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pliable mesh <b>110</b> substantially covers the windows. For example, the pliable mesh <b>110</b> may be suspended relative to a window such that main expanse of pliable mesh is arranged parallel to and offset from a transparent pane of the window. In such arrangement, the pliable mesh <b>110</b> may visually obscure the transparent pane of the window. The pliable mesh <b>110</b> may therefore prevent a bird from observing its reflection or otherwise viewing the transparent pane as open space. The pliable mesh <b>100</b> cooperates with the deformable members <b>130</b> and weighted masses <b>120</b> to limit movement of the main expanse toward the transparent pane. For example, in the event that a bird flies into the system <b>100</b>, the mesh <b>110</b> will initially move towards the window, in the direction the bird was flying. The kinetic energy of the bird is transferred to the one or more deformable members <b>130</b> and to the one or more weighted masses <b>120</b>, causing the one or more deformable members to temporarily elongate, and then rebound, causing the gentle and gradual deceleration of the bird. In this regard, the deformable members <b>130</b> are configured to absorb momentum of the bird that is transferred to the main expanse via the impact from the bird. In several embodiments, by disposing the lateral expanse of a pliable mesh <b>110</b> by at least about 10-18 inches spaced apart from the window or structure, the combined resistance of movement from the one or more elastically deformable members <b>130</b> and the inertia required to displace the weighted mass is 120 is generally sufficient to substantially deaccelerate a bird moving at a speed of up to 45 mph and having a mass less than about 14 ounces before it would hit the window. In one embodiment, the 14-ounce mass provides a safety margin, as any most small- and medium-sized birds only weigh about 6 ounces.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In several embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may prevent an object sized at 14-16 ounces and having a velocity of 35-45 mph from touching the window, or only slightly touch the glass so that the glass does not visually flex (at 14 oz or more). In many embodiments, the energy is efficiently absorbed on the initial impact of the bird with the mesh <b>110</b> by the extension of the elastically deformable members <b>130</b>, then as the pliable mesh <b>110</b> and the deformable members <b>130</b> reach their elastic limits, and further extension takes much greater force, the inertia of the mesh <b>110</b> must be transferred to the hanging weights <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In multiple embodiments, for windows ranging in size from about 2 to 8 ft., each weighted mass <b>120</b> preferably weighs about 7 to 8 pounds (3 to 4 kilograms). In one or more embodiments, weighted mass <b>120</b> attached to the pliable mesh <b>110</b> will pre-extend the deformable members <b>130</b>. In many embodiments, the one or more weighted masses <b>120</b> are preferably bags <b>121</b> filled with sand or any sort of pliable container, preferably containing a non-toxic substance that will not decay or leach on exposure to sunlight, rain, snow or expansion and contraction due to changing weather conditions. In at least one embodiment, it is possible to deploy metal balls (shot or ball bearings like some soft sided dive weights) as well as PVC pipe filled with metal and coated with padding, such as foam rubber, these are less preferred for one or more reasons. In certain embodiments, the sandbags <b>121</b> may weigh from about 7-8 pounds each, such that when two bags <b>121</b> are used there is about 14-16 lbs. total of ballast as weighted mass. In one embodiment, the mass may be reduced for small windows <b>10</b> or using multiple bags <b>121</b>, and the mass may be increased as windows are of large widths and heights. The weighted masses <b>120</b> provide several advantages, including minimizing movement of the pliable mesh <b>110</b> in high wind conditions. In many embodiments, the system <b>100</b> deploys filled sandbags <b>121</b> (for weighted mass and easily adjustable gravity based tensioning) as the one or more weighted masses <b>120</b> which are combined with the one or more deformable members <b>130</b> to allow a gentle and gradual transference of the bird's kinetic energy to the sandbags, to absorb and disperse enough of that energy to decelerate them safely and gently rebound them away from the glass without making contact.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one or more embodiments, preferably that each deformable member <b>130</b> of the pair has a modulus of at least about 0.85 to 2 kg/cm, but more preferably about 1.1 to 1.7 kg/cm and most preferably about 1.2 to 1.5 kg/cm. In some embodiments, when more than two elastic members <b>130</b> are attached to the pliable mesh <b>110</b>, the modulus of each member may be reduced to a lower value provided the modulus acting in parallel is at least about 1.7 to 3.9 kg/cm, but more preferably about 2.2 to 3.1 kg/cm and most preferably about 2.5 to about 3.1 kg/cm.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an alternative embodiment of the bird impact mitigation system <b>100</b><i>a </i>is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.

Additionally, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, two plastic bars <b>150</b> are disposed on opposing lower edges <b>1101</b><i>r </i>and <b>11011</b> that surround a lower rectangular cut out <b>115</b> in the pliable mesh <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the rectangular cut out <b>115</b> may allow for heavy winds to pass under and through the mesh <b>110</b> more effectively, so to minimize any movement by the system <b>100</b><i>a</i>. In at least one embodiment, the deformable members <b>130</b> are attached to the pliable mesh <b>110</b> via reinforced grommet holes at the corners, but in a net or pliable mesh without grommet holes, the one or more deformable members <b>130</b> are preferably attached to tarp clamps <b>140</b>.

In some embodiments, plastic bar <b>150</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, may be preferably utilized when the window length is greater than about 8-10 ft horizontally or vertically to avoid a momentary collapsing effect of the mesh <b>110</b> toward the center before the material transfers significant energy to the suspension system to decelerate the bird (a delay or lag that may be mitigated by using the plastic bar <b>150</b> to restore the reaction time of the energy transfer).
