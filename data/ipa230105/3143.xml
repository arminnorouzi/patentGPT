Such steam-based power plants are often connected to electrical grids, e.g., wide area distribution networks for electrical power often including multiple power plants. Typically, a steam-based power plant burning coal uses electrical power from the grid to which it is connected to drive various elements, e.g., fuel feeders, fuel-pulverizers, heaters, water pumps, air fans, etc., that facilitate electrical power generation operations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many electrical power grids, however, often suffer from fluctuations in their ability to supply consistent electrical power. For example, a grid may experience periods where demand exceeds supply due to natural and/or man-made events and/or accidents. In such scenarios, the frequency of the electrical power supplied by the grid may drop by as much as 0.5 Hz or more. As will be understood, such fluctuations may damage the various elements within a steam-based power plant and/or restrict/hamper normal electrical power generation operations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">What is needed, therefore, is an improved system and method for maintaining electrical power continuity in a steam-based power plant.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, a system for maintaining electrical power continuity in a steam-based power plant is provided.

The method includes receiving, at an electrical power storage apparatus, surplus electrical power from a fossil fuel-fired power generation unit electrically coupled to an electrical power grid and to the electrical power storage apparatus.
