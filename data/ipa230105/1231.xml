In some embodiments, the plurality of elongate seeds dispensed at different angles from a single pivot point include seeds dispensed in at least three different radial angles, at least four different radial angles or even at least six different radial angles, forming a cone, flower or sun shape. The seeds are distributed evenly or unevenly around the single pivot point, for example depending on the shape of the tumor.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Implanting elongate seeds at different angles from a single pivot point results in having a different distance between the seeds at their proximal end near the single point and at their distal ends farther from the single point. This difference in distance between different portions of the seeds is not desired, because the destruction range of the radiation from the seeds decreases sharply with the range from the seed. Applicant, however, has determined that the sun shaped arrangement can provide sufficient radiation to destroy a tumor, and the advantage in simplifying the implanting of the seeds by reducing the number of insertion points of the delivery tube into the patient, outweighs the irregularity of the radiation distribution. Minimizing the number of insertion points is particularly important for glioblastoma tumors in the brain, which is delicate tissue in which it is important to minimize bleeding. Nonetheless, embodiments of the invention could be advantageous in treating other tumors requiring percutaneous implantation of seeds, such as lung, pancreas and liver tumors.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to a probe for implanting radioactive seeds into a tumor. The probe comprises an outer delivery tube whose distal end is led into the tumor, and an elongate applicator carrying one or more radiotherapy seeds, which passes through an inner channel of the outer delivery tube. The probe is designed such that the distal end of the elongate applicator dispenses seeds at an angle (i.e., an angle different from zero, for example at least 2&#xb0; or even at least 5&#xb0;) relative to an axis of the outer delivery tube. Additionally, the probe is designed to allow changing the radial angle at which the elongate applicator dispenses seeds, without taking the outer delivery tube out of the tumor. In some embodiments, the outer delivery tube is rotated within the patient, in order to change the radial angle of seed-ejection. Optionally, the elongate applicator rotates with the outer delivery tube. Alternatively, the elongate applicator does not rotate with outer delivery tube, but rather assumes an angle relative to the outer delivery tube, due to an internal slope or bulge in the delivery tube, such that rotation of the applicator is unnecessary. Further alternatively, the outer delivery tube remains stationary and the elongate applicator is rotated. In some embodiments, the applicator has a wide angle of rotation of at least 180&#xb0;, at least 270&#xb0;, at least 300&#xb0; or even up to a full 360&#xb0;. The applicator optionally allows an operator to dispense multiple seeds radially from a single insertion depth of the applicator, where each of the seeds is dispensed at a different radial angle. The operator optionally can adjust the angle between the seeds, such that the seeds are distributed evenly or unevenly around the applicator. The operator can potentially dispense seeds at multiple depths along the axis of insertion as the applicator is inserted or removed, rather than inserting an applicator repeatedly to dispense the seed directly beneath the applicator. Aspects of the invention thus allow for minimally invasive application of radiotherapy seeds in GBM or other tumors and provides an alternative delivery mechanism to existing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-section of a medical probe <b>100</b>, for use in implanting radiotherapy seeds in a patient, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

This relatively small angle has the advantage of requiring a relatively small bend in applicator <b>106</b> to achieve the angle, such that seeds <b>112</b> can easily slide within applicator <b>106</b> while the applicator is bent.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In other embodiments, the distal end <b>118</b> of applicator <b>106</b> forms a larger angle relative to delivery tube <b>102</b>, for example at least 30&#xb0;, at least 40&#xb0;, at least 50&#xb0; or even at least 60&#xb0;.

The radial angles in which the seeds <b>112</b> are ejected are optionally spaced evenly by about the same angle. Alternatively, for example in irregular tumors, the seeds are spaced unevenly. The seeds <b>112</b> in each layer optionally span over 360&#xb0; around the delivery tube <b>102</b>. Alternatively, delivery tube <b>102</b> is inserted on an edge or close to an edge of a tumor, and seeds <b>112</b> are ejected into the tumor over a span of angles suitable for inserting seeds <b>112</b> into the tumor.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the seeds <b>112</b> in different layers <b>402</b> are ejected at same radial angles, e.g., seeds <b>112</b>A, <b>112</b>B and <b>112</b>C are ejected at same radial angles.

In other embodiments, in order to allow for sterilization at a temperature higher than the boiling point of the liquid, the liquid is introduced into applicator <b>106</b> before its sealing is removed, immediately before the method of implanting the seeds <b>112</b> begins.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of distal hub <b>604</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, in which the liquid is introduced immediately before the implanting procedure. Distal hub <b>604</b> comprises a tube connection hub <b>608</b>, which connects applicator <b>106</b> to extension tube <b>602</b>. Distal hub <b>604</b> further includes a seed stopper <b>610</b>, which prevents seeds <b>112</b> from leaving applicator <b>106</b>. Seed stopper <b>610</b> optionally comprises a suitable heat resistant material, such as polyetheretherketon (also known as PEEK). Distal hub <b>604</b> further includes a distal silicone sheet <b>612</b>, held between two screws <b>614</b> and <b>616</b>, sealing applicator <b>106</b> on its distal end.

Then, the liquid from the syringe is filled into extension tube <b>602</b> and therefrom, due to the low pressure in applicator <b>106</b>, into applicator <b>106</b> in a manner which surrounds seeds <b>112</b>. Thereafter, extension tube <b>602</b> is detached from applicator <b>106</b>, for example by cutting it in a cutting slot <b>620</b> of distal hub <b>604</b>, and distal hub <b>604</b> is removed from applicator <b>106</b>. The liquid surrounding seeds <b>112</b>, within applicator <b>106</b>, prevents radon from escaping from applicator <b>106</b> and also holds seeds <b>112</b> in place and prevents them from undesired movements.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the liquid is a biocompatible viscous liquid such as glycerine.
