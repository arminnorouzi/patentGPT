Lateral wing and spoiler arrangements are known, for example, from DE 10 2017 201 860 A1, DE 10 2018 213 034 A1 and WO 2016 020 423 A1, which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In the case of a side spoiler arrangement which can be activated in a motorized manner, a spoiler blade can be moved by way of an actuating motor out of an aerodynamically function-less rest position into a spoiler position which is extended to the side and to the rear. In the spoiler position, a flow behind the spoiler blade has to be prevented, that is to say it has to be prevented that a significant air flow which would considerably increase the air resistance arises between the extended spoiler blade and the motor vehicle body.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Described herein is a motor vehicle side spoiler arrangement that can be activated in a motorized manner and has low air resistance in the spoiler position of the spoiler blade. The motor vehicle side spoiler arrangement according to aspects of the invention has a spoiler blade which can be moved in a motorized manner and is the essential aerodynamically active part of the side spoiler arrangement. The spoiler blade is, in particular, a body which is smooth-surfaced on the outer side and, in the retracted state, is particularly preferably seated in a vehicle body opening and closes the latter completely here without a step. The spoiler blade is moved by way of a preferably electric actuating motor between a retracted rest position, in which the spoiler blade does not have any appreciable aerodynamic function, and a laterally extended spoiler position. Here, the spoiler blade carries out both a lateral and longitudinally directed movement in a horizontal plane, in each case in relation to the vehicle axes. The longitudinally directed movement into the spoiler position preferably takes place toward the rear, not toward the front. In the present case, this is particularly preferably a rear-side side spoiler arrangement, in each case one spoiler arrangement being provided on the vehicle both on the left-hand and on the right-hand side.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the vehicle side, a spoiler shell which is fixed on the vehicle is provided with a shell rear wall. The spoiler shell with the shell rear wall forms and closes off a receiving space for a guide mechanism and the actuating drive for guiding and actuating the spoiler blade. The spoiler shell is preferably seated behind a vehicle body opening, and is preferably largely fluid-tight, with the result that no moisture or water can pass into the space which lies proximally behind the spoiler shell even in the case of an extended spoiler blade. The guide mechanism holds and guides the spoiler blade, the movement, defined by way of the guide mechanism, of the spoiler blade between its retracted and its extended position having both a movement component in the longitudinal direction and a movement component in the transverse direction, that is to say being moved outward away from the vehicle body and toward the rear in the case of the opening movement.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The guide mechanism can be configured, for example, as a parallelogram guide, by way of which a displacement movement in the transverse direction and in the longitudinal direction and possibly also a slight rotation of the spoiler blade are defined.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A sliding seal lip is provided as underflow protection between the spoiler blade, extended into its spoiler position, and the shell rear wall, which sliding seal lip aerodynamically closes a front-side gap between the spoiler blade and the shell rear wall in the extended spoiler blade position. As a result, the air stream which comes from the front during driving operation is largely deflected upward and/or downward or distally to the side, and the air stream cannot flow proximally behind the spoiler blade. The sliding seal lip is connected by way of its lip base fixedly on the vehicle or, as an alternative, fixedly to the spoiler blade, and slides with its lip tip, during the retraction and the extension of the spoiler blade, on the opposite surface, that is to say on the spoiler blade or on a vehicle-side surface. The sliding seal lip is particularly preferably fixed on the spoiler blade, and lies on the shell rear wall with its lip tip which forms a sliding edge. This arrangement has the advantage that, in particular, the sliding seal lip is arranged in an aerodynamically optimum manner even in intermediate positions of the spoiler blade between the completely retracted and completely extended spoiler blade position, for example always at the front end of the spoiler blade.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sliding seal lip preferably consists of an elastic lip body which is prestressed elastically in such a way that it is adapted to the varying front-side gap between the completely retracted and completely extended spoiler blade position and always largely or completely closes the front-side gap here.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The shell rear wall is preferably of substantially smooth-surfaced configuration in the entire sliding region, on which the sliding seal lip slides between the completely retracted and the completely extended spoiler blade position, with the result that the lip tip-side sliding edge of the sliding seal lip is not damaged when sliding on the shell rear wall in the sliding region.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The front end of the spoiler blade is preferably V-shaped in side view, and the sliding seal lip is arranged or oriented in a similarly V-shaped manner along the front end of the spoiler blade, the tapered middle part of the front end pointing toward the front. As a result of the V-shaped nature of the spoiler blade front end, the air stream which strikes the spoiler blade front end or the sliding seal lip from the front is split, and is deflected upward and downward, with the result that no accumulation of air arises here.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following text, one exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described in greater detail on the basis of the figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a horizontal section of a left-hand-side motor vehicle side spoiler arrangement in the retracted rest position of the spoiler blade,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a horizontal section II-II of the motor vehicle side spoiler arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in the extended spoiler position of the spoiler blade, and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an inner-side top view of the spoiler blade of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The figures show a left-hand-side motor vehicle side spoiler arrangement <b>15</b> with a spoiler blade <b>30</b> which can be moved in a motorized manner.

The spoiler shell <b>50</b> has, inter alia, a bottom wall <b>54</b> which lies approximately in a horizontal plane and a shell rear wall <b>52</b> which lies approximately in a vertical plane, the basic plane of which is oriented approximately parallel to the opening plane of the vehicle body opening <b>20</b> in the front region of the spoiler shell <b>50</b>, which front region forms the sliding region <b>52</b>&#x2032;.
