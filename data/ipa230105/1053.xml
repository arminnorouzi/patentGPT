Treatment of open wounds often involves washing and disinfecting the wound to remove any foreign matter and closing the wound with a substrate. Common wound closure substrates include, for example, adhesive, staples, and sutures.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Medical devices are implants or prosthetics placed inside or on the surface of the body to replace a missing biological structure, support a damaged biological structure, or enhance an existing biological structure. Medical devices may be used to perform a variety of functions, such as diagnostic, therapeutic, and/or monitoring functions. Medical devices can be placed permanently or removed after a period of time. Placement of medical devices is often performed by attaching the device to a target tissue with adhesive or sutures. Certain devices are also manufactured by coupling one or more parts to each other with adhesive or sutures.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For closure of severe wounds and placement of critical or delicate medical devices, current methods generally involve suturing by hand. However, hand suturing requires significant skill, leading to extended times in surgery. Hand suturing is not practical in the field or at the point of injury. Additionally, during device manufacturing, suturing produces low yield because the process is time consuming and has low tolerance for error leading to high manufacturing costs. Devices that require integration of two unlike materials, such as metal and soft tissue or soft material, are especially challenging.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to one exemplary situation, the assembly of bioprosthetic heart valves currently requires suturing by hand, a labor-intensive process performed by highly trained technicians. Suturing along every strut and node can require more than 1,000 sutures per device and over 20 hours of skilled labor. During the procedure, the tissue must not be fully punctured to avoid valve leakage and failure upon implantation. Due to the delicate nature of this process, there is typically low yield, for example, 50% or less.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Practitioners have searched for alternatives to hand suturing that may be applied with a lower skill level and in less time, resulting in cost savings to the patient. However, the few alternatives to hand suturing on the market have not been shown to be adequate replacements for all applications. For instance, conventional adhesives (such as cyanoacrylate (&#x201c;Super glue&#x201d;), Bioglue&#x2122; (CryoLife, Inc., Kennesaw, Ga.), and Coseal&#x2122; (Baxter International Inc., Deerfield, Ill.)) typically fall into two categories. Some conventional adhesives provide a strong bond but are too stiff for delicate tissues. Other conventional adhesives are dynamic and flexible but provide only a weak bond. Neither category of conventional adhesives will provide suitable adhesion for a moving tissue, such as a heart, lung, or muscular tissue.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Other proposed solutions, such as mussel-based and slug slime bio-inspired adhesives, do not provide adequate adhesion to compliant wet surfaces and typically require chemical reactions or materials that are not translatable in the clinic.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Conventional methods do not generally provide adequate adhesion or integration of two unlike materials. Integrating soft and hard materials or metal to a tissue or polymer is often a requirement when implanting medical devices in the body. When the environment is mechanically demanding (such as bone or heart tissue), device failure can be catastrophic. For example, migration of a medical device from the implantation site is a significant concern for transcatheter heart valves and self-expanding stents placed in other lumens of the body (such as blood vessels, gastrointestinal system tissues, and the esophagus). Adhesives that do not adequately integrate unlike materials are generally inadequate for such applications.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Most, if not all, conventional medical adhesives are biodegradable. Biodegradable adhesives are more generally used for fast healing or superficial wound closure. For devices that are intended to be implanted long-term, such as heart valves, biodegradable adhesives are generally inadequate.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Thus, there is a need for an improved method of adhesion that can provide suitable adhesion to wet surfaces, integration of unlike materials, adequate strength and flexibility, and long-term or permanent adhesion.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Additionally, infections resulting from both wound treatment and placement of medical devices are common. Wound infections generally occur when bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms grow within the damaged tissue of the wound. Device associated infections generally occur as a result of pathogenic microorganism colonization at the placement site. Medical devices may also be rejected by surrounding tissues when placement of the device triggers a disproportionate immune response. There is a need for an improved method of adhesion that reduces the risk of an adverse reaction to wound treatment and medical device placement.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In accordance with one aspect, there is provided a biocompatible adhesive. The biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein contain engineered microstructures that support mechanical adhesion to a target tissue or target material, such as a component of a medical device. Thus, the biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein do not generally rely on chemical or other adhesion mechanisms to provide attachment. Although in certain embodiments, the biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein may be supplemented with chemical or other adhesion mechanisms. For instance, in certain embodiments, the biocompatible adhesives may be supplemented with sutures (significantly reducing the overall number of sutures) and/or a chemical or conventional adhesive coating.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein may be applied with low skill level and provide rapid adhesion, reducing labor times. In certain embodiments, the biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein may provide substantially simultaneous attachment upon application. The biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein may provide strong adhesion to compliant wet surfaces such as internal organs and wounds, adhesion and integration of two unlike materials, flexible but strong dynamic adhesion to preserve tissue flexibility and movement, and optional long-lasting or permanent adhesion.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein may comprise a substrate and a plurality of micro-scale elements extending from a surface of the substrate. The substrate may be a substantially planar structure. The biocompatible adhesive may be a single-sided adhesive. In such embodiments, the plurality of micro-scale elements may extend from one surface of the substrate. The biocompatible adhesive may be a double-sided adhesive. In such embodiments, the plurality of micro-scale elements may extend from two opposite surfaces of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In certain embodiments, the biocompatible adhesive may have a backing layer positioned on an adhesive side of the adhesive. For instance, a backing layer may be positioned adjacent a distal end of the micro-scale elements. The backing layer may provide protection for the micro-scale elements, for example, during storage or transport. The backing layer may be easily removable prior to application of the biocompatible adhesive. The backing layer may have a smooth surface. The backing layer may have an indented surface configured to mate with the micro-scale elements.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The micro-scale elements may be engineered for mechanical attachment to a selected target tissue. Mechanical attachment to tissue material generally requires puncture and/or penetration of at least one layer of the tissue. As disclosed herein, &#x201c;puncture&#x201d; or &#x201c;puncturing&#x201d; may refer to any insertion into a layer, including partial insertion. As disclosed herein, &#x201c;penetrate&#x201d; or &#x201c;penetration&#x201d; may refer to passage through a layer.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The layer of the tissue may be an external or superficial layer of the tissue. The layer may be, for example, an external layer of the tissue, such as an external fibrous layer. The layer may be, for example, a superficial layer of the tissue, such as a superficial fibrous layer, cell layer (e.g., epithelial cell layer or connective cell layer), or adventitial layer (e.g., adventitial layer of a blood vessel, including puncturing an adventitial layer of the blood vessel and puncturing a medial layer of the blood vessel). In some embodiments, mechanical attachment may include penetrating a superficial mucosal layer to puncture and/or penetrate a fibrous layer of the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring specifically to skin tissue as one exemplary target tissue, an epidermal layer covers an exterior surface of the skin. An adhesive effective for external wound closure may include micro-scale elements engineered to puncture and/or penetrate the epidermal layer of the skin. Other bodily tissues have similar external layers. The biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein are generally engineered to puncture and/or penetrate at least one layer of a selected target tissue.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The target tissue may be any bodily structure capable of providing mechanical resistance. The target tissue may comprise any bodily tissue. The biocompatible adhesives disclosed herein may be engineered to provide adhesion to delicate tissues, such as gastrointestinal and pulmonary tissues, dynamic tissues, such as cardiac and muscular tissues, and dense tissues, such as skeletal and connective tissues. Exemplary target tissues include cardiac tissue, pulmonary tissue, skeletal tissue, muscular tissue, connective tissue, nervous tissue, gastrointestinal tissue, ocular tissue, dental tissue, and others.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The target tissue may be a native tissue. For example, the target tissue may be a live tissue of the subject. In other embodiments, the target tissue may be non-native tissue, for example, a bioprosthetic tissue. Bioprosthetic tissues may be previously implanted foreign tissues. The bioprosthetic tissues may be implanted at the time of implanting the biocompatible adhesive. The bioprosthetic tissues may comprise donor tissue or bioengineered tissue. The donor tissue may be, for example, allogeneic or xenogeneic tissue. The bioengineered tissue may be at least partially synthetic tissue. The bioengineered tissue may comprise autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic tissue.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the micro-scale elements may have a length selected to puncture or penetrate a layer of the target tissue, for example, an external or superficial layer of the target tissue. The length may be selected to avoid puncturing or penetrating a specific layer of the target tissue. For example, the length may be selected to avoid puncturing a nerve, e.g., a layer of the target tissue containing nerves. The length may be selected to avoid puncturing a fluid-containing lumen, such as a blood vessel or intestine. The length may be selected to avoid puncturing or penetrating any non-target layer of the target tissue. In certain embodiments, the micro-scale elements may have a length selected to puncture or penetrate more than one layer of the target tissue, for example, at least two layers of the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The disclosure refers generally to attachment to a target tissue. However, it should be understood that micro-scale elements may be engineered for mechanical attachment to any target material. Thus, any embodiments disclosed herein which refer to a target tissue may be used for attachment to any target material. The target material may be any non-tissue material. The target material may be a synthetic material. The target material may be, for example, a polymeric material, a metal material, or any other material.

The length of the micro-scale elements may be from about one micrometer to several hundred micrometers. Exemplary micro-scale elements may have a length from less than 1 &#x3bc;m, 1 &#x3bc;m-1,000 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m-750 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m-500 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m-300 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m-250 &#x3bc;m, or 10 &#x3bc;m-150 &#x3bc;m, for example, 10 &#x3bc;m-50 &#x3bc;m, 50 &#x3bc;m-100 &#x3bc;m, 100 &#x3bc;m-150 &#x3bc;m, 120 &#x3bc;m-150 &#x3bc;m, 150 &#x3bc;m-250 &#x3bc;m, 250 &#x3bc;m-500 &#x3bc;m, 500 &#x3bc;m-750 &#x3bc;m, or 750 &#x3bc;m-1,000 &#x3bc;m.

The base width may be selected to provide adequate adhesion while not incurring damage to the target tissue. The base width of the micro-scale elements may be defined by a representative dimension of the proximal end of the micro-scale elements adjacent to the substrate. For example, a conical micro-scale element may have a base width defined by the diameter of the proximal end of the micro-scale element. Similarly, a rectangular pyramid micro-scale element may have a base width defined by the diagonal of the rectangular cross-section proximal end of the micro-scale element and a triangular pyramid micro-scale element may have a base defined by the height of the triangular cross-section of the proximal end of the micro-scale element. Thus, in certain embodiments, the micro-scale element may be rotationally symmetric, having a circular cross-sectional area. In other embodiments, the micro-scale element may have a rectangular or triangular cross-sectional area. The micro-scale elements may have a cross-sectional area of any shape. The micro-scale elements may have a base width of less than 1 &#x3bc;m, 1 &#x3bc;m-100 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m-100 &#x3bc;m, 20 &#x3bc;m-100 &#x3bc;m, or 40 &#x3bc;m-80 &#x3bc;m, for example, 1 &#x3bc;m-60 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m-60 &#x3bc;m, 20 &#x3bc;m-60 &#x3bc;m, or 20 &#x3bc;m-40 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The micro-scale elements may have a profile engineered to puncture or penetrate and anchor the target tissue. In some embodiments, the plurality of micro-scale elements may be formed of a short extrusion. Exemplary short extrusions may have a base width to element length ratio of 1:2-1:5, for example 1:2-1:4. In some embodiments, the plurality of micro-scale elements may be formed of a long extrusion. Exemplary long extrusions may have a base width to element length ratio of 1:6-1:10, for example, 1:6-1:8 or 1:8-1:10. Thus, the micro-scale elements may have a base width to element length ratio of 1:2-1:10.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, the base may be defined by a representative dimension of the distal end of the micro-scale elements.

In particular, the distal end of the micro-scale elements may be dimensioned to have a radius of curvature small enough to puncture the target tissue with the applied penetration force. Sharpness of the micro-scale elements, for instance, an apex or vertex angle of the micro-scale elements, may be selected for the target tissue. The apex or vertex angle is shown in the exemplary embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> (labelled apex angle).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In general, a smaller apex or vertex angle may correspond with increased sharpness of the micro-scale element. A larger apex or vertex angle may correspond with decreased sharpness of the micro-scale element. In general, the apex or vertex angle may be as small as possible, for example, as permissible by tolerance of the manufacturing method. Exemplary apex and vertex angles include less than 15&#xb0;, 15&#xb0;-30&#xb0;, 30&#xb0;-45&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;-60&#xb0;. In other embodiments, exemplary apex and vertex angles include 60&#xb0;-90&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;-120&#xb0; and 120&#xb0;-180&#xb0;. In some embodiments, the apex or vertex angle may have a rounded tip.

The at least one protrusion may be a physical element that extends from a surface of the micro-scale element. The at least one protrusion may be dimensioned to require lesser penetration force for entry of the micro-scale element than a removal force for extraction. For instance, the at least one protrusion may be dimensioned so as to facilitate entry into the target tissue and/or make extraction from the target tissue difficult.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A plurality of micro-scale elements of the biocompatible adhesive may have at least one protrusion. In some embodiments, substantially all of the micro-scale elements of the biocompatible adhesive comprise at least one protrusion.

The at least one protrusion may be a radial protrusion, for example, a ring or other structure surrounding the base of the micro-scale element. In other embodiments, the micro-scale elements need not be rotationally symmetric. For instance, the at least one protrusion may be laterally located on one or more points of the micro-scale element (for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).

Anchoring the biocompatible adhesive may be effectuated immediately upon penetration of the layer of the target tissue. For instance, applying a small pressure to the biocompatible adhesive may anchor the biocompatible adhesive to the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The biocompatible adhesive or a component thereof may be formed of a polymeric material. For example, in some embodiments, the substrate or a portion thereof may be formed of a polymeric material.

The material may be selected from polymeric materials having differing durometers.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, the biocompatible adhesive or component may be formed of a rigid or semi-rigid polymeric material. The rigid or semi-rigid polymeric material may be selected to provide structural support.

The flexible polymeric material may be selected to be compatible with target tissue flexibility and movement.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The biocompatible adhesive or a component thereof may be formed of a metal material, for example, a metal or metal alloy. For example, in some embodiments, the substrate or a portion thereof may be formed of a metal material. In some embodiments, the micro-scale elements or a portion thereof may be formed of a metal material. Exemplary biocompatible metal materials include stainless steel, cobalt-chrome alloy, titanium, and nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol). Other metals, such as gold, platinum, silver, aluminum, iridium, tantalum, and tungsten may be used. The metal material may be a rigid or semi-rigid material.

The pliable metal material may be selected to be compatible with target tissue flexibility and movement.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, the biocompatible adhesive may be formed of a combination of materials. For instance, the biocompatible adhesive may be formed of two or more polymeric materials. The biocompatible adhesive may be formed of one or more metal and polymeric materials. For instance, the substrate may be formed of a first material and the micro-scale elements may be formed of a second material. In some embodiments, the substrate may be formed of a more flexible material and the micro-scale elements may be formed of a more rigid or semi-rigid material. For example, in at least some exemplary embodiments, the substrate may be formed of a flexible polymeric material and the micro-scale elements may be formed of a rigid or semi-rigid polymeric material or a metal material. In certain embodiments, the substrate and/or micro-scale elements may comprise a rigid or semi-rigid core. The substrate and/or micro-scale elements may comprise a flexible outer layer. In one exemplary embodiment, the substrate may comprise a flexible material and the micro-scale elements may comprise a rigid or semi-rigid core with a flexible outer layer. The flexible outer layer may form the one or more protrusions.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Thus, in certain embodiments, the substrate may be formed of a first material and the micro-scale elements may be formed of a second material. In some embodiments, the substrate may comprise portions formed of a first material and portions formed of a second material and/or the micro-scale elements may comprise portions formed of a first material and portions formed of a second material. For instance, the micro-scale elements may comprise a core formed of a first material and an outer layer formed of a second material. In certain exemplary embodiments, the micro-scale elements may comprise one or more protrusions formed of a second material. The materials may be independently selected to be a polymeric material, a variety of polymeric materials (for example, a first polymeric material and a second polymeric material), a metal material, and/or a variety of metal materials (for example, a first metal material and a second metal material). The materials may be independently selected to provide desired rigidity or flexibility.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">While the micro-scale elements are generally dimensioned to anchor the biocompatible adhesive to the target tissue substantially simultaneously upon attachment, the biocompatible adhesive and/or the substrate may be formed of a material capable of expansion over time. In particular, for extended use or permanent use of the biocompatible adhesives, the material may be selected to provide expansion proportional to the growth rate of the target tissue. Thus, the biocompatible adhesive may remain attached even as the target tissue of the subject grows. Additionally, for dynamic tissues, such as cardiac, pulmonary, and muscle tissues, the material may be selected to provide reversible expansion with movement of the target tissue. Thus, the biocompatible adhesive may remain attached with expansion and contraction of the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The micro-scale elements may be formed of a material and/or be dimensioned to reduce breakage from the substrate during use. Thus, the material and/or dimensions (for example, base width and length dimensions) may be selected based on the target tissue. Certain target tissues that have more movement may require more flexible micro-scale elements. Certain target tissues that require greater penetration force may require more rigid micro-scale elements. In certain embodiments, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% of the micro-scale elements may remain attached to the substrate after a pre-determined period of use, for example, after 24 hours, after 48 hours, after 1 week, after 1 month, or after 1 year of use.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In certain embodiments, the biocompatible adhesive or a component thereof may be sterile or substantially sterile.

Antimicrobial and antiseptic agents may inhibit the growth or reproduction or destroy microorganisms such as fungi, viruses, bacteria, and combinations thereof. In particular, the antimicrobial or antiseptic agent may inhibit the growth or reproduction or destroy pathogenic microorganisms. Antimicrobial and antiseptic agents may additionally prevent or treat an infection by a pathogenic microorganism. Exemplary antimicrobial agents include mupirocin, fusidic acid, neomycin, bacitracin, polymyxins, retapamulin, ebselen, and antimicrobial peptides, such as PXL150 and others. Exemplary antiseptic agents include biocides, such as chlorhexidine, trisclosan, povidone-iodine, and alcohol-based biocides. It should be noted that several therapeutic agents may have more than one effect, for example, more than one of an anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiseptic effect. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent may be formulated to provide a prophylactic treatment.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The therapeutically active agent may be coated on a surface of the biocompatible adhesive, for example, on a surface of at least some of the plurality of micro-scale elements.

The deployable element may comprise, for example, a releasable micro-scale element or a releasable protrusion of a micro-scale element. The deployable element may comprise microcapsules. The deployable element may be formulated for immediate release. The deployable element may be formulated for extended release or delayed release. The deployable element may be formulated to provide a local effect, for example, an effect at the target tissue. The deployable element may be formulated to provide a system effect, for example, an effect at a tissue other than the target tissue. In some embodiments, the deployable element may be configured to migrate to a tissue other than the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The biocompatible adhesives described herein may be manufactured by a number of different micro-scale product manufacturing methods. Exemplary manufacturing methods include injection molding, e.g., polymer molding or metal molding, additive manufacturing, metal cutting, e.g., laser cutting, plasma cutting, water jetting, microfabrication lithography, metal etching, or others. The manufacturing method may be selected based on the material of the biocompatible adhesive and/or the material of the micro-scale elements. In one exemplary embodiment, the biocompatible adhesive may be manufactured by bi-layer injection molding. For instance, the micro-scale elements may be molded from a first layer of the mold and the at least one protrusion may be molded from a second layer of the mold. The geometries of the bi-layer mold may be selected to reduce breakage of the protrusions from the micro-scale elements upon removal. A tri-layer mold may be used, for example, to manufacture a double-sided biocompatible adhesive.

One approach (with a polymer-based microstructure) is to coat or over-mold the stent with the biocompatible adhesive structure. Another approach (with a metal-based microstructure) is to glue or weld an etched foil onto the stent. Alternatively, a sheet of the biocompatible adhesive may be fabricated and wrapped around the stent and attached. The biocompatible adhesive may be attached to the stent with sutures, adhesives, or similar mechanisms. The biocompatible adhesive may be used in conjunction with conventional sutures, but still utilizing significantly fewer sutures than currently required to manufacture bioprosthetic valves.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Biocompatible Adhesives</heading><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Biocompatible adhesives as described herein were produced.
