Some small form factor cameras may incorporate folded optics including one or more light path folding elements such as prisms or mirrors to change the direction of the optical path of an image so as to redirect light to an image sensor that is positioned out of the natural path of the light representing the image to be captured. Some such systems include optical image stabilization (OIS) and/or autofocus (AF) mechanisms that may sense and react to external excitation/disturbance by adjusting position of the light path folding elements and/or optical lens assembly on an X and/or Y axis in an attempt to compensate for unwanted motion of the camera unit or lens.

In such contexts, &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; is used to connote structure by indicating that the units/circuits/components include structure (e.g., circuitry) that performs those task or tasks during operation. As such, the unit/circuit/component can be said to be configured to perform the task even when the specified unit/circuit/component is not currently operational (e.g., is not on). The units/circuits/components used with the &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; language include hardware&#x2014;for example, circuits, memory storing program instructions executable to implement the operation, etc. Reciting that a unit/circuit/component is &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; perform one or more tasks is expressly intended not to invoke 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112(f) for that unit/circuit/component.

In various embodiments, a camera may include one or more optical elements, an image sensor, an actuator arrangement, and the ball bearing suspension arrangement. The optical element(s) may include, for example, a lens, a prism, and/or a mirror. The actuator arrangement may include the tiltable structure(s) and a tilt actuator. In some embodiments, the tiltable structure(s) may include a carrier to which the optical element or the image sensor may be fixedly coupled. The tilt actuator may be configured to tilt the tiltable structure(s) about a tilt axis. In various embodiments, compact camera modules include actuators to deliver functions such as autofocus (AF) and/or optical image stabilization (OIS). One non-limiting approach to delivering a very compact actuator for AF and/or OIS is to use a voice coil motor (VCM) actuator.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to various embodiments, the ball bearing suspension arrangement may suspend the tiltable structure(s) from a base structure, and may allow motion of the optical element(s) or the image sensor enabled by the tilt actuator. The ball bearing suspension arrangement may include a set of ball bearings arranged to allow tilt motion of the tiltable structure(s) about the tilt axis. In some embodiments, the set of ball bearings may include a ball bearing that is at a different height relative to other ball bearings in set of ball bearings. In some embodiments, the set of ball bearings may include a first ball bearing and a second ball bearing positioned along an axis, and the axis may intersect a first plane that is orthogonal to the tilt axis. Furthermore, the set of ball bearings may include a third ball bearing. The first ball bearing, the second ball bearing, and the third ball bearing may be positioned along a second plane that intersects the first plane.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some other camera systems, four or more ball bearings may be positioned in a single plane orthogonal to the tilt axis. However, in such an arrangement, any small difference in ball size, or for example differences in positional height as a result of imperfect manufacturing tolerances for example in any material surrounding the ball bearings, may reduce the stability of a tiltable structure as it rests and/or rotates on the ball bearings. In various embodiments disclosed here, the set of ball bearings may have a number of ball bearings (e.g., three ball bearings) arranged to increase stability of the tiltable structure(s) in suspension by the set of ball bearings and during rotating about the tilt axis. For example, one of the ball bearings may be positioned higher on the tilt axis relative to the other ball bearings. As a result, and in accordance with some embodiments, the plane formed by ball bearings is not orthogonal to the tilt axis. According to some embodiments, this placement of the ball bearings may allow for additional room within a camera housing for more parts and/or upgraded components of a camera module, as further discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Various embodiments are discussed herein within the context of a folded optics arrangement. However, it should be understood that various embodiments of the bearing suspension arrangement may be used in various different types of cameras, including those that do not have a folded optics arrangement those that have a different folded optics arrangement than the ones used as examples herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that some embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Described herein are embodiments of a camera with folded optics and a bearing suspension arrangement for suspending one or more tiltable structures according to various embodiments. The arrangements discussed throughout generally comprise at least a first ball bearing, and a second ball bearing positioned closer, relative to the first ball bearing to an object side of a light path folding element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a generalized example of a perspective view of an example folded optics arrangement that may be included in a camera <b>100</b> with folded optics configured with a ball bearing suspension arrangement, in accordance with some embodiments.

The lens group <b>104</b> may include one or more lens elements. In some embodiments, the lens group <b>104</b> may be located between the prism <b>102</b> and the image sensor <b>106</b>. The prism <b>102</b> and the lens group <b>104</b> may form a folded optics arrangement (e.g., a single fold optics arrangement as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) through which light passes before reaching the image sensor <b>106</b>. Light may follow an optical path <b>108</b> that is folded by prism <b>102</b> such that the light is directed towards the lens group <b>104</b>, passes through the lens group <b>104</b>, and then reaches the image sensor <b>106</b>.
