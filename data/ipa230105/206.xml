Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates generally to an article of footwear including a sole plate.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">2. Description of the Background</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many conventional shoes or other articles of footwear generally comprise an upper and a sole attached to a lower end of the upper. Conventional shoes further include an internal space, i.e., a void or cavity, which is created by interior surfaces of the upper and sole, that receives a foot of a user before securing the shoe to the foot. The sole is attached to a lower surface or boundary of the upper and is positioned between the upper and the ground. As a result, the sole typically provides stability and cushioning to the user when the shoe is being worn. In some instances, the sole may include multiple components, such as an outsole, a midsole, and a top portion. The outsole may provide traction to a bottom surface of the sole, and the midsole may be attached to an inner surface of the outsole, and may provide cushioning or added stability to the sole. For example, a sole may include a particular foam material that may increase stability at one or more desired locations along the sole, or a foam material that may reduce stress or impact energy on the foot or leg when a user is running, walking, or engaged in another activity. The sole may also include additional components, such as plates, embedded with the sole to increase the overall stiffness of the sole and reduce energy loss during use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The upper generally extends upward from the sole and defines an interior cavity that completely or partially encases a foot. In most cases, the upper extends over the instep and toe regions of the foot, and across medial and lateral sides thereof. Many articles of footwear may also include a tongue that extends across the instep region to bridge a gap between edges of medial and lateral sides of the upper, which define an opening into the cavity. The tongue may also be disposed below a lacing system and between medial and lateral sides of the upper, to allow for adjustment of shoe tightness. The tongue may further be manipulatable by a user to permit entry or exit of a foot from the internal space or cavity. In addition, the lacing system may allow a user to adjust certain dimensions of the upper or the sole, thereby allowing the upper to accommodate a wide variety of foot types having varying sizes and shapes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The upper of many shoes may comprise a wide variety of materials, which may be utilized to form the upper and chosen for use based on one or more intended uses of the shoe. The upper may also include portions comprising varying materials specific to a particular area of the upper. For example, added stability may be desirable at a front of the upper or adjacent a heel region so as to provide a higher degree of resistance or rigidity. In contrast, other portions of a shoe may include a soft woven textile to provide an area with stretch-resistance, flexibility, air-permeability, or moisture-wicking properties.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in many cases, articles of footwear having uppers with an increased comfort and better fit are desired, along with soles having improved cushioning systems or structural characteristics such as a sole plate to add rigidity or spring-like properties.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An article of footwear, as described herein, may have various configurations. The article of footwear may have an upper and a sole structure connected to the upper.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a sole structure for an article of footwear with an upper. The sole structure can include an outsole comprising an upper outsole and a lower outsole. The lower outsole can include a set of fingers extending outwardly from the upper outsole and curving downward and under the upper outsole. The lower outsole can be spaced from the upper outsole and can define a spacing. A cushioning member can be provided within the spacing. A set of ground engaging members can extend from a bottom surface of the lower outsole.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the outsole can have a front portion proximate a forefoot region of the article of footwear and a rear portion proximate a heel region of the article of footwear, wherein the set of fingers of the lower outsole are provided in at least one of the front portion or the rear portion. In some embodiments, the sole structure can further include a set of ribs protruding downward from a bottom surface of the upper outsole and extending from the front portion to the rear portion. In some embodiments, the cushioning member can be provided in at least one of the front portion or the rear portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, each finger of the set of fingers of the lower outsole can have a ground engaging member from the set of ground engaging members.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the front spacing can have a crescent profile with a curved length and a gap height. The gap height can vary along the curved length and can define a maximum gap height located beneath the location of a ball of a user's foot.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, a tooth can extend downward from a front of the upper outsole to support &#x201c;toe off.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides an article of footwear with a forefoot region, a midfoot region, and a heel region. The article of footwear can include an upper and an outsole coupled to the upper. The outsole can include an upper outsole and a lower outsole and can have a front portion proximate the forefoot region, a middle portion proximate the midfoot region, and a rear portion proximate the heel region. The upper outsole can extend across the forefoot, midfoot, and heel regions. The lower outsole can extend below but not entirely across the upper outsole in the front portion. The lower outsole can be spaced from the upper outsole and can define a spacing. A set of ground engaging members can extend from a bottom surface of the lower outsole.

The upper may comprise a knitted component, a woven textile, and/or a non-woven textile. The knitted component may be made by knitting of yarn, the woven textile by weaving of yarn, and the non-woven textile by manufacture of a unitary non-woven web. Knitted textiles include textiles formed by way of warp knitting, weft knitting, flat knitting, circular knitting, and/or other suitable knitting operations. The knit textile may have a plain knit structure, a mesh knit structure, and/or a rib knit structure, for example. Woven textiles include, but are not limited to, textiles formed by way of any of the numerous weave forms, such as plain weave, twill weave, satin weave, dobbin weave, jacquard weave, double weaves, and/or double cloth weaves, for example. Non-woven textiles include textiles made by air-laid and/or spun-laid methods, for example. The upper may comprise a variety of materials, such as a first yarn, a second yarn, and/or a third yarn, which may have varying properties or varying visual characteristics.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> depict an embodiment of an article of footwear <b>100</b> including an upper <b>102</b> a top portion <b>120</b>, and a sole structure <b>104</b>. The upper <b>102</b> is attached to the top portion <b>120</b> and together define an interior cavity into which a foot may be inserted. For reference, the article of footwear <b>100</b> defines a forefoot region <b>108</b>, a midfoot region <b>110</b>, and a heel region <b>112</b>. The forefoot region <b>108</b> generally corresponds with portions of the article of footwear <b>100</b> that encase portions of the foot that includes the toes, the ball of the foot, and joints connecting the metatarsals with the toes or phalanges. The midfoot region <b>110</b> is proximate and adjoining the forefoot region <b>108</b>, and generally corresponds with portions of the article of footwear <b>100</b> that encase the arch of the foot, along with the bridge of the foot. The heel region <b>112</b> is proximate and adjoining the midfoot region <b>110</b> and generally corresponds with portions of the article of footwear <b>100</b> that encase rear portions of the foot, including the heel or calcaneus bone, the ankle, and/or the Achilles tendon.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Many conventional footwear uppers are formed from multiple elements (e.g., textiles, polymer foam, polymer sheets, leather, and synthetic leather) that are joined through bonding or stitching at a seam. In some embodiments, the upper <b>102</b> of the article of footwear <b>100</b> is formed from a knitted structure or knitted components. In various embodiments, a knitted component may incorporate various types of yarn that may provide different properties to an upper. For example, one area of the upper <b>102</b> may be formed from a first type of yarn that imparts a first set of properties, and another area of the upper <b>102</b> may be formed from a second type of yarn that imparts a second set of properties. Using this configuration, properties of the upper <b>102</b> may vary throughout the upper <b>102</b> by selecting specific yarns for different areas of the upper <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The article of footwear <b>100</b> also includes a medial side <b>116</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and a lateral side <b>118</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).

In some embodiments, for example, the percentage decrease in the front spacing volume <b>128</b> from the rested state to the neutral state can be in a range of about 1 percent to about 20 percent, more preferably the percentage decrease in the front spacing volume <b>128</b> can be in a range of about 5 percent to about 10 percent. Additionally, the rear spacing volume <b>174</b> will be decreased in the neutral state.

Further, the middle portion <b>134</b> of the outsole <b>130</b> contacts the top portion <b>120</b> in the midfoot region <b>110</b> and provides additional support of the arch of the user when in the neutral state.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">During use, in an active state (not shown), when the outsole <b>130</b> is in contact with the ground and a user exerts a downward force in the forefoot region <b>108</b>, the downward force will urge the top portion <b>120</b> toward the outsole <b>130</b> and further decrease the front spacing volume <b>128</b> while lengthening the first longitudinal length <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the percentage decrease in the first spacing volume <b>128</b> from the rested state to the active state can be a range of about 10 percent to about 100 percent, more preferably, the percentage decrease in the front spacing volume <b>128</b> can be in a range of about 50 percent to about 90 percent. Additionally, in the active state, if a user applies a force to the heel portion <b>112</b>, the rear spacing volume <b>174</b> can experience a percentage decrease in volume. In some embodiments, for example, the decrease in volume from the rested state to the active state can be in a range of about 90 percent to about 100 percent. Further, the middle portion <b>134</b> of the outsole <b>130</b> can act as a fulcrum when in the active state. For example, a user can strike the heel portion <b>112</b> on the ground while walking or running and rotate the foot forward about the middle portion <b>134</b> in the midfoot region <b>110</b>, and continue rotating the foot forward, striking the forefoot region <b>108</b> on the ground.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The outsole <b>130</b> along with the front spacing <b>140</b> and the rear spacing <b>142</b> can therefore provide force absorption as a user exerts downward force onto the forefoot region <b>108</b> and the heel region <b>112</b>, respectively, of the article of footwear <b>100</b> and can also provide a spring effect as the downward force from the user is relieved.

Further, the outsole <b>130</b> may be a ground-engaging portion or include a ground-engaging surface of the sole structure <b>104</b> and may be opposite of the upper <b>102</b>. For example, the outsole <b>130</b> can include any combination of ground engaging members (e.g., spikes <b>144</b>, teeth <b>146</b>, and barbs <b>148</b>) that extend from the bottom surface <b>138</b> of the outsole <b>130</b> and which can be positioned throughout the front portion <b>132</b> and the rear portion <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As shown, the article of footwear <b>100</b> includes spikes <b>144</b> and teeth <b>146</b> in the front portion <b>132</b> and barbs <b>148</b> in the front and rear portions <b>132</b>, <b>136</b>. The number and placement of spikes can affect traction with respect to linear movement.

In some embodiments, the front spacing volume is approximately the same as the rear spacing volume.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In a neutral state (not shown), when a user's foot is received within the upper <b>902</b> and the user is standing (i.e., no downward force is being applied to the article of footwear <b>900</b> other than the weight of the user), the front spacing volume <b>928</b> decreases due to the upper outsole <b>930</b>A being urged toward the lower outsole <b>930</b>B under the force of the weight of the user. In some embodiments, for example, the percentage decrease in the front spacing volume <b>928</b> from the rested state to the neutral state can be in a range of about 1 percent to about 20 percent, more preferably the percentage decrease in the front spacing volume <b>928</b> can be in a range of about 5 percent to about 10 percent. Additionally, the rear spacing volume <b>974</b> will be decreased in the neutral state. In some embodiments, for example, the percentage decrease of the rear spacing volume <b>974</b> from the rested state to the neutral state can be in a range of about 1 percent to about 50 percent, more preferably the percentage decrease in the rear spacing volume <b>974</b> can be in a range of about 10 percent to about 30 percent. Further, the middle portion <b>964</b> of the lower outsole <b>930</b>B contacts the upper outsole <b>930</b>A in the midfoot region <b>910</b> and provides additional support of the arch of the user when in the neutral state.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">During use, in an active state, when the lower outsole <b>930</b>B is in contact with the ground and a user exerts a downward force in the forefoot region <b>908</b>, the downward force will urge the upper outsole <b>930</b>A toward the lower outsole <b>930</b>B and further decrease the front spacing volume <b>928</b> while lengthening the first longitudinal length <b>922</b> and the latitudinal width <b>982</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the percentage decrease in the front spacing volume <b>928</b> from the rested state to the active state can be in a range of about 10 percent to about 100 percent, more preferably, the percentage decrease in the front spacing volume <b>928</b> can be in a range of about 50 percent to about 90 percent. Additionally, in the active state, if a user applies a force to the heel portion <b>912</b>, the rear spacing volume <b>974</b> will experience a percentage decrease from the rested state. For example, the percentage decrease can be in a range of about 90 percent to about 100 percent. Further, the middle portion <b>964</b> of the lower outsole <b>930</b>B can act as a fulcrum when in the active state. For example, a user can strike the heel portion <b>912</b> on the ground while walking or running and rotate the foot forward about the middle portion <b>964</b> in the midfoot region <b>910</b>, and continue rotating the foot forward, striking the forefoot region <b>908</b> on the ground.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The configuration of the outsole <b>930</b>, with the front spacing <b>940</b> and rear spacing <b>942</b> provided between the upper outsole <b>930</b>A and the lower outsole <b>930</b>B, can provide force absorption as a user exerts downward force onto the forefoot region <b>908</b> and the heel region <b>912</b>, respectively, of the article of footwear <b>900</b> and can also provide a spring effect as the downward force from the user is relieved. This can reduce the severity of the impact to a user's foot and leg joints during use.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">As stated above, some combination of ground engaging members (e.g., spikes <b>944</b>, teeth <b>946</b>, and barbs <b>948</b>) can be provided on the outsole <b>930</b>.
