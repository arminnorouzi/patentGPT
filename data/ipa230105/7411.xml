In other instances, well known components or methods have not been described in detail but rather in a block diagram in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present design. Further, specific numeric references such as first hearing aid can be made. However, the specific numeric reference should not be interpreted as a literal sequential order but rather interpreted that the first hearing aid is different than a second hearing aid.

The wireless charger <b>190</b> is designed to provide an easy user experience when storing the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> when not in use and be repeatedly manufacturable without a lot of defects due to tolerances.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The wireless charger <b>190</b> is shown with a pair of storage areas with the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b>. Again, an example housing/case of the wireless charger <b>190</b> is used to store a pair of hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> when the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> are not in use. The use of the magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> allows the wireless charger <b>190</b> to be a secure carrying case for the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>. The use of the magnet holds the hearing assistance device in place in the portable carrying case/wireless charger <b>190</b> when the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is put into its storage and charging location in the wireless charger's <b>190</b> housing. Even when the cap of the housing is accidentally knocked off the wireless charger <b>190</b>, then the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> will not fall out because the magnet will supply a magnetic retention force to hold the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in the carrying case.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown, the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is configured to have dimensions that allow the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to fit and be implemented as an in-the-ear-canal hearing aid and/or an ear bud.

The multiple views of the wireless charger <b>190</b> and its housing with the storage area for the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> as well as the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> differ from the top of the wireless charger removed on the left view to the top-down view of the example storage area in the wireless charger <b>190</b> shown on the right view.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The housing of the wireless charger <b>190</b> functions as a portable carrier case for the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b>.

The contours of the storage areas each conform to a shape of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The shape and slope of the grooves of the molding of the plastic wireless charger <b>190</b> are shaped gradually to allow an easy lead in for an insertion of a hearing assistance device.

The shape and slope of the grooves/contours of the wireless charger <b>190</b> make it easy to physically remove the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> from the storage area. A human can pull the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> out of the wireless charger <b>190</b> by overcoming a magnetic retention force. Yet, the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> can have enough force from the magnetic retention force to not shake out of place in the wireless charger <b>190</b> when a user is transporting the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> positioned properly/locked in place within the wireless charger <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example magnet in the wireless charger and a ferromagnetic target plate in a hearing assistance device that are used to create a magnetic retention force to hold each hearing assistance device in place when charging in order to control an amount of interference with a wireless charging between the wireless charger and the hearing assistance device(s).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown, the magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the ferromagnetic target plate in each hearing assistance device create a magnetic retention force that holds the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in place when charging.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The magnetic field of the magnet is offset relative to the target plate or the receive charge coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> so that the primary force of the magnetic field is pulling down on the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to put the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> into a known specific location and an offset enough to slightly pull the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> backwards and downwards to make a direct contact between the wall of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in the wall of the wireless charger <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown, on a lower left is a wireless charger <b>190</b> with two hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> stored inside. Up to the right, a magnification of one of the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> located inside of the hearing of the wireless charger <b>190</b> is shown. The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> rests in its storage location inside the wireless charger <b>190</b> where the contours of the shaped area of the housing guide and help retain the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in an optimum wireless charging alignment. The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can have its receive charging coil, its target plate, and its ferrite shield in an optimum wireless charging alignment with the wireless charger <b>190</b>. There is a gap between the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> and the transmit charging coil of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. As shown, the transmit charging coil and its printed circuit board connects to the foam inside the housing.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As discussed, the wireless charger <b>190</b> uses a magnetic retention force; and accordingly, the magnetic in the wireless charger <b>190</b> is positioned relative to a transmit charging coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a receive coil in a hearing assistance device <b>100</b> such that the magnetic field supplied from the magnet to cause the desired magnetic retention force to retain the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is not going to interfere significantly with the magnetic fields intended to cause the wireless charging between transmit charging coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a receive coil in a hearing assistance device <b>100</b> during the charging of the batteries in the hearing assistance device and/or communication of data.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Again, the magnet is positioned relative to the transmit and receive charge coils. The magnet is positioned to 1) the side or 2) below the transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive charge coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>. The magnet is positioned so that its magnetic waves will have a minimal impact on the charging coils and charging magnetic fields causing the wireless charging of the batteries in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the magnet is polarized and has a magnetic strength set to cause a minimal impact on the magnetic fields caused by the charging coils in addition to its geographic positioning. The magnet's primary function is to pull in and hold the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in its charge location and alignment between the transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive coil in the hearing instrument.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The magnetic field of the magnet is offset relative to the target plate or charge coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> so that the primary force of the magnetic field is pulling down on the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to put the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> into a known specific location and an offset enough to slightly pull the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> backwards and downwards to make a direct contact between the wall of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in the wall of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. This is a slight offset of less than normally 1 mm. The magnet pulls it towards the seat and at a small angle relative to the gap. The magnet pulls hearing assistance device <b>100</b> towards the circular seat and adds aids to maintain a small angle relative to the gap for the receive coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is retained in accurate positioning for wireless charging by, for example, a fully saturated N<b>52</b> magnet. The N<b>52</b> magnet is an example of the highest grade of neodymium magnet currently available with a strength of the magnetic fields of up to <b>1</b>.<b>4</b> teslas. The magnet is polarized on its side facing towards the hearing device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> contains a ferromagnetic material (&#x201c;target plate&#x201d;) with an approximately evenly distributed mass about the hearing assistance device's <b>100</b> axis, such that regardless of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> rotation about its axis, it will be attracted to the magnet at the same location. Some examples of ferromagnetic substances are Iron, Cobalt, Nickel, etc. Note, a difference between the magnetic and the ferromagnetic target plate is the target plate tries to adhere itself to the magnet which is magnetized.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The target plate can be located such that the center of mass is located offset from the magnet centerline such that the magnet is applying a force on the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> along its axis to ensure it is located firmly against the plastic component on which hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> rest in the wireless charger <b>190</b> (&#x201c;cradle&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example wireless charger housing that contains a transmit charging coil and a magnet. The housing is shown as translucent around the transmit charging coil, magnet, compliant foam, and ferrite shield. Up to the right, the assembly of the transmit charging coil integrated into its flexible printed circuit board, compliant foam, and ferrite shield is shown.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Again, the isolation view of the assembly of printed circuit board integrated charging coils, the compliant foam, and the ferrite shield is shown in position mounted inside the housing of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The contours of the molding of the housing are shaped to cause the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to naturally fall within the contours of that housing and align with the transmit charge coil. Thus, the shape and slope of the storage location in the wireless charger <b>190</b> aids in repeatedly getting the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> into its proper location and alignment to allow an efficient charge of the batteries of the hearing assistance device. The shape of the storage location for the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is shaped and sloped closer to a V (as opposed to a perfect cylinder) so that the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> naturally centers itself in the location for the storage and be in the correct position for aligning the wireless charging. Again, the contours of the storage area lead to an area of the housing that has a flat circular portion, which has dimensions slightly larger than the corresponding circular back of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>, and the transmit charging coil is located at this flat circular portion.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the magnet within the housing has two peaks that act as magnetic concentrators. This allows for increased and more accurate retention of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> closer to the peaks compared to other magnet shapes, such as a half-pipe-style shape. The increased magnetic retention ensures the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> requires a solid removal force and will not fall out of the wireless charger <b>190</b> from minor impacts, such as an accidental bump.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate diagrams of an embodiment of an example distance of the gap between the transmit charge coil in the wireless charger and the receive charge coil in the hearing assistance device, which is controlled within the threshold amount by a few factors including integrating the transmit charging coil as part of a flexible printed circuit that is adhered to the compliant foam. Both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> show a zoomed-in view between 1) the printed circuit board, the compliant foam, the ferrite shield on the backside of the transmit charging coil, and the magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and 2) the ferrite shield on the backside of the receive coil and target plate in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>, as well as the gap that is between the receive coil and the transmit coil when the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is stored inside the housing of the wireless charger <b>190</b> and in place. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows the same zoomed-in relationship between the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> resting in the storage area of the wireless charger <b>190</b> but superimposed are the magnetic fields from the magnet inside the wireless charger <b>190</b> as well as the magnetic fields between the transmit charge coil and the receive coil in order to send power wirelessly to the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>. The magnetic fields generated by the magnet are offset in regard to the magnetic fields being generated by the wireless charging through the coils.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the ferromagnetic target plate in each hearing assistance device <b>100</b> are positioned relative to a charging coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a receive coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> such that a first magnetic field supplied from the magnet to cause the magnetic retention force of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to be controlled to not significantly interfere with a second set of magnetic fields causing the wireless charging between the charging coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive coil in a hearing assistance device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note, magnetic fields going in the same direction of each other will significantly interfere with each other (e.g., subtract from each other). Thus, the magnet is used to retain the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> oriented perpendicular to the wireless charging axis so that the magnetic field it generates is perpendicular to the wireless charging axis. This significantly reduces interference between the magnetic fields generated by both the magnet and the wireless charging coils allowing for more efficient charging.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The perpendicular orientation of the magnet's magnetic field allows for the ability to use a stronger magnet, such as the N<b>52</b>, which ends up producing less interference and less impact on the efficiency of the wireless charging. The reduced interference and impact to the wireless charging efficiency allows for the wireless charging coils to be packaged closer to the perpendicular magnet allowing for a smaller form factor for the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> while still maintaining the same existing features as an in-the-ear canal hearing assistance device. A smaller form factor allows for the inclusion of more people within the market by enabling people with smaller inner ear canals to use the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, the ferromagnetic target plate is located within the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> such that a center of mass is located offset from a magnet centerline. The offset between the center of mass of the ferromagnetic target plate and the centerline of the magnet is configured to create a force vector pulling the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> downward into the housing (e.g., cradle) and due to the contour shape of the storage area backwards towards the transmit charging coil, so that the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> abuts firmly [e.g., fully bottoms out] against the housing of the wireless charger <b>190</b> at a location of the charging coil every time. Again, the magnet's primary function is to pull the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> into its charge location and alignment between the transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive coil in the hearing instrument.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, a distance/size of the gap between the transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive charge coil in the hearing instrument is controlled within a threshold amount (kept to a minimum) by at least three factors. The distance of the gap is controlled to be 0.02 millimeters up to 1.5 mm. In an example embodiment, the gap is controlled to be 1.04 mm+or &#x2212;0.02 millimeters. The minimum gap would have the copper coils of each charging coil face to face with a thin hermetic seal between the two (e.g., the receiving coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> and the charging coils in the wireless charger <b>190</b>.)</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A first factor is controlling a thickness of a casing in a hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in an area covering the receive coils in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> as well as controlling a thickness of a housing in a wireless charger <b>190</b> in an area covering the transmit coils. The thickness can be controlled by a choice of a fluid flowing (e.g., not viscous/ low viscosity) plastic so that the plastic can flow easily into the mold for the hearing assistant device and the mold for the wireless charger <b>190</b> with very little resistance; and thus, be able to be made reliably thin. Example plastic may be a Polycarbonate (PC)-Polybutylene Terephthalate (PBT) plastic. The hearing instrument may use a nylon for the microphone cover.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second factor to keep the gap small is the use of foam and the fact that the form is made out of a compliant material. The distance/size of the gap between a transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a receive charge coil in the hearing instrument is controlled within a threshold amount by the use of foam that is made out of the compliant material. A directional force applied by the compressed compliant foam forces the transmit charge coil to be pressed flat and evenly against a wall of the housing for the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The form is made out of a compliant material so that when it's being assembled the foam can compress and push the transmit charge coil to be pressed directly against the wall of the plastic making the casing for the wireless charger <b>190</b>. This directional force applied by the compressed compliant foam forces the wireless transmitter coil to be pressed flat and evenly against the wall of the plastic molding for the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The upward bias of the foam combined with the offset between the center of mass of the target plates and the centerline of the magnet allows for the ability to maintain gap distances between coils with higher accuracy.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Note, also the use of the foam made out of a compliant material that is compressible also allows for manufacturing tolerances to be slightly relaxed because of the compressible nature of their form and can adapt its shape when other components have not been assembled perfectly in line and in their exact position during the manufacturing process. This allows greater tolerances during the manufacturing process. Note the foam made out of the compliant material could be replaced with a glue to hold the wireless transmit coil in place but could lose some of the benefits listed above as well as would no longer be easily disassembled. For example, foam allows the easy disassembly and assembly of the wireless charger <b>190</b>, which allows for more repairs.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The third factor in keeping the gap as well as a form factor of each device's overall dimensions small is integrating the wireless transmitter coil to the printed circuit board inside the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The distance of the gap between the transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive charge coil in the hearing instrument is also controlled within the threshold amount by integrating the transmit charging coils as part of a flexible printed circuit that is adhered to the compliant foam. Smaller dimensions are possible by integrating the transmit charging coils as part of a flexible printed circuit and this makes an overall area taken up between the wireless transmitter coil and the printed circuit board smaller and dimensions, than if the wireless transmitter charging coil is a separate and distinct component from the printed circuit board. Again, then, the wireless charging coils in the wireless charger <b>190</b> integrated as part of a flexible printed circuit is adhered to the compliant foam and inserted into the housing. The system can also use wire wound coils, but these would increase cost and require larger physical packages, but would cause slight wireless charging improvements.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The foam and wireless charging coils sit more upward and outward interfering with the cradle in two directions. When the foam and wireless charging coil are installed into the cradle, the foam is compressed in order to fit the foam and wireless charging coils into the cradle creating an upward bias. The upward bias of the foam forces the wireless charging coils against the portion of the housing/cradle that contacts the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> on the opposite side without the need for any adhesives between the transmit charging coils and the housing itself allowing for a closer distance between the transmit and receive charging coils.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Utilizing the upward bias of the foam instead of an adhesive to secure contact between the wireless charging coils and the housing/cradle reduces the impact caused by variations in components resulting from tolerances during manufacturing. This improves the efficiency and optimization for the manufacturing of the components and reduces the need to rework or tune the components in order to get them to fit together.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In wireless charging, as the gap distance increases, there are massive drops in efficiency. As such, the wireless charging coils of the wireless charger <b>190</b> are positioned as close as possible to the wall of the housing contact point of the cradle where the wireless charging coils of the hearing assistance device. By removing the need for an adhesive layer to join the wireless charging coil to the cradle, the gap distance between the wireless charging coils is reduced improving efficiency in wireless charging.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, as discussed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows both the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> and the wireless charger <b>190</b> have a shield made out of ferrite material. A transmit charging coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a receive charging coil in hearing assistance device <b>100</b> have the shield made out of ferritic material on i) a backside of the transmit charging coil as opposed to a front side that faces the receive charging coil and ii) a backside of the receive charging coil as opposed to a front side that faces the transmit charging coil.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example magnet in the wireless charger that is positioned relative to a transmit charge coil in the wireless charger and a receive charge coil in a hearing assistance device to control an amount of interference with a wireless charging occurring between the wireless charger and the hearing assistance device. As shown, a similar relationship of components exists as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, but without the housing of the wireless charger <b>190</b> or the casing of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>. The transmit charging coil is shown facing the received charging coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>. A ferrite shield is on both the receive side and the transmit side in order to concentrate the flux of the magnetic field and control where that magnetic field is going during the charging. The lines of the magnetic fields for the wireless charge signal are transmitted from the charging coil and go towards and into the receive coil. The lines of the magnetic fields for the wireless charge signal then loop back. Also, the target plate cooperates with the magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> to pull the target plate in response to the magnetic field from the magnet to pull the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> into position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> is positioned relative to a transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a receive charge coil in a hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to control an amount of interference with a wireless charging between the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the hearing assistance device. The magnet is positioned at least one of i) to a side of the transmit charging coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive charge coil in the hearing assistance device, ii) to below the transmit charging coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the receive coil in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b>, and iii) not in between the transmit charging coil and receive coils.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, the mass of the target plate has a square hole cutout in the middle of the target plate in order to be able to package the microphone within. This maximizes the amount of mass that may fit into the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> without hitting tolerance constraints.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, the wireless charging coils include wireless charging transmitting coils on the wireless charger <b>190</b> side which are larger copper coils (e.g., 5 mm diameter coil) and wireless charging receiving coils on the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> side which are smaller copper coils (e.g., 3 mm diameter coil). The wireless charging coils on the transmission side are larger in order to ensure the transfer of charge emitted hits the receiving coils completely.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the wireless charging coils (both transmit and receive) each have a ferritic material applied to the rear sides of them to reduce wasted energy from the wireless charging and to assist them with shielding from surrounding magnetic fields and ferromagnetic materials. The ferritic material from the transmitting side on the wireless charger <b>190</b> should not be saturated in order to retain some of the magnetic field generated by the wireless charging coils so that it may be passed through to the ferritic material on the receiving side in the hearing assistance device. When the ferritic material is saturated, power will no longer be able to transfer through and will merely generate heat. Both the hearing instrument and the wireless charger <b>190</b> use a ferrite shield in order to concentrate the flux and make a more efficient charging between the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> and a wireless charger <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example contours of the storage areas that conform to the shape of the hearing assistance device to enable an insertion and a retention of the hearing assistance device(s) correctly in the storage area(s) of the wireless charger as well as easy to physically remove the hearing assistance devices the storage area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows three views of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. One view shows a top portion containing the storage area of the wireless charger <b>190</b> (e.g., the cradle) where the hearing assistance devices will eventually be stored separated from the lower portion of the wireless charger <b>190</b> which has the additional components. A middle view shows a straight on view of a flat circular area of the wireless charger <b>190</b> in the storage area and the contours and the slight V slope into the storage area. A view on the right shows a wireless hearing assistance device <b>100</b> installed and stored in the storage area of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The contours of the storage areas each conform to the shape of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to enable an insertion and a retention of the hearing assistance devices correctly in the storage areas of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The contours of the storage areas allow easy physical removal of the hearing assistance devices from the storage area, via a human pulling the hearing assistance devices out of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The human needs to overcome a strength of the magnetic retention force between the ferromagnetic target plate in the hearing assistance devices and the magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The strength of the magnetic retention force between the ferromagnetic target plate in the hearing assistance devices and the magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> is set below well below an average amount of force a human can produce to pull out the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> but slightly above a force needed for the hearing assistance devices to shake out of place in the wireless charger <b>190</b> when a user is transporting the hearing assistance devices.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The view on the right shows the magnet in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the ferromagnetic target plate in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> cooperate with the contours of the storage areas that conform to the shape of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to magnetically pull the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> into its charge location and alignment between a transmit charge coil in the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a receive coil in the hearing instrument. The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is aligned properly.

Without the offset between the center of mass of the target plates and the centerline of the magnet, the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> would be held and retained by the magnet, but unable to locate the wireless charging as it would not be pulled into the appropriate position.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of an example front on view as well as a side diagram of an embodiment of an example hearing assistance device. The side view is good to illustrate the hearing assistance device does not have an external electrical contact to transfer data. Wax build up on an external contact on a hearing assistance device can interfere with data transmission through the electrical contact. The hearing assistance device can be made without the external electrical contact on the hearing assistance device. Thus, the wireless transfer of both power and data communications occurs between the wireless charger and the hearing assistance device.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In general, two ways exist to charge the batteries in the hearing assistance device. One is a direct contact with an electrical contact on an external surface of the hearing assistance device that then goes to the battery. The other way of charging is the use of a wireless receive coil in the hearing assistance device. Elimination of the electrical contact removes the degradation from earwax as well as galvanic corrosion occurring to other parts in both the hearing assistance device and the wireless charger.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A lack of an external contact also allows a hermetic ceiling of the wireless charger.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example number of electronic systems, including the hearing assistance devices, communicating with each other in a network environment in accordance with some embodiments.
