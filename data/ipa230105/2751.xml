The enzymes having TAL activity are currently classified in EC4.3.1.23 (previously classified as EC 4.3.1.5). TAL catalyzes the formation of p-coumaric acid from L-tyrosine.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Tyrosinemia (also referred to as &#x201c;hereditary tyrosinemia,&#x201d; and &#x201c;hypertyrosinemia&#x201d;) is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood levels of tyrosine, due to the deficiency of an enzyme required for the catabolism of tyrosine in the liver. If untreated, tyrosine and other metabolites accumulate in the tissues and organs of affected individuals, resulting in serious medical issues. Tyrosinemia is an inborn error of metabolism inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. There are three types of tyrosinemia, each caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme. Currently used treatment methods depend upon the type of tyrosinemia involved. A low protein diet is often used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Type I tyrosinemia (also referred to as &#x201c;FAH deficiency,&#x201d; &#x201c;fumaryl acetoacetase deficiency,&#x201d; &#x201c;fumaryl aceotacetate hydrolase deficiency,&#x201d; &#x201c;hereditary infantile tyrosinemia,&#x201d; and &#x201c;hepatorenal tyrosinemia&#x201d;) is caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, due to mutations in the fah gene. This is the most severe form of the disease, with symptoms usually appearing in the first few months of life, commonly including failure to thrive, diarrhea, bloody stools, vomiting, jaundice, enlarged liver, the tendency to easily bruise, lethargy, irritability, fever, and other symptoms, such as a distinctive cabbage-like odor of the skin and urine. Some affected infants have repeated neurologic episodes of acute polyneuropathy, characterized by severe leg pain, as well as altered mental status, abdominal pain, and respiratory failure. Infants with the acute form are typically affected at birth and there is a rapid onset of symptoms that can lead to developmental delays, enlarged spleen, ascites, kidney disease, and blood clotting abnormalities. Untreated, it can lead to hepatic and renal failure, nervous system problems, and an increased risk of liver cancer (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma). In some cases, hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are present. If untreated, this disease can be fatal. In the less-common chronic form, the symptoms exhibit a more gradual onset and tend to be less severe. Affected infants initially exhibit vomiting, diarrhea, enlarged liver and spleen, and failure to thrive. Eventually, progressive liver cirrhosis occurs, leading to chronic liver failure, developmental delays, and renal Fanconi syndrome (a rare kidney disorder characterized by weakening and softening of the bones [rickets], vomiting, dehydration, weakness, and fever). In some cases, the most effective treatment has been full or partial liver transplant. Worldwide, this form affects approximately 1 in 100,000 human births (Genetics Home Reference, U.S. National Library of Medicine).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Type II tyrosinemia (also referred to as &#x201c;keratosis palmoplantaris-corneal dystrophy,&#x201d; oculocutaneous tyrosinemia,&#x201d; &#x201c;Richner-Hanhart syndrome,&#x201d; &#x201c;tyrosinemia due to TAT deficiency,&#x201d; and &#x201c;tyrosinema due to tyrosine aminotransferase deficiency,&#x201d;) is caused by a deficiency of tyrosine aminotransferase, due to mutations in the tat gene. It affects the eyes, skin, and mental development. As with Type I tyrosinemia, symptoms usually begin in early life, and include excessive tearing, photophobia, eye pain and redness, and painful skin lesions on the palms and soles. About half of affected individuals have some level of intellectual disability. This form occurs in less than 1 in 250,000 persons (Genetics Home Reference, supra).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Type III tyrosinemia (also referred to as &#x201c;tyrosinemia due to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase deficiency,&#x201d; &#x201c;tyrosinemia due to 4-hydroxyphenylpyuriv acid oxidase deficiency,&#x201d; and &#x201c;tyrosinemia due to HPD deficiency&#x201d;) is a rare disorder, caused by a deficiency of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, due to mutations in the hpd gene. Symptoms of this form include intellectual disability, seizures, and intermittent ataxia. This form is very rare, only a few cases have been reported (Genetics Home Reference, supra).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are additional cases in which there are temporary elevated tyrosine levels, due to non-genetic factors such as vitamin C deficiency or premature birth, which results in immature liver enzymes. Differential diagnoses are used to differentiate these transient cases from tyrosinema I, II, or III.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to tyrosinemia, there are other diseases associated with insufficient or absent tyrosine metabolism. For example, alkaptonuria also referred to as alcaptonuria, is a disease caused by deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in tyrosine degradation. This enzyme is encoded by the HGD gene. Insufficient activity of this enzyme results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid. Excess homogentisic acid and related compounds are deposited in connective tissues, causing the cartilage and skin to darken. Over time, arthritis may result due to the accumulation of homogentisic acid and related metabolites in the joints of affected individuals. Homogentisic acid is also excreted in urine, making the urine turn black. Alkaptonuria is a rare disease that affects 1 in 250,000 to 1,000,000 people worldwide (See, Genetics Home Reference, supra).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Treatment of these diseases has largely been the life-long use of a phenylalanine-, and tyrosine-restricted diet. Treatment with nitisinone (NTBC; 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzol)-1,3-cyclohexane dione; Orfadin&#xae;) has been reported to be helpful for type I tyrosinemia and alkaptonuria, due to its inhibition of the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate oxidase pathway. However, NTBC must be used in combination with a challenging and costly phenylalanine-, and tyrosine-restricted diet to prevent both liver failure and carcinogenesis. There remains a need in the art for easy to administer, effective treatment(s) to ameliorate the symptoms of these diseases and allow patients to utilize normal diets.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides engineered tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) polypeptides and compositions thereof.

In some embodiments, the deimmunization is complete, in that the variant protein does not stimulate an immune response in patients to whom the variant protein is administered. This response can be measured by various methods including but not limited to, the presence or abundance of anti-drug antibodies, the presence or abundance of neutralizing antibodies, the presence of an anaphylactic response, or the prevalence or intensity of cytokine release upon administration of the protein. In some embodiments, the variant protein is less immunogenic than the wild-type or reference protein. In some embodiments, deimmunization involves modifications to proteins (e.g., epitopes) that are recognized by T-cell receptors. In some embodiments, the T-cell epitopes are removed from a wild-type or reference protein in order to produce a deimmunized variant protein. In some embodiments, the deimmunized protein shows lower levels of response in biochemical and cell-biological predictors of human immunological responses including dendritic-cell T-cell activation assays, or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptide binding assays.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">&#x201c;Coding sequence&#x201d; refers to that part of a nucleic acid (e.g., a gene) that encodes an amino acid sequence of a protein.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The term &#x201c;percent (%) sequence identity&#x201d; is used herein to refer to comparisons among polynucleotides and polypeptides, and are determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Alternatively, the percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which either the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences or a nucleic acid base or amino acid residue is aligned with a gap to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Those of skill in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math., 2:482 [1981]), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol., 48:443 [1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 [1988]), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (e.g., GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Software Package), or by visual inspection, as known in the art. Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity include, but are not limited to the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described by Altschul et al. (See, Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215: 403-410 [1990]; and Altschul et al., 1977, Nucleic Acids Res., 3389-3402 [1977], respectively). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as, the neighborhood word score threshold (See, Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always&#x3e;0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always&#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (See, Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 [1989]). Exemplary determination of sequence alignment and % sequence identity can employ the BESTFIT or GAP programs in the GCG Wisconsin Software package (Accelrys, Madison Wis.), using default parameters provided.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">&#x201c;Reference sequence&#x201d; refers to a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, a segment of a full-length gene or polypeptide sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotide or amino acid residues in length, at least 25 residues in length, at least 50 residues in length, at least 100 residues in length or the full length of the nucleic acid or polypeptide. Since two polynucleotides or polypeptides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete sequence) that is similar between the two sequences, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides or polypeptide are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides or polypeptides over a &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d; to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. In some embodiments, a &#x201c;reference sequence&#x201d; can be based on a primary amino acid sequence, where the reference sequence is a sequence that can have one or more changes in the primary sequence.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">&#x201c;Comparison window&#x201d; refers to a conceptual segment of at least about 20 contiguous nucleotide positions or amino acids residues wherein a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides or amino acids and wherein the portion of the sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison window can be longer than 20 contiguous residues, and includes, optionally 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer windows.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x201c;Corresponding to&#x201d;, &#x201c;reference to&#x201d; or &#x201c;relative to&#x201d; when used in the context of the numbering of a given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence refers to the numbering of the residues of a specified reference sequence when the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence is compared to the reference sequence. In other words, the residue number or residue position of a given polymer is designated with respect to the reference sequence rather than by the actual numerical position of the residue within the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence. For example, a given amino acid sequence, such as that of an engineered TAL, can be aligned to a reference sequence by introducing gaps to optimize residue matches between the two sequences. In these cases, although the gaps are present, the numbering of the residue in the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence is made with respect to the reference sequence to which it has been aligned.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x201c;Amino acid difference&#x201d; or &#x201c;residue difference&#x201d; refers to a difference in the amino acid residue at a position of a polypeptide sequence relative to the amino acid residue at a corresponding position in a reference sequence. The positions of amino acid differences generally are referred to herein as &#x201c;Xn,&#x201d; where n refers to the corresponding position in the reference sequence upon which the residue difference is based. For example, a &#x201c;residue difference at position X93 as compared to SEQ ID NO: 2&#x201d; refers to a difference of the amino acid residue at the polypeptide position corresponding to position 93 of SEQ ID NO: 2. Thus, if the reference polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 has a leucine at position 93, then a &#x201c;residue difference at position X93 as compared to SEQ ID NO: 2&#x201d; has an amino acid substitution of any residue other than leucine at the position of the polypeptide corresponding to position 93 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In most instances herein, the specific amino acid residue difference at a position is indicated as &#x201c;XnY&#x201d; where &#x201c;Xn&#x201d; specified the corresponding position as described above, and &#x201c;Y&#x201d; is the single letter identifier of the amino acid found in the engineered polypeptide (i.e., the different residue than in the reference polypeptide). In some instances, the present disclosure also provides specific amino acid differences denoted by the conventional notation &#x201c;AnB&#x201d;, where A is the single letter identifier of the residue in the reference sequence, &#x201c;n&#x201d; is the number of the residue position in the reference sequence, and B is the single letter identifier of the residue substitution in the sequence of the engineered polypeptide. In some instances, a polypeptide of the present disclosure can include one or more amino acid residue differences relative to a reference sequence, which is indicated by a list of the specified positions where residue differences are present relative to the reference sequence. In some embodiments, where more than one amino acid can be used in a specific residue position of a polypeptide, the various amino acid residues that can be used are separated by a &#x201c;/&#x201d; (e.g., X307H/X307P or X307H/P). The present application includes engineered polypeptide sequences comprising one or more amino acid differences that include either/or both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">&#x201c;Conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; refers to a substitution of a residue with a different residue having a similar side chain, and thus typically involves substitution of the amino acid in the polypeptide with amino acids within the same or similar defined class of amino acids. By way of example and not limitation, an amino acid with an aliphatic side chain may be substituted with another aliphatic amino acid (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine); an amino acid with hydroxyl side chain is substituted with another amino acid with a hydroxyl side chain (e.g., serine and threonine); an amino acids having aromatic side chains is substituted with another amino acid having an aromatic side chain (e.g., phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine); an amino acid with a basic side chain is substituted with another amino acid with a basis side chain (e.g., lysine and arginine); an amino acid with an acidic side chain is substituted with another amino acid with an acidic side chain (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid); and/or a hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid is replaced with another hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid, respectively.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">&#x201c;Non-conservative substitution&#x201d; refers to substitution of an amino acid in the polypeptide with an amino acid with significantly differing side chain properties. Non-conservative substitutions may use amino acids between, rather than within, the defined groups and affects (a) the structure of the peptide backbone in the area of the substitution (e.g., proline for glycine) (b) the charge or hydrophobicity, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. By way of example and not limitation, an exemplary non-conservative substitution can be an acidic amino acid substituted with a basic or aliphatic amino acid; an aromatic amino acid substituted with a small amino acid; and a hydrophilic amino acid substituted with a hydrophobic amino acid.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">&#x201c;Deletion&#x201d; refers to modification to the polypeptide by removal of one or more amino acids from the reference polypeptide. Deletions can comprise removal of 1 or more amino acids, 2 or more amino acids, 5 or more amino acids, 10 or more amino acids, 15 or more amino acids, or 20 or more amino acids, up to 10% of the total number of amino acids, or up to 20% of the total number of amino acids making up the reference enzyme while retaining enzymatic activity and/or retaining the improved properties of an engineered transaminase enzyme. Deletions can be directed to the internal portions and/or terminal portions of the polypeptide. In various embodiments, the deletion can comprise a continuous segment or can be discontinuous.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">&#x201c;Insertion&#x201d; refers to modification to the polypeptide by addition of one or more amino acids from the reference polypeptide. Insertions can be in the internal portions of the polypeptide, or to the carboxy or amino terminus. Insertions as used herein include fusion proteins as is known in the art. The insertion can be a contiguous segment of amino acids or separated by one or more of the amino acids in the naturally occurring polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">A &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; or a &#x201c;biologically active fragment&#x201d; used interchangeably herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion(s) and/or internal deletions, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the sequence to which it is being compared (e.g., a full-length engineered TAL of the present invention) and that retains substantially all of the activity of the full-length polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">&#x201c;Isolated polypeptide&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide which is substantially separated from other contaminants that naturally accompany it (e.g., protein, lipids, and polynucleotides). The term embraces polypeptides which have been removed or purified from their naturally-occurring environment or expression system (e.g., host cell or in vitro synthesis). The recombinant TAL polypeptides may be present within a cell, present in the cellular medium, or prepared in various forms, such as lysates or isolated preparations. As such, in some embodiments, the recombinant TAL polypeptides can be an isolated polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">&#x201c;Substantially pure polypeptide&#x201d; refers to a composition in which the polypeptide species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar or weight basis it is more abundant than any other individual macromolecular species in the composition), and is generally a substantially purified composition when the object species comprises at least about 50 percent of the macromolecular species present by mole or % weight. Generally, a substantially pure TAL composition comprises about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, about 90% or more, about 95% or more, and about 98% or more of all macromolecular species by mole or % weight present in the composition. In some embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (i.e., contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species. Solvent species, small molecules (&#x3c;500 Daltons), and elemental ion species are not considered macromolecular species. In some embodiments, the isolated recombinant TAL polypeptides are substantially pure polypeptide compositions.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">&#x201c;Improved enzyme property&#x201d; refers to an engineered TAL polypeptide that exhibits an improvement in any enzyme property as compared to a reference TAL polypeptide and/or as a wild-type PAL polypeptide (e.g., the wild-type sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2) or another engineered TAL polypeptide. Improved properties include but are not limited to such properties as increased protein expression, increased thermoactivity, increased thermostability, increased pH activity, increased stability, increased enzymatic activity, increased substrate specificity or affinity, increased specific activity, increased resistance to substrate or end-product inhibition, increased chemical stability, improved chemoselectivity, improved solvent stability, increased tolerance to acidic pH, increased tolerance to proteolytic activity (i.e., reduced sensitivity to proteolysis), reduced aggregation, increased solubility, reduced immunogenicity, and altered temperature profile.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">&#x201c;Increased enzymatic activity&#x201d; or &#x201c;enhanced catalytic activity&#x201d; refers to an improved property of the engineered TAL polypeptides, which can be represented by an increase in specific activity (e.g., product produced/time/weight protein) or an increase in percent conversion of the substrate to the product (e.g., percent conversion of starting amount of substrate to product in a specified time period using a specified amount of TAL) as compared to the reference TAL enzyme. Exemplary methods to determine enzyme activity are provided in the Examples. Any property relating to enzyme activity may be affected, including the classical enzyme properties of K<sub>m</sub>, V<sub>max </sub>or k<sub>cat</sub>, changes of which can lead to increased enzymatic activity. Improvements in enzyme activity can be from about 1.1 fold the enzymatic activity of the corresponding wild-type enzyme, to as much as 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 25-fold, 50-fold, 75-fold, 100-fold, 150-fold, 200-fold or more enzymatic activity than the naturally occurring TAL or another engineered TAL from which the TAL polypeptides were derived.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the engineered TAL polypeptides have a k<sub>cat </sub>of at least 0.1/sec, at least 0.2/sec, at least 0.3/sec, at least 0.5/sec, at least 1.0/sec and in some preferred embodiments greater than 1.0/sec.

In some specific embodiments, the engineered TAL enzyme exhibits improved enzymatic activity in the range of 1.5 to 10 fold, 1.5 to 25 fold, 1.5 to 50 fold, 1.5 to 100 fold or greater than that of a reference TAL enzyme (e.g., a wild-type TAL or any other reference TAL). TAL activity can be measured by any suitable method known in the art (e.g., standard assays, such as monitoring changes in spectrophotometric properties of reactants or products). In some embodiments, the amount of products produced can be measured by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separation combined with UV absorbance or fluorescent detection directly or following o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatization. In some embodiments, other methods are used, such as tracking the coumarate product (e.g., use UV absorbance to track its production at 290 nm or 310 nm). In some other embodiments, the production of ammonia is assayed using commercially available kits (e.g., the Megazyme rapid ammonia assay kit [Megazyme International, Wicklow, Ireland]). Comparisons of enzyme activities are made using a defined preparation of enzyme, a defined assay under a set condition, and one or more defined substrates, as further described in detail herein. Generally, when lysates are compared, the numbers of cells and the amount of protein assayed are determined as well as use of identical expression systems and identical host cells to minimize variations in amount of enzyme produced by the host cells and present in the lysates.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The terms &#x201c;thermally stable&#x201d; and &#x201c;thermostable&#x201d; refer to enzymes of the present invention that retain a specified amount of enzymatic activity, primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure after exposure to identified temperatures over a given period of time under conditions prevailing during the use of the enzyme, for example, when exposed to altered temperatures. &#x201c;Altered temperatures&#x201d; include increased or decreased temperatures.

Thus, the &#x201c;enzymatic activity&#x201d; or &#x201c;activity&#x201d; of a TAL polypeptide can be expressed as &#x201c;percent conversion&#x201d; of the substrate to the product in a specific period of time.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">&#x201c;Hybridization stringency&#x201d; relates to hybridization conditions, such as washing conditions, in the hybridization of nucleic acids. Generally, hybridization reactions are performed under conditions of lower stringency, followed by washes of varying but higher stringency. The term &#x201c;moderately stringent hybridization&#x201d; refers to conditions that permit target-DNA to bind a complementary nucleic acid that has about 60% identity, preferably about 75% identity, about 85% identity to the target DNA, with greater than about 90% identity to target-polynucleotide. Exemplary moderately stringent conditions are conditions equivalent to hybridization in 50% formamide, 5&#xd7; Denhart's solution, 5&#xd7;SSPE, 0.2% SDS at 42&#xb0; C., followed by washing in 0.2&#xd7;SSPE, 0.2% SDS, at 42&#xb0; C. &#x201c;High stringency hybridization&#x201d; refers generally to conditions that are about 10&#xb0; C. or less from the thermal melting temperature T<sub>m </sub>as determined under the solution condition for a defined polynucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, a high stringency condition refers to conditions that permit hybridization of only those nucleic acid sequences that form stable hybrids in 0.018M NaCl at 65&#xb0; C. (i.e., if a hybrid is not stable in 0.018M NaCl at 65&#xb0; C., it will not be stable under high stringency conditions, as contemplated herein). High stringency conditions can be provided, for example, by hybridization in conditions equivalent to 50% formamide, 5&#xd7; Denhart's solution, 5&#xd7;SSPE, 0.2% SDS at 42&#xb0; C., followed by washing in 0.1&#xd7;SSPE, and 0.1% SDS at 65&#xb0; C. Another high stringency condition is hybridizing in conditions equivalent to hybridizing in 5&#xd7;SSC containing 0.1% (w:v) SDS at 65&#xb0; C. and washing in 0.1&#xd7;SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65&#xb0; C.

Although the genetic code is degenerate in that most amino acids are represented by several codons, called &#x201c;synonyms&#x201d; or &#x201c;synonymous&#x201d; codons, it is well known that codon usage by particular organisms is nonrandom and biased towards particular codon triplets. This codon usage bias may be higher in reference to a given gene, genes of common function or ancestral origin, highly expressed proteins versus low copy number proteins, and the aggregate protein coding regions of an organism's genome. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides encoding the TAL enzymes may be codon optimized for optimal production from the host organism selected for expression.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">&#x201c;Control sequence&#x201d; refers herein to include all components, which are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a polynucleotide and/or polypeptide of the present application.
