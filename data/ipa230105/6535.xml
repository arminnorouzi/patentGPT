Transistor <b>150</b> is shown using a small signal model for a FET, which includes an ideal FET <b>152</b> connected in parallel with a current source <b>154</b> and a resistance <b>156</b>. Current source <b>154</b> provides a current having a magnitude equal to g<sub>m</sub>*V<sub>GS</sub>, where g<sub>m </sub>is the transconductance of transistor <b>150</b> and V<sub>GS </sub>is the gate-to-source voltage of transistor <b>150</b>.

Decreasing the V<sub>GS </sub>of transistor <b>150</b> reduces the current through resistors R<b>1</b>A and R<b>1</b>B, thereby decreasing the voltage at V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">There are four circuit paths that provide significant contributions to the PSRR in a voltage regulator. Path <b>1</b> <b>110</b> is from the voltage regulator input V<sub>DD </sub>through the error amplifier <b>112</b>. Path <b>2</b> <b>120</b> is from the voltage regulator input V<sub>DD </sub>through buffer amplifier <b>122</b>. Path <b>3</b> <b>130</b> is from the voltage regulator input V<sub>DD </sub>through the FET transconductance <b>154</b>, which produces a current <b>154</b> of g<sub>m</sub>*V<sub>GS</sub>.

A change in Vis of the FET changes the amount of current flowing through transistor <b>150</b>, which is modeled by path <b>3</b> <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">PSRR error contributions from path <b>1</b> <b>110</b> and path <b>2</b> <b>120</b> are typically minimized by the design of the voltage regulator circuit, so path <b>3</b> <b>130</b> and path <b>4</b> <b>140</b> are the primary PSRR error contributors. The PSRR error contribution of path <b>1</b> <b>110</b> can be minimized by designing the error amplifier <b>112</b> in differential mode to minimize the AC signal from the voltage regulator input V<sub>DD </sub>being injected through the power supply path of error amplifier <b>112</b>. The PSRR error contribution from path <b>2</b> <b>120</b> can be minimized by keeping the impedance between the voltage regulator input V<sub>DD </sub>of buffer amplifier <b>122</b> and the gate of transistor <b>150</b> small in comparison to the impedance between the gate of transistor <b>150</b> and ground.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In path <b>3</b> <b>130</b>, a current equal to g<sub>m</sub>*V<sub>GS </sub>is generated. Any voltage difference between the gate and source of transistor <b>150</b>, V<sub>GS</sub>, will produce a current signal flowing through transistor <b>150</b> to V<sub>OUT</sub>. If there is any AC signal at the source of transistor <b>150</b>, that signal is input supply noise. If the output of buffer amplifier <b>122</b> and the gate of transistor <b>150</b> are at ground, then V<sub>GS </sub>will be equal to V<sub>DD</sub>. Any change in the frequency or amplitude of V<sub>DD </sub>will be transferred directly to V<sub>GS </sub>and produce a current <b>154</b> of g<sub>m</sub>*V<sub>GS </sub>through transistor <b>150</b>. In a voltage regulator, g<sub>m </sub>is typically relatively large because the FET is relatively large in size. If g<sub>m </sub>is relatively large, it will inject a relatively large current that is multiplied by the load impedance, R<sub>Load </sub>in parallel with C<sub>Load</sub>. Any noise in this current signal generates a noise signal at V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The PSRR error contribution from path <b>3</b> may be reduced by keeping the voltage at the gate of transistor <b>150</b> the same as the voltage at the source of transistor <b>150</b> so that V<sub>GS </sub>remains zero. This can be accomplished by AC-coupling the gate of transistor <b>150</b> to V<sub>DD</sub>. The gate can be AC-coupled to the source of transistor <b>150</b> by keeping the impedance between the V<sub>DD </sub>input to buffer amplifier <b>122</b> and the gate of transistor <b>150</b> small in comparison to the impedance between the gate of transistor <b>150</b> and ground. This makes the small signal AC component of V<sub>GS </sub>equal to zero, so that virtually no current is injected due to an AC component of V<sub>DD</sub>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The PSRR error contribution from path <b>4</b> <b>140</b> comes from V<sub>DD </sub>through the FET impedance <b>156</b> of transistor <b>150</b>. Any variation in the voltage at the source of transistor <b>150</b> shows up on V<sub>OUT</sub>. In the AC domain, V<sub>OUT </sub>should be at ground so that there is a voltage difference between the source and the drain of transistor <b>150</b>. That voltage difference causes the FET to inject a current through the FET impedance 1/g<sub>ds </sub><b>156</b> into the V<sub>OUT </sub>signal, so the signal at V<sub>OUT </sub>will not be at zero in the AC domain. A voltage divider is formed with 1/g<sub>ds </sub><b>156</b> as the top impedance, and the bottom impedance as the series combination of R<b>1</b>A and R<b>1</b>B in parallel with R<sub>Load </sub>and C<sub>Load</sub>. Having a high value for 1/g<sub>ds </sub><b>156</b> improves the PSRR of the circuit because most of the signal at the source of the transistor <b>150</b> will be dropped across 1/g<sub>ds</sub>, and V<sub>OUT </sub>will remain referenced to ground.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A portion of the noise may be compensated for in error amplifier <b>112</b> as long as the noise on V<sub>DD </sub>is not also on the V<sub>REF </sub>signal. In at least some cases, a filter capacitor is added between the V<sub>REF </sub>terminal and ground. Error amplifier <b>112</b> compares V<sub>FB </sub>to V<sub>REF </sub>and produces an error correction signal at its output to cause V<sub>OUT </sub>to follow V<sub>REF</sub>. A feedback control loop corrects any errors between V<sub>OUT </sub>and V<sub>REF </sub>up to the AC gain capabilities of the feedback control loop. However, the feedback control loop is not typically designed to have high bandwidth due to circuit stability concerns, and the feedback control loop is often not able to keep up with a 1-20 MHz signal. At high frequencies, the gain of the feedback control loop may begin dropping and reach 0 dB at unity gain bandwidth. So, any high frequency noise injected through path <b>3</b> <b>130</b> or path <b>4</b> <b>140</b> may not be corrected for by error amplifier <b>112</b> due to the AC gain limitations of the feedback control loop.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an example voltage regulator <b>200</b> with a feed-forward PSRR booster.

Increasing the V<sub>GS </sub>of transistor <b>150</b> increases the current through resistors R<b>1</b>A and R<b>1</b>B, thereby increasing the voltage at V<sub>OUT</sub>. If the voltage at V<sub>OUT </sub>is above the specified value, the V<sub>GS </sub>of transistor <b>150</b> will be decreased.

The value for C<sub>PSR </sub>is selected based on the current limit range. The variation in the FET impedance of transistor <b>150</b> with load current, and the impact that FET impedance variation has on the PSRR, is minimized by coupling a load-dependent resistance in series with the parallel combination of capacitors C<sub>PSR </sub>and C<sub>BANK</sub>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A conventional voltage regulator may have the problem of over-compensation when there is a large voltage difference between V<sub>DD </sub>and V<sub>OUT</sub>, which can make the PSRR worse. In voltage regulator <b>300</b>, the current from PSRR booster capacitors C<sub>PSR </sub>and C<sub>BANK </sub>is disabled when the voltage difference between V<sub>DD </sub>and V<sub>OUT </sub>crosses above a certain threshold voltage V<sub>TH</sub>. Comparator <b>144</b> determines when the voltage difference between V<sub>DD </sub>and V<sub>OUT </sub>crosses the threshold voltage V<sub>TH </sub>and provides a signal at its output to stop the current flow.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first input to comparator <b>144</b> is coupled to V<sub>OUT</sub>.

The output of comparator <b>144</b> will be high if the voltage difference between V<sub>DD </sub>and V<sub>OUT </sub>is less than V<sub>TH</sub>. The output of comparator <b>144</b> will be low if the voltage difference between V<sub>DD </sub>and V<sub>OUT </sub>is more than V<sub>TH</sub>. If the output of comparator <b>144</b> is low, transistor M<sub>PSR_COMP </sub>will be turned off, and no current will flow from C<sub>PSR </sub>and C<sub>BANK</sub>.

A load dependent MOS resistance from M<sub>SENSE1 </sub>modulates the current injection from the capacitor bank C<sub>BANK</sub>, tracking the current due to 1/g<sub>ds </sub><b>156</b> of transistor <b>150</b>. The capacitance of the capacitor bank C<sub>BANK </sub>is proportional to the voltage at V<sub>DD</sub>, and injects a current to compensate for the current due to impedance 1/g<sub>ds </sub><b>156</b> so that the AC current on V<sub>DD </sub>has a magnitude close to zero.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Adjustments to compensate for changes due to a variation in load current can be made using the capacitor bank C<sub>BANK </sub>and/or the adjustment of MOS switch <b>142</b> in series with the capacitor bank. The capacitance of capacitor bank C<sub>BANK </sub>that is chosen corresponds to the current limit, or can be controlled by a series of comparator that enable different FET switches within MOS switch <b>142</b> in response to the load current through transistor <b>150</b>. If the range of the current limit or the load current changes, the capacitance of the capacitor bank C<sub>BANK </sub>will also change. For example, a current of 0-500 mA may correspond to capacitance C<b>1</b>, a current of 500 mA to 1 A correspond to capacitance C<b>2</b>, and a current of 1 A to 3 A correspond to capacitance C<b>3</b>, where C<b>1</b>&#x3c;C<b>2</b>&#x3c;C<b>3</b>. Increasing the capacitance of capacitor bank C<sub>BANK </sub>increases the current through the capacitor bank. The impedance 1/g<sub>ds </sub><b>156</b> and the current through the capacitor bank track each other, with both increasing or decreasing linearly.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The MOS resistor M<sub>SENSE1 </sub>is used for fine tuning the injection current within each of the current limit or load current bands. The resistance of the MOS resistor M<sub>SENSE1 </sub>is inversely proportional to the load current, so the resistance of the MOS resistor M<sub>SENSE1 </sub>decreases as the load current increases. As the resistance of the MOS resistor M<sub>SENSE1 </sub>decreases, more current is injected in the circuit. So, the PSRR degradation caused by load current variation is improved by a boost current injection circuit modulating a capacitance using capacitor bank C<sub>BANK </sub>and fine tuning the current injection using MOS resistance M<sub>SENSE1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this description, &#x201c;terminal,&#x201d; &#x201c;node,&#x201d; &#x201c;interconnection,&#x201d; &#x201c;lead&#x201d; and &#x201c;pin&#x201d; are used interchangeably.
