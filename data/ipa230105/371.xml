num="0003">In recent years, blood pressure measurement devices used for measuring blood pressure are being used as means to check health status at home, as well as in medical facilities. A blood pressure measurement device detects vibration of the artery wall to measure blood pressure by, for example, inflating and contracting a cuff wrapped around the upper arm or the wrist of a living body and detecting the pressure of the cuff using a pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such a blood pressure measurement device, a so-called integrated type in which a cuff is integrated with a device body feeding a fluid to the cuff is known.
