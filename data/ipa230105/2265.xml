For example, it relates to processes for the treatment of a residual that allow for inactivation of at least one type of pathogen in the residual so as to obtain a treated residual. For example, the treated residual can be suitable for an agricultural purpose.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wastewater treatment plants in Canada produce about 860,000 dry tons per year of sewage residuals (TS); Montr&#xe9;al, Qu&#xe9;bec generates approx. 270 t TS/day. In Europe, the UK generates 1,640,000 t dry TS/year where 70% is used for land application while in Germany, 20% of its almost 2 billion tons per year of dry solids was applied to land in 2010 (Oleszkiewicz, 2012). Landfilling, incineration and land application are three main options for residuals disposal. As landfilling and incineration each have their own environmental disadvantages, regulators favor agricultural land application of residuals. For example, Section 5.6.8 of the Qu&#xe9;bec Residual Materials Management Policy 1998-2008 (Qu&#xe9;bec, 2000) states: &#x201c;The ultimate goal is to ensure that no sludge is landfilled until it has been demonstrated that recovery is not an economically viable option.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is estimated that land application of residuals contributes more than $55 M a year to the economy. However, residuals, for example, may contain pathogens from a fecal source which may threaten human health if the residuals are not used safely in accordance with good practice. Therefore, complex regulatory systems, e.g., the Bureau de normalisation du Qu&#xe9;bec (BNQ) standards, have been developed for reusing residuals with the intention of protecting human, animal and plant health, ground and surface water quality, enduring soil quality and soil biodiversity. These regulations encourage municipal wastewater treatment facilities to treat residuals to a higher quality level and minimize constraints on use; and require relatively expensive management practices, further assuring clean and safe beneficial uses for residuals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such treatment should be designed to improve the characteristics of the residuals for a disposal practice, increase the economic feasibility of using a particular practice and reduce the potential for public health, environmental and nuisance problems. Conventional technologies such as time&#x2014;temperature regimes, high pH&#x2014;high temperature processes, alkaline treatment by adding lime, beta ray irradiation, gamma ray irradiation and use of a mesophilic anaerobic digester are usually not effective enough, and are usually time-consuming and expensive. Further, other issues and trends including the push for lower greenhouse gas production, reducing dioxins/furans and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), decreasing time and energy requirements, availability of land and acceptability of present practices will affect the selection of a process for residuals treatment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electrokinetic treatment is based on the application of, for example, direct current (DC) within a contaminated matrix to remove, for example, pollutants through several electrokinetic phenomena. While it has been used in soil remediation for many years, electrokinetic treatment of residuals is a novel application of such technology in environmental practice.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect, there is provided a process for treating a residual, said process comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">treating a mixture comprising the residual, a peracid or source thereof and an ammonium salt in a reactor, with an electric field, by means of at least one anode and at least one cathode that define therebetween an electrokinetic zone for treating the mixture,</li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">thereby allowing for inactivation of at least one type of pathogen in the residual so as to obtain a treated residual.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">According to another aspect, there is provided a process for treating a residual, said process comprising:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">treating a mixture comprising the residual, a peracid or source thereof and an ammonium salt in a reactor, with an electric field, by means of at least one anode and at least one cathode that define therebetween an electrokinetic zone for treating the mixture,</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">thereby allowing for destruction of at least one type of pathogen in the residual so as to obtain a treated residual.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">According to another aspect, there is provided a process for treating a residual, said process comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0014">treating a mixture comprising the residual, a peracid or a source thereof and an ammonium salt, in a reactor, with an electric field, by means of at least one anode and at least one cathode that define therebetween an electrokinetic zone for treating the mixture,</li>    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0015">thereby allowing for simultaneous inactivation and/or destruction of at least one type of pathogen in the residual and dewatering of the residual, so as to obtain a treated dewatered residual and separated water.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">It has been shown in the present disclosure that treating a mixture comprising a residual, a peracid or a source thereof and an ammonium salt, for example, ammonium nitrate with, for example, a low voltage gradient in a direct current electric field can simultaneously dewater and inactivate and/or destroy at least one type of pathogen from the residual, producing treated a dewatered residual and separated water. The processes of the present disclosure can, for example, raise the temperature of the mixture, change the chemical properties of the residual, change the physiological properties of <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>spores present in the residual, for example, cause the spores to germinate, destroying most pathogens and creating an environment that will not support future pathogen regrowth. The processes of the present disclosure, for example, enhance the ionic strength, cause an exothermic reaction and increase the biocidal stressors/constituents present in the system. The processes of the present disclosure can, for example, provide disinfection, or pasteurization, or sterilization of the residual.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">Unlike some prior art processes, the treated residual can, for example, be suitable for agricultural purposes because, for example, the ammonium salt may not create byproducts which can be harmful to human health in such a way that human exposure to them needs to be restricted. The processes of the present disclosure have been shown, for example, to be effective in destroying one of the most resistant forms of a microorganism, <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>spores, from anaerobically digested residuals within a fast time of less than two hours. It should be noted that under anaerobic conditions, <i>C. perfringens </i>spores are, for example, the most resistant microbe and a three log reduction indicates Class A disinfection with respect to viruses, bacteria and helminth eggs (Blanker et al., 1992). Compared to other methods for producing residuals of a high standard (for example, P1 or Class A biosolids) the processes of the present disclosure are expected to be inexpensive both in initial capital expenditure and ongoing operation and maintenance costs.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples while indicating embodiments of the present disclosure are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the scope of the present disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0019">The following drawings represent examples that are presented in a non-limitative manner:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic representation of a reactor for treating residuals in accordance with an example of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a front view of an electrode for use in a reactor for treating residuals in accordance with an example of the present disclosure, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a top view of the same electrode;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrograph showing the creation of nicks in <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>spore membranes (black arrow) after treatment by a process of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic representation of the treatment reactions according to a process of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic representation of the lethal pathways in a <i>C. perfringens </i>spore according to a process of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exemplary plot showing the log reduction of <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>spores over time in anaerobically digested residuals treated with a process of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0026">Unless otherwise indicated, the definitions and embodiments described in this and other sections are intended to be applicable to all embodiments and aspects of the application herein described for which they are suitable as would be understood by a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">As used in this application, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.

By controlling, for example, the electrochemical processes, which can generate temperature with time (up to about 70&#xb0; C., from about 70&#xb0; C. to about 95&#xb0; C. and above about 95&#xb0; C.) leading to a log reduction of pathogens of about 3, about 5 and about 9 respectively. It is expected to provide, for example, an inexpensive and reliable means of producing a readily usable and valuable high standard P1 (Class A) product and by EU regulations, an acceptable residual material. The most eminent characteristics of the processes of the present disclosure can be described as follows:</p><p id="p-0087" num="0091">First, the application of a low voltage gradient electric field (for example, less than about 8 V/cm) enhanced with a peracid or a source thereof, for example, Bioxy S (BS) and an ammonium salt (AN) provides the benefit of low energy consumption. Furthermore, the applied enhancement agents (EAs), for example, BS and AN do not create disinfection byproducts (DBPs) which would be harmful to human health in such a way that human exposure to them needs to be restricted. BS is a biocide and strong oxidant which is rapidly converted to carbonic acid and sodium carbonate. It is used for disinfection of equipment in the food industry. Ammonium components can be found in fertilizers and have very little effect on pH level in the soil. In the residual matrix, the ammonium salt, increases the electrical conductivity of the residual, increasing the efficiency of the treatment system. The ammonium salt can also liberate ammonia, which acts as a biocide.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0092">Second, it has been shown that the processes of the present disclosure have the ability, for example to eradicate one of the most resistant forms of microorganism, <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>spores, in anaerobically digested residuals (for example, biosolids) within two hours. Hence, the processes of the present disclosure can be effective on resistant microorganisms, and are a fast treatment technology to achieve safe residuals which can be widely used and handled without restriction. Conventional methods such as composting, thermal drying, digestion technologies and lime stabilization either are not effective on spores or need a minimum treatment time of at least 72 hours.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0093">Further, the processes of the present disclosure can, for example raise the temperature of the material to above about 97&#xb0; C., effectively killing most pathogens and creating an environment that will not support future pathogen regrowth.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0094">Simultaneous dewatering of the residual is another advantage of the processes of the present disclosure. The treated residual may not, for example require a further dewatering process. The separated water can, for example be reused directly in irrigation.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0095">Compared to other methods of producing Class A biosolids and residuals acceptable by EU regulations, the processes of the present disclosure are expected to be inexpensive in both initial capital expenditure and ongoing operation and maintenance costs. The equipment can be fully automated and requires very little operator time.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0096">The following non-limiting example is illustrative of the present application:</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0097">The BioElectro&#x2122; processes of the present disclosure are an innovative application of low voltage gradient in, for example, direct electric field technology to treat a residual. It is a technology that combines at least two functions in one: dewatering and pathogen destruction as per BNQ-P1 regulatory compliance (USEPA requirements for class A) as well as regulations in all European Union countries and quality improvement which permits more unrestricted, beneficial uses of residuals. It requires a low energy source in the form of, for example, direct current (DC), and offers a suitable technology for a low-tech solution to sludge management applicable to all regions around the world.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0098">The processes of the present disclosure can be based on the application of a low voltage gradient in, for example, a direct electric field with two enhancing agents (EAs): Bioxy S (BS) and an ammonium salt, for example, ammonium nitrate (AN). The concentration of BS and AN used increases the conductivity of the sewage sludge. Further, the disinfection role of BS and AN, at the applied concentrations, without application of the electrical field would be negligible. The process was conducted in laboratory size prototype BioElectro&#x2122; equipment consisting of a regulated power supply and a 3,100 mL rectangular BioElectro&#x2122; reactor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) with internal dimensions of 214 mm length&#xd7;214 mm width&#xd7;74.1 mm height. The reactor <b>10</b> comprises four electrodes <b>12</b> and a rectangular housing <b>14</b> that is effective for receiving the residual <b>16</b>. The electrodes <b>12</b> can comprise 2 cathodes and 2 anodes. The electrodes can be flat, circular, perforated or not and they can have various configurations. The electrodes can also be concentric. The power supply transforms alternating current (AC) from a utility line (120-V, 60 Hz) into high voltage AC, then rectifies to DC signals. The BioElectro&#x2122; reactor can be equipped with four perforated stainless steel (316L) electrodes (cylinders 10 mm in diameter, 102 mm long) coated with mesh (200 &#x3bc;m), for example, stainless steel mesh, located at a distance of 172 mm from each other in proximity of outlet (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>). Underneath each electrode, a 200 mL bottle was installed to collect electroosmotic flow (EOF) during the experiment.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0099">A considerable effort has been made to identify indicator microorganisms whose presence would suggest that human pathogens might be present in the residual. <i>C. perfringens </i>is a spore-forming thermophilic bacterium and its spore has been suggested as an indicator for inactivation mechanisms other than temperature as it is resistant to temperature. This organism is found in densities of about 10<sup>6 </sup>colony forming units (CFUs) per gram of solids in raw biosolids (Reimers (2002)).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0100">The process starts by adding BS and AN to the sewage sludge (the ratio of BS to AN can be about 0.5 to about 2 g/g or can be about 0.1 to about 2 g/g). The prepared suspension is then dispersed into BioElectro&#x2122; reactors with a working volume of 2,800 mL. Electrokinetic (EK) phenomena are generated by applying an electrical current between the electrodes such that at least one of the electrodes functions as an anode and at least one of the electrodes functions as a cathode. A flow of water is induced from the sludge towards the outlets due to the applied electric field. Accordingly, the sludge is dewatered. The dewatering process eliminates water, raises the concentration of solids and reduces sludge volume, thus reducing the costs of further treatment and handling. Simultaneously, the destruction of <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>spores is achieved after two hours treatment of the sewage sludge. The effective near sterilization conditions (&#x3e;8 log reduction of spores) are obtained at constant voltage gradients of less than about 5 V/cm in the presence of BS and AN.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0101">The studies of the present disclosure showed that voltage gradient, BS and AN are not sufficiently effective when used alone. In other words, spore inactivation and/or destruction could be obtained only through the interactive disinfection of voltage gradient and the enhancement agents BS and AN.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0102">Without wishing to be bound to such a theory, the mechanism of disinfection suggests that different factors which attack numerous spore constituents, including spore coats, proteins, unsaturated lipids, respiratory enzymes and peptidoglycans are involved in the inactivation and/or destruction of <i>C. perfringens </i>spores in the processes of the present disclosure. For example, reactions taking place due to the EK phenomena help to create effective oxidative zones, which neutralize protective systems inside and outside of <i>C. perfringens </i>spores. The generated oxygen-based free radicals diffuse to targets within the spore protoplast, possibly in the core membrane, and impair the spores. Without wishing to be bound to such a theory, the mechanism of spore inactivation and/or destruction under the influence of an electric field may include: (1) significant alteration in spore shape and surface properties such as hydrophobicity and net surface charge; and (2) change in the configuration of membrane components such as lipids. All of these impacts can potentially lead to irreversible permeabilization of the membrane, resulting in leakage of crucial cytoplasmic components. The breakdown of spore membranes and creation of nicks under the studied conditions was observed in treated spores (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0103">Along with the action of the electric field on the spores, electrochemical redox reactions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) which occur simultaneously on the electrode surfaces, facilitate the production of toxic hydrogen peroxide and chlorine or subsequent hypochlorous acid, both of which may infiltrate into the inner part of the spores and hasten the inactivation and/or destruction process. Induced electrochemical reactions also bring about large pH changes in the localized vicinity of the electrodes. Therefore, the pH of the sewage sludge increased significantly, to a level that ruptures disulfide bonds in the spore coats and leads to hydrolysis of cortex. Moreover, at the elevated pH (&#x3e;10.7), AN has a higher spore inactivation and/or destruction power. This is attributed to the generation of ammonia in the molecular form (NH<sub>3</sub>) rather than the ionized form (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0104">Without wishing to be bound to such a theory, the direct current also helps germination of spores and lowers their resistance to harsh conditions due to: (1) sub-lethal heat (above about 62&#xb0; C. for example at about 62 to about 95&#xb0; C.) generated during the treatment which begets alterations in the permeability of the spore coats and opening of a chemical bond between dipicolinic acid (DPA) and spore enzymes; and (2) an electrokinetically deployed reduction state at the cathodic side of the BioElectro&#x2122; reactor ruptures disulfide bonds in the spore coats and brings about hydrolysis of cortex. Moreover, ohmic heating produced during the process brings about degradation of the spore cortex, and makes the membrane dysfunctionally permeabilized, causing cell death. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the lethal pathways in the processes of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exemplary plot showing the log reduction of <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>spores over time in an anaerobically digested residual treated with a process of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0105">The person skilled in the art would understand that the various properties or features presented in a given embodiment can be added and/or used, when applicable, to any other embodiment covered by the general scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0106">The present disclosure has been described with regard to specific examples.
