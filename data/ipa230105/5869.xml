In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the one or more embodiments. It is evident, however, in various cases, that the one or more embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. Additionally, features depicted in the drawings with like shading, cross-hatching, and/or coloring can comprise shared compositions and/or materials.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Flip chip assemblies can be employed to connect one or more semiconductor devices (e.g., integrated circuit chips, integrated passive devices, microelectrochemical systems, and/or the like) with external circuitry (e.g., a package assembly). The one or more semiconductor devices can be positioned on one or more first chips, while the external circuitry can be positioned on one or more second chips. The first chip can further comprise one or more chip pads, which can be align with one or more chip pads on the second chip. An electrically conductive material can be deposited onto the chip pads. When the first chip is placed on the second chip, the electrically conductive material can contact the aligned chip pads of the first and second chips to establish an interconnect.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Typically, the electrically conductive material is deposited onto the chip pads as multi-layered pillars or stud bumps. However, formation of multi-layered pillars requires full wafer processing and numerous processing steps that may impair, damage, and/or inhibit one or more features of the flip chip assembly. Additionally, control over the dimensions and/or geometry of stud bumps can be substantially limited. For example, the top surface of the stud bumps includes a neck portion formed from disrupting the flow of deposited material, where the dimensions and/or geometry of the neck portion can vary with each implementation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Various embodiments described herein can regard the use of 3D printing technology to form one or more flip chip interconnects and/or tune one or more resonators of a semiconductor device. In one or more embodiments, 3D printed interconnects can be printed directly onto one or more chip pads. Further, the 3D printing technology employed to form the interconnects can enable the formation of precisely defined sizes and/or geometries. In one or more embodiments, one or more resonators of a semiconductor device can be tuned via the one or more 3D printing technologies. For example, material can be added to a surface of the one or more resonators to alter the operating frequency exhibited by the one or more resonators.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As described herein, the terms &#x201c;deposition process&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;deposition processes&#x201d; can refer to any process that grows, coats, deposits, and/or otherwise transfers one or more first materials onto one or more second materials.

In semiconductor lithography, the patterns can be formed by a light sensitive polymer called a photo-resist. To build the complex structures that make up a semiconductor device and the many wires that connect the various features of a circuit, lithography processes and/or etch pattern transfer steps can be repeated multiple times. Each pattern being printed on the wafer can be aligned to the previously formed patterns and slowly the subject features (e.g., conductors, insulators and/or selectively doped regions) can be built up to form the final device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a diagram of an example, non-limiting cross-sectional view of a chip structure <b>100</b> comprising one or more interconnects <b>102</b> that can be 3D printed and/or employed within one or more flip chip assemblies in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein.
