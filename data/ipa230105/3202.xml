Engines fueled by chemical reactions, such as turbine (jet) engines or other combustion engines, require a substantial positive temperature differential between inlet air and exhaust gas. As a jet engine accelerates, especially above Mach 1, the temperature of the inlet air rises rapidly while the temperature of the exhaust gas rises more slowly, so the temperature differential diminishes. Eventually the temperature differential is extinguished, and no positive work or thrust can be produced by the engine. This happens at Mach 4 or so for a conventional turbine. One approach to higher speed attempts to avoid the inlet air temperature rise by compressing and decelerating the flow less and running the combustion process at supersonic speed. This approach is embodied in the supersonic combustion ram jet (scram jet). Compression is required to generate work, so the scram jet delays the onset of zero thrust to higher speed (Mach 8-10 range).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric propulsion adds energy from an external source to establish thrust. The specific impulse of electric propulsion can be large in comparison with chemical propulsion where the specific impulse is limited by the energy available from chemical reactions. In practice, the specific impulse is limited by the particular implementation. Since thrust will decrease as the specific impulse increases for a given power, a tradeoff must be made for a particular mission between propellant usage and mission time. High specific impulse leads to low propellant usage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are three main types of electric thrusters: electrothermal, electromagnetic, and electrostatic. Electrothermal thrusters are similar to standard chemical rocket engines in that heat energy is added to a working fluid in a confined volume, raising its pressure, but differ in that the heat is produced by electrical means (often an electrical discharge). The gas is subsequently expanded through a converging-diverging nozzle to achieve thrust just as in chemical rockets. There are a variety of electromagnetic thruster configurations, but all depend on generating a thrust by accelerating particles in a particular direction relative to both the electric and magnetic fields in the plasma. For example, the pulsed plasma microthruster (PPT) utilizes a spark discharge across a block of TEFLON&#xae; to create plasma, which is accelerated outward by induced azimuthal current interacting with a radial magnetic field. In a Hall thruster, an axial electric field provided in a radial magnetic field creates an azimuthal Hall current, which accelerates plasma axially producing thrust. In the self-field magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thruster, the current flow creates its own magnetic field in which a force accelerates the plasma flow radially and axially. This can only occur if the current and hence the power are high, often necessitating pulsed operation at lower average powers. Electrostatic thrusters accelerate charged particles in an electric field, without an applied magnetic field. A linear accelerator, such as the one installed at the Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) is an example of an electrostatic thruster, though it is not used for the production of thrust.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electromagnetic thrusters have much higher specific impulse than electrothermal thrusters. Electromagnetic thrusters are more compact than electrostatic ion thrusters because a charge neutral plasma does not have a space charge limitation on density. Problems include electrode erosion and general complexity of flow and current fields. The PPT thruster is mature and simple but does not scale up to large powers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electrostatic ion thrusters use a set of grids to accelerate charged ions. Electrons are also expelled separately to maintain charge neutrality and prevent a charge buildup which could shut off the ion beam. Heavy gases such as mercury vapor and xenon have been used to reduce ionization losses as a fraction of total energy. Ionization losses are approximately the same for most gases, whereas for a given exhaust velocity the energy added per ion is greater for heavier gases. In electrostatic thrusters, the beam consists of ions only and repulsion between particles limits the maximum density to relatively low levels, sometimes called the &#x201c;space charge effect&#x201d;. The space charge effect limits electrostatic thrusters to significantly lower thrust than other types of electric thrusters.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Consequently, there is no chemical-fuel based airbreathing propulsion system that can enable hypersonic flight in the range above Mach 10 or so and up to orbital speed. The range above Mach 10 is important because it would provide access to orbit without a rocket vehicle. A rocket capable of reaching the moon will typically have a fuel mass fraction of 90%+; of that fuel mass, 85% will be oxidizer. An airbreathing engine would permit most of the oxidizer mass to be left off the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Flight in low earth orbit, denominated in energy terms, is about 3.2*10<sup>4 </sup>J/g (assumes 8 km/s is orbit). LH/LOX combustion yields about 1.27 10<sup>4 </sup>J/g (NIST heat of formation of gaseous water)&#x2014;so a fuel mass roughly 2.5 times the payload mass is required to place a payload in orbit. More energy is needed out of the fuel burn to improve this ratio. Improving performance of propulsion systems is typically limited by the energy intensity of the fuel, and applies to most propulsion systems, whether rockets, jets, scramjets, bypass turbines, and the like. Fuels are limited in intensity by the energy (power) per unit mass (J/g) that can be released from them which, in turn, is proportional to the strength (energy) of the bonds holding their components together. Chemical fuels harvest the energy of molecular bonds and thus are limited to less than 10<sup>5 </sup>J/g, leading to a performance limit of, for example, rockets at about 500 seconds I<sub>SP </sub>(specific impulse). Nuclear fuels harvest either the weak force bonding energies (referred to as leptonic fuels) that roughly range between 10<sup>5 </sup>J/g and 10<sup>10 </sup>J/g, or strong force nuclear bonds that range above those energies. Nuclear power reactors and nuclear weapons are familiar examples of strong gluon bond energy harvesting. Various forms of &#x201c;beta&#x201d; batteries (nuclear batteries) are examples of power sources harvesting weak force bond energies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The description herein provides improvements to the performance of engine systems, propulsion systems, and associated power sources for such systems.

Discussed herein are leptonic fuels, a-thermal propulsion, and direct use of leptonics. Distinct from fission or fusion, a special class of nuclear decay interactions is called beta decay. Nuclear beta decay occurs in three ways, beta&#x2212;, beta+, and EC (electron capture). In these decays, a nuclear neutron (or proton) changes into a nuclear proton (or neutron) with the ejection of neutrinos and electrons (or positrons). Leptonic fuels are distinguishable from chemical fuels and from &#x2018;hadronic&#x2019; fuels of fission, fusion, and related concepts. Leptonic fuels or &#x201c;leptonics&#x201d; enable specific impulse (I<sub>SP</sub>) levels of tens of thousands of seconds and higher.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one example of leptonic fuels, nuclear isomers can be employed for energy storage. Although a naturally stable isomer state might be employed, the examples herein can employ forced stability in isomers by blocking accessible decay pathways with an engineered solution. A trigger energy describes the energy required to trigger prompt decay of an isomer, where prompt decay indicates a decay which follows closely in time from when commanded by a triggering system. This prompt decay can achieve usable energy from the gamma/beta decay scheme and improves the effectiveness of a propulsion cycle described herein by at least creating more ions per decay and more electrons to charge a corresponding electric field. Thus, the approach described herein, in effect, recycles the trigger energy, eliminating it as an energy cost. The engine systems described herein advantageously releases no external radiation, leaves no radioactive residue (e.g. fallout). Moreover, the engine systems described herein can be completely inert in an anomalous flight incident or, in a worst case, if all the leptonic fuel were released freely into the environment, 95% would revert to decay via neutrino release (which is harmless) and a remainder would decay to inert isotopes in a year or less.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Leptonic fuels can be employed in lieu of chemical or hadronic fuels. Hadronic fuels are advantageous in some respects but because of their ultra-high intensity, hadronic fuels produce hard radiation and radioactive residues (fallout) that are difficult to manage with respect to environmental and public health impacts. To mitigate these potentially adverse impacts, hadronic fuels incur generous amounts of overhead in the form of shielding, and other protective and prophylactic gear that adds mass and complexity to the system, diminishing, or even eliminating, the potential benefit of high-intensity fuel. Leptonics, however, operate in a range where fuel intensities and, thus, system performances are improved by orders of magnitude, but not so much as to produce the undesirable consequences or incur the countervailing penalties in mass and complexity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Leptonics offer a mass flow per unit of power produced consistent with a high specific impulse, and the mass flow of spent leptonic material is such that the velocity required to achieve target thrust levels is beyond what a fluid flow system can typically achieve. Thus, augmentation of the mass flow with inert material is employed in the engine and propulsion systems discussed herein. Leptonics are theoretically capable of specific impulse levels higher than what is optimal for reaction propulsion systems (i.e. thrusters rooted in Newton's third law entailing gas flows), so some dilution of the leptonic fuel flow with a working fluid derived from non-fuel supplies can be employed. This working fluid may be harvested from external sources, such as when flying in an atmosphere, or can be provided from on board stores of propellant material. The engine or propulsion systems discussed herein are considered as a type of plasma fuel engines (PFE). Thus, the I<sub>SP </sub>of a PFE with leptonic enhancement is throttleable and controllable to meet various flight and mission requirements. However, there are two technical challenges with leptonics. First, leptonics must be rendered stable (radiologically inert) for transport and ground handling when not being used. One way to ensure stable or inert leptonic power sources during storage and transport is to employ isotopes that decay only by electron capture and deny those isotopes access to electrons by storing as bare ions (i.e. stripped of all atomic electrons) and confined in a &#x201c;magnetic bottle&#x201d; such as a ion storage ring of ion trap. A second challenge is a mechanism for throttling or triggering of decay processes. The leptonic fuel is released from a suitable storage system and controlled to release corresponding energy on demand. The examples herein trigger prompt decay to regulate the burn rate and thus the power output from the leptonic fuel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An &#x201c;a-thermal&#x201d; engine concept includes engines that are not strictly &#x201c;heat engines&#x201d; even if they produce some heat, provided the universal gas law (UGL), PV=nRT, is not the underlying prime principle. Chemical fuel engines all depend on UGL cycles (e.g., Brayton or Otto cycle, Sterling Engines, etc. . . . ) where the working fluid is heated directly or indirectly by combustion (or other heating concept) in a containment (e.g., &#x201c;combustion chamber&#x201d;) which leads to an increase in pressure followed by an expansion through a nozzle, generating mechanical energy which is then harvested as thrust according to conservation of momentum. While still employing conservation of momentum to generate thrust, plasma propulsion systems do not rely of the UGL, but generate acceleration of the working fluid directly by electromagnetic acceleration fields which do not require heating with compression. While plasma propulsion systems do shed some heat from various sources of inefficiency, the amounts can be relatively small A-thermal acceleration of working fluid is employed with leptonic fuels as energy intensity is great enough that usage of leptonics in heat engines would exceed the temperature and pressure limits of structural materials available to build devices capable of using the energy intensity. Moreover, to achieve acceptable augmentation of the leptonic mass flow in a heat-style engine by stored or harvested working fluid would force so much growth in engine size and weight as to reduce the benefit of leptonic fuel at the system level. Put somewhat differently, heat engines put too much of the available energy into the engine in the form of heat and, thus, cannot be built to use high intensity fuels without compromising performance at the system level, reducing the benefit of leptonic energy intensity. Leptonic-fueled engines discussed herein are primarily a-thermal in nature. The plasma fuel engine (PFE) incorporates an a-thermal accelerator of working fluids or materials. PFE devices rely on the working material to be partially ionized and, to generate acceleration of the partially ionized material, employ both an electric and a magnetic field to operate in one of two modes (or a mixture of both). These two modes include a magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) mode or a Hall thruster mode. Other modes include a reverse operation to provide electric power generation. These PFE devices require no heating or compression of the working material when operating at the highest efficiency (e.g. I<sub>SP</sub>&#x3e;chemical limit), but PFE devices are not perfectly efficient and some heating occurs and incurs losses. PFE devices are often considered electrical propulsion devices and use electrical power typically for two purposes. First, to at least partially ionize the working material into a plasma and to maintain that ionization level of the material during the acceleration run. Second, to accelerate the resulting plasma electromagnetically. Power for acceleration is withdrawn from the electric field, so the magnetic field is not depleted. The energy for ionization is a dead loss resulting in residual heating when recombination occurs so some designs will generally seek to employ the minimum acceptable ionization and to gain some useful work out of the recombination heating. These designs might fall in a class of mixed a-thermal/thermal cycles.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Also discussed herein is the use of raw nuclear radiant energy output from leptonics directly to power a PFE, rather than converting the energy output first to electrical power. So, in this sense the PFE discussed herein is not properly an electric propulsion system. Systems that convert nuclear radiation into electric power add weight and complexity that can also compromise system-level performance (especially specific performance) to the point where no net benefit results. Waste heat and adverse consequences of conversion into electric power can be averted by using nuclear energy of leptonics directly by eliminating the energy conversion. Relatively small amounts of energy can be drawn off the PFE engine cycle for hotel electric power (HEP), sensors, or other on-board systems.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The type of nuclear decay employed herein occurs in three ways, beta&#x2212;, beta+, and EC (electron capture). In these decays, a nuclear neutron (or proton) changes into a nuclear proton (or neutron) with the ejection of neutrinos and electrons (or positrons). The energy release mechanism from leptonic fuels is referred to as beta decay, implying either electron capture decay or internal conversion decay, and produces some mixture of beta and gamma radiation. For the PFE devices discussed herein, associated gamma radiation is marginally useful for purposes of establishing and maintaining the plasma conductivity, while the beta radiation is directly useful in the engine cycle. The combined beta and gamma radiation permeate the interior housing of the engine, passing through the working material or fluid that has been introduced as a mass augmentation agent, and ionizing a small fraction of the working material as it passes through the housing. The beta radiation is absorbed on electrodes arrayed along the length of walls of the housing building up electric charge and establishing an electric field that accelerates the ionized material. In many examples of leptonics, the proportion of gamma radiation is relatively large compared to beta radiation and the PFE device can benefit by passing at least some of the gamma radiation through a membrane or target material first that converts the gamma radiation to beta radiation (e.g. high energy electrons) by the photoelectric effect. This conversion advantageously preserves the full momentum vector (direction and magnitude) of the gamma radiation in the resulting beta radiation. The result is direct use of both gamma and beta radiation from a leptonic power source to energize and power a PFE device without first converting to electric power.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is presented as a schematic view of an example plasma fuel engine (PPE) with a leptonic source. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates system <b>100</b> comprising housing <b>110</b>, leptonic source <b>120</b>, control system <b>121</b>, magnetic field source <b>122</b>, power circuitry <b>123</b>, and thrust material source <b>125</b>.

This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as a first flow speed <b>101</b> and a second flow speed <b>102</b> after an acceleration.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The acceleration of working fluid <b>115</b> is provided within housing <b>110</b> using energy in the form of high-energy beam electrons <b>150</b>, referred to as beta (&#x3b2;) radiation, provided by leptonic source <b>120</b> to both establish electric field (E) <b>151</b> in housing <b>110</b> and at least partially ionize working fluid <b>115</b> to be accelerated by electric field <b>151</b>. Once working fluid <b>115</b> is partially ionized by beam electrons <b>150</b>, a portion of the electrons of working fluid <b>115</b> (referred to herein as plasma electrons) are liberated forming ions within working fluid <b>115</b>. While the ions are accelerated towards output aperture <b>114</b> by electric field <b>151</b>, plasma electrons are induced to flow in the opposite direction. This behavior is due in part to the large mass difference between electrons and ions, on the order of 1:2000. However, magnetic field source <b>122</b> establishes magnetic field (B) <b>152</b> into housing <b>110</b> which entrains or partially immobilizes plasma electrons with respect to electric field <b>151</b>. These plasma electrons tend to helically drift with average motion perpendicular to the electric field and the magnetic field lines (<b>152</b>) instead of participating in the flow of working fluid <b>115</b>. Meanwhile, the ions of working fluid <b>115</b> transfer momentum to other particles of working fluid <b>115</b>, such as neutral (non-ionized) particles or other ions. The ions are accelerated by electric field <b>151</b>. In the idealized case, the force on each ion is F=qE, and the total force is F=nqE, where &#x2018;q&#x2019; is the particle charge, &#x2018;n&#x2019; is the number of ions, &#x2018;E&#x2019; is the intensity/direction of the electric field. However, this force can depend on the density of working fluid <b>115</b>, the ionization fraction, the magnetic field, and such. Momentum transfer from beam electrons <b>150</b> occurs, but for the examples herein the momentum transfer will be small enough to neglect. Thus, the momentum transfer that matters more is between the ions of working fluid <b>115</b> and the neutral particles in working fluid <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An electric field in housing <b>110</b> can be established using a conventional electrical power supply coupled between electrodes on housing <b>110</b>. However, this conventional technique would require a dedicated electrical power source, along with any associated power conversion equipment and corresponding inefficiencies. In the examples herein the electric field is instead established by leptonic source <b>120</b>. Beam electrons <b>150</b> are injected into housing <b>110</b>, aimed to stream across the flow of working fluid <b>115</b> at an oblique angle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows example injection of beam electrons <b>150</b> from leptonic source <b>120</b> towards cathodes <b>112</b>. The point where the electrons are emitted is anode <b>111</b>, the point where they are collected after passing through working fluid <b>115</b> are cathodes <b>112</b>, and an electric field (E) <b>151</b> is generated between anode <b>111</b> and cathodes <b>112</b>. A benefit to this approach is that the energy output of leptonic source <b>120</b> that emits beam electrons <b>150</b> can be directly used without lossy and heavy conversion, and beam electrons <b>150</b> streaming through working fluid <b>115</b> creates the ionization for current flow. The direction of electric field <b>151</b> is then a function of the direction in which beam electrons <b>150</b> are aimed. Electrons sourced from beam electrons <b>150</b> can also be redistributed among electrodes through electrical connections once they are collected by cathodes <b>112</b> to further refine the direction of electric field <b>151</b>. A strength of electric field <b>151</b> is proportional to how many electrons are supplied by beam electrons <b>150</b>, and the energy of each of the electrons of beam electrons <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The total current flow within working fluid <b>115</b> in housing <b>110</b> includes both beam electrons <b>150</b> and plasma electrons. However, the majority of the current flow is provided by plasma electrons, because beam electrons <b>150</b> are effectively decoupled from the flow of working fluid <b>115</b> due to their high energy. Although once individual electrons among beam electrons <b>150</b> lose a sufficient portion of their energy and become entrained with the flow, these individual electrons count as &#x201c;plasma&#x201d; electrons and not as &#x201c;beam&#x201d; electrons. Anode <b>111</b> is located at a leading edge or input aperture <b>113</b> of housing <b>110</b>, and there are or more cathodes disposed along the length of housing <b>110</b>. One cathode is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for clarity, and further examples with multiple electrodes are included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Beam electrons <b>150</b> deposit charge (electrons) on cathodes <b>112</b>, and that charge can be redistributed as necessary by wiring (not shown). Plasma electrons travel back through working fluid <b>115</b> in housing <b>110</b> from the cathode to the anode under the action of electric field <b>151</b>. Thus, there are two populations of electrons: beam electrons <b>150</b> that shoot downstream against the electric force of electric field <b>151</b>, and plasma electrons that move upstream according to the electric force. The term &#x2018;anode&#x2019; is used intentionally as system <b>100</b> would naturally be embedded in a circuit restoring the lost electrons to maintain change balance in the system. Because of the rapid emission of electrons via beam electrons <b>150</b>, the charge on anode <b>111</b> is naturally highly positive and would be neutralized by electron sources (e.g. cathodes) returning electrons to anode <b>111</b> by reverse electron flow through the plasma of working fluid <b>115</b>, which is similar to a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) current flow direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The induced voltage between cathode and anode is a function of the initial kinetic energy of beam electrons <b>150</b> after passing into housing <b>110</b>. Beam electrons <b>150</b> lose energy at least due to energy deposition into working fluid <b>115</b> and climbing the potential between the anode and the cathode, which can correspond to the following equation:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mo>&#x2202;</mo>    <mi>&#x3b5;</mi>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mo>&#x2202;</mo>    <mi>x</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mo>-</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>Y</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mi>x</mi>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <mo>-</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>q</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>&#x2207;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>V</mi>      <mo>(</mo>      <mi>x</mi>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0037" num="0000">which can be integrated and rearranged to get the voltage:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>V</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <msub>     <mi>&#x3b5;</mi>     <mn>0</mn>    </msub>    <mi>q</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>-</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mn>1</mn>     <mi>q</mi>    </mfrac>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <msubsup>      <mo>&#x222b;</mo>      <mn>0</mn>      <mi>L</mi>     </msubsup>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>Y</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mi>x</mi>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>dx</mi>       <mo>.</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0039" num="0000">Where Y(x) is the differential energy deposition of the electron beam into working fluid <b>115</b>, and depends on several factors (e.g., electron energy, gas density, and gas composition) and is a known quantity for atmospheric gases (air). An appropriate balance between energy deposition (ionization) and induced voltage dictates the desired energy of the electron beam, though from immediate considerations (inducing several kV/m along the PFE), the desired energy should not be less than several tens of keV after passing into a chamber/housing of modest size. Electron beams can produce a conductivity of 0.5 S/m in 0.6 atm air with 1 W/cm<sup>3 </sup>of beam power deposition.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0035">As mentioned above, beam electrons <b>150</b> are provided by leptonic source <b>120</b>. Leptonic source <b>120</b> comprises one or more materials having properties which support beta decay or electron capture type of inverse beta decay. These materials may comprise various isotopes or isomers, among other materials. Beta decay isotopes can be viewed as a new class of fuels, referred to as leptonic fuel herein, with specific energy several orders of magnitude greater than any chemical fuel. Such leptonic fuels also play a new role in a thrust engine, that is, leptonic fuels are not especially useful as working fluid <b>115</b> because of the mass of each emitted electron. However, systems that include leptonic fuels can employ another source of mass flow. This mass flow can be harvested from the atmosphere (e.g., an airbreather arrangement) or store it on-board an associated vehicle and pump it into housing <b>110</b> (e.g. a rocket-like arrangement). Systems that include leptonic fuels are able to make use of much higher specific energy fuels than heat engines alone can tolerate.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0036">One example leptonic fuel is <sup>7</sup>Be, a nuclear isotope of beryllium having 4 protons and 3 neutrons. This isotope can undergo electron capture decay into <sup>7</sup>Li, a lithium isotope having 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Decay of <sup>7</sup>Be transmutes to <sup>7</sup>Li, a stable daughter, absorbing an electron and transmuting one proton into a neutron with a net release of 0.862 MeV. One decay product of <sup>7</sup>Be is a 478 keV (0.478 MeV) gamma photon, which is generated in approximately 10% of the decays. These gamma photons are converted by leptonic source <b>120</b> to electrons by placing a metallic target in an emission path, from which electrons are produced by the photoelectric effect resulting in a nuclear-energized anode <b>111</b>. While doing even a single conversion between photons and electrons is costly in terms of potential energy losses, the arrangement of leptonic source <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> allows housing <b>110</b> to fully contain the <sup>7</sup>Be and its daughter element, <sup>7</sup>Li, while releasing only electrons into the surrounding environment external to housing <b>110</b>. The energy of the beam electrons produced in this manner can be significantly smaller than that of the gamma photons, such as 25%, or 100 keV, which is roughly the energy of the K-shell electrons most likely to be ejected in this interaction. The direction of the beam electron motion is, on average, preferentially at an angle normal to the emitting surface that conserves momentum.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0037">Leptonic source <b>120</b> thus employs energetic electrons to form beam electrons <b>150</b> electron beam that can pass through a window in a wall of housing <b>110</b>, pass through working fluid <b>115</b> and deposit energy by ionizing collisions with particles of working fluid <b>115</b>. Due to the specific energy of beam electrons <b>150</b>, each emitted electron is expected to produce thousands of ionizations in working fluid <b>115</b>. After transiting a portion of working fluid <b>115</b>, beam electrons <b>150</b> are collected on cathodes <b>112</b>. The ionization thus produced in working fluid <b>115</b> provides the plasma conductivity needed to drive current and produce a Lorentz body force on working fluid <b>115</b>. The collection of electrons of beam electrons <b>150</b> on cathodes <b>112</b> downstream of the emission point near anode <b>111</b> establishes electric field <b>151</b> that drives the current in the plasma formed from working fluid <b>115</b>. Thus, a single energetic beam of beta radiation (beam electrons <b>150</b>) supplies system <b>100</b> with ions and with the electric field powering the acceleration of working fluid <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0038">The plasma fuel engine (PFE) described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be an air-breathing plasma accelerator. In lieu of breathing ingested air, the PFE may be adapted to breathing exhaust gas from another heat engine (optionally augmented with ingested air) and when that heat engine is a rocket, a Rocket-PFE hybrid configuration arises (R-PFE). The appeal of the R-PFE configuration is that it presents linear combinations of a rocket and PFE operational modes in a single flow path, with the PFE portion having significantly higher I<sub>SP </sub>than the rocket portion. Because such a configuration can seamlessly shift between rocket and PFE modes, such a configuration offers useful new mission maneuver capability in various applications. For example, hypersonic travel is possible in PFE and R-PFE arrangements, having a power range of megawatt to gigawatt. Moreover, the use of leptonic source <b>120</b> provides for a throttleable engine response using a variable intensity of electric field and ionization level that is set by release of beta radiation (beam electrons <b>150</b>). As will be discussed below, a control system (<b>121</b>) can instruct leptonic source <b>120</b> to alter properties of beam electrons <b>150</b> to affect the throttle and other dynamic properties of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">Returning to the elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, housing <b>110</b> comprises structural elements that provide a chamber for ionization of an input material and acceleration of that material to produce thrust on an associated vehicle.

This plasma includes ionized particles <b>261</b>-<b>262</b> and plasma electrons <b>263</b>-<b>267</b> which are liberated from neutral particles <b>260</b>. Ions will respond to electric field <b>203</b> by moving downstream (rightward) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Plasma electrons (<b>263</b>) are separated from ionized particles <b>261</b>-<b>262</b> and initially might have momentum in the downstream direction. Electric field <b>203</b> exerts a force on plasma electrons in the upstream direction. Concurrently, magnetic field source establishes magnetic field <b>204</b> approximately perpendicular to the downstream/upstream flow within housing <b>210</b>. Magnetic field <b>204</b> induces plasma electrons (<b>265</b>-<b>266</b>) to execute a helical &#x2018;drift&#x2019; with average motion in a direction perpendicular to both the electric field (E) and magnetic field (B). Thus, magnetic field <b>204</b> acts to separate plasma electrons from the flow and entrain them in the magnetic field. As the plasma electrons lose downstream momentum under the action of the magnetic field lines, eventually the plasma electrons are directed by electric field <b>203</b> upstream. This upstream motion forms a current in the plasma indicated by electrons <b>267</b>, which may have angled/helical drifting with respect to the applied magnetic and electric fields. Furthermore, ions <b>261</b>-<b>262</b> in the plasma transfer momentum to other particles within working fluid <b>201</b>, such as other ions, electrons, and neutral particles. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, momentum transfer occurs between ions (<b>262</b>) of the plasma within housing <b>210</b> and neutral particles (<b>264</b>) of working fluid <b>201</b>. Momentum transfer may also transfer between ions of the plasma, but since the ions typically gain momentum from electric field <b>203</b>, the momentum transfer between ions and neutral particles accounts for a larger portion of the thrust produced by system <b>200</b>. This momentum transfer occurs primarily via elastic collisions among ions and neutral particles. Ions, neutral particles, and some plasma electrons can exit housing <b>210</b> at exit aperture <b>212</b>, producing thrust using exhaust <b>202</b>. This thrust can accelerate a vehicle when coupled to housing <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows magnetic field lines which indicate magnetic field <b>204</b> (B) established generally perpendicular to the direction of flow of working fluid <b>201</b> as well as to electric filed <b>203</b>.

Magnetic field source <b>246</b> can adjust the approximately perpendicular angle to select among performance characteristics for the thrust corresponding to thrust magnitude and specific impulse magnitude. Although many examples will have the approximately perpendicular angle fixed upon manufacture, other examples can have a dynamically variable approximately perpendicular angle. Since thrust will decrease as the specific impulse increases for a given power, a tradeoff must be made for a particular mission between propellant usage and mission time. High specific impulse leads to low propellant usage. High thrust scenarios can include atmospheric conditions where atmospheric input is available for working fluid <b>201</b>.

Decay example <b>300</b> includes decay via transmutation of <sup>7</sup>Be into <sup>7</sup>Li. One example leptonic fuel is <sup>7</sup>Be, a nuclear isotope of beryllium having 4 protons and 3 neutrons. This isotope can undergo electron capture decay into <sup>7</sup>Li, a lithium isotope having 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Decay of <sup>7</sup>Be transmutes to <sup>7</sup>Li, a stable daughter, absorbing an electron (c) and transmuting one proton into a neutron (implying that one up-quark in the <sup>7</sup>Be nucleus has been flipped to a down-quark) with a net release of 0.862 MeV, referred to as the reaction Q. Energy level <b>310</b> corresponds to this 0.862 MeV potential energy. In an initial state, <sup>7</sup>Be (4 Be 7) can decay via two pathways <b>313</b> and <b>314</b>/<b>315</b>. Decay pathway <b>313</b> includes absorption of an electron and transmutation of one proton of <sup>7</sup>Be into a neutron and emission of a neutrino having an energy of 0.862 MeV, such as an electron neutrino (&#x3c5;<sub>e</sub>), to reach energy level <b>312</b>. Energy level <b>312</b> corresponds to <sup>7</sup>Li (3 Li 7). Decay pathway <b>313</b> occurs 89.56% of the time, approximately 9 out of 10 decays. Decay pathway <b>314</b> includes absorption of an electron and transmutation of one proton into a neutron to form an intermediary excited version of <sup>7</sup>Li at energy level <b>311</b> which is 0.384 MeV less than energy level <b>310</b>. At a later time, this excited version of <sup>7</sup>Li can relax by emission of a gamma photon having energy of 0.478 MeV to reach energy level <b>312</b>. Decay pathway <b>314</b>/<b>315</b> occurs 10.44% of the time, approximately 1 out of 10 decays. This 0.478 MeV gamma photon, which is generated in approximately 10% of the decays, translates to a specific energy of 6.6&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>J/kg, orders of magnitude greater than chemical fuels.

In decay pathway <b>313</b> in example <b>301</b>, electron <b>321</b> is absorbed by isotope <sup>7</sup>Be (<b>320</b>) to produce electron neutrino <b>323</b> (&#x3c5;<sub>e</sub>) and <sup>7</sup>Li.

This ring structure can provide a style or ion trap or magnetic bottle, where electromagnetic elements <b>411</b> are disposed around the ring structure to contain and direct ionized <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei <b>415</b>. Each ionized <sup>7</sup>Be nucleus is fully ionized in this example, which corresponds to no orbital/valence electrons. Moreover, no electrons are included in the collection of <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei, providing for bare nuclei of <sup>7</sup>Be within containment structure <b>401</b>. Detailed view <b>420</b> shows one such arrangement, with a collection of <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei having associated motion around the ring structure without contact with the walls of the ring structure. Other magnetic or electromagnetic containment solutions are possible to contain nuclei of <sup>7</sup>Be.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">Once beta particles are desired to be produced, control element <b>450</b> can be instructed to extract a portion of nuclei <b>415</b>, perhaps via a controllable diversion channel, magnetic valve, or magnetic throat arrangement shown by channel <b>412</b>. These nuclei <b>415</b> are directed toward target material <b>413</b> which (as detailed in view <b>430</b>) includes lead (Pb) atoms <b>431</b> having ample electrons within the bulk material as well as associated with each Pb atom. As nuclei <b>415</b> come into proximity with electrons, each nucleus <b>415</b> can undergo a decay process to convert into <sup>7</sup>Li nuclei. Various materials can be employed for target material <b>413</b> which exhibit loosely coupled elections when in a bulk material form, such as various metallic materials, f-block elements, d-block elements, rare earth materials, and the like, including combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0060">Several processes are shown in view <b>430</b>. In a first interaction <b>441</b> between a <sup>7</sup>Be nucleus and an electron in target material <b>413</b>, <sup>7</sup>Be undergoes electron capture decay into an excited state of <sup>7</sup>Li <b>435</b>&#x2014;which then relaxes into another state of <sup>7</sup>Li (<b>434</b>) by releasing a 478 keV gamma photon <b>436</b> (&#x3b3;). Gamma photon <b>436</b> liberates electron <b>438</b> from target material <b>413</b>, such as from a Pb atom or free electron (<b>433</b>) in the bulk material. Electron <b>438</b> is now emitted as &#x3b2; (beam electron <b>416</b>). In a second interaction <b>440</b> between a <sup>7</sup>Be nucleus and an electron in target material <b>413</b>, <sup>7</sup>Be undergoes electron capture decay into <sup>7</sup>Li (<b>434</b>) by releasing &#x3c5;<sub>e </sub><b>439</b> which exits target material <b>413</b> without further interaction. By control of release of a quantity of nuclei <b>415</b> from containment structure <b>415</b>, electron capture decay of <sup>7</sup>Be can be prompted to produce corresponding beam electrons <b>416</b>. This decay is prompt&#x2014;meaning the average time lapse between ion-electron collisions and the subsequent release of energy is less than a design amount that sets the maximum power available from each decay.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">As noted above, about 10% of the decays produce a gamma photon, with the other 90% releasing a non-interacting neutrino. Additionally, rare bound-state beta decays can occur for some materials (referred to as two-body decays), in which a produced electron might remain bound to a particular nucleon. Thus, gamma radiation will be the primary useful output of this process, which is leveraged to liberate electrons having similar energy from a target material. The geometry of the target material and ability to steer the gamma radiation can play a role in the conversion efficiency overall. Moreover, a conversion between gamma photons and electrons is costly in terms of potential energy losses, but this process allows a corresponding engine to fully contain <sup>7</sup>Be and <sup>7</sup>Li, within the engine&#x2014;releasing only electrons into the environment. Under certain assumptions, electrons produced by this process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> can have significantly smaller energy than that of the gamma photons, such as 25% (or 100 keV), which is roughly the energy of the K-shell electrons most likely to be ejected by gamma photons in this interaction. The direction of the electron motion is, on average, preferentially at an angle normal to the emitting surface that conserves momentum.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">Energetic electrons among beam electrons <b>416</b> can form an electron beam (although not so well collimated as a standard beam) that can pass through an aperture or window in a wall of a housing or plasma chamber of a PFE, pass through the working fluid, and deposit energy by ionizing collisions with its gas molecules. Each beam electron is projected to cause thousands of ionizations, before being collected on a cathode positioned along the length of the PFE housing. The ionization thus produced provides the plasma conductivity needed to drive current and produce a Lorentz body force on the gas without the need for seeding of special particles in the working fluid. The collection of beam electrons on the cathodes downstream of the emission point (anode) establishes the electric field that drives the current within the housing. Thus, a single energetic beam of beta particles (beam electrons <b>416</b>) supplies the PFE with ions and with the electric field powering acceleration of the working fluid.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">Under certain theoretical frameworks, decay via electron capture of <sup>7</sup>Be will occur promptly when the (mean)<sup>7</sup>Be nuclei are mated with a source of charge if <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei have been stored in a charge-deprived condition long enough to reach a corresponding incipient decay state. Put somewhat differently: a finite quantity of radioactive electron capture material is considered effectively inert after, for example, five half-lives. Likewise, if stored in a charge deprivation state for five half-lives, effectively all of the material will decay promptly when <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei are rejoined with a source of charge (elections). Thus, decay of <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei can be triggered based on a lifetime until the <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei reaches the incipient decay state. The half-life of <sup>7</sup>Be is 53.22 days, which computes to a mean lifetime of 76.78 days. Bare <sup>7</sup>Be nuclei can be stored in containment structure <b>410</b> for 2-3 half-lives (2&#xd7; or 3&#xd7; of 75-78 days) and then released into target material <b>413</b> to promptly decay into daughter products. Based on this prompt or triggered decay, 1 gigawatt (GW) of power for 15 minutes might take 1.4 kg of <sup>7</sup>Be.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a method of operating a leptonic source, such as any among leptonic sources <b>120</b> or <b>220</b>-<b>221</b>, or the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.

A leptonic fuel is a fuel that releases energy from lepton absorption in the atomic nucleus that flip up-quarks to down-quarks rather than from molecular bonds of chemical fuels or the strong force interactions of nuclear power. Technologies utilizing leptonic fuels exhibit performance orders-of-magnitude above chemical/electrochemical prime movers and expel orders-of-magnitude less waste as a result. To create throttleable power using leptonic fuels, a system is employed to command prompt energy release, i.e., to &#x201c;burn&#x201d; the leptonic fuels on demand Weak nuclear force energy release can be controlled within plasmas that incorporate stripped hadron-lepton collisions if the collision scenarios are well-enough controlled to enhance cross-sections and remove interaction barriers posed by various physical conservation rules. Such plasmas exist momentarily in the hadronic volume (e.g. atomic nucleus) during compatible electron-hadron collisions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">One example isotope selected for a leptonic fuel is <sup>7</sup>Be. Stable beryllium (<sup>9</sup>Be) has 5 neutrons and 4 protons, whereas <sup>7</sup>Be has 3 neutrons and 4 protons. Decay of <sup>7</sup>Be occurs via electron capture (sometimes referred to as inverse beta decay), instead of direct beta decay. Masses of isotope <sup>7</sup>Be may be manufactured within fission-style nuclear reactors or by particle accelerators, among other methods. Other example leptonic fuels might employ isomer-based metastability. In some isotopes, raising the nucleus to a higher metastable energy state can boost its half-life dramatically, rendering it, in effect, relatively stable. These metastable states are called &#x201c;isomers&#x201d; of the isotopes provided their half-lives are long enough to be measurable.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0067">In operation <b>511</b>, a quantity of the selected isotope is stripped of orbital electrons by full ionization to produce bare nuclei or bare ions. Certain otherwise radioactive isotopes, such as those that decay by electron capture (e.g. <sup>7</sup>Be), are metastable and non-radioactive when denied access to nuclear electrons. Nuclear electrons, as used herein, are ordinary leptons that are positioned close enough to a nucleus so that their wave function overlap with the nucleus. The ionization of <sup>7</sup>Be can be achieved using various known atomic ionization processes. Once ionized, the bare ions are stored in this metastable state without access to electrons (<b>512</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, one example storage technology is presented as a ring-style storage device (containment structure <b>410</b>) that employs electromagnetic elements or magnetic elements to confine ions into a storage ring. Containment structure <b>410</b> can be roughly 1.4 meters in diameter and adapted to hold high current at low energies to store a reasonable amount of <sup>7</sup>Be in a stable state for a suitably long duration. Containment structure <b>410</b> is not entirely passive and will have some maintenance power requirements associated with electromagnetic elements, thermal control, telemetry, and other features. The maximum energy available from one mol of <sup>7</sup>Be decay is approximately one tenth of a gigawatt-day.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0068">Control element <b>450</b> of containment structure <b>410</b> transfers (<b>513</b>) metastable ions to an electron source to stimulate prompt electron capture beta decay. In this example, the fully ionized <sup>7</sup>Be particles are transferred from the ring structure through channel <b>412</b> to target material <b>413</b> for production of electrons (&#x3b2;). The energy from leptonic fuels can be released promptly on demand to achieve utility in devices such as PFEs or as general-purpose power sources. When stripped of all orbital electrons to a bare ion (e.g. atomic nucleus), the strong positive charge of the bare ion can attract and accelerate an electron into a sharp collision with the nucleus, maximizing captured-electron density in the hadronic volume stimulating the quark flip. Normally, such energy is released in accordance with a natural isotopic half-life. The natural decay scenario of <sup>7</sup>Be transmutes <sup>7</sup>Be to <sup>7</sup>Li, absorbing an electron and flipping one up-quark to a down-quark&#x2014;all at a net loss of 0.00092534 atomic mass units (AMU), from 7.0169298828 AMU to 7.016004548 AMU or 0.862 MeV.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0069">The incidence of <sup>7</sup>Be ions onto target material <b>413</b> generates (<b>514</b>) beam electrons <b>416</b> from electron capture decay. Target material <b>413</b> comprises a relatively dense and electron-rich material, typically metallic or conductive. These materials typically form a lattice structure which include a population of valence electrons that are free to move about the bulk of the material. This arrangement of electrons provides donor electrons which participate in the prompt electron capture (EC) decay process of <sup>7</sup>Be. This electron capture decay can produce neutrinos as well as gamma photons. In addition to providing free electrons for EC, target material <b>413</b> also can provide a source for electrons to be liberated using gamma photons and produce beam electrons <b>416</b> via the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect dominates gamma-metal interactions until a threshold&#x2014;dependent upon the size of the metal nucleus&#x2014;above which Compton scattering dominates. For lead (Pb), this threshold is about 600 keV. These beam electrons <b>416</b> can then be introduced (<b>515</b>) to a target device, such as a PFE to generate thrust or to a general-purpose power supply to generate electrical power directly from deceleration of the electrons.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">Thus, operations <b>500</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> provide for a leptonic source configured to hold isotope ions in a confinement state in which nuclear decay (such as electron capture decay) is below a threshold probability. Then, upon command of a control element, a portion of the isotope ions are released from confinement for prompt nuclear decay to produce radiation for ionizing a working fluid of an engine or for direct use as a power source. In one example, the radiation produced comprises gamma photons for impingement onto a target material and liberation of the beam electrons from the target material. Control of the quantity of the portion of the isotope ions released from confinement is selected to achieve a selectable energy output level. In engine examples, the selectable energy output level corresponds to an ionization degree of the plasma and the selectable intensity of the electric field produced from resulting charge distributions. Advantageously, when employed in a flight/engine system, the leptonic sources discussed herein are designed to release no harmful radiation, leave no radioactive residue (fallout), and be inert in an anomalous flight incident. In a worst case, if all the leptonic fuel were released freely into the environment, 90% would decay via harmless neutrino release and rest would decay to inert <sup>7</sup>Li in a year or less.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a method of operating an engine that employs a leptonic source, such as any among system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

In a hot plasma, full ionization takes place, and the ions and the electrons are in thermal equilibrium. A cold plasma (also known as a weakly ionized plasma) is one where only a small fraction of the atoms in a gas are ionized, and the electrons reach a very high temperature, whereas the ions remain at the ambient temperature or slightly above.

Leptonic sources <b>220</b>-<b>221</b> are configured to emit beam electrons <b>226</b>-<b>227</b> into housing <b>210</b> to ionize working fluid <b>201</b> into a plasma according to a selectable ionization degree. Also, beam electrons <b>226</b>-<b>227</b> deposit charge onto cathodes <b>230</b>-<b>235</b> to establish (<b>612</b>) electric field <b>203</b> of a selectable intensity in the plasma. This selectable ionization degree and selectable intensity of electric field <b>203</b> can ultimately correspond to an amount of thrust produced by system <b>200</b>. Control circuitry <b>241</b> or other control elements can control the release of ions within leptonic sources <b>220</b>-<b>221</b> to control a rate of decay. This rate of decay corresponds to an intensity of beam electrons <b>226</b>-<b>227</b> and controls the selectable ionization degree and the selectable intensity of electric field.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0075">To further refine the selectable intensity of electric field, leptonic sources <b>220</b>-<b>221</b> or windows <b>215</b>-<b>216</b> of housing <b>210</b> are configured to emit beam electrons <b>226</b>-<b>227</b> with an angular configuration among cathodes <b>230</b>-<b>235</b> that establishes a progressively more negative charge on cathodes <b>230</b>-<b>235</b>. Cathodes <b>230</b>-<b>235</b> are coupled to housing <b>210</b> downstream from anodes <b>236</b>-<b>237</b>. Cathodes <b>230</b>-<b>235</b> are established as progressively more negative in charge among each other in the downstream direction (i.e. to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Power circuitry is electrically coupled between anodes <b>236</b>-<b>237</b> and cathodes <b>230</b>-<b>235</b>, or among individual cathodes <b>230</b>-<b>235</b>. This power circuitry comprises power circuitry <b>240</b> as well as bias elements <b>242</b>-<b>245</b>. This power circuitry establishes the progressively more negative charge arrangement. This progressively more negative charge arrangement forms the intensity and direction of electric field <b>203</b> within the plasma of housing <b>210</b>. In addition to the progressively more negative charge arrangement, the power circuitry can provide electrical power to other circuitry in system <b>200</b>. This other circuitry can include control circuitry <b>241</b> configured to control the selectable ionization degree of the plasma and the selectable intensity of the electric field according to a desired thrust level.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0076">In addition to electric field <b>203</b> within housing <b>210</b>, system <b>200</b> also establishes (<b>613</b>) magnetic field <b>204</b> to entrain plasma electrons of working fluid <b>201</b>. Magnetic field <b>204</b> is produced by magnetic field source <b>246</b> as an approximately perpendicular magnetic field in relation to electric field <b>203</b> or approximately perpendicular to the flow of particles in housing <b>210</b>. Magnetic field <b>204</b> acts to operate on any charged particle within housing <b>210</b>, but due to the much larger masses of ions in the plasma, electrons typically feel the effects of magnetic field <b>204</b> to a much larger degree. Magnetic field <b>204</b> at least partially entrains plasma electrons, such as shown for electrons <b>265</b>-<b>266</b>. This entrainment corresponds to causing plasma electrons to helically drift with average motion perpendicular to the electric field and the lines of magnetic force instead of traveling according to a prior direction of movement. Thus, magnetic field <b>204</b> allows the plasma electrons to more easily either impinge on cathodes or receive momentum in the upstream direction from electric field <b>203</b>. All the power for acceleration of plasma electrons is withdrawn from electric field <b>203</b>, so the magnetic field is not depleted from this activity. Thus, when changes to angles of the magnetic field are not desired, permanent magnets can be employed since only a small amount of energy is needed for this process of entrainment. However, an electromagnet device with a selectable or adjustable angle can be employed when changes to angles of the magnetic field are desired. As mentioned herein, the approximately perpendicular angle can be mechanically or electrically selectable or adjustable to select among performance characteristics for the thrust corresponding to thrust magnitude and specific impulse magnitude.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">System <b>200</b> generates (<b>614</b>) an electrical current from plasma electrons and plasma ions within electric field <b>203</b>. Electric field <b>203</b> acts on both ions and electrons, albeit to produce a force in opposite directions. Electrons of the plasma in housing <b>210</b> which have been entrained by magnetic field <b>204</b> are accelerated by electric field <b>203</b> by moving upstream (leftward direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) as seen for electrons <b>267</b>. These electrons can propagate upstream between cathodes and anodes, eventually deposited onto anodes <b>236</b>-<b>237</b>. Ions are accelerated (<b>615</b>) downstream by electric field <b>203</b> to produce a first portion of thrust for system <b>200</b> from the ions exiting housing <b>210</b>. These ions also transfer momentum via collisions with other particles of working fluid <b>201</b>, such as neutral particles introduced to housing <b>210</b> that have not been ionized by beam electrons. System <b>200</b> thus produces (<b>616</b>) second portion of thrust from momentum transfer between ions and these other particles of material. These neutral particles can be introduced from at least one among ingested atmospheric gas when operating in an atmosphere, and a pressured propellant tank when operating outside of an atmosphere. The total thrust produced by system <b>200</b> is proportional to the selectable ionization degree of the plasma and the selectable intensity of electric field <b>203</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates control system <b>700</b> and associated software <b>705</b> in an implementation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates control system <b>700</b> that is representative of any system or collection of systems in which the various operational architectures, scenarios, and processes disclosed herein may be implemented.
