U.S. Publication Serial No. 20050014245, which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses devices and methods for biomaterial production. Biologically active molecules include proteins and nucleic acid molecules. Production of such molecules in living cells offers numerous advantages over alternative productions methods but isolation and purification issues arise when extracting biologically active molecules from cells. There are various components present in cells which prevent realization of high yields of biologically active molecules of interest as well as representing possible unwanted contaminants to a final product.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Plasmid production is a field of interest due to the emergence of the non-viral gene therapy and DNA vaccine fields. Plasmids are large and complex macromolecules, which are maintained as supercoiled DNA structures unless disrupted. Rather then using synthetic means, in many instances it is more cost effective to produce them in biological systems, and subsequently isolate and purify them from those systems. Biological production of plasmids commonly takes the form of fermenting <i>Escherichia coli </i>(&#x201c;<i>E. coli</i>&#x201d;) cells containing the plasmid of interest.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cell lysis and the subsequent treatment steps used to prepare a process stream for purification, are the most difficult, complex, and important steps in any plasmid process. It is in this process where yield and quality are defined for each plasmid production run. The search for an optimal method, one which is continuous, scaleable, and yielding high quality product that can be formulated at high concentration irrespective of plasmid size, has been an obstacle in getting acceptable processes to commercial capability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lysing bacteria for plasmid purification using alkali and detergents is a common technique. Unfortunately, this method presents significant challenges for large scale preparations (or scaled-up production). First, thorough mixing of suspended cells with lysis solution is easily managed at small scale by simply vortexing or inverting the vessel containing the cells. However, this is impractical at large scale, where volumes may be in the range of tens or hundreds of liters. Common techniques for mixing large volumes of liquid, such as impeller mixing, are problematic because as some cells begin to lyse after initial mixing, they release genomic DNA which dramatically increases solution viscosity. This increase in viscosity significantly interferes with further mixing. Another challenge is that excessive incubation at high pH after addition of alkaline lysis solution can lead to permanent denaturation of the plasmid, making it unsuitable for most subsequent uses, especially for therapeutic purposes. Furthermore, it is well known that mixing at this step should be thorough but sufficiently gentle (i.e., low shear) to prevent substantial amounts of material from the flocculent precipitate into the plasmid-containing solution. Large amounts of host genomic DNA and endotoxin are present in the flocculent precipitate and if they become mixed with the plasmid they can be difficult to separate from the plasmid during subsequent purification. Thus, the large scale production of plasmids expose large quantities of cells to lysis solution, mix them and neutralize the lysate in a manner to optimize plasmid yield, minimize plasmid degradation, and maximize removal of other cellular components so that the material can be further purified to produce a high concentration, high quality, high purity final product in relatively large volumes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are a variety of existing methods to purify plasmids; however, these methods are not suitable for large scale preparations. Laboratory scale purification techniques cannot simply be scaled up for the volumes involved in large scale plasmid preparation. Large scale preparations require the optimization of yield and molecular integrity while maximizing removal of contaminants and concentration of plasmid. In producing large quantities of plasmid DNA at high concentration, a problem exists in maintaining the plasmid as supercoiled and open circle relaxed form. Storage conditions generally require high salt, and molecular degradation over time remains a problem even in the presence of salt. Many existing purification methods rely upon the use of potentially dangerous, toxic, mutagenic or contaminated substances, and/or expensive substances or equipment, which, again, are not desirable for large scale preparations. Some existing purification methods utilize the use of enzyme to digest protein for eventual elimination and such enzymes are costly for large scale production and can cause a risk of biologic contamination.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There remains a need for methods of large scale production of biologically active molecules of interest, such as plasmids, in which the final product can be produced in a cost effective manner, such as minimal equipment and/or minimal process steps, with high yield, at high concentration, and minimal degradation and without the presence of impurities, contaminants and unwanted substances. There remains a need for large quantities of plasmids solutions having high concentration and minimal degradation and presence of impurities, contaminants and unwanted substances and methods of preparing such solutions. The need for large quantities of plasmids is greater for those plasmids that are low copy number plasmids, which require much larger quantities of cells to yield plasmid quantities in the milligram (&#x201c;mg&#x201d;) range and above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present invention comprises large scale processes for producing high purity samples of at least one biologically active molecule of interest from bacterial cells.

The cells may be produced or generated by any means, such as for example by fermentation. Methods for fermenting cells are well known to those skilled in the art.

In some embodiments, the present invention may be employed to extract more than one type of biologically active molecule of interest. The biologically active molecules of interest may be a macromolecule such as a nucleic acid molecule or protein. In some embodiments, the biologically active molecule of interest may be a plasmid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;plasmid&#x201d; or &#x201c;DNA plasmid,&#x201d; used interchangeably, refers to circular DNA molecules that are extra-chromosomal DNA molecules separate from the chromosomal DNA which are capable of replicating independently of the chromosomal DNA. An encoding sequence or transgene is often contained within the DNA plasmid, and when present, the DNA plasmid is referred to as an expression plasmid or expression construct. The coding sequence, or &#x201c;encoding nucleic acid sequence,&#x201d; can include initiation and termination signals operably linked to regulatory elements including a promoter and polyadenylation signal capable of directing expression in the cells of the individual to whom the nucleic acid molecule is administered.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;large scale&#x201d; as used in reference to the described processes refers to purification processes that produce from bacterial cells or a suspension of bacterial cells quantities of at least one biologically active molecules, particularly DNA plasmid, of about 1 gram or greater and/or purification processes that requires lysis of quantities of bacterial cell paste of about 1 kilogram or greater.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;high purity&#x201d; as used in reference to the level of purity of biologically active molecules, particularly DNA plasmid, refers to purification of the molecules from host bacterial cells at a level of at least greater than or equal to about 90%; and preferably greater than or equal to about 91%, greater than or equal to about 92%, greater than or equal to about 93%, greater than or equal to about 94%, greater than or equal to about 95%, greater than or equal to about 96%, greater than or equal to about 97%, greater than or equal to about 98%, or greater than or equal to about 99%.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;continuous&#x201d; or &#x201c;substantially continuous&#x201d; as used in reference to the processes described herein refers to a continuous flow of materials (or solution or dispersion) between each step of the purification process to each subsequent step, starting from the beginning of the purification process up until the step of loading the ion-exchange chromatography column. For example, as bacterial cells of a dispersion contact with lysis solution in the contacting step to form a lysate solution, such lysate solution will directly flow into the next step of neutralization with the neutralization solution. These continuous transitions between steps eliminate a holding or incubating step between the purification process steps.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;biologically active molecule&#x201d; refers to a molecule or a biomolecule contained within the bacteria that is in its functional state, and, in some embodiments, particularly refers to a DNA plasmid.

Such processes enable the production of pharmaceutical grade biomolecules at large scale, e.g. production of about 1 gram or more of plasmid. Some embodiments of the invention exclude the use of any materials or processes that could prove detrimental to the large scale production or pharmaceutical products include, for example, the inclusion of enzymes, heat denaturation, mechanical separation (machines that do such separation), e.g., centrifugation apparatus, or organic or volatile solvents, e.g., isopropanol.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Cells of interest may be produced and harvested such as by routine means of fermentation and collection. It is well within the abilities of one skilled in the art to prepare sufficient quantities of the cells of interest. For example, the cells may be <i>E. coli </i>containing a high copy number plasmid of interest, and the plasmid-containing cells may be fermented to high density using batch or fed batch techniques. Methods for preparing such plasmid-containing <i>E. coli </i>cells and performing such batch or fed-batch fermentation are well known to those skilled in the art. The cells may be harvested by routine means such as centrifugation or filtration to form a cell &#xf3;aste. Such harvesting methods are well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that harvested cells or cell paste may be processed immediately, or stored in a frozen or refrigerated state for processing at a later date.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Harvested cells may be lysed using a lysis solution to release their contents, including the biologically active molecules of interest, into a lysate solution.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Generally, prior to lysing the cells, the cell paste may be used to prepare a suspension of cells containing the biologically active molecule of interest. The cells may be suspended in any suitable solution. The suspension containing the cells in suspension solution may be maintained in a tank or other storage container. Two containers may be used wherein the second container may be used to resuspend additional amount of cells while the first container is used in the lysis process. The suspension solution may in some embodiments contain a moderate concentration of buffer, a moderate concentration of a chelating agent, or both. In some embodiments, the suspension solution may comprise about 25 mM Tris-hydrochloride (&#x201c;Tris-HCl&#x201d;), and about 10 mM edetate disodium (&#x201c;Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA&#x201d;), at a pH of about 8. In some embodiments, the cell suspension may be prepared by suspending a known weight of cell paste with a known weight of suspension buffer. For example, one part cell paste may be resuspended in about 4-10 parts of buffer, in some embodiments with about 6-8 parts of buffer. In some embodiments, the optical density of the resulting cell suspension may be about 50-80 OD<sub>600 </sub>units. In some embodiments, it may be about 60-70 OD<sub>600 </sub>units.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A lysis solution preferably contains one or more lysis agents, such as an alkali, an acid, an enzyme, an organic solvent, a detergent, or a mixture thereof. However, the use of an animal derived enzymes or organic solvent is not preferred as they are detrimental to the production of pharmaceutical products. In some embodiments, the lysis solution comprises an alkali, a detergent, or a mixture thereof. Suitable alkalis include, but are not limited to, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Detergents may be nonionic, cationic, or anionic. Suitable detergents include, but are not limited to sodium dodecyl sulfate (&#x201c;SDS&#x201d;), Triton, Tween, or pluronic-type agents (block-copolymers based on ethylenoxide and propylenoxide). Selection of suitable alkali or detergent will be well within the ordinary skill of the art. In some embodiments, the lysis solution may comprise sodium hydroxide (&#x201c;NaOH&#x201d;) and SDS. In some embodiments, the concentration of NaOH may be about 0.1 to about 0.3 N, and in some embodiments, about 0.2 N. In some embodiments, the concentration of SDS may be about 0.1% to about 5%, and in some embodiments about 1%. In some embodiments, the lysis solution may be maintained in a tank or other storage container.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The cell suspension and lysis solution may be combined to lyse the cells and produce a lysate solution. In some embodiments, they are combined, mixed and maintained as a mixture for a time sufficient to facilitate high levels of lysis of cells and release of biological materials, thus forming the lysate solution.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, cell suspension and lysis solution are maintained in separate tanks and retrieved from such tanks using one or more pumps. The cell suspension and lysis solution may be brought into contact with each other using a &#x201c;Y&#x201d; connector. In some embodiments, equal volumes of cell suspension and lysis solution may be pumped at equal flow rates using a dual head pump. However, those of skill in the art will recognize that cell suspension and lysis solution of different volumes may be pumped at different rates, using individual pumps, if so desired. In some embodiment, cell suspension and lysis solution are simultaneously pumped through a dual head pump frp, from about 0.3 L/min to about 2 L/min, with the contacted fluids exiting the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; connector at a rate from about 0.6 L/min to about 4 L/min. Those of skill in the art will recognize that these flow rates can be easily increased or decreased, and tubing size increased or decreased, to meet any throughput requirement. After exiting the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; connector, the contacted cell suspension and lysis solution may be passed through a high shear, in-line mixer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The mixer may be any device that provides rapid, high shear mixing in a flow through mode (as opposed to a batch mode). In some embodiments, the mixer is a rotor/stator mixer or an emulsifier. Those of skill in the art will recognize that a variety such high shear, in-line mixers are commercially available. Use of any such mixers is well within the scope of the present invention. In some embodiments, the mixer is a Silverson L4R rotor/stator mixer fitted with a standard Emulsor screen (Silverson Machines, Inc. East Longmeadow, Mass.) and an in-line assembly. The rotor may be operated at a speed such as from about 500 rpm to about 900 rpm, 500-600 rpm, from about 500 rpm to about 700 rpm, from about 500 rpm to about 800 rpm, from about 600 rpm to about 700 rpm, from about 600 rpm to about 800 rpm, from about 600 rpm to about 900 rpm, from about 700 rpm to about 800 rpm or from about 700 rpm to about 900 rpm.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Such a mixer is suitable for processing cell suspensions of from about 0.3 L/min to about 2 L/min. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that larger scale mixers may be substituted for processing substantially greater volumes of cell suspension. Such substitution will be readily accomplished by one skilled in the art with no more than ordinary experimentation. The use of a high shear, in-line mixer facilitates the thorough and rapid mixing of the cell suspension and lysis solution, bringing the cells into intimate contact with the lysis agent(s) to achieve efficient lysis. Moreover, mixers can readily accommodate different fluid flow rates, and provide the flexibility of adjustable speed mixing for different flow rates. Materials exiting the high shear, in-line mixer may then pass through a holding coil. This coil may simply comprise a length of tubing sufficient to provide that the fluid passes through the coil for a determined time. The function of the coil is to provide sufficient contact time between the cells and the lysis agent(s) to ensure substantially complete lysis. At the same time, the coil ensures that contact time is not so long as to have negative consequences. In some embodiments, such as those in which the cells are plasmid-containing cells and the lysis solution comprises an alkali, it is desirable to ensure that exposure to alkali lasts long enough to achieve substantially complete cell lysis as well as substantially complete denaturation of proteins, genomic DNA, and other cell components. However, it is also desirable that exposure to alkali not be so prolonged as to result in substantial amounts of permanently denatured plasmid. The coil may be one complete tubing, or segmented into 2-10 tubings to allow for flexibility of fluid flow rates. The holding coil allows this contact time to be controlled. In some embodiments this contact time may be from about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes. In some embodiments this contact time may be from about 2 minutes to about 9 minutes, from about 2 minutes to about 8 minutes, from about 2 minutes to about 7 minutes, from about 2 minutes to about 6 minutes, from about 3 minutes to about 10 minutes, from about 3 minutes to about 9 minutes, from about 3 minutes to about 8 minutes, from about 3 minutes to about 7 minutes, from about 3 minutes to about 6 minutes, from about 4 minutes to about 10 minutes, from about 4 minutes to about 9 minutes, from about 4 minutes to about 8 minutes, from about 4 minutes to about 7 minutes, from about 4 minutes to about 6 minutes, from about 5 minutes to about 10 minutes, from about 5 minutes to about 9 minutes, from about 5 minutes to about 8 minutes, from about 5 minutes to about 7 minutes, or from about 5 minutes to about 6 minutes. Preferably the contact time is from about 4 minutes to about 8 minutes or from about 4 minutes to about 6 minutes. In some embodiments the contact time is about 5 minutes. In some embodiments, the length and diameter of the holding coil are such that the desired exposure time is achieved when lysed cells are flowed through at the desired rate. In some embodiments, the holding coil may be from about 10 feet in length to about 150 feet in length, from about 25 feet in length to about 100 feet in length, or from about 40 feet in length to about 60 feet in length. In some embodiments the holding coil is about 50 feet in length, and in some embodiments the holding coil is about 100 feet in length. The holding coil can have an inner diameter from about 0.5 inches to about 2 inches, and in some embodiments 0.625 inches. Also in some embodiments, the lysed cells may exit the high shear, in-line mixer and pass through the holding coil at a rate of from about 100 mL/min to about 10 L/min, from about 200 mL/min to about 8 L/min, from about 300 mL/min to about 6 L/min, from about 400 mL/min to about 4 L/min, from about 400 mL/min to about 2 L/min, or from about 600 mL/min to about 1.2 L/min. Preferably the rate through the holding coil is from about 0.6 L/min to about 10 L/min. In some preferred embodiments the rate of passage through the holding coil is about 600 mL/min and in some embodiments it is about 1200 mL/min. Adjustment of coil length and diameter can be accomplished by one skilled in the art to accommodate or adjust to the larger flow rate as biologically active molecule production is scaled-up. The lysate solution is collected from the holding coil.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The lysate solution is neutralized by combining it with a neutralizing solution (which is also referred to as a neutralizing precipitation solution) to produce a dispersion comprising neutralized lysate solution and debris. The resultant dispersion may then be maintained to facilitate separation of the neutralized lysate solution from the debris.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, lysate solution, which comprises the lysed cells, may be neutralized by mixing it with neutralizing solution in a neutralizing chamber. This neutralization of lysate solution can be facilitated by mixing in the neutralizing chamber. In some embodiments, this neutralizing can be followed by bubble mixing in a bubble column mixer.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferably, the neutralization occurs in conjunction with bubble mixing in a bubble column mixer. In some embodiments, the lysate solution exiting the holding coil may enter a bubble column mixer while simultaneously a pump may deliver a neutralization/precipitation solution from another tank into the bubble column mixer. In some examples, also simultaneously, compressed gas from another tank may be sparged into the bottom of the bubble column mixer. In some embodiments, lysate solution may enter the column at the bottom from one side, while neutralization/precipitation solution may enter at the bottom from the opposite side. Compressed gas may be sparged in through a sintered sparger designed to deliver gas bubbles substantially uniformly across the column cross section. Lysate solution, which comprises the lysed cells, and neutralization solution flow vertically up the column and exit through an outlet port on the side near the top. The passage of the gas bubbles through the vertical column of liquid serves to mix the lysate solution with the neutralization/precipitation solution. The mixing provided by the rising gas bubbles is thorough but gentle and low shear. As the neutralization/precipitation solution mixes with the lysed cells of the lysate solution, cell components precipitate from the solution. A snorkel may be provided at the top of the bubble column mixer to vent excess gas.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the lysate solution comprises plasmid-containing cells lysed with an alkali, a detergent, or a mixture thereof, and the neutralizing/precipitating solution neutralizes the alkali and precipitates host cell components such as proteins, membranes, endotoxins, and genomic DNA. In some embodiments, the alkali may be NaOH, the detergent may be SDS, and the neutralization/precipitation solution may comprise potassium acetate, ammonium acetate, or a mixture thereof. In some embodiments, the neutralization/precipitation solution may comprise an unbuffered solution containing about 1 M potassium acetate and from about 3 M to about 7 M ammonium acetate. Using such a neutralization/precipitation solution produces a suspension with a pH of from about 7 to about 8, which is preferable to an acidic pH because acidic conditions can lead to depurination of DNA. In some embodiments, the neutralization/precipitation solution may be provided in a chilled form from about 2&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The bubble column mixer provides mixing in a low shear manner and thus avoids excessive release of genomic DNA and endotoxins into the neutralized lysate solution. One skilled in the art will be able to determine suitable rates for flowing gas through the bubble column mixer. Gas flow rates may be used at about 2 standard liters per minute to about 20 standard liters per minute (&#x201c;slpm&#x201d;). Any suitable gas may be used, including, but not limited to, air, nitrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide. The gas may be filtered compressed air.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The combination of lysate solution and neutralization solution results in the generation of a dispersion containing neutralized lysate solution and debris. The neutralized lysate solution may be collected in a tank or other storage container. In some embodiments, the container is chilled to 5-10&#xb0; C. The time for the holding of neutralized lysate in the container is not mandatory, and may vary from less than 1 hour, from about 1 hour to about 12 hours, from about 12 hours to about 15 hours, or greater than 15 hours. In some embodiments, the time used is about 12 hours, while some examples involve a time of about 15 hours, while in other examples the time is &#x201c;overnight&#x201d; (defined as being greater than about 15 hours). In one embodiment, a sufficient hold period was employed to achieve substantially complete separation of the cell debris from the neutralized lysate solution, resulting the obtained crude lysate of limited solid particles advantageous for subsequent clarification process. However, the process scale is limited to the crude lysate holding tank and the process time is elongated by this hold period.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In order to achieve large scale purification of low yield plasmid product, the period for the holding of neutralized lysate may be reduced to lower than 1 hour. In some embodiments, the neutralized lysate solution may be simultaneously processed at the time it is generated, thus the holding time in the container is negligible. In some embodiments, the lysate solution is simultaneously processed by the following process after a period from about 5 minutes to about 60 minutes of collecting the lysate in the container. The reduction or elimination of lysate holding time also removes the process capacity limit by containers as the lysate is processed immediately at its generation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The neutralized lysate solution may be clarified with any approaches of solid/liquid separation, e.g. bag filtration, cartridge filtration, batch centrifugation, continuous centrifugation. Complete removal of the particles in the solution is desirable to avoid the clogging of membrane or column in the following purification processes. At the same time, the lysate may not be subjected to excessive shear that will shred genomic DNA and cause the release of genomic DNA, shredded genomic DNA, endotoxin and other contaminants to be released into the plasmid-containing solution. Batch filtration may be used for processing small volume of lysate, but impractical at large scale. Continuous centrifugation is also unsuitable because the precipitate may be subjected to high shear stress and release high level of contaminant to solution. In some embodiments a series of filtrations employing different grade of filter media can be utilized. The primary filtration can be used to remove a majority of large cell floccs range in micron sizes, while the consecutive secondary filtration retains the remaining fine particles. An optional third filtration may be conducted when a stringent clarity is desired for the following process and the secondary filtration is insufficient.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, bag and cartridge filters can be employed due to their high dirt holding capacity and minimal disturbance to solution. The filter bags or cartridge may be of any size, shape, pore size rating, configuration, and media type. The filter media is preferred to be made of materials of pharmaceutical grade or compliant with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. The filter material is also preferred to have no charge or have limited binding of the product. The particle size limit of filter materials may vary from about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to about a few hundred microns, providing that it is greater than the size of the target product that the product will not be retained by the filter media. The bag filters and cartridge filter media may be single-layered, multi-layered, pleated, or multi-pleated.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, two or more filters with similar pore size ratings may be used in parallel to accommodate process at large scale. The majority of solid particles in the lysate solution, including cell wall and membrane components, precipitates, genomic DNA, protein, lipids, lipopolysaccharides, and other contaminants, will be removed by the filtration. However, when the primary filtration is insufficient to deliver solution of desired clarity, a secondary filtration with reduced pore size or higher retention rate may be placed subsequently. In some embodiments, two or more secondary filters may be placed in parallel to accommodate process at large scale. Use of multiple filters may be required in a large scale process, and one skilled in the art will recognize that details such as the number of filters used, as well as their particle size limits, may be readily varied.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the dispersion may be collected and maintained in a settling tank to allow the debris to precipitate or float. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the dispersion may be collected as a slurry of crude cell lysate and precipitated host cell components from the bubble column mixer and maintained in a settling tank to allow the debris to precipitate or float. The dispersion may be maintained, such as being held in the settling tank, for a time sufficient to achieve substantially complete separation of the precipitated host cell components, which make up the debris, from the neutralized lysate solution. The precipitated components may rise to the surface of the dispersion, aided by the entrapped gas bubbles introduced by the bubble column mixer. In some embodiments, the dispersion may be held in the settling tank for about 6 to about 24 hours, in some embodiments from about 12 hours to about 18 hours. In some embodiments, the dispersion may be chilled to less than about 15&#xb0; C. during the holding period, in some embodiments from about 2&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C., to aid in precipitating RNA or other impurities. In some embodiments, the dispersion may be gently mixed during the holding period, such as by an impeller mixer operated at a very low rpm, preferably from about 15 rpm to about 25 rpm.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, a vacuum may be applied to the container which holds the dispersion, such as, for example, a settling tank. This aids in bringing precipitated components to the liquid surface. Furthermore, this compacts the floating flocculent precipitate/debris, aiding its subsequent removal and also allowing a greater percentage of neutralized lysate solution to be recovered in later steps. Furthermore, this removes air trapped in solution that may foul later chromatography steps. In some embodiments, the applied vacuum may be from about 15 inches of HG to about 30 inches of Hg (inHg), in some embodiments, from about 20 in Hg to about 30 inHg, and in some embodiments, from about 25 in Hg to aobut 30 inHg. In some embodiments, the vacuum may be maintained throughout this holding period. Vacuum may be applied using a vacuum pump, or any other available vacuum or negative pressure device available. In some embodiments, prior to beginning solid/liquid separation, any vacuum applied to the tank is carefully released. Crude cell lysate, i.e., neutralized lysate solution, is then collected from the tank using a pump and passed through a depth filter and a final filter, and then collected in a holding tank. In some embodiments, the settling tank is fitted with a sight glass, allowing an operator to observe the position of the liquid level and the compacted precipitated host cell components. Pumping of material from the tank is monitored visually, and halted before the precipitated host cell components enter the line. This prevents clogging of the subsequent filters. No bag filtration (or cartridge filtration) or centrifugation is required. Further, disturbance of the debris is thus minimizing release of components such as genomic DNA or endotoxins into the neutralized lysate solution. After the neutralized lysate solution is pumped from the settling tank, it may be passed through one or more filters to remove fine particulates. In some embodiments, about one to about three filters may be used in series, with the first filter removing larger particles, and subsequent filters removing successively smaller particles. In some embodiments, two filters may be used in series. In some embodiments, the first filter is a pre-filtering depth filter with a particle size limit from about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 15 &#x3bc;m, preferably from about 7.5 &#x3bc;m to about 12 or more preferably from about 9 &#x3bc;m to about 11 In some embodiments the pre-filtering depth filter has a particle size limit of about 10 The second filter is preferably a membrane filter with a cut-off of from about 0.01 &#x3bc;m to about 0.25 or preferably from about 0.05 &#x3bc;m to about 0.15 &#x3bc;m. In some embodiments the membrane filter has a cut-off of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that details such as the number of filters used, as well as their particle size limits, may be readily varied.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A large selection of filters is commercially available from different vendors. One particular type is 720 series pleated cartridge filters (CPI filters, Houston, Tex.), which demonstrated a large dirt holding ability and superior processing capacity. High efficiency multi-layer filter bags such as 300 series and 500 series (Knight Corporation, Houston, Tex.) have showed considerable retention to fine particles. PROGAF&#x2032; filter bags (Eaton Filtration, Cleveland, Ohio) with progressive density design of up to 12 layers of media may deliver high efficiency in the removal of particles with a variety of sizes. In some embodiments, a combination of pleated cartridge filtration followed by multilayer or pleated cartridge filtration may deliver best performance for the clarification of particles in the neutralized lysate solution.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The cartridge filters or bag filters are preferred to be assembled in the filter housings or filter vessels for the ease of operation and higher process capacity. The vessel material may be type 304 or 316 stainless steel, or carbon steel, while all plastic housing with a choice of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), polyester plastic (PPL) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) construction may be advantageous for ultra-pure or corrosive applications. The filter vessels may be custom-designed or readily available from several manufacturers. For example, Eaton Filtration (Cleveland, Ohio) provides a wide selection of housings/vessels designed to meet any demanding applications, such as TOPLINE, SIDELINE, DUOLINE, MODULINE, POLYLINE, FLOWLINE, ECOLINE, MAXILINE series. One skilled in the art will be able to determine the construct and features of filter housing to accommodate the process requirements.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Optionally, an additional depth filter or membrane filter may be implemented after the secondary filtration. The filter is preferred to have a cut-off of from about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to about 0.2 &#x3bc;m for further removal of fine particles in the neutralized lysate solution. Cartridge filters, such as Vangard PP and Alpha PP from Meissner (Camarillo, Calif.), Clarigard from Millipore (Billerica, Mass.), HP and PreFlow from Pall (East Hills, N.Y.), may be contemplated as disposable or with the aid of housings. However, most of these cartridge filters are limited by their process capacity, especially in the disposable formats. Preferable is the use of disposable components which may offer scalable format to accommodate applications at large scale. Millipore (Billerica, Mass.) has developed a high-performance disposable depth filter system, Millistak+Pod, for the applications in either the lab or process-scale. The filter media in the pod filters is composed of select grade cellulose fiber and diatomaceous earth, and is demonstrated to have large contaminant holding and superior retention. The stacked disc design of pod format aid by the stainless holder enabled large surface area filtration in tight spaces. One skilled in the art may determine the media grade and membrane area of the Pod filter to meet specific operation needs. The clarified neutralized lysate solution, which contains the biologically active molecules of interest, can then be subjected to ion exchange chromatography, including column chromatography or membrane based. Preferably, a membrane-based approach may be used, such as anion exchange membrane chromatography. For example, the neutralized lysate solution can be applied to an ion exchange membrane. According to some embodiments, the biologically active molecule of interest may contacted with a membrane whereby the biologically active molecule of interest may bind to the membrane, while impurities flow through or are washed off of the membrane, thus separating the biologically active molecule of interest from the impurities. Alternatively, the biologically active molecule of interest may flow through the membrane, while impurities are retained. In some embodiments, the biologically active molecule of interest binds to the membrane and, after washing to remove weakly bound impurities, the biologically active molecule of interest is eluted from the membrane. The elution may be accomplished by flowing a salt solution through the membrane. The salt solution has a strength, concentration, or conductivity sufficient to overcome the binding of the biologically active molecule of interest to the membrane. The biologically active molecule of interest is thus recovered in the ion exchange eluate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although any ion exchange membrane may be suitable, in some embodiments an anion exchange membrane such as a strong anion exchange membrane, comprising quaternary amine groups, may be used. Examples of such membranes include, but may not be limited to the Mustang Q (Pall Corporation, East Hills, N.Y.), Sartobind Q (Sartorius, Edgewood, N.Y.), and Intercept Q (Millipore Corporate, Billerica, Mass.).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, plasmid-containing cells are lysed and neutralized to produce a neutralized lysate solution that may be processed by anion exchange membrane purification that comprises purification using a Pall Mustang Q cartridge (Pall Corporation, East Hills, N.Y.). In some embodiments, the neutralized lysate solution may be adjusted to a conductivity of about less than 95 mS/cm, or about 85 mS/cm, by dilution with a suitable amount of purified water. The conductivity may be adjusted to from about 80 mS/cm to about 85 mS/cm in some embodiments. Purified water equal to about 1.5-times the lysate volume can be used for dilution to achieve the desired conductivity. The Mustang&#xae; Q cartridge may be conditioned by flowing a suitable salt solution through it. In some embodiments, the solution may comprise from about 0.5 M sodium chloride to about 1.0 M sodium chloride (&#x201c;NaCl&#x201d;) and in some other embodiments 0.67 M NaCl. The equilibration solution may also include a buffering agent, a chelating agent, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, this equilibration/wash solution may comprise, in addition to 0.67 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, with a pH of 8. In some embodiments, equilibration/wash solution may be pumped through the cartridge at about 800 mL/min to about 1500 mL/min. Diluted neutralized lysate solution may be pumped onto the cartridge, in some embodiments at less than about 4800 mL/min, in some embodiments at from about 2000 mL/min to about 20,000 mL/min. The loaded cartridge may be washed with equilibration/wash buffer, preferably at a flow rate from about 800 mL/min to about 1500 mL/min. Washing may in some embodiments be continued until the absorbance at 260 nm (A<sub>260</sub>) of the effluent returns to approximately baseline. Plasmid may be eluted with a solution that comprises 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, and pH 8. Elution may in some embodiments be performed at a flow rate of from about 500 mL/min to aobut 9000 mL/min, from about 500 mL/min to about 8000 mL/min, from about 500 mL/min to about 7000 mL/min, from about 500 mL/min to aobut 6000 mL/min, from about 500 mL/min to about 5000 mL/min, from about 500 mL/min to about 4000 mL/min, from about 500 mL/min to about 3000 mL/min, from about 500 mL/min to about 2000 mL/min, from about 600 mL/min to about 5000 mL/min, from about 600 mL/min to about 4000 mL/min, from about 600 mL/min to about 3000 mL/min, from about 600 mL/min to about 2000 mL/min, or from about 600 mL/min to about 1500 mL/min.

Plasmid A has a size of 6549 bp. The plasmid typically replicates at a low copy number of &#x2dc;250 copies/cell. Approximately 3.1 kg wet cell weight (&#x201c;WCW&#x201d;) of cell paste was suspended in a resuspension buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris-hydrochloride (&#x201c;Tris-HCl&#x201d;, J. T.

Excess air was vented through the top of the column. As the lysate solution and neutralization/precipitation solutions passed through the column, they were continuously mixed by the gentle turbulence of the rising bubbles.

The plasmid-containing liquor (neutralized lysate solution) was carefully pumped from the tank through a sanitary fitting at the bottom. The liquid and precipitate levels in the tank were continuously monitored, and pumping was halted in time to ensure that the precipitate did not exit the tank. This was subjected to a 10 &#x3bc;m depth filtration, followed by 0.1 &#x3bc;m final filtration. A portion of the neutralized lysate solution was lost during filtration, due to clogging of the filters. As a result, approximately 69 L of cleared neutralized lysate solution was obtained.

The column was stripped with sterile water for injection (&#x201c;WFI&#x201d;, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Ill.) to remove bound contaminants including RNA and endotoxin, and was regenerated for repeatable use. The eluate achieved approx. 870 mg of plasmid with the yield of 95%, while the supercoiled percentage of plasmid was enriched from 66% after Q to more than 80% after the butyl column step.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The eluate from butyl HIC was concentrated and desalted by ultrafiltration/diafiltration (&#x201c;UF/DF&#x201d;), using a Pall Centramate&#x2122; cassette holder fitted with one Pall Omega suspended screen membrane cassettes (Pall Corporation, East Hills, N.Y.), with an area of 1 ft<sup>2 </sup>and a nominal molecular weight cut-off of 50 kDa. A volume of 41.2 mL of bulk retentate was recovered, with a DNA concentration of 9.026 mg/mL (by A<sub>260</sub>). First wash of WFI for the UF/DF rig yielded 46.9 mL with the concentration of 1.6 mg/mL. Second wash of WFI yielded 65.8 mL with the concentration of 0.268 mg/mL. Combined DNA recovery after UF was approximately 47 6 mg with the yield of 55%. The final supercoiled percentage of plasmid achieved was more than 87% after UF.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Samples from EXAMPLE 1 were subjected to analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, which is displayed as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The resuspended cells were mixed with the lysis solution consisting of 0.2 N NaOH (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) and 1% SDS (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) at an equal flow rate of 300 mL/min by a Silverson Model L4R rotor/stator mixer, which was operated at a rotor speed of 800 rpm. The lysate effluent from mixer retained 5-minute holding time in the holding coil before entering the bubble column to mix with the pre-chilled (4-5&#xb0; C.) neutralization/precipitation (NP) solution. The NP solution containing 1 M potassium acetate (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) and 3 M ammonium acetate (EMD Chemicals, Inc., Bibbstown, N.J.) was fed to the bubble column mixer at 600 mL/min, simultaneously, the compressed air was introduced from the bottom sparger at a flow rate of 3-5 slpm.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The neutralized cell lysate was first received by a woven mesh bag of 200-400 &#x3bc;m hanging below the outlet port of the bubble column. Large cell flocculent was retained in the bag, whereas the crude lysate solution containing the plasmid DNA and reduced cell debris was collected in the pre-chilled (5&#xb0; C.) settling tank. Simultaneously, the generated crude lysate was pumped to a 48 &#x3bc;m pleated cartridge filter (CPI filters, Houston, Tex.) fitted in an ECOLINE filter vessel (Eaton Filtration, Iselin, N.J.) at a flow rate of 2 L/min. The primary filtered lysate was collected in a container with a total volume of 75 L recovered. A second filtration was performed afterwards. The primary filtered lysate was pumped to a 523 multi-layer bag filter (Knight Corporation, Barrington, Ill.) fitted in an ECOLINE filter vessel (Eaton Filtration, Iselin, N.J.) at a flow rate of 2 L/min. The recovered solution was collected in a container with total volume of 65 L recovered. Finally, a depth filtration was conducted with Millistak Pod disposable depth filter system (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.). The filter media had a pore size distribution of 0.2-2.5 &#x3bc;m. A Pod filter with the membrane area of 0.11 m<sup>2 </sup>was used to clarify the secondary filtered lysate at a flow rate of 0.5 L/min. A volume of 60 L final clarified lysate was achieved, which demonstrated a high clarity of NTU value lower than 2.

A wet cell weight of 24.4 kg cells were recovered from 400-L working volume of fermentation. The cells were resuspended with 171 L of resuspension buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris-HCl (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) at the pH of 8 and 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA (Mallinckrodt Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) for a period of 3 hours. The resuspended cells were mixed with fresh lysis solution by Silverson high shear mixer at the same flow rate of 600 ml/min, and held for approximately 5 min accomplished by a holding loop. The neutralization/precipitation solution consisting of 1 M potassium acetate (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) and 3 M ammonium acetate (EMD Chemicals, Inc., Bibbstown, N.J.) were pumped to the bubble mixer at a flow rate of 1.2 L/min to mix with lysed cells. Compressed air fed at a gas flow rate of 5-6 slpm served as the mixing force and transporting the neutralized lysate to a collecting tank. An approximate period of 5 hour was used for the lysis process. The neutralized cells exiting the bubble mixing device were diverted to a collecting tank and subject to following filtration continuously.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The neutralized crude lysate was processed with three sequential filtrations upon its generation and these clarification processes were operated simultaneously with the lysis process. The initial filtration was performed by pumping the crude lysate containing cell flocculents into a TOPLINE filter vessel (Eaton Filtration, Iselin, N.J.) fitted with a 48 &#x3bc;m pleated cartridge filter (CPI filters, Houston, Tex.) at a flow rate of 2.4 L/min. The primary filtration was employed to remove the majority of large particles such as cell floccs, and a pleated membrane offers more filtration area, thus higher flow rate and larger process capacity than a single layer or multi-layer construct. Four pleated cartridges were used to process a volume of 680 L neutralized crude lysate containing cell floccs, while recovered primary filtered lysate was estimated at 600 L. The solution exiting the 48 &#x3bc;m pleated cartridge filter was directly pumped to a secondary ECOLINE filter vessel (Eaton Filtration, Iselin, N.J.) fitted with a 1 &#x3bc;m multi-layer cartridge filter (CPI filters, Houston, Tex.) at a flow rate of 2.4 L/min. This step removed a majority of small particles ranged between 1 &#x3bc;m and 50 &#x3bc;m in the secondary filtered lysate. The subsequent Mustang Q has a pore size equivalent to 0.2 &#x3bc;m, and thus a third depth filtration by a filter with the absolute based pore size of 0.2 &#x3bc;m or lower was performed. The depth filter Millitak+Pod filter system is able to achieve both large process volume and a high retention to fine particles. The Millistak C0HC filter (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.) fitted in a stainless steel Pod holder was used to reduce the turbidity of lysate to 2 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU). A membrane area of 1.1 m<sup>2 </sup>C0HC filter processed a volume of 400 L secondary filtered lysate.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The filtered lysate exiting Millistak filter was collected in a container.

The mixture was flowed into a Kenics in-line mixer leading into another holding tank. The conductivity of such diluted lysate in the holding tank had a range of 90-95 mS/cm. A volume of 400 L diluted lysate was loaded to a 10 inch Mustang Q (Pall, East Hills, N.Y.) which had a bed volume of 260 ml. The Q capsule was saturated before 200 L of Q load. An approximate 3 g of plasmid DNA was recovered in the Q eluate.
