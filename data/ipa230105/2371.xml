It is estimated that about 2 million TB patients die each year globally. The treatment of drug-susceptible TB currently centers on four antibiotics, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide which were introduced more than 40 years ago (Franz 2017). Failure to properly treat tuberculosis has caused global drug resistance in Mtb and thus rendering some medications ineffective. A need exists in the art, therefore, to identify new chemical entities to treat TB.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0004">The present invention is directed to compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II):</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="62.99mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230002372A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">wherein:<br/>R<sub>1 </sub>is hydrogen or lower alkyl;<br/>R<sub>2 </sub>is hydrogen, lower alkyl, halo, cyano, trifluoromethyl, halo-lower alkyl, di-halo-lower alkyl, alkoxy, or carboxamide;<br/>R<sub>3 </sub>is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, halo, cyano, trifluoromethyl, halo-lower alkyl, di-halo-lower alkyl, alkoxy, or carboxamide;<br/>R<sub>4 </sub>is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, halo, cyano, trifluoromethyl, halo-lower alkyl, di-halo-lower alkyl, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, or carboxamide;<br/>R<sub>5 </sub>is: lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylene or &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>-cycloalkyl, spiral(C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>11</sub>)cycloalkyl, phenyl, a bridged cycloalkyl or</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="11.09mm" wi="17.78mm" file="US20230002372A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0012" num="0000">wherein m is 1, 2 or 3 and n is 1, 2, 3, or 4; or</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-C00005" he="10.67mm" wi="28.36mm" file="US20230002372A1-20230105-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0014" num="0000">wherein m is 1 or 2;<br/>or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0005">The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing the above compounds and to methods of treating microbial infections such as tuberculosis.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0006">It is to be understood that the terminology employed herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments, and is not intended to be limiting.

For example, (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkyl means an alkyl in which the branched or straight-chain monovalent saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical has one to 6 carbon atoms. As would be readily understood from the disclosure provided herein, all substitution definitions apply equally to these structures. For example, (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkyl may be substituted in the same manner an alkyl is substituted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0023">By any range disclosed herein, it is meant that all integer unit amounts within the range are specifically disclosed as part of the invention. Thus, for example, 1 to 12 units means that 1, 2, 3 . . . 12 units are included as embodiments of this invention.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0024">Compounds of formula I can have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and can exist in the form of optically pure enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers such as, for example, racemates, optically pure diastereoisomers, mixtures of diastereoisomers, diastereoisomeric racemates or mixtures of diastereoisomeric racemates. The optically active forms can be obtained for example by resolution of the racemates, by asymmetric synthesis or asymmetric chromatography (chromatography with a chiral adsorbents or eluant). The invention embraces all of these forms.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0025">In the practice of the method of the present invention, an effective amount of any one of the compounds of this invention, or a combination of any of the compounds of this invention, is administered via any of the usual and acceptable methods known in the art, either singly or in combination. The compounds or compositions can thus be administered, for example, ocularly, orally (e.g., buccal cavity), sublingually, parenterally (e.g., intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously), rectally (e.g., by suppositories or washings), transdermally (e.g., skin electroporation) or by inhalation (e.g., by aerosol), and in the form or solid, liquid or gaseous dosages, including tablets and suspensions. The administration can be conducted in a single unit dosage form with continuous therapy or in a single dose therapy ad libitum. The therapeutic composition can also be in the form of an oil emulsion or dispersion in conjunction with a lipophilic salt such as pamoic acid, or in the form of a biodegradable sustained-release composition for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0026">Useful pharmaceutical carriers for the preparation of the compositions hereof, can be solids, liquids or gases. Thus, the compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, suppositories, powders, enterically coated or other protected formulations (e.g. binding on ion-exchange resins or packaging in lipid-protein vesicles), sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, and the like. The carrier can be selected from the various oils including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are representative liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic with the blood) for injectable solutions. For example, formulations for intravenous administration comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient(s) which are prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient(s) in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering the solution sterile. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, talc, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical additives such as preservatives, stabilizing agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, salts for adjusting osmotic pressure, buffers and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulation are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will, in any event, contain an effective amount of the active compound together with a suitable carrier so as to prepare the proper dosage form for proper administration to the recipient.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0027">The dose of a compound of the present invention depends on a number of factors, such as, for example, the manner of administration, the age and the body weight of the subject, and the condition of the subject to be treated, and ultimately will be decided by the attending physician or veterinarian. Such an amount of the active compound as determined by the attending physician or veterinarian is referred to herein, and in the claims, as a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d;. For example, the dose of a compound of the present invention is typically in the range of about 1 to about 1000 mg per day. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount is in an amount of from about 10 mg to about 500 mg per day.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0028">It will be appreciated that the compounds of the invention may be derivatized at functional groups to provide derivatives which are capable of conversion back to the parent compound in vivo.
