These RF communications may be transmitted to, or received from, any number of different external targets, endpoints, wireless network nodes, or systems. As an example, RF communications can be sent and received by walkie-talkies, cell phones, vehicles, airplanes, rotary aircraft, ships, satellites, and so on.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">RF communications have advanced significantly in recent years. Now, more than ever before, devices with RF capabilities are able to establish (in many cases even simultaneously) different RF communication links with external transmitters and receivers. Such advancements have substantially improved the quality of life. Because of the benefits provided by RF communications, more and more RF components (e.g., RF front-end components and RF back-end components) are being installed into electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the proliferation of wireless RF communications, there is a substantial need to continuously improve such communications, especially in scenarios where signal interference may occur. Such interference may be intentional or unintentional interference. For example, with respect to intentional interference, broadband jammers and narrowband jammers (e.g., a tone generator) may be used by adversarial entities to attempt to prevent communications. With respect to unintentional interference, interference from other users/terminals, cross-polarization leakage, hardware issues, adjacent satellite interference, co-site interference, electromagnetic radiation, or other interferers may inadvertently interfere with desired communication.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hopping waveforms are traditionally used to overcome interference by rapidly changing the signal frequency to attempt to avoid, or at least mitigate, interference. Further, various interferer excision techniques can be used to remove broadband and narrowband interference. However, when these two techniques are used together, various problems can arise. For example, in some environments, using excision results in degradation to the hopping signal of interest as notching tools view the hopping signal of interest as interference. The mischaracterization and attack of the signal of interest would result in data loss. Further, in modern systems where most of the data is Ethernet data packets, or similar data, a small amount of data loss can be catastrophic as the data would either be lost or have to be retransmitted. Retransmission results in lower data throughput. Further, Traditional interference cancelation tools are not fast enough to remove jammers for hopping waveforms.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one exemplary technology area where some embodiments described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment illustrated herein includes a method of suppressing interference in a frequency hopping signal. The method includes receiving a frequency hopping signal for a signal of interest. The frequency hopping signal includes the signal of interest modulated using frequency hopping and wideband and narrowband interference. Prior to de-hopping the frequency hopping signal, one or more wideband interferences in the frequency hopping signal are identified. The one or more wideband interferences are suppressed to create a wideband interference suppressed signal. Subsequent to suppressing the one or more wideband interferences, the wideband interference suppressed signal is de-hopped to create a de-hopped signal. In the de-hopped signal, one or more narrowband interferences are identified. The one or more narrowband interferences are suppressed to create an interference suppressed signal. The interference suppressed signal is demodulated to create a demodulated signal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

This allows the effective data transmission rate to be higher as the impacts of interference are reduced due to the removal of wideband and narrowband interference.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The implementation of the suppression only adds a minor time delay to the data transfer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The speed of the narrowband suppression allows for the removal of interference during each hop bin.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, the disclosed embodiments beneficially classify signals and finely estimate signal parameters such that interference can be removed through demodulation, re-modulation, and subtraction (e.g., active cancellation). Accordingly, these and numerous other benefits will now be described below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E</figref>, an example is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a transmitter <b>102</b> and a receiver <b>104</b>. The transmitter <b>102</b> is configured to transmit, using various hardware such as modulators, antennas, etc., an input signal <b>106</b> to the receiver <b>104</b>. As alluded to above, the transmitter <b>102</b> will send the input signal <b>106</b> by modulating the input signal <b>106</b> into a frequency hopping signal <b>108</b> to attain benefits of so doing as discussed previously above. In particular, the transmitter <b>102</b> will perform forward error correction coding at a forward error correction coding processor <b>110</b> on the input signal <b>106</b> to allow error correction to be performed at the receiver <b>104</b>. The encoded input signal is then provided to a hopping processor <b>112</b>. The hopping processor splits the forward error correction encoded input signal into various hop bins to create the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b> for the input signal. Note that the elements of the hopping signal <b>108</b> are sometimes referred to herein as the signal of interest, particularly when referred to in connection with injected interference and in connection with operations to suppress said interference. That is, the signal of interest refers to the various hop bins and data in the hopping signal <b>108</b> irrespective of the temporal order in which that data is received.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, additional details are illustrated regarding the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b>. The frequency hopping signal <b>108</b> includes various frequency SOI hop bins <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b>. The reference numbers are selected to indicate frequency hop order. Thus, for example, the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b> hops from frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> to frequency SOI hop bin <b>2</b> to frequency SOI hop bin <b>3</b> to frequency SOI hop bin <b>4</b> to frequency SOI hop bin <b>5</b>, and so forth. The hop bins as illustrated herein represent spectral bandwidth within the overall bandwidth allocated for the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b> is transmitted by the transmitter <b>102</b> through a channel <b>116</b>. The channel <b>116</b> may be an over the air channel or other appropriate channel. For example, the transmitter <b>102</b> will cause electromagnetic radiation to radiate through the channel <b>116</b>. The channel <b>116</b> is subject to a plurality of interferers <b>118</b>. The interferers may take many forms. For example, in some embodiments, some of the interferers <b>118</b> may be intentional interferers such as jammers attempting to disrupt communication between the transmitter <b>102</b> and the receiver <b>104</b>. These intentional interferers may attempt to interfere with communications in a number of different ways. For example, in some embodiments, the interferers may attempt to inject wideband interference into the channel <b>116</b> to interfere with the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b>. Wideband interference may span portions of one or more frequency hop bins and is often characterized by certain traits. For example, the interference may have a particular modulation type. Alternatively or additionally, the interference may have a particular center frequency. Alternatively or additionally, the interference may have a particular symbol rate. Wideband interference may be co-channel interference including continuous wave (CW) tones and modulated signals.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another type of intentional interference injected by interferers into the channel <b>116</b> includes narrowband interference. Narrowband interference is often characterized by signals that follow or are otherwise present in many hops, and which occupy less than half the bandwidth of any hop. Narrowband interference may comprise modulated signals, FM signals, static CW tones, multi-tones, swept tones, and hopped tones that consume, in some embodiments, up to 10% of the signal of interest bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Other non-intentional interference may also be injected into the channel <b>116</b>. This nonintentional interference may be for example interference from other users/terminals, cross-polarization leakage, hardware issues, adjacent satellite interference, co-site interference, electromagnetic radiation, or other interferers may inadvertently interfere with desired communication.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In any case, the intentional and nonintentional interference injected into the channel <b>116</b> interferes with the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b> to cause an interfered frequency hopping to signal <b>120</b> to be input from the channel <b>116</b> into the receiver <b>104</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, the receiver <b>104</b> has a specialized modem configured to suppress the interference.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, additional details regarding the interfered frequency hopping signal are illustrated. In particular, the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> is shown as including the frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. However, the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> also includes interference that has been added to the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b>, and wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. Further, the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> includes narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, and narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>3</b>. In particular, the wideband interferers from among the interferers <b>118</b> inject the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. Narrowband interferers from the interferers <b>118</b> inject the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>124</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As this interference can prevent data in the input signal <b>106</b> from being recovered and/or cause delays in transmission of data in the input signal <b>106</b>, the receiver <b>104</b> includes functionality in a modem at the receiver <b>104</b> for mitigating the injected interference. As alluded to previously, this is performed in a two-step suppression of interference where wideband interference is suppressed prior to de-hopping the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> and narrowband interference is suppressed after de-hopping is performed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In particular, the wideband interference processor <b>126</b> of the receiver <b>104</b> receives the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b>. The wideband interference processor <b>126</b> then performs various actions to suppress the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> in the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b>. This may be accomplished in various fashions. For example, when the wideband interference is structured interference, structured interference suppression may be performed. In particular, structured interference is interference that has one or more identifiable traits including at least one of modulation type, center frequency, frequency bandwidth, or symbol rate.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> one example embodiment of the wideband interference processor <b>126</b> is illustrated. In this example, the wideband interference processor <b>126</b> includes a trait estimator <b>128</b> that receives as input the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b>. The trait estimator <b>128</b> includes various hardware and processing tools including various filters, frequency analysis hardware, wave form analysis hardware, demodulators, etc. that can perform various operations on the interfered frequency hopping signal to attempt to identify traits of the wideband interference integrated into the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b>. Thus, the trait estimator <b>128</b> outputs traits <b>130</b> of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. As discussed previously, these traits may include modulation type, center frequency, and symbol rate for the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, the wideband interference processor may include various filters to attempt to filter out portions of the signal of interest from the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> to isolate at least a portion of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. Using this isolated portion of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>, the wideband interference processor <b>126</b> can then attempt to identify various traits of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With respect to modulation type, various modulation types can be identified. For example, the wideband interference may have been modulated using BPSK, QPSK, offset QPSK, 8PSK, QAM, etc. In some embodiments, the trait estimator <b>128</b> includes various corresponding demodulators to attempt to demodulate the isolated portions of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. A successful demodulation identifies the modulation used to encode the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With respect to center frequency, the trait estimator <b>128</b> includes various spectral analysis tools that can be used to identify the frequency of constituent signals making up the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. This frequency analysis can be used to identify center frequencies for the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With respect to bit rate, the trait estimator <b>128</b> may include various phase locked loops or other timing hardware that is configured to identify symbol boundaries in the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> so as to identify symbol rate of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the traits <b>130</b> identified by the trait estimator <b>128</b> can be provided to a demodulator <b>132</b>. The interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> is also provided to the demodulator <b>132</b>. The demodulator <b>132</b> attempts to demodulate the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> which produces demodulated wideband interference <b>134</b>. Note that this demodulation process will serve to remove all or most of the portions of the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> that contain signal of interest elements. The wideband interference processor further includes a re-modulator <b>136</b> which re-modulates the demodulated wideband interference to produce an estimate <b>138</b> of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> further illustrates an adder <b>140</b> which is able to combine signal elements either constructively or destructively. In this example, the estimate <b>138</b> is added destructively to the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> to essentially remove, or at least suppress, all or portions of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a wideband interference suppressed signal <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, a more detailed illustration of the wideband interference suppressed signal <b>142</b> is illustrated. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, major portions of the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> have been removed. Note that in some embodiments it is ill-advised to completely remove all of, or just the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> as this can cause sharp transitions within hop bins resulting in high-frequency anomalies that are deleterious to accomplishing communications. Rather, certain wave shaping can be performed to prevent sharp frequency transitions. Thus, as noted previously, the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> are suppressed in the wideband interference suppressed signal <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Note that in some embodiments, the wideband interference processor <b>126</b> may be channel limited in that it is only able to remove a certain number of interferences. For example, in some embodiments, only five distinct interferences can be removed. In some embodiments, the wideband interference processor <b>126</b> identifies interferences by identifying high power (either average or total) portions of the interfered frequency hopping signal <b>120</b> to identify the interferences. Thus, in some such example, a certain number of the easiest to extract interference signals can be removed. In some situations, this may be signals with the highest overall power across a spectrum, highest peak power in a particular spectral component, or based on some other characteristics.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a de-hopping processor <b>144</b>. The de-hopping processor <b>144</b> is configured to de-hop the wideband interference suppressed signal <b>142</b>. In particular, the wideband interference suppressed signal <b>142</b> is provided from the wideband interference processor <b>126</b> to the de-hopping processor <b>144</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the de-hopping processor <b>144</b> will order the various frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b> in an appropriate order based on their frequencies. A conventional de-hopping processor may be used to implement the de-hopping processor <b>144</b>. The output of the de-hopping processor <b>144</b> is a de-hopped signal <b>146</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, the de-hopped signal <b>146</b> nonetheless still includes the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>124</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To compensate for this narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>124</b>-<b>3</b>, the receiver <b>104</b> includes a narrowband interference processor <b>148</b>. The narrowband interference processor <b>148</b> suppresses the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>124</b>-<b>3</b>. This can be accomplished in a number of different ways. An example of one way that this can be accomplished is illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> which illustrates one example of the narrowband interference processor <b>148</b>. The narrowband interference processor <b>148</b> receives as input the de-hopped signal <b>146</b>. The de-hopped signal is provided to an averaging processor <b>150</b>. The averaging processor <b>150</b> identifies power averages <b>152</b> of the various frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b>. This can be accomplished using various hardware integrators and/or other hardware items to identify average power in each of the frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b>. The de-hopped signal <b>146</b> is further provided to a spectrum analyzer <b>154</b>. The spectrum analyzer analyzes the frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b> to identify frequency anomalies in the frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b>. For example, the spectrum analyzer may be able to identify high power components at certain frequencies with respect to the average power identified by the averaging processor <b>150</b>. In particular the spectrum analyzer will identify frequency bins <b>156</b> corresponding to the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>124</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> further illustrates a suppressor <b>158</b>. The suppressor <b>158</b> receives as input the power averages <b>152</b> and the frequency bins <b>156</b>. The suppressor can then use the frequency bins <b>156</b> to identify anomalies in the frequency SOI hop bin <b>1</b> through SOI hop bin <b>10</b> to identify frequencies of the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>3</b>. The suppressor <b>158</b> can then remove all or portions of the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>124</b>-<b>3</b> to produce an interference suppressed signal <b>160</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>. Note that in many embodiments, the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>3</b> is not removed completely so as to avoid creating high frequency artifacts in the interference suppressed frequency hop signal <b>160</b>. Instead, certain wave shaping techniques are performed to smooth frequency transitions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that narrowband interference removal is typically not channel limited, meaning that any instances of narrowband interference can be suppressed. Further, narrowband interference suppression can be used to remove multi-tone signals as well. Further, due to the speed at which narrowband interference is able to be suppressed, embodiments can further be configured to address moving signals, such as sweeping signals, hopping interferences, etc.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Observation of the interference suppressed signal <b>160</b> shows that certain differences caused by suppressing the wideband interference <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> in the narrowband interference <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>124</b>-<b>3</b> exist between the interference suppressed signal <b>160</b> and the frequency hopping signal <b>108</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, embodiments may include functionality for addressing these differences to reproduce the input signal <b>106</b> without errors or with a reduced number of errors. This can be done for example using forward error correction decoding by a forward error correction decoder <b>162</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In particular, the interference suppressed signal <b>160</b> is provided to a demodulator <b>164</b> which demodulates the interference suppressed signal <b>160</b> to attempt to obtain the symbols in the input signal <b>106</b>. In particular, a bitstream or symbol stream is created by the demodulator <b>164</b>. This bitstream or symbol stream is provided to the FEC decoder <b>162</b> which will perform forward error correction decoding according to the forward error correction coding scheme implemented by the forward error correction coding processor <b>110</b>. The output of the forward error correction decoder is an output signal <b>164</b> that ideally is the same as the signal of interest input signal <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The following discussion now refers to a number of methods and method acts that may be performed. Although the method acts may be discussed in a certain order or illustrated in a flow chart as occurring in a particular order, no particular ordering is required unless specifically stated, or required because an act is dependent on another act being completed prior to the act being performed.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a method <b>500</b> is illustrated. The method includes acts for suppressing interference in a frequency hopping signal. The method includes receiving a frequency hopping signal for a signal of interest (act <b>502</b>). The frequency hopping signal includes the signal of interest modulated using frequency hopping and wideband and narrowband interference.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The method <b>500</b> further includes, prior to de-hopping the frequency hopping signal, identifying one or more wideband interferences in the frequency hopping signal (act <b>504</b>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The method <b>500</b> further includes suppressing the one or more wideband interferences to create a wideband interference suppressed signal (act <b>506</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The method <b>500</b> further includes, subsequent to suppressing the one or more wideband interferences, de-hopping the wideband interference suppressed signal to create a de-hopped signal (act <b>508</b>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The method <b>500</b> further includes, in the de-hopped signal, identifying one or more narrowband interferences (act <b>510</b>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The method <b>500</b> further includes suppressing the one or more narrowband interferences to create an interference suppressed signal (act <b>512</b>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The method <b>500</b> further includes demodulating the interference suppressed signal to create a demodulated signal (act <b>514</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The method <b>500</b> may further include performing forward error correction decoding on the demodulated signal to correct for signal degradation caused by suppressing at least one of wideband interference and narrowband interference.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The method <b>500</b> may be practiced where suppressing the one or more wideband interferences comprises performing structured interference suppression. Structured interference is interference that has identifiable traits, including one or more of modulation type, center frequency, frequency bandwidth, or symbol rate. For example, in some such embodiments, the structured interference suppression comprises overlapping signal separation and cancellation. One type of overlapping signal separation and cancellation is successive interference cancellation whereby a receiver decodes a strongest signal first, subtracts it from the combined signal, and then decodes the difference. However, embodiments may also be implemented where interference is weaker than the signal of interest such that embodiments decodes a weaker signal, subtracts it from the combined signal, and then decodes the difference. In some structured interference suppression embodiments, the structured interference suppression comprises: identifying modulation type (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, offset QPSK, 8PSK, QAM, etc.) for the one or more wideband interferences; identifying center frequency for the one or more wideband interferences; identifying symbol rate for the one or more wideband interferences; using the identified modulation type, center frequency, and symbol rate, demodulating the frequency hopping signal to remove at least a portion of the signal of interest and to create one or more demodulated wideband interferences; remodulating the one or more demodulated wideband interferences to create an approximation of the wideband interferences in the frequency hopping signal; and subtracting the approximation of the wideband interferences from the frequency hopping signal to create a wideband interference suppressed frequency hopping signal.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The method <b>500</b> may be practiced where suppressing the one or more wideband interferences comprises performing unstructured interference suppression. Unstructured interference is interference that does not have an identifiable modulation type, center frequency, frequency bandwidth, or symbol rate. For example, white noise could properly be classified as unstructured interference.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The method <b>500</b> may be practiced where suppressing the one or more narrowband interferences comprises: averaging signal power in hop bins of the de-hopped signal; performing spectral analysis to identify frequency bins in the de-hopped signal that have signal levels above a predetermined threshold with respect to averages identified by averaging signal power in hop bins of the de-hopped signal; and suppressing frequency bins in the de-hopped signal that have signal levels above a predetermined threshold with respect to averages identified by averaging signal power in hop bins of the de-hopped signal. In some such embodiments, performing spectral analysis comprises performing a fast Fourier transform.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, the methods may be practiced by a computer system including one or more processors and computer-readable media such as computer memory. In particular, the computer memory may store computer-executable instructions that when executed by one or more processors cause various functions to be performed, such as the acts recited in the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Embodiments of the present invention may comprise or utilize a special purpose or general-purpose computer including computer hardware, as discussed in greater detail below. Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include physical and other computer-readable media for carrying or storing computer-executable instructions and/or data structures. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer system. Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions are physical storage media. Computer-readable media that carry computer-executable instructions are transmission media. Thus, by way of example, and not limitation, embodiments of the invention can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: physical computer-readable storage media and transmission computer-readable media.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Physical computer-readable storage media includes RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage (such as CDs, DVDs, etc.), magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A &#x201c;network&#x201d; is defined as one or more data links that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and/or modules and/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmissions media can include a network and/or data links which can be used to carry desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above are also included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission computer-readable media to physical computer-readable storage media (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a &#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and/or to less volatile computer-readable physical storage media at a computer system. Thus, computer-readable physical storage media can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions.
