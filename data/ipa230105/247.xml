furniture or shelves for storing or displaying many and varied objects, such as books&#x2014;in this case, bookcases&#x2014;, knick-knacks&#x2014;in this case, showcases or display units&#x2014;, perfume bottles&#x2014;in this case, pianos&#x2014;, etc. More particularly, the furniture in question comprises a plurality of modules which are slidably mounted on boards&#x2014;floors, ceilings or dividers&#x2014;in order to be able to modify and develop the storage or display structure of this furniture.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">More generally, the field of the invention is therefore that of furniture for storing and displaying objects which are modular and capable of changing by sliding along two low and high boards, each having two front and rear edges, of modules comprising front edges and low and high rear edges, these boards and modules being arranged to ensure guiding of the modules along the boards.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such furniture is described in Belgian patent

num="0005">The inventors have therefore sought a particularly simple solution for making a modular and scaleable storage structure that is easy to manufacture and to change, and this is how they provide the invention of the present application, which consists of a modular and scaleable piece of furniture comprising, at least between two low and high boards each having two front and rear edges, at least one module with at least one side wall, provided with two low and high edges, and a rear bottom wall having two low and high edges and assembled to the side wall, the boards and the module being arranged to allow sliding and guiding of the module along the boards, the piece of furniture wherein<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul

board comprises a longitudinal rib projecting perpendicular to its planar surfaces,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">the module is indented longitudinally and perpendicular to its side wall in order to be able to fit onto the ribs of the boards and thus slide along these ribs.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0009">It should be noted at once that the material of the boards and the module, which may be metal for example, is advantageously wood or another material that can be cut and machined.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0010">In the case where only one of the edges of the boards comprises a rib, the boards can be either a low board or a high board, depending on whether they are presented with the rib facing up or down, it being understood that the boards will have to be turned so that their rib is that of a rear edge.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">With a single rib, forming, in profile, an L with the board, said board can be a low board or a high board, but then, in the latter case, without any other additional board above this high board, to form only a single-module set or a single row of modules.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">If the piece of furniture is to comprise at least two superimposed rows of modules separated by an intermediate board, then this intermediate board comprises two projecting longitudinal ribs, perpendicular to the planar surfaces of this board, as an extension of each other and forming, in profile, a T with the board.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">The longitudinal ribs projecting out of the boards may have a flank that is coplanar with the rim of the edge of the boards or may be recessed with respect to this rim.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">In one embodiment, with the bottom wall assembled to the rear edge of the side wall, the module is indented in two longitudinal grooves formed respectively in the low and high edges of the bottom wall and extending into the low and high edges of its side wall to cooperate with the ribs of the low and high boards.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Of course, the module may comprise two side walls assembled to the bottom wall, the above characteristics naturally applying mutatis mutandis to this embodiment, the module thus comprising two side walls each provided with two low and high edges, and a rear bottom wall having two low and high edges and assembled to the side walls. In this case, and the bottom wall being assembled to the rear edges of the side walls, the module can be indented in two notches formed respectively in at least one of the low and high edges of its two side walls, with a depth equal to the height of the projecting ribs of the boards, preferably near its bottom wall, and aligned parallel to the bottom wall.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">In the case where the module comprises only one side wall, it is preferable that the bottom wall be assembled to the side wall below its rear edge.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">Advantageously, in the latter case, the material of the module being preferably wood, the module comprises, in the rear dihedral for assembling the bottom wall and the side wall, a buttress extending between the high and low edges of the bottom and side walls and indented into two longitudinal notches formed respectively in its high and low edges and extending, in the rear edge of the side wall, projecting out of the bottom wall, at the top and bottom, to cooperate with the ribs of the high and low boards.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">In this case, it is preferable that the edge of the bottom wall, opposite its edge for assembling with the side wall, is provided with a bar indented at the top and bottom, for cooperation with the ribs of the high and low boards, the bar extending in line with the buttress.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">In the case where the module has only one side wall, with a bottom wall disposed below the rear edge of the side wall, and its material is metal, the two walls may be welded together or formed as a single bent piece.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">The present application also relates to a piece of furniture comprising more than two boards and/or at least two modules as claimed above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The invention will be better understood upon reading the following description of several embodiments of the piece of furniture of the invention, with reference to the appended drawings in which</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the left side of an embodiment of the piece of furniture of the invention, with a single row of two modules of a first embodiment between two low and high boards of a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view of the left side of the piece of furniture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top perspective view of one of the modules of the piece of furniture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with two side walls and a bottom wall assembled to the rear edges of the side walls;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial view of the right side of a second embodiment of a board of the piece of furniture of the invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view of the left side of a third embodiment of a board of the piece of furniture of the invention;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top perspective view of a second embodiment of a module of the piece of furniture of the invention, with two side walls and a bottom wall assembled to the rear edges of the side walls;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top perspective view of a third embodiment of a module of the piece of furniture of the invention, with a single side wall, with a bottom wall assembled to the side wall below its rear edge, and made of wood;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a top perspective view of a fourth embodiment of a module of the piece of furniture of the invention made of metal, with a single side wall, with a bottom wall welded to the rear edge of the side wall;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a top perspective view of a fifth embodiment of a module of the piece of furniture of the invention made of metal, with a single side wall and bottom wall formed in one piece;

The boards and the walls of the modules are here made of wood.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">Each board <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> comprises a front edge <b>5</b> and a rear edge <b>6</b>, delimiting two parallel planar surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">A thin slat <b>10</b>, here also made of wood, is attached to the entire rim <b>9</b> of the rear edge <b>6</b> of the boards <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, projecting upwards and downwards perpendicular to the planar surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> of the boards <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>. In functional terms, each slat <b>10</b> is formed by two half-slats as an extension of each other and forming upper <b>11</b> and lower <b>12</b> longitudinal ribs projecting perpendicular to the planar surfaces <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> of the boards <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>. In profile, the two ribs <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of each slat <b>10</b> form, with the board to which they are attached, a T. The slats are preferably attached to their board by bonding.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">It should be noted that the high board <b>2</b> of the furniture in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises an upper rib <b>11</b>, so that it can be used as an intermediate board when transforming the piece of furniture in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> into a piece of furniture with two or more rows of modules, with the board <b>2</b> becoming the low board to support the modules of the second row.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">Leaving aside this upper rib, which in this case is effectively useless, the lower rib <b>12</b> forms, in profile, an L with the board <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">Similarly, the lower rib <b>12</b> of the low board <b>1</b> is not useful here either. It is therefore for convenience and simplicity that the slats <b>10</b> have been attached to the boards.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">In the case where only one rib (a half-slat) is attached to the boards, it is interesting to note that they can be attached either as a lower or an upper rib, since it would be sufficient to rotate the boards around an axis orthogonal to their rib to transform a lower rib into an upper rib, and vice versa, and thus to transform a high board into a low board, all ribs having to remain attached to the rear edge of the boards.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">In the case of a board provided with only one lower rib, as will be easily understood below, the board can only be a high board of a piece of furniture with a single row of modules.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">The piece of furniture in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises support shoes under the low board <b>1</b> which have been provided to improve the seat of the piece of furniture and to take into account the fact that this low board also comprises a lower rib <b>12</b>, a series of shoes <b>13</b> being pressed against this rib and the rear edge <b>6</b> of the board, other shoes <b>13</b> being attached under the front edge <b>5</b> of the board, the shoes <b>13</b> having of course the same height as the rib <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">Each module <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> comprises here a left side wall <b>14</b>, a right side wall <b>15</b> and a rear bottom wall <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">Each side wall comprises a high edge <b>17</b> and a low edge <b>18</b>. Similarly, the rear bottom wall <b>16</b> comprises a high edge <b>19</b> and a low edge <b>20</b>. The two side walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, by their vertical rear edge <b>23</b>, are assembled to the rear bottom wall <b>16</b>. This structure is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">The three walls of the modules <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> can be assembled in different ways. First of all, and here, they are bonded to each other.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">In this case, the rear bottom wall <b>16</b> is disposed between the two side walls, the rear face <b>21</b> of the bottom wall being coplanar with the rear rims <b>22</b> of the vertical rear edges <b>23</b> of the side walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The front face of the bottom wall could also be disposed against these rear rims.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">The modules <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are indented longitudinally, that is in the direction of the length of the piece of furniture, and thus in the direction of the length of the boards <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and perpendicular to the side walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">An indentation has been made both in the rear bottom wall <b>16</b> and in the two side walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">In the rear bottom wall <b>16</b>, a groove <b>24</b> has been cut into the high <b>19</b> and low <b>20</b> edges. These grooves <b>24</b> have substantially the same thickness as the slats <b>10</b> and a depth substantially equal to the height of the ribs <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">The grooves <b>24</b> are extended in the side walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> by notches <b>25</b> made here in their high edges <b>17</b>, low edges <b>18</b> and vertical rear edges <b>23</b>. The notches <b>25</b> have the same thickness and depth as the grooves <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">Thus, the walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of the modules <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> can fit onto the ribs <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of the boards <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and slide along these ribs. The modules can be placed anywhere. They can, without changing their structure, be moved after the first installation and this is why the furniture is described as modular and scaleable furniture.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">The module <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> differs from the one in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> only by its indentations. It comprises two side walls <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> and a rear bottom wall <b>33</b>. The bottom wall <b>33</b> does not comprise any grooves. Only notches <b>34</b> have been cut into the high <b>35</b> and low <b>36</b> edges of the side walls, below the bottom wall. The high and low notches are respectively aligned with each other parallel to the bottom wall, to, in fact, form partial, or dislocated, grooves along lines <b>37</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">The notches <b>34</b> have the same dimensions as the notches <b>25</b> of modules <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>.
