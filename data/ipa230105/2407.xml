id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant global health problem, affecting over 5% of the world population (over 350 million people worldwide and 1.25 million individuals in the U.S.).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Despite the availability of a prophylactic HBV vaccine, the burden of chronic HBV infection continues to be a significant unmet worldwide medical problem, due to suboptimal treatment options and sustained rates of new infections in most parts of the developing world. Current treatments do not provide a cure and are limited to only two classes of agents (interferon alpha and nucleoside analogues/inhibitors of the viral polymerase); drug resistance, low efficacy, and tolerability issues limit their impact. The low cure rates of HBV are attributed at least in part to the fact that complete suppression of virus production is difficult to achieve with a single antiviral agent. However, persistent suppression of HBV DNA slows liver disease progression and helps to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapy goals for HBV-infected patients are directed to reducing serum HBV DNA to low or undetectable levels, and to ultimately reducing or preventing the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The HBV capsid protein plays essential functions during the viral life cycle. HBV capsid/core proteins form metastable viral particles or protein shells that protect the viral genome during intercellular passage, and also play a central role in viral replication processes, including genome encapsidation, genome replication, and virion morphogenesis and egress. Capsid structures also respond to environmental cues to allow un-coating after viral entry. Consistently, the appropriate timing of capsid assembly and dis-assembly, the appropriate capsid stability and the function of core protein have been found to be critical for viral infectivity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need in the art for therapeutic agents that can increase the suppression of virus production and that can treat, ameliorate, or prevent HBV infection. Administration of such therapeutic agents to an HBV infected patient, either as monotherapy or in combination with other HBV treatments or ancillary treatments, will lead to significantly reduced virus burden, improved prognosis, diminished progression of the disease and enhanced seroconversion rates.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Background art on heteroaryldihydropyrimidines for use in the treatment of HBV includes WO 2015/132276, WO2013/102655, WO01/68641 and WO99/54326.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Provided herein are compounds useful for the treatment of HBV infection in a subject in need thereof.

Disclosed compounds may modulate (e.g., accelerate, delay, inhibit, disrupt or reduce) normal viral capsid assembly or disassembly, bind capsid or alter metabolism of cellular polyproteins and precursors. The modulation may occur when the capsid protein is mature, or during viral infectivity. Disclosed compounds can be used in methods of modulating the activity or properties of HBV cccDNA, or the generation or release of HBV RNA particles from within an infected cell.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In one embodiment, the compounds described herein are suitable for monotherapy and are effective against natural or native HBV strains and against HBV strains resistant to currently known drugs. In another embodiment, the compounds described herein are suitable for use in combination therapy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0030">Listed below are definitions of various terms used to describe this invention. These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout this specification and claims, unless otherwise limited in specific instances, either individually or as part of a larger group.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein generally have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Generally, the nomenclature used herein and the laboratory procedures in cell culture, molecular genetics, organic chemistry, and peptide chemistry are those well-known and commonly employed in the art.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">As used herein, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; refer to one or to more than one (i.e. to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, &#x201c;an element&#x201d; means one element or more than one element. Furthermore, use of the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; as well as other forms, such as &#x201c;include&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;included,&#x201d; is not limiting.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art and will vary to some extent on the context in which it is used. As used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is meant to encompass variations of &#xb1;20% or &#xb1;10%, including &#xb1;5%, &#xb1;1%, and &#xb1;0.1% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;capsid assembly modulator&#x201d; refers to a compound that disrupts or accelerates or inhibits or hinders or delays or reduces or modifies normal capsid assembly (e.g., during maturation) or normal capsid disassembly (e.g., during infectivity) or perturbs capsid stability, thereby inducing aberrant capsid morphology and function. In one embodiment, a capsid assembly modulator accelerates capsid assembly or disassembly, thereby inducing aberrant capsid morphology. In another embodiment, a capsid assembly modulator interacts (e.g. binds at an active site, binds at an allosteric site, modifies or hinders folding and the like) with the major capsid assembly protein (CA), thereby disrupting capsid assembly or disassembly. In yet another embodiment, a capsid assembly modulator causes a perturbation in structure or function of CA (e.g., ability of CA to assemble, disassemble, bind to a substrate, fold into a suitable conformation, or the like), which attenuates viral infectivity or is lethal to the virus.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;treating&#x201d; is defined as the application or administration of a therapeutic agent, i.e., a disclosed compound (alone or in combination with another pharmaceutical agent), to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient (e.g., for diagnosis or ex vivo applications), who has an HBV infection, a symptom of HBV infection or the potential to develop an HBV infection, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the HBV infection, the symptoms of HBV infection, or the potential to develop an HBV infection. Such treatments may be specifically tailored or modified, based on knowledge obtained from the field of pharmacogenomics.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; or &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; means no disorder or disease development if none had occurred, or no further disorder or disease development if there had already been development of the disorder or disease. Also considered is the ability of one to prevent some or all of the symptoms associated with the disorder or disease.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; &#x201c;individual&#x201d; or &#x201c;subject&#x201d; refers to a human or a non-human mammal. Non-human mammals include, for example, livestock and pets, such as ovine, bovine, porcine, canine, feline and murine mammals. Preferably, the patient, subject, or individual is human.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;effective amount,&#x201d; &#x201c;pharmaceutically effective amount,&#x201d; and &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refer to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of an agent to provide the desired biological result. That result may be reduction or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. An appropriate therapeutic amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; refers to a material, such as a carrier or diluent, which does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively non-toxic, i.e., the material may be administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable salt&#x201d; refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention include the conventional non-toxic salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418 and Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">As used herein, the term &#x201c;composition&#x201d; or &#x201c;pharmaceutical composition&#x201d; refers to a mixture of at least one compound useful within the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates administration of the compound to a patient or subject. Multiple techniques of administering a compound exist in the art including, but not limited to, intravenous, oral, aerosol, parenteral, ophthalmic, pulmonary, and topical administration.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or carrier, such as a liquid or solid filler, stabilizer, dispersing agent, suspending agent, diluent, excipient, thickening agent, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting a compound useful within the invention within or to the patient such that it may perform its intended function. Typically, such constructs are carried or transported from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, including the compound useful within the invention, and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials that may serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; surface active agents; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">As used herein, &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; also includes any and all coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are compatible with the activity of the compound useful within the invention and are physiologically acceptable to the patient. Supplementary active compounds may also be incorporated into the compositions. The &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; may further include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound useful within the invention. Other additional ingredients that may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions used in the practice of the invention are known in the art and described, for example in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Genaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., 1985, Easton, Pa.), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;alkyl,&#x201d; by itself or as part of another substituent means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>alkyl means an alkyl having one to three carbon atoms, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>alkyl means an alkyl having one to four carbon) and includes straight and branched chains.
