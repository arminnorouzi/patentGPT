Biopsies can include surgical excisional biopsies and stereotactic and ultrasound guided needle breast biopsies. In the case of image directed biopsy, the radiologist or other physician may take a small sample of the irregular tissue for laboratory analysis. If the biopsy proves to be malignant, additional surgery (e.g., a lumpectomy or a mastectomy) may be required. In the case of needle biopsies, the patient may return to the radiologist a day or more later, and the biopsy site (the site of the lesion) may need to be relocated in preparation for the surgery. An imaging system, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MM) or x-ray may be used to locate the biopsy site. In order to assist the relocation of the biopsy site, a marker may be placed at the time of the biopsy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of markers used after breast biopsies to mark the location where the biopsied tissue was removed is described in the following US Patents: U.S. Pat.

In some contexts, a placed marker may not completely correspond to the biopsy site when the marker is relocated. For instance, the marker may migrate to another nearby location during the intervening time between the biopsy procedure and subsequent follow up procedures. Migration of the biopsy site marker can cause difficulties when identifying the biopsy site during subsequent follow-up procedures. Accordingly, it may be desirable to incorporate features into a marker to maintain the marker in a fixed position over time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While several systems and methods have been made and used for marking a biopsy site, it is believed that no one prior to the inventor has made or used the invention described in the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the specification concludes with claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description of certain examples taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals identify the same elements.

The accompanying drawings incorporated in and forming a part of the specification illustrate several aspects of the present invention, and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention; it being understood, however, that this invention is not limited to the precise arrangements shown.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following description of certain examples of the invention should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention. Other examples, features, aspects, embodiments, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description, which is by way of illustration, one of the best modes contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other different and obvious aspects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions should be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It may be beneficial to be able to mark the location or margins of a lesion, whether temporarily or permanently, prior to or immediately after removing or sampling it. Marking prior to removal may help to ensure that the entire lesion is excised, if desired. Alternatively, if the lesion were inadvertently removed in its entirety, marking the biopsy site immediately after the procedure would enable reestablishment of its location for future identification.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once a marker is positioned at a biopsy site, it may be desirable for the marker to remain visible under ultrasound. It may also be desirable to make the marker readily identifiable relative to other structural features of a patient. For instance, it may be desirable for the marker to be distinguishable under ultrasound visualization from microcalcifications to avoid inadvertently characterizing the marker as a microcalcification during subsequent ultrasonic examinations. Generally, microcalcifications are used in the field to identify suspicious lesions or masses. Thus, it is generally desirable for the ultrasound view to be distinguishable as a marker and not inadvertently identified as a new mass.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">I. Exemplary Marker</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Aspects presented herein relate to devices and procedures for manufacturing a marker for percutaneously marking a biopsy cavity (<b>10</b>) having surrounding tissue (<b>30</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>. For instance, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a marker (<b>100</b>) may be initially placed in the biopsy cavity (<b>10</b>) to facilitate relocation of the biopsy site. Marker (<b>100</b>) may comprise a carrier (<b>120</b>) and a marker element (<b>12</b>). Carrier (<b>120</b>) generally includes a bioabsorbable marker material (<b>122</b>). Thus, carrier (<b>120</b>) is generally configured for absorption into a patient after placement of marker (<b>100</b>) within the biopsy cavity (<b>10</b>). In some examples, carrier (<b>120</b>) can include a plurality of microbubbles to enhance visualization of carrier (<b>120</b>) under ultrasound. As will be described in greater detail below, marker material (<b>122</b>) is generally bioabsorbable such that marker material (<b>122</b>) may be generally absorbed into the patient's tissue over time. In the present example, marker material (<b>122</b>) comprises a hydrogel that is initially in a dehydrated state. Although a hydrogel is used in the present example, it should be understood that in other examples marker material (<b>122</b>) may comprise other known bioabsorbable materials.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present example, marker (<b>100</b>) further includes a marker element (<b>12</b>) that is generally not bioabsorbable. Marker element (<b>12</b>) may comprise a radiopaque or echogenic marker embedded within the bioabsorbable marker material (<b>122</b>) of carrier (<b>120</b>). For instance, marker element (<b>12</b>) may comprise metal, hard plastic, or other radiopaque or hyperechoic materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. In other examples, marker (<b>100</b>) may be formed without a marker element (<b>12</b>). In still other examples, marker (<b>100</b>) may be formed with only marker element (<b>12</b>) such that carrier (<b>120</b>) is omitted and marker element (<b>12</b>) is in a &#x201c;bare&#x201d; form. In other words, in some examples marker (<b>100</b>) is formed of only carrier (<b>120</b>) as a bare clip.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Marker material (<b>122</b>) is generally expandable once disposed within a patient at a biopsy site. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, the initially dehydrated marker material (<b>122</b>) may absorb fluid from the surrounding tissue (<b>30</b>) into which it is inserted. In response to this absorption of fluid, maker material (<b>122</b>) may swell, thereby permitting carrier (<b>120</b>) to fill a cavity formed at a biopsy site by removal of tissue samples during a biopsy procedure. Biodegradable materials may be particularly suitable in applications where it is desired that natural tissue growth be permitted to completely or partially replace the implanted material over time. Accordingly, biocompatibility is ensured and the natural mechanical parameters of the tissue are substantially restored to those of the pre-damaged condition.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Marker (<b>100</b>) may be inserted into the body either surgically via an opening in the body cavity (<b>30</b>), or through a minimally invasive procedure using such devices as a catheter, introducer or similar type insertion device. Marker (<b>100</b>) may be delivered immediately after removal of the tissue specimen using the same device used to remove the tissue specimen itself. Follow-up noninvasive detection techniques, such as x-ray mammography or ultrasound may then be used by the physician to identify, locate, and monitor the biopsy cavity site over a period of time via marker (<b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Marker (<b>100</b>) of the present example is large enough to be readily visible to a clinician under x-ray or ultrasonic viewing, for example; yet small enough to be able to be percutaneously deployed into the biopsy cavity and to not cause any difficulties with the patient. Although examples are described in connection with treatment and diagnosis of breast tissue, aspects presented herein may be used for markers in any internal, tissue, e.g., in breast tissue, lung tissue, prostate tissue, lymph gland tissue, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The hydration of the marker material (<b>122</b>) of carrier (<b>120</b>) by the natural moisture of the tissue surrounding it causes expansion of the polymer and thus minimizes the risk of migration. The growing hydrogel-based marker material (<b>122</b>) centers marker (<b>100</b>) in the biopsy cavity as it grows. As the hydrogel expands, naturally present moisture from the surrounding tissue, the hydration enables increasing sound through transmission, appears more and more hypoechoic and is easy to visualize on follow up ultrasound studies.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The hydrated hydrogel marker material (<b>122</b>) of carrier (<b>120</b>) may also be used to frame permanent marker (<b>12</b>). The hypoechoic nature of the hydrated marker material (<b>122</b>) enables ultrasound visibility of the permanent marker (<b>12</b>) within the hydrogel hydrated marker material (<b>122</b>) because the permanent marker (<b>12</b>) is outlined as a specular reflector within a hypoechoic hydrated marker having a water-like nonreflective substrate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">II. Exemplary Marker Delivery Device</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples it may be desirable to deploy marker (<b>100</b>) described above within the body cavity (<b>30</b>) using certain marker delivery devices. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> show an exemplary marker delivery device (<b>150</b>) which includes an elongate outer cannula (<b>162</b>) having a marker exit, such as side opening (<b>164</b>) formed adjacent to, but spaced proximally from, the distal end of the cannula (<b>162</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A grip (<b>166</b>) can be provided at the proximal end of cannula (<b>162</b>). A push rod (<b>168</b>) can be provided, with push rod (<b>168</b>) extending coaxially in cannula (<b>162</b>) such that push rod (<b>168</b>) is configured to translate within cannula (<b>162</b>) to displace one or more markers through side opening (<b>164</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).

For instance, some markers may be prone to migration after placement of a biopsy site due to movement of tissue in the intervening time between marker placement and subsequent follow-up procedures. As a result, such markers may introduce challenges with identifying the biopsy site during subsequent follow-up procedures. Accordingly, it may be desirable to incorporate features into a marker similar to marker (<b>100</b>) to maintain the marker in a fixed position within tissue over time. Although several examples are described herein that incorporate the features outlined above, it should be understood that various alternative combinations can be used without departing from the basic principles described herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A.

As will be described in greater detail below, hydrogel may be dehydrated and/or cured prior to being deployed at a biopsy site or within a biopsy cavity.

Although spring (<b>630</b>) is shown in the present example as being centered between primary coil (<b>632</b>) and secondary coil (<b>634</b>), it should be understood that in some examples spring (<b>630</b>) may be disposed off-center relative to primary coil (<b>632</b>) and secondary coil (<b>634</b>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Regardless of the particular position of spring (<b>630</b>), spring (<b>630</b>) as being positioned outside of both primary element (<b>624</b>) and secondary element (<b>626</b>) of carrier (<b>620</b>).

Thus, spring (<b>630</b>) is generally configured to drive movement of secondary element (<b>626</b>) and/or primary element (<b>624</b>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Spring (<b>630</b>) may take a variety of forms suitable for driving movement of secondary element (<b>626</b>) relative to primary element (<b>624</b>). In the present example, spring (<b>630</b>) is shown as a coil or torsion spring. Such a configuration may also be desirable to enhance the visibility of marker element (<b>612</b>) under x-ray by including one or more overlapping coils. However, other suitable configurations may be used. For instance, in some examples spring (<b>630</b>) may include a shape memory material such as nitinol. Spring (<b>630</b>) may then transition from a first relatively straight shape to a second bent shape in response to a temperature increase from surrounding tissue.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Primary coil (<b>632</b>) and secondary coil (<b>634</b>) are disposed on opposing ends of marker element (<b>612</b>).

Meanwhile, secondary coil (<b>634</b>) is disposed within secondary element (<b>626</b>) of carrier (<b>620</b>). Both coils (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) define a distinctive geometric pattern that may be visible under x-ray and/or ultrasound. For instance, in some examples, coils (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) may include one or more loops of wire material to enhance visualization of marker element (<b>612</b>) under x-ray visualization at a variety of angles relative to the x-ray source and detector. Additionally, the one or more loops of each coil (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) may be configured to anchor marker element (<b>612</b>) within primary element (<b>624</b>)/secondary element (<b>626</b>) of carrier (<b>620</b>) to thereby provide a mechanical ground for marker element (<b>612</b>). In other examples, coils (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) may be of a ribbon or sheet configuration bent at one or more points to provide enhanced visualization under x-ray and/or ultrasound. In any of the above-described configurations for each coil (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>), such coils (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) may include one or more openings and/or bores to further enhance visualization. Furthermore, each coil (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) does not necessarily be of identical configurations. Indeed, in some examples it may be desirable to have at least some variation between the configuration of each coil (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) to more readily identify a particular end of marker (<b>600</b>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Each coil (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) of the present example is integral with the rest of marker element (<b>612</b>).

However, in other examples each coil (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>) may be a separate component with other portions of marker element (<b>612</b>) being connected, secured, and/or fastened to each coil (<b>632</b>, <b>634</b>). With the integral construction, marker element (<b>612</b>) may include a single common material such as metal.

As can be seen, spring (<b>630</b>) is configured to drive movement of secondary element (<b>626</b>) relative to primary element (<b>624</b>) about an axis defined by spring (<b>630</b>). This transition results in marker (<b>600</b>) being of a more irregular shape and thus more likely to anchor within tissue at a biopsy site. In the present example, a rotation of approximately 90&#xb0; is shown. However, it should be understood that in other examples various other rotations may be used.

As will be described in greater detail below, hydrogel may be dehydrated and/or cured prior to being deployed at a biopsy site or within a biopsy cavity. Once the hydrogel contacts tissue, the hydrogel may absorb moisture from the tissue and expand or swell as the moisture in the hydrogel increases.

Once marker (<b>900</b>) is released from the tubular structure, the resilient bias of springs (<b>936</b>, <b>942</b>, <b>948</b>, <b>954</b>) may cause anchors (<b>932</b>, <b>938</b>, <b>944</b>, <b>950</b>) to expand. As a result, each secondary coil (<b>934</b>, <b>940</b>, <b>946</b>, <b>952</b>) of each anchor (<b>932</b>, <b>938</b>, <b>944</b>, <b>950</b>) may be forced into adjacent tissue to anchor marker (<b>900</b>) at the biopsy site. Overtime, some tissue in-growth may occur with respect to each secondary coil (<b>934</b>, <b>940</b>, <b>946</b>, <b>952</b>) further increasing anchoring of marker (<b>900</b>) over time.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">E. Exemplary Biopsy Site Marker with Nitinol Tube</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an exemplary marker (<b>1000</b>) that is generally configured to automatically change shape upon delivery at a biopsy site and limit migration of marker (<b>1000</b>) relative to an initial placement in tissue. As with marker (<b>100</b>) described above, marker (<b>1000</b>) of the present example includes a carrier (<b>1020</b>) and a marker element (<b>1012</b>). As with carrier (<b>120</b>) described above, carrier (<b>1020</b>) of the present example generally includes a bioabsorbable marker material (<b>1022</b>). Thus, carrier (<b>1020</b>) is generally configured for absorption into a patient after placement of marker (<b>1000</b>) within a biopsy cavity such as biopsy cavity (<b>10</b>) described above. Carrier (<b>1020</b>) of the present example defines a generally cylindrical shape, although a variety of other shapes may be used. As similarly described above, some examples of carrier (<b>1020</b>) may include a plurality of microbubbles to enhance visualization of carrier (<b>1020</b>) under ultrasound.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Marker material (<b>1022</b>) of the present example comprise a hydrogel or other suitable materials. Hydrogel materials are generally configured to absorb into a patient's tissue over time. Thus, marker material (<b>1022</b>) is generally non-permanent. Additionally, hydrogel is generally configured to expand or swell when placed within tissue. As will be described in greater detail below, hydrogel may be dehydrated and/or cured prior to being deployed at a biopsy site or within a biopsy cavity. Once the hydrogel contacts tissue, the hydrogel may absorb moisture from the tissue and expand or swell as the moisture in the hydrogel increases. In some examples, the hydrogel may also be manipulated during dehydration and/or curing to control expansion of the hydrogel in accordance with various expansion profiles (e.g., limit longitudinal expansion, limit transverse expansion, and/or etc.). Although maker material (<b>1022</b>) is described herein as being hydrogel, it should be understood that in other examples marker material (<b>1022</b>) may comprise other suitable materials or include various combinations of suitable materials with or without hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Unlike carrier (<b>120</b>) described above, carrier (<b>1020</b>) is divided into two portions&#x2014;a distal element (<b>1024</b>) and a proximal element (<b>1026</b>). As will be described in greater detail below, distal element (<b>1024</b>) and proximal element (<b>1026</b>) are generally spaced from each other by a predetermined distance to permit movement of a portion of marker (<b>1000</b>) relative to distal element (<b>1024</b>) and proximal element (<b>1026</b>). Thus, distal element (<b>1024</b>) and proximal element (<b>1026</b>) together form a generally cylindrical shape, with the cylindrical shape being interrupted by the space between distal element (<b>1024</b>) and proximal element (<b>1026</b>). Both distal element (<b>1024</b>) and proximal element (<b>1026</b>) are shown in the present example as having a similar cylindrical shape. However, it should be understood that in other examples distal element (<b>1024</b>) and proximal element (<b>1026</b>) may have dissimilar shapes.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As with marker element (<b>12</b>) described above, marker element (<b>1012</b>) of the present example is at least partially disposed within a portion of carrier (<b>1020</b>). However unlike marker element (<b>12</b>), one or more portions of marker element (<b>1012</b>) is disposed outside of carrier (<b>1020</b>). For instance, marker element (<b>1012</b>) extends from distal element (<b>1024</b>) to proximal element (<b>1026</b>), exposing a portion of marker element (<b>1012</b>) between distal element (<b>1024</b>) and proximal element (<b>1026</b>). As will be described in greater detail below, this configuration of marker element (<b>1012</b>) is generally configured to promote anchoring of marker (<b>1000</b>) within tissue via movement of one or more of marker element (<b>1012</b>), distal element (<b>1026</b>), and/or proximal element (<b>1024</b>).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Marker element (<b>1012</b>) includes an anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) (alternatively referred to as a &#x201c;tube,&#x201d; &#x201c;expansion member,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;cross member&#x201d;), a distal connector (<b>1032</b>), and a proximal connector (<b>1034</b>). Anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) is disposed between distal connector (<b>1032</b>) and proximal connector (<b>1034</b>). Anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) of the present example comprises a plurality of nitinol wires oriented relative to each other to form a tubular structure. As will be discussed in greater detail below, this configuration of anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) is configured to permit expansion of anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) in response to heat from surrounding tissue so that the wires forming anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) engage the surrounding tissue, thereby anchoring marker (<b>1000</b>). Although anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) is formed of a plurality of wires in the present example, it should be understood that in other examples anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) may take on a variety of forms using a variety of materials. For instance, in some examples anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) may be of a tubular sheet material with holes and/or slots extending through the sheet. In such examples, anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) may include nitinol, other biocompatible shape-memory alloys, or biocompatible non-shape-memory alloys.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Distal connector (<b>1032</b>) is disposed on one end of anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) with proximal connector (<b>1034</b>) being disposed on the other end of anchor tube (<b>1030</b>). Each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) is at least partially disposed within an element (<b>1024</b>, <b>1026</b>) of carrier (<b>1020</b>). Thus, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) provides a mechanical ground between anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) and each element (<b>1024</b>, <b>1026</b>) of carrier (<b>1020</b>). Additionally, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) may be configured to enhance visualization of marker (<b>1000</b>) under ultrasound. For instance, in some examples, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) may include one or more wire coils configured to provide a distinctive pattern under x-ray and/or ultrasonic visualization. In other examples, each connection (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) may include a ribbon or sheet material bent or twisted at several locations to provide a distinctive pattern under x-ray and/or ultrasonic visualization.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some examples, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) may be integral with anchor tube (<b>1030</b>). Thus, in such examples, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) and anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) may comprise the same material as anchor tube (<b>1030</b>). In other examples, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) may comprise a different material relative to anchor tube (<b>1030</b>). In such examples, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) may be integral with anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) using overmolding, forging or other similar processes. Alternatively, each connector (<b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>) may be separate from anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) and connected thereto using one or more fasteners, adhesives, and/or other suitable mechanical couplings.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In an exemplary use, marker (<b>1000</b>) may be in an initial configuration with anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) in a generally tubular configuration similar to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Such a configuration may correspond to marker (<b>1000</b>) being loaded into a marker delivery device similar to marker delivery device (<b>150</b>) described above. While marker (<b>1000</b>) is in the initial configuration, marker (<b>1000</b>) is generally configured for deployment at a biopsy site using the marker delivery device.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Once marker (<b>1000</b>) is deployed at a biopsy site, marker (<b>1000</b>) is configured to automatically transition to an expanded configuration. During this transition, anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) gradually absorbs heat from surrounding tissue. This heat absorption activates the shape-memory properties of anchor tube (<b>1030</b>). In the present example, each wire making up anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) may be configured with a curved pattern larger than the radius defined by carrier (<b>1020</b>) upon activation of the shape-memory property. As a result, anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) will expand upon activation of the shape-memory property, with each wire forming anchor tube (<b>1030</b>) engaging the surrounding tissue with increasing force.
