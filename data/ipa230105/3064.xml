In particular, the present disclosure is directed to roller carriers that can be conveniently adjusted to position the roller and track relative to a bottom bracket lift pin engagement so that the lift pin assembly and track do not interfere when the door is operated. The present disclosure also related to a bottom bracket including an integrated lift/step plate to facilitate closing the door without damaging the door.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sectional doors are used to cover openings in structures that open and close easily. For example, garage doorways are typically provided with sectional doors that can be raised and lowered to open and close the garage. Sectional doors include rollers positioned outward of the stiles along the side edges of the doors. Sets of rollers extend from the left and right edges of the door and engage, respectively, with left and right tracks along the sides of the doorway. The rollers and tracks support and guide the door as it is move up and down to open and close the doorway.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Each roller typically includes a roller wheel that resides in the track and a roller shaft that connects the wheel with a roller carrier assembly fixed to a stile along the edge of the door. In some sectional doors, the roller shaft extends through brackets fixed to the roller carrier assembly. Engagement of the roller shaft with the bracket fixes the axis of the shaft along a horizontal direction and supports the roller wheel so that it is aligned with the track. For known doors, when the door is installed, the distance the shaft extends from the bracket may need to be adjusted, for example, by placing spacers on the shaft, so that the edge of the door aligns with the opening of the doorway and so that the door is accurately engaged with the tracks. Such an adjustment may be cumbersome and may require supplying additional components, e.g., spacers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sectional doors typically include a mechanism to bias the door vertically to counterbalance the weight of the door. This bias may be adjusted to closely match the weight of the door so that opening the door does not require lifting the weight of the door itself. This vertical bias allows a person to lift the door easily. Where the door is provided with a motorized mechanism to open and close the door, the vertical bias reduces the amount of electrical power required to open the door. The vertical bias is typically provided by a spring, such as a torsion spring, that drives a reel or cable drum. A top end of a lift cable engages with the reel. A bottom end of the lift cable engages with a lift pin assembly positioned near the lower edge of the door. Lift pin assemblies may be provided at the bottom edge of the door at both the left and right sides of the door. When the door is moved downward to close the doorway, the cable is unwound from the reel, twisting the torsion spring to store mechanical energy. To open the door, vertical force is applied to the door causing the door to move upward. The stored tension in the spring drives the reel to wind the cable upward, facilitating opening of the door.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Engagement of the door with the doorway may include a weatherproof seal between the door and the doorway. Typically, a resilient gasket is provided along the edge of the doorway. When the door is in its downward position, this gasket is compressed between the door and the doorway. The door may also include a gasket along its bottom edge that compresses against the threshold of the doorway when the door is fully closed to seal the bottom of the doorway.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Compression of the gasket along the edge of the doorway is required only when the door is fully closed. As the door is being moved upward and downward with respect to the doorway, it is advantageous that the door does not engage with the gasket until it is fully or nearly fully closed. Positioning the door away from the gasket while it moves up and down reduces wear of the door and the gasket and allows the door to move more freely. Typically, the tracks along the sides of the doorway that engage with the rollers are arranged so that the face of the door is moved away from the jamb surrounding the doorway as the door moves upward from its downward-most position. The tracks maybe arranged at an angle away from the vertical. Roller carriers supporting the rollers may be configured so that as the rollers move upward along the tracks the face of the door moves inward and away from the jamb of the doorway. As the door moves downward to the closed position, the arrangement of rollers and tracks moves the door toward the inside face of the doorway. According to some known doors, the track is arranged so that the door moves about &#x215b; inch away from the doorway for each vertical foot of upward motion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the face of the door moves away from the inside face or jamb of the doorway, the lift pin engagements at the bottom edge of the door likewise move inward with respect to the doorway and toward the track. A problem with known sectional doors is that the inward movement of the lift pin engagement may cause the lift pin engagement to contact the track, potentially damaging the track and/or the lift pin engagement. Typically, the position of the rollers on the door and the tracks connected with the doorway are selected so that the lift pin engagement is positioned inward of the track. Proper positioning of the rollers so that the lift pin engagement does not interfere with the track may be cumbersome for known sectional doors. For example, to properly align the tracks so that they are not contacted by the lift pin engagement, an installer may have to add spacers to the shafts of the rollers to move the roller wheels further in the outward direction from the edges of the door. This adjustment may be cumbersome. The position of the rollers with respect to the inside face of the doorway also depends, in part, on the thickness of the door itself. Sectional doors may come in a variety of thicknesses, further complicating the proper positioning of the roller to avoid interference between the lift pin engagement and the track.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Sectional doors are typically closed and locked by moving the door fully downward and extending one or more bolt locks on the door outward from the edges of the door to engage with openings in the tracks. To facilitate alignment of the bolt locks with the openings in the tracks, downward force may need to be applied to the door, for example, to compress a gasket along the bottom edge of the door with the threshold of the doorway and to overcome vertical bias applied by the lift cable and torsion spring. Known sectional doors may include a step plate that is fastened to a lower portion of the stile of the door. The step plate provides a surface for a person to apply downward force by stepping on the plate. The step plate may also serve as a lift handle, allowing a user to grasp the door and lift it upward to open the doorway. Providing a step plate may make installation of the door more complicated and require that extra parts that need to be supplied with the sectional door.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure relates to apparatuses and methods to address these and other difficulties.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a bottom bracket for a sectional door that includes an integrated step plate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a bottom bracket for a sectional door including a roller carrier for receiving the shaft of a roller, where the wheel of the roller can be selectively positioned with respect to an edge of the door.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a bottom bracket for a sectional door that includes a lift pin engagement that is integrated with the bottom bracket.

Lift cable <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is connected with engagement <b>12</b> by a pin inserted through aligned holes in engagement <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a number of through holes are provided through bottom bracket <b>3</b> to fix bracket <b>2</b> with door <b>10</b>. These including elongated hole <b>11</b>, that provides a mechanism for adjustably fixing roller carrier <b>4</b> to bracket <b>2</b> and door <b>10</b>, as will be explained below.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows roller carrier <b>4</b>. Carrier <b>4</b> includes a connection plate <b>7</b> and two parallel wing plates <b>9</b> that extend from connection plate <b>7</b>. Connection plate <b>7</b> includes elongated holes <b>7</b><i>a</i>. Wing plates <b>9</b> each include one or more roller receiving holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>. Receiving holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>are arranged so that the shaft <b>34</b> of roller <b>30</b> can be fitted through both wing plates <b>9</b> to hold the roller in a fixed orientation with respect to carrier <b>4</b>. The position of holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>with respect to connection plate <b>7</b> determines how far the axis of roller <b>30</b> will be positioned from the inside surface of door <b>10</b>. When the door <b>10</b> is installed in a doorway <b>100</b>, the axis of the rollers <b>30</b> is aligned with the center-line of track <b>120</b>L, <b>120</b>R. The position of the center-line of the track relative to the inside face of the doorway depends on the track size. Typically, track sizes range from 1 inch to 4 inch, and may be larger. For installations where door <b>10</b> is subject to high wind forces, for example, in hurricane-prone regions, a larger, more robust track size may be used. Where a less robust door is sufficient, a narrower, less expensive track size may be used. The same roller carrier <b>4</b> can be used to support rollers <b>30</b> to engage with various tracks of various sizes by engaging the rollers with selected sets of holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>. As a result, a bottom bracket assembly according to embodiments of the disclosure can be used to support doors designed for different situations. This may reduce the number of parts that need to be inventoried for different configurations of the door.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a roller <b>30</b> that may be used with bottom bracket assemblies according to embodiments of the disclosure. Roller <b>30</b> has a roller shaft <b>34</b> connected with a wheel <b>32</b>. A low friction bearing may be provided between shaft <b>34</b> and wheel <b>32</b> to facilitate rotation of the wheel with respect to the shaft. A locating shoulder <b>36</b> is provided on the shaft <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, when shaft <b>34</b> is inserted through holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>of roller carrier <b>4</b>, shoulder <b>36</b> presses against wing <b>9</b> of carrier <b>4</b> so that wheel <b>32</b> is held a fixed distance from the carrier. Roller <b>30</b> may be a commercial product with the dimensions of the wheel, shaft, and shoulder conforming to industry standards. Using such standard parts reduces the cost to install a door and to repair and maintain the door by replacing rollers when they become worn. By providing a roller carrier according to embodiments of the disclosure, which can be easily adjusted, standard rollers can be used without modification, e.g., without having to add spacers to the shaft of the roller to adjust the position of the wheel outward from the edge of the door.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows an exploded view of bottom bracket assembly <b>1</b>. Bottom bracket <b>2</b> is fixed to an edge stile of door <b>10</b>. Side members <b>5</b> extend along the edge of the door. Lift engagement <b>12</b> is positioned near the bottom edge of the door. Fasteners extend through holes in bottom bracket <b>2</b>, roller carrier <b>4</b>, and strut <b>8</b> to fix bottom bracket assembly <b>1</b> to door <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows the bottom bracket assembly <b>1</b> assembled as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, roller shaft <b>34</b> is inserted through selected holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>in roller carrier <b>4</b>. Shoulder <b>36</b> contacts the side of roller carrier <b>4</b> at the edge of the selected hole <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Elongated holes <b>7</b><i>a </i>in carrier <b>4</b>, and elongated hole <b>11</b> in bottom bracket <b>2</b> allow the position of carrier <b>4</b>, and hence the position of roller wheel <b>32</b>, to be adjusted to select the distance of the wheel from the edge of the door so that the wheel <b>36</b> is aligned with the position of track <b>120</b>L, <b>120</b>R fixed near the inside edges of doorway <b>100</b>. This adjustment allows tracks <b>120</b>L <b>120</b>R to be positioned away from the edge of door <b>10</b> so that lift cable <b>20</b> and lift engagements <b>12</b> do not interfere with tracks <b>120</b>L, <b>120</b>R. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, by adjusting roller carrier <b>4</b> relative to bracket <b>2</b>, roller wheel <b>32</b> and track <b>102</b>L are positioned outward from the edge of the door a distance sufficient that lift engagement <b>12</b> does not interfere with track <b>102</b>L. As discussed above, tracks <b>120</b>L, <b>120</b>R are angled away from the inside face of doorway <b>100</b> so that, as the door moves upward, the door moves inward, away from the jamb of the doorway. This motion allows the door <b>10</b> to break contact with doorway and with the weatherproofing gasket provided to seal door <b>10</b> with doorway <b>100</b> when the door is opened. If the tracks <b>120</b>L, <b>120</b>R are located too close to the edge of door <b>10</b>, when the door moves inward as it rises, lift pin engagement <b>12</b> or cable <b>20</b> could contact the track, potentially damaging the track, cable, or the pin engagement. A bottom bracket assembly <b>1</b> according to embodiments of the disclosure avoids this problem by allowing an installer to adjust the distance of wheel <b>32</b> with respect to the door <b>10</b> by sliding roller carrier <b>4</b> with respect to bottom bracket <b>2</b> before tightening fasteners inserted through elongated holes <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to one embodiment bottom bracket assemblies <b>1</b> are installed on a door <b>10</b> as follows. Bottom bracket <b>2</b> is fitted to the stile on a first side of the door <b>10</b> with side member <b>5</b> positioned against the edge of the stile and the bottom edge of bottom bracket <b>2</b> aligned with the bottom edge of the stile. Fasteners, such as self-drilling Tek screws, are driven through the lowermost holes in bracket <b>2</b> and into the stile to fix the bracket to the stile.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Roller carrier <b>4</b> is positioned so that elongated holes <b>7</b><i>a </i>on the carrier align with holes in the middle of bracket <b>2</b> (as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) and the lowermost hole in carrier <b>4</b> aligns with elongated hole <b>11</b> in bracket <b>2</b>. Fasteners are partially driven through the elongated holes <b>7</b><i>a </i>in carrier <b>4</b>. The fasteners are left loose enough to allow carrier <b>4</b> to move side-to-side.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Roller <b>30</b> is installed by inserting shaft <b>34</b> of the roller <b>30</b> through a selected set of receiving holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The set of receiving holes <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>is selected based on the size of wheel <b>32</b> (and hence, the track size of tracks <b>120</b>L, <b>120</b>R). According to one embodiment, where a two-inch track size is used, the innermost receiving holes <b>4</b><i>a </i>are selected and where a three-inch track size is used, the outermost set of receiving holes <b>4</b><i>b </i>are selected.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The horizontal position of carrier <b>4</b>, and hence roller wheel <b>32</b> with respect to the edge of door <b>10</b>, is adjusted to correspond with the desired location of track <b>120</b>L, <b>120</b>R with respect to the doorway <b>100</b>.
