The VCM production is achieved mainly through the following two industrial production routes: calcium carbide route and ethylene route. In the calcium carbide route, VCM is prepared through the hydrochlorination of acetylene under the catalysis of mercury chloride. In the ethylene route, VCM is prepared through the pyrolysis of 1,2-DCE.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The global treaty &#x201c;Minamata Convention on Mercury&#x201d; restricts and may eventually prohibit the use of mercury catalysts, making the calcium carbide route the less desirable route for producing VCM in China. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a green VCM production route.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Industrially, thermal pyrolysis is adopted for the pyrolysis of 1,2-DCE to prepare VCM, and a reaction temperature is controlled at about 500&#xb0; C. to improve a conversion rate of 1,2-DCE. This route involves a high reaction temperature and a large energy consumption and is prone to coking and carbon deposition, which requires periodic shutdown for coke cleaning, causing a great impact on the normal operation of production. Therefore, it is necessary to study and develop a catalyst capable of reducing the pyrolysis temperature and improving the pyrolysis selectivity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,225 discloses a catalyst for catalytic pyrolysis of 1,2-DCE to prepare VCM, where the catalyst is obtained by loading a rare earth element on molecular sieves HFZ-20, HFZ-30, and HFZ-55. When the catalyst is used for catalytic pyrolysis of 1,2-DCE to prepare VCM, a 1,2-DCE conversion rate is 35.8% and a maximum VCM selectivity is 90.1%.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Chinese Patent CN102247884A discloses a catalyst for catalytic pyrolysis of 1,2-DCE to prepare VCM, where the catalyst is obtained by loading a rare earth element on a molecular sieve ZSM-5. When the catalyst is used for catalytic pyrolysis of 1,2-DCE to prepare VCM, a 1,2-DCE conversion rate is 55.6% and a maximum VCM selectivity is 98%.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Chinese Patent CN102249844A discloses a method for catalytic pyrolysis of 1,2-DCE with a metal-modified molecular sieve SAPO-34 as a catalyst to prepare VCM, where a 1,2-DCE conversion rate is 55% and a maximum VCM selectivity is 98%.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Chinese Patent CN102766018A discloses a method for catalytic pyrolysis with a barium chloride catalyst to prepare VCM, where a BaCl<sub>2 </sub>active
