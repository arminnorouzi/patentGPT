To provide a high energy density battery module, cylindrical battery cells may be arranged with a bottom end of each of the battery cells secured to a cooling surface of the battery module using an adhesive. However, in such battery modules, the thermal gradient across the plurality of battery cells in the battery module needs to be effectively controlled so that all of the battery cells are equally cooled.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Thus, it is advantageous for the cooling capacity of the cooling surface to be uniform across the cooling surface. If the cooling capacity of the cooling surface varies across the cooling surface and the thermal gradient across the plurality of battery cells is not effectively controlled, certain battery cells will be cooled less than other battery cells in the battery module and will degrade faster than the other battery cells, resulting in accelerated capacity loss of the overall battery module. Additionally, if the thermal gradient across the plurality of battery cells is not effectively controlled, it may be difficult to estimate the temperature of each of the battery cells in the battery module during operation (e.g., by measuring the temperature of select battery cells and estimating the temperature of the other battery cells based on the measured temperatures) without directly measuring the temperature of each of the battery cells.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These problems may be particularly relevant to large format battery modules having several arrays of battery cells electrically connected in parallel groups because temperature sensors for many or all of the battery cells may add cost and complexity, and because the capacity loss of a single battery cell in a parallel group of battery cells may be propagated to all the battery cells in the parallel group of battery cells, thereby significantly lowering the capacity of the battery module.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To solve these problems, systems and methods are provided herein for efficiently controlling the thermal gradient across a plurality of battery cells in a battery module (e.g., a high energy density battery module).

For example, the thickness of the overall stack between the bottom of battery cell <b>102</b> mounted on the first cooling surface <b>112</b> and the cooling fluid in the cooling channel may also affect the cooling capacity. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the cooling profile of the first cooling surface <b>112</b> may be determined by experimentation. For example, the cooling capacity at each point across the first cooling surface <b>112</b> may be measured. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the cooling profile of the first cooling surface <b>112</b> may be estimated by modeling the first cooling surface <b>112</b>.

In some embodiments of the present disclosure, to determine the cooling profile, the cooling capacity of each portion (e.g., 1 mm&#xd7;1 mm) of the first cooling surface <b>112</b> may be determined.

A first region <b>302</b> may correspond to an input port of the cooling plate <b>300</b>, while a second region <b>304</b> may correspond to an output port of the cooling plate <b>300</b>. The first region <b>302</b> and the second region <b>304</b> may be connected by a channel <b>306</b>. Cooling fluid may enter the cooling plate <b>300</b> at the input port, by region <b>302</b>, and travel along the channel <b>306</b>, before reaching the second region <b>304</b> and exiting the cooling plate <b>300</b> through the output port (i.e., in the direction indicated by the arrows). As the cooling fluid travels through the cooling plate <b>300</b>, the cooling fluid absorbs heat and becomes warmer. Accordingly, even if the arrangement of the channel <b>306</b> is optimized for a planned arrangement of the battery cells <b>102</b>, the cooling profile of the cooling plate <b>300</b> may still vary across the cooling surface of the cooling plate <b>300</b>.

In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the adhesive <b>108</b> may be a thermal interface material having a thermal conductivity that can be varied. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the adhesive <b>108</b> may include at least two different components having different thermal conductivities. For example, the adhesive <b>108</b> may include at least two different resins (e.g., an epoxy resin, a polyester resin, an acrylic resin, etc.) and a curative (e.g., a hardener or an initiator). By varying the ratio of the two resin components in the adhesive <b>108</b>, the thermal conductivity of the adhesive <b>108</b> may be varied. Of course, this is only one example, and the adhesive may have more than two different resin components having different thermal conductivities. In some embodiments, the adhesive <b>108</b> may include a resin and at least two different curatives having different thermal conductivities.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the first component of the adhesive (a first resin) may have a higher thermal conductivity than the second component of the adhesive (a second resin). For example, the first resin may have a thermal conductivity of 1.4 Watts/meter*Kelvin (W/m*K). However, this is only one example, and the first resin may have a thermal conductivity greater than or equal to <b>1</b>.<b>0</b>W/m*K. The second resin may have a thermal conductivity of <b>0</b>.<b>1</b>Wm*K. However, this is only one example, and the second resin may have a thermal conductive less than or equal to 0.3 W/m*K.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the ratio of the first resin to the second resin in the adhesive <b>108</b> may be varied based on the cooling profile of the first cooling surface <b>112</b>. By varying the ratio of the first to the second resin in the adhesive <b>108</b> based on the cooling profile of the first cooling surface <b>112</b>, the adhesive <b>108</b> may compensate for variabilities in the cooling capacity across the first cooling surface <b>112</b> and provide equal cooling to each of the battery cells <b>102</b> mounted thereon. For example, the first resin has a thermal conductivity of 1.0 Wm*K and the second resin has a thermal conductivity of 0.3 W/m*K, the thermal conductivity of the adhesive <b>108</b> may be varied from <b>0</b>.<b>3</b>W/m*K-<b>1</b>.<b>0</b>Wm*K by varying the ratio of the first resin to the second resin from 0/100 to 100/0.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the thermal conductivities of the first and second resins may be varied by doping with standard additives that are thermally conductive but electrically insulative such as alumina, boron nitride, alumina trihydrate, or magnesium hydroxide, where the latter two materials may impart added flame retardancy properties to the mixed adhesive at the cost of reduced thermal conductivity to weight ratio. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the second resin may have its viscoelastic properties modified to match that of the first resin by addition of additives with low thermal conductivities such as fumed silica or other thickeners to increase viscosity while still keeping the thermal conductivity low. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, it may be advantageous for the thermal conductivities of both of the first and second resins to be high in order to maximize the cooling provided by the first cooling surface <b>112</b>. For example, if the cooling profile of the first cooling surface <b>112</b> does not include a large amount of variation across the first cooling surface <b>112</b>, the difference between the thermal conductivities of the first and second resins may be smaller than the entire range of possible thermal conductivities.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, in order to maximize the cooling provided by the first cooling surface <b>112</b>, the adhesive <b>108</b> having the highest possible thermal conductivity should be applied to the area of the first cooling surface <b>112</b> having the lowest cooling capacity conductivity (e.g., a ratio of 100/0 of the first resin to the second resin). In some embodiments of the present disclosure, based on, e.g., limitations of the ratios of the resins or the way in which they are applied, the ratio of the first resin to the second resin may be limited to a minimum amount of the first resin or the second resin (e.g., 10/90).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, it may be advantageous to maintain the uniformity of the thickness of the cured adhesive <b>108</b> so that the battery cells <b>102</b> are spaced apart from the first cooling surface <b>112</b> by a same distance. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the thickness of the adhesive <b>108</b> may be controlled by impregnating the adhesive with glass beads (or other materials) having a predetermined size. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the thickness of the adhesive <b>108</b> may be controlled by using pre-cured adhesive standoffs to maintain the uniform distance between each of the battery cells <b>102</b> and the first cooling surface <b>112</b> while the adhesive <b>108</b> cures. Aside from securing the battery cells <b>102</b> to the first cooling surface <b>112</b> and compensating for the variabilities in cooling capacity across the first cooling surface <b>112</b>, the adhesive <b>108</b> should also maintain electrical isolation between the battery cells <b>102</b> and the first cooling surface <b>112</b> and maintain electrical isolation between each parallel connected group of the battery cells <b>102</b>. Thus, the adhesive <b>108</b> should also have sufficient dielectric properties.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows the adhesive <b>108</b> having varied thermal conductivity applied to the first cooling surface <b>112</b> of the illustrative cooling plate <b>300</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.
