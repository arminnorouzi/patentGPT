generally relates to a vehicle beam component, and more specifically relates to a tubular beam with a hollow interior, such as for use as a vehicle bumper reinforcement, a structural frame component, a battery tray component, or the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicle components are typically designed for a specific vehicle model specification with efforts to efficiently conserve and reduce mass and to meet vehicle impact and safety requirements. For example, it is known that the cross-sectional shape of a vehicle beam used as a bumper beam or structural component is generally continuous along the length of the vehicle beam and is designed to have a shape that corresponds with the desired packaging space, bending strength, and impact energy management characteristics. In the case of roll formed or stamped vehicle beams, the weld location on the cross-sectional shape can impact the component's performance. Also, different materials and manufacturing processes provide vehicle beam design constraints that are considered along with costs. One known manufacturing process is hot metal gas forming that is capable of forming high strength steel in a closed die with pressurized air blown into the interior of a steel tube. Nonetheless, vehicle beams for structural components including rockers, bumper beams, and battery tray components are susceptible to improvements that may enhance their overall performance and cost.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One aspect of the disclosure provides a vehicle beam assembly that has a hollow tubular beam that is formed with a steel tube air forming process. The vehicle beam assembly includes a pair of crush cans configured to be coupled to a vehicle frame and a hollow tubular member that is coupled to the crush cans. The tubular member includes a varied cross section along a length of the tubular member. The hollow tubular member includes a center portion having a first cross-sectional shape and a pair of end portions that extend outward from the crush cans in a direction away from the center portion, such as at an angle of 40-70 degrees. Additionally, at least one transition portion disposed between the center portion and one of the pair of end portions, and a cross-sectional shape of the center portion, a cross sectional shape of one of the end portions, and a cross-sectional shape of the transition portion are all different cross-sectional shapes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another aspect of the disclosure provides a vehicle beam assembly component that is configured to be formed with steel tube air forming. The vehicle beam assembly component includes a hollow tubular member having an integrated flange extending along a length of the tubular member. Additionally, the integrated flange includes a folded seem defined by abutting interior surfaces of adjacent wall sections of the tubular member. Moreover, the folded seem terminates at an edge of the integrated flange where the adjacent wall sections integrally interconnect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Yet another aspect of the disclosure provides a vehicle beam assembly component that includes a hollow tubular member configured to be formed with a steel tube air forming process.

<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> includes crush cans <b>12</b> that support end portions of the vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> at a frame <b>14</b> of a vehicle, such as to extend generally longitudinally on the vehicle between the back side of a bumper beam <b>16</b> and the rail tips of the vehicle frame. In other examples, the vehicle beam assembly <b>10</b> is a component for a vehicle battery tray or a vehicle rocker. Vehicles and vehicle components are typically subject to multiple crash tests during vehicle development. Various crash tests test various features of the vehicle and components at different speeds, angles, and impact objects, so as to provide energy absorption and corresponding ratings for each crash test. In some examples, a frontal crash test provides a front impact that measures the energy absorption of a vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> and the supporting crush cans <b>12</b>. In one example, such as the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> and the crush cans <b>12</b> are configured to absorb impact energy before substantial deformation or damage is done to the vehicle frame, such that the design and length of the crush can <b>12</b> and the cross-sectional shape of the vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> can alter the impact energy absorption, as shown on the force-displacement graph of the crash event.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, vehicle crash tests include a Mobile Progressive Deformable Barrier (MPDB) test. This test replicates a head-on collision between two oncoming cars at moderately high speeds. In most collisions of this type, only a part of the vehicle front width structure is involved, i.e. the two colliding vehicles are laterally offset. In the full-scale MPDB test, the test vehicle is driven at 50 km/h and with 50 percent overlap into a deformable barrier also travelling at 50 km/h. The barrier represents the front end of another vehicle, getting progressively stiffer the more it is deformed. The test replicates a crash between the test vehicle and a typical mid-size car. It has been found that a beam component having a sharp edge or corner does not give the desired results of the MPDB test. Also, beam components having a relatively small height at the section contacting the barrier do not perform well in this test.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to the drawings and the illustrative examples depicted therein, a vehicle beam assembly is provided with at least one beam component that is formed with a process that involves hot metal gas forming or steel tube air forming (STAF). Traditionally, high strength beams formed in roll form mills have design constraints based on the hardness or ductility of the metal and typically have a consistent cross-sectional shape along the length of the beam. In some examples of the disclosure, the vehicle beam assembly may include a hollow tubular member that has a flange extending along a length of the tubular member, where the flange includes a folded seem defined by abutting interior surfaces adjacent wall sections of the tubular member. The folded seem terminates at an edge of the flange where the adjacent wall sections integrally interconnect. In some examples, the flange can include a different size and different position along the length of the beam. Such a flange is generally not capable of being formed with the same material in a roll forming process. Moreover, in some examples, the vehicle beam assembly may include a hollow tubular member with a varied cross section along its length, such as to provide a cross section tailored for the crash impact energy demands, packaging constraints, and accessory attachments at the corresponding section of the length.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E</figref>, the vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> is provided that has a hollow tubular member <b>20</b>, which in some examples may also be referred to as a bumper beam.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The hollow tubular member <b>20</b> has a varied cross section along its length that is produced by a steel tube air forming (STAF) process. In some examples, the STAF process includes resistance heating, high pressure air injection, forming and hardening. This process makes it possible to perform the integrated forming of the tubular member <b>20</b> and a flange <b>18</b>, unlike traditional welding methods, the STAF system improves rigidity and simplifies the overall production process. The STAF process allows for a varied cross section along a single tubular member <b>20</b> and also results in a component that has a high strength and high rigidity. While varied cross sectional shapes can be obtained other ways, including but not limited to hot stamping, cold pressing, and hydroforming, each of these result in a component having either low strength, low rigidity, or both.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to the drawings and the illustrative examples depicted therein, a vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> may include a pair of crush cans <b>12</b> configured to be coupled to a vehicle frame and a tubular member <b>20</b> configured to be coupled to the pair of crush cans <b>12</b>. The crush cans <b>12</b> are coupled with and support end portion <b>24</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b> at a frame of a vehicle <b>10</b>, such as to extend generally longitudinally on the vehicle between the back side of the tubular member <b>20</b> and the rail tips of the vehicle frame. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the crush cans <b>12</b> are approximately equidistant from a vertical centerline of the tubular member <b>20</b>. However, in other examples, the crush cans <b>12</b> may be offset from being equidistant from the vertical centerline of a tubular member <b>20</b>. Additionally, the end portion <b>24</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b> extend horizontally past the crush cans <b>12</b> and curve rearward, such as to reduce sharp corners or edges of the tubular member <b>20</b> that may contact the impacted object near the crush can. The crush cans <b>12</b> and the tubular member <b>20</b> may include a coupling plate or other coupling portions therebetween to assist in the coupling between the crush cans <b>12</b> and the tubular member <b>20</b>. However, it is also contemplated that the crush cans <b>12</b> may be directly coupled to the tubular member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, the tubular member <b>20</b> define a hollow interior. It is contemplated that the tubular member <b>20</b> may have a consistent profile shape along its entire length when viewed from the front or rear. Additionally, the cross-sectional shape of tubular member <b>20</b> or the tubular section alone may include, but is not limited to a rectangular shape, a B-shape, a D-shape, a C-shape, or a b-shape. The length of the tubular member <b>20</b> may be curved, such as to conform to the front packaging space of a certain vehicle. For example, the tubular member <b>20</b> may include various sections along its length with differing degrees of curvature, including relatively straight sections and sections with relatively tight curvatures. The length of the tubular member <b>20</b> includes a center portion <b>22</b>, two end portions <b>24</b>, and transition portions <b>26</b> between the center portion <b>22</b> and each of the two end portions <b>24</b>. In some examples, the profile of the end portion <b>24</b> and transition portions <b>26</b> is the same as the profile of the center portion <b>22</b>, when viewed from the front or rear. In other examples, the profile of one or more of the end portions <b>24</b>, the transition portions <b>26</b>, or the center portion <b>22</b> may have varying profiles.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The cross-sectional shape of the tubular member <b>20</b> is formed to generally enclose the hollow interior of the tubular member <b>20</b>. The tubular member <b>20</b> includes a rear wall <b>49</b>, an upper wall <b>50</b>, a lower wall <b>52</b>, and a front wall <b>47</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b>. The front wall <b>47</b> forms the front face of the tubular member <b>20</b>. Impact loads applied to the front face are directed rearward along the upper and lower wall <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, a front wall <b>47</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b> includes at least one stiffening channel <b>39</b> defined therein. The stiffening channel <b>39</b> or channels <b>39</b> may be configured to provide additional strength and stiffening to the tubular member <b>20</b>. In some examples, the stiffening channel <b>39</b> extends continuously along the length of the tubular member <b>20</b>. In the example shown, the tubular member <b>20</b> includes an upper stiffening channel <b>39</b> and a lower stiffening channel <b>39</b> disposed approximately equidistant from a center of the front face. However, various other locations have been contemplated. In additional examples, more or less than two stiffening channels <b>39</b> may be provided at the front face. Additionally, in the example shown, the stiffening channels <b>39</b> have a generally curved profile provided a rounded stiffening channel <b>39</b>, however, various other configurations have been contemplated including more sharp transitions of the stiffening channels <b>39</b> such that a more angular stiffening channel <b>39</b> is realized.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some examples, the rear wall <b>49</b> may also be a generally smooth rectangular surface and/or include stiffening features as described above. Moreover, the upper wall <b>50</b> and the lower wall <b>52</b> may be generally smooth rectangular surfaces extending parallel to one another along the length of the tubular member <b>20</b>. In some examples, the upper and/or lower wall <b>52</b> may include apertures or other features which facilitate the coupling of additional components.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The vehicle beam assembly component <b>10</b> may include one or more flanges <b>18</b> formed on the beam with the material that the forms the beams. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>D and <b>2</b>E</figref>, the upper and lower flanges <b>18</b> extend along a length of the tubular member <b>20</b>, where the flanges <b>18</b> include a folded seem defined by abutting interior surfaces adjacent wall sections of the tubular member. The folded seem terminates at an edge of the flange <b>18</b> where the front wall is aligned with and integrally extends into the flange <b>18</b>. It is also contemplated that one or more flanges may be integrally formed with the vehicle beam component, such that one or more flanges are integral with the vehicle beam component, such as to replace individually attached brackets.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E</figref>, the hollow tubular member <b>20</b> includes a center portion <b>22</b> having a first cross-sectional shape and end portions <b>24</b> that have a second cross-sectional shape. In some examples, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, the first cross-sectional shape is a D shape. In other examples, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>, the first-cross sectional shape is a B shape. Other first cross-sectional shapes have also been contemplated including but not limited to C orb shapes. The second cross-sectional shape at the end portions <b>24</b> is different than the first cross-sectional shape, and in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> the second cross-sectional shape is a B shape. In additional examples, the end portions <b>24</b> may have different cross-sectional shapes, such as a C shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>, a D shape, a B shape, a b shape, a d shape, or other conceivable shape or dimensional differences from the cross-sectional shape at the center portion of the beam. Moreover, it is contemplated that one of the end portions <b>24</b> may have a different cross sectional shape than the other end portion <b>24</b>, if desired.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C and <b>3</b></figref>, the tubular member <b>20</b> also includes at least one transition portion <b>26</b> disposed between the center portion <b>22</b> and the end portions <b>24</b>. The transition portion <b>26</b> includes a third cross-sectional shape or shapes that transitionally interconnect the first and second cross-sectional shapes along the length of the tubular member <b>20</b>. As such, the cross-sectional shape or shapes along the transition portion <b>26</b> may be intermediate transitional shapes that form when altering the cross-sectional profile of a tube between the first and second cross-sectional shapes and thus are similar to the first or second cross-sectional shapes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the transition portion <b>26</b> tapers in depth as the beam extends outboard from the D-shape of the center portion <b>22</b> to the B-shape of the end portions <b>24</b>. In addition, as the transition portion <b>26</b> extends outboard from the center portion <b>22</b>, the cross-sectional shape begins to form a recess in the shape of channel <b>34</b> at the rear wall to divide the upper portion <b>30</b> from the lower portion <b>32</b>. The channel <b>34</b> increases in depth outboard from the center portion <b>22</b> simultaneously with the reduction in depth of the overall cross-sectional shape until the base of the channel <b>34</b> contacts the front wall of the beam. When the channel <b>34</b> contacts and engages the front wall of the beam, the upper portion forms a top tube <b>30</b> and the lower portion forms the bottom tube <b>32</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b>. In additional examples, the transition portion and features thereof, including the channel, may vary in depth, width, or other shapes or dimensions at different rates along the length, such as in a linear, an exponential, or a stepped rate in change in formation along the length of the transition portion <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The length of the transition portion <b>26</b> may depend upon the degree of difference between the cross-sectional shapes interconnected by the transition portion, such as the first and second cross-sectional shapes of the center and end portions <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E and <b>3</b></figref>. The length of the transition portion may also have a length and location along the length of the beam that is tailored for the desired impact energy absorption characteristics at that section. For example, the length of the transition portion may be shorted when the energy absorption characteristics of its profile are undesirable and or alternatively located over the crush cans in such a situation. In addition, it is contemplated that the transition portion may assume a cross-sectional shape that is not an intermediate transitional shape between the first and second cross-sectional shapes. For instance, in one example, the third cross-sectional shape is a C shape. In another example, the third cross-sectional shape is a b shape. In yet another example, the third cross-sectional shape is a B shape. Other second cross-sectional shapes have also been contemplated including but not limited to a D shape or a d shape. Additionally, the transition portion may include at least one recess or channel. The recess may be configured to allow engagement of the crush can or another feature of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E</figref>, the tubular member <b>20</b> includes end portions <b>24</b> having the second cross-sectional shape as a B shape. The end portions <b>24</b> include a top tubular member portion <b>30</b> and bottom tubular member portion <b>32</b> separated by an indented section <b>34</b> which forms the B cross-sectional shape (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the indented section <b>34</b> is disposed on the surface of the tubular member <b>20</b> which engages the crush can <b>12</b>. The tubular member <b>20</b> also includes the center portion <b>22</b> having a D cross sectional shape such that the indented section <b>34</b> does not extend into the center portion <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>). Between the center portion <b>22</b> and the end portions <b>24</b> is the transition portion <b>26</b> which may include a partially indented section <b>34</b> that tapers as it extends towards the center portion <b>22</b>. As described above, the transition portion <b>26</b> has a cross sectional shape that is different from both the first cross sectional shape of the center portion <b>22</b> and the second cross-sectional shape of the end portions <b>24</b>. The transition portion <b>26</b> may include one or more recessed portions <b>38</b> configured to engage one or more other components of the bumper assembly. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> the tubular member <b>20</b> may include one or more stiffening channels <b>40</b> extending across the length of a surface opposite of the surface which engages the crush cans <b>12</b> and disposed at the front of the vehicle. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, two stiffening channels <b>40</b> extend parallel along the length of the tubular member <b>20</b>. However, more or less stiffening channels <b>40</b> have been contemplated.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As described above, sharp component corners, such as end edges of bumper beams, do not perform well in the MPDB test. Accordingly, the end portions <b>24</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b> extend past corresponding crush cans <b>12</b> in a direction away from the center portion <b>22</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>6</b>, <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>E, and <b>11</b>A-<b>12</b>E</figref>. In other words, at least a portion of a length of the tubular member <b>20</b>, and more specifically the end portions <b>24</b> of the tubular member <b>20</b> extend further than the crush cans <b>12</b> on either side. Moreover, to further prevent sharp corners, the end portions <b>24</b> extend at an angle from the center portion <b>22</b>, such as to reduce the inaction of the end edges with the impact barrier. In one example, the end portions <b>24</b> extend at an angle of approximately 30-80 degrees. In another example, the end portions <b>24</b> extend at an angle of approximately 40-70 degrees. In yet another example, the end portions <b>24</b> extend at an angle of approximately 50-60 degrees. In yet another example, the end portions <b>24</b> extend at an angle of approximately 55 degrees. The end portions <b>24</b> may also have a curvature that extends from and through the transition portion to an intermediate area or to the distal end of the end portion.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the end portion <b>24</b> of the tubular member includes a reduced depth in comparison to the center portion <b>22</b>, such that the additional rearward angle and reduced depth at the end portion <b>24</b> allows the bumper beam to be packaged within vehicle fascia that would not otherwise permit the packing of a bumper beam having a constant cross-sectional shape along its length, as shown in dashed lines. The depth of the tubular member <b>20</b> tapers along the transition portion <b>26</b> to provide the reduced section depth at the end portion <b>24</b>, which has a generally constant depth. The curvature of the tubular member <b>20</b> increases from the generally straight center portion <b>22</b> to the transition portion <b>26</b> and a curvature is present in the end portion <b>24</b>. It is also contemplated that in some examples that the curvature is present exclusively at the transition portion, such that the end portions are generally straight.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the transition portion <b>26</b>&#x2032; similarly has a reduced section depth that tapers outboard from the center portion <b>22</b>&#x2032; toward the end portions <b>24</b>&#x2032;. In contrast to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> where the tapered depth was used to move the front face of the beam at the end portions inboard in the vehicle for allowing the end portions to extend further within the provided packaging space, the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> moves the rear face of the tubular member <b>20</b>&#x2032; forward in the vehicle at the transition portion <b>26</b>&#x2032; and end portions <b>24</b>&#x2032; so as to provide additional space for a longer crush can <b>12</b>&#x2032;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. The longer crush can <b>12</b>&#x2032; increases the available crush stroke by the distance and thereby the increases potential energy absorption at the crush can <b>12</b>&#x2032;, which is configured to crush and fail during impact before the vehicle frame <b>14</b>&#x2032; is substantially loaded or subjected to potentially damaging impact forces. Also, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the shallow section depth enables a tighter sweep or increased curvature (i.e., a smaller radius of curvature) at the end section. The depth difference is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> as shown between L2 and L3, showing that a rear wall without the reduced section depth at L3 effectively has a greater compressive forces than the rear wall at L2, while each maintain the same curvature at the front wall of the beam. The greater compressive forces at the rear wall with a section depth of L3 is shown to cause sheet wrinkling, which is generally undesirable.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the rear face of the bumper tubular member <b>20</b> formed with the STAF process is generally void of wrinkling or bowing, which is commonly caused by bending a beam in a post-forming operation, such as a sweep unit or an off-line bender. By providing the bumper tubular member <b>20</b> without such wrinkles or bowing, the rear face of the beam is generally planar and thereby an effective surface for welding. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the crush can is welded directly to the rear face of the beam, omitting an interface plate that is commonly used with roll formed beams and thereby eliminating the weight and processing requirements for the interface plate.

It may also be advantageous in some examples to configure the engagement portions of the beam that attach to the crush cans to further improve energy absorption, such as by providing an recessed area at the rear side of the beam to receive the crush can. As shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref> the use of a beam with a rectangular cross section at the crush can attachment may result in some inefficiency of energy absorption during impact. This inefficiency may be resolved by reducing the effective depth of the beam at the crush can engagement, such as with a reduced depth as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> or an alternative section, for instance a C-shaped section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>E, <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>E, and <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B</figref>, the tubular member <b>416</b> may also or alternatively include integrally formed crush can attachment features at select areas of the end portions <b>424</b> of the tubular member.

Such a recessed area may also result in flanges <b>418</b> being formed above and below the recessed surface. The flanges may also be used to provide a surface with an improved weld condition for attaching the crush can.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Also, in some examples, the tubular member may include at least one local deformation at a select section along the length of the beam. In some examples, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the deformation at the top wall provided between a front flange <b>518</b><i>a </i>and a rear flange <b>518</b><i>b </i>provides front and rear mounting surfaces for a tow hook bushing. In doing this, front and rear plates used to hold a bushing in a beam may be generally omitted. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a front flange <b>618</b> may be integrally disposed on the beam <b>620</b> and extend upward from the front face in a manner that allows brackets to be omitted, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. Such a front flange <b>618</b> may provide an improved energy absorption by the top wall of the beam, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> in comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. In additional examples, the beam has local tailoring, such as with an angled shape to the wall as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, to provide improved impact absorption, such as improved from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Moreover, the local deformation may provide clearance for adjacent vehicle components during crush caused by impact.
