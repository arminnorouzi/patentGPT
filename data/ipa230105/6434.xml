In general, a GFCI device detects when current flowing from the positive side of the power source (e.g., an AC voltage source, or the like) is different than the current returning to the negative side of the power source. GFCIs are often used in locations where electric current might find an alternative path to return to ground (e.g., near water, grounded metal structures, or the like). GFCI devices may be used to shut off a circuit to prevent unwanted shocks or electrocution due to the current traveling along an unintended path. Accordingly, the installation of GFCI devices in certain locations is often mandated by different safety standards. Additionally, these safety standards often specify what types of devices are suitable to be installed in such locations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some standards exist that specify minimum requirements for the function, construction, performance, and markings of GFCI devices. For example, Underwriter's Laboratories (UL) 943C standard is used for class C and D GFCI devices, while UL943 standard is used for Class A GFCI devices. UL 943C specifies that a GFCI device must satisfy at least the following performance requirements: (1) the GFCI must be able to withstand line transients of 6 kV and 3 kA as defined by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61000-4-5; (2) the GFCI must be able to pass a 2200 Volt AC dielectric test for 60 seconds; (3) the GFCI must have a ground-fault trip level of 20 mA (e.g., for class C and D GFCI; 6mA for class A GFCI); (4) the GFCI must have a trip time that is less than the inverse time curve defined for GFCI devices and must not exceed 20 ms for high ground-fault currents; (5) the GFCI must be able to withstand a 5 kA short-circuit fault; (6) the GFCI must be able to function from 85% to 110% voltage for a given load, such as 60 A or 100 A, applied over a temperature range of &#x2212;35&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C; (7) the GFCI must be able to monitor load-side ground continuity (e.g., for class C and D GFCI) ; and (8) the GFCI must include a ground-fault test function.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would therefore be desirable to provide a GFCI device that meets or exceeds the minimum requirements set forth in such standards.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

The devices and methods, however, may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the system and method to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an improved protection device (e.g., GFCI) capable of meeting the trip time requirements of UL943(C) while using an AC contactor with inconsistent contact opening time. Unlike prior approaches in which a fast DC contactor with consistent contact opening time is used, the AC contactor of the present embodiments provides reduced average opening times by delaying the trip decision to a known optimum interval calculated respect to a voltage A/C (VAC) line voltage zero cross point. By delaying the disconnect and only tripping the AC contactor in a defined trip zone, the average contactor opening time can be reduced (e.g., by 1 ms).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, embodiments of the present disclosure may advantageously provide devices with a low-computational complexity half-wave DFT filter to attenuate odd harmonics.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Still furthermore, embodiments of the present disclosure may advantageously provide detection of a status (e.g., open/closed) of the AC contactor and of AC contactor chatter. Unlike prior approaches in which an auxiliary contact is used, devices herein may include a contactor coil current monitoring circuit and a microprocessor to monitor current of a coil of the AC contactor. The contactor status and chatter may be estimated from the contactor coil current.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Still furthermore, embodiments of the present disclosure may advantageously provide continuous non-destructive auto-monitoring that allows for automatic testing of the ability of the device to respond to a ground fault. Unlike prior approaches in which an artificial fault current is generated at regular intervals (e.g., every hour) to check the health of a current transformer and the CT current condition circuit, devices herein provide a continuous fault current (e.g., 1 mA, 300 Hz), which is generated to check the health of the current transformer and the CT current condition circuit. In some embodiments, the DFT filter attenuates this signal to a level which can be ignored even in a GFCI with a ground-fault trip level of 6 mA, for example. Advantageously, the testing may be done without opening the AC contactor and without compromising the ability of the GFCI to respond to a ground fault.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a block diagram of an exemplary three-phase GFCI device (hereinafter &#x201c;device&#x201d;) <b>100</b> in accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated.

The zero cross interrupt may be considered valid (i.e., not triggered by noise) if the time between two consecutive interrupts is in a specific range (e.g., 8.33 ms&#xb1;0.5 ms for the 60 Hz frequency). Otherwise, it is considered as not detected and a virtual ZC interrupt (e.g., with a period of 8.33 ms for the 60 Hz frequency) is generated by an internal virtual ZC timer <b>133</b>A to ensure the average opening time is still minimum. If ZC interrupts are missing for more than 2 s, for example, the CC circuit <b>114</b> and the microprocessor <b>133</b> may output a voltage signal to cause the contactors <b>134</b> to open and will indicate a diagnostic error.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this example, an average opening time of the AC contactor <b>112</b> may be minimized by delaying the trip decision to a known optimum interval (&#x201c;trip zone&#x201d;).

Furthermore, the auto-monitoring function does not compromise the ability of the device <b>100</b> to respond to a ground fault. Although non-limiting, in some embodiments, a continuous 1 mA, 300 Hz fault current may be generated to check the health of the CT <b>110</b> and the CTCC circuit <b>127</b>.

In this embodiment, the auto test signal <b>800</b> may be a PWM signal with a carrier frequency of 17316 Hz consisting of a sinusoidal auto test signal with amplitude of 1 mA, a frequency of 300 Hz, which is continuously injected through the CT <b>110</b>. The CT <b>110</b> and a low-pass anti-aliasing filter may smooth out the PWM signal <b>800</b> to a sinusoidal auto test signal. If the firmware does not detect the auto test signal, it trips the AC contactor <b>112</b> and indicates a diagnostic error. In some embodiments, the frequency of the PWM auto test signal <b>800</b> is selected in a way that the DFT algorithm rejects it in the normal operation, 300 Hz in a 60 Hz network, for example. The auto test signal may be disabled, e.g., for 2.5 seconds after the AC contactor <b>112</b> closes and during the time that the GF test signal is activated.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Embodiments of the present disclosure may use the absolute value of the difference between the two most recent GF ADC samples to detect the auto test signal.

If the absolute value of the difference value is less than the threshold value (e.g., 5LSB), then an auto test signal missing timer starts to count. If this timer reaches a threshold (e.g., 500 ms), a trip will be triggered and a diagnostic error indicated.
