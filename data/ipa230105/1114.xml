Residue accumulation may adversely affect e-vaping device performance, based on affecting the rate of vapor formation, increasing the probability of chemical reactions between the residue and one or more elements of the e-vaping device, affecting the elements included in a formed vapor, affecting the amount of vapor formed by the e-vaping device during vapings, some combination thereof, or the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some cases, e-vaping devices may be manufactured via mass-production.
