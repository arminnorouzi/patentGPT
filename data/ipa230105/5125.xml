Each secondary circuit may be associated with a circuit breaker and/or switch that electrically couples the secondary circuit to the main electrical input, and may also serve as an overcurrent protector (or other failsafe). The electrical panel may be capable of supporting numerous secondary circuits based on a variety of factors including panel loading. In-service electrical panels come in a variety of configurations, including having a number of secondary circuits that may be less than the maximum number of secondary circuits that the particular in-service panel is capable of supporting. As such, in-service electrical panels may be capable of supporting the electrical load and associated mechanical components for additional secondary circuits, such as a secondary circuit associated with an electric vehicle charging station. However, facility-specific electrical characteristics, such as existing loads, cable sizes, and service capacities may hinder the ability to determine whether another secondary circuit can be added and/or whether the load requirements of the circuit, such as that for an electrical vehicle charging station (or other use), are compatible with the existing infrastructure. There is a constant need for systems and techniques for analysis of electric panels.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for analyzing an electrical panel.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example, a method of determining a capability of an electrical panel is disclosed. The method includes providing information relative to the electrical panel to a computer vision software. The method further incudes analyzing, using the computer vision software, an attribute of the electrical panel at least partially based on the information. The method further includes calculating an overall electrical power capacity of the electrical panel based at least in part on the attribute of the electrical panel. The method further includes calculating an electrical load on the electrical panel based at least in part on the attribute of the electrical panel. The method further includes generating a report comprising an unused electrical power capacity of the electrical panel at least partially based on the electrical load and the overall electrical power capacity of the electrical panel. The information provided to the computer vision software includes a digital image of the electrical panel. The digital image depicts a plurality of circuit breakers. Each circuit breaker of the plurality of circuit breakers has one or more symbols identifiable by the computing device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, analyzing the attribute of the electrical panel can comprise identifying characteristics of each electrical breaker electrically coupled to the electrical panel based on the one or more symbols. The characteristics of the electrical breaker can comprise at least one of a voltage rating, an amperage rating, a single pole configuration, a double pole configuration, and a tandem breaker configuration. In some cases, analyzing the attribute of the electrical panel at least partially based on the information includes at least one of: (i) identifying, using the computer vision software, operational characteristics of each circuit breaker based at least in part on the one or more symbols corresponding to each circuit breaker; and/or (ii) identifying, using the computer vision software, an amount of vacant breaker slots on the electrical panel; and/or (iii) identifying, using the computer vision software, a make, model, and/or type (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) of the electrical panel; and/or (iv) identifying a geographic location at which the digital image was taken.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, calculating the electrical load on the electrical panel may include estimating an average electrical power provided by the electrical panel to loads connected to the electrical panel. In some cases, calculating the overall electrical power capacity of the electrical panel is at least partially based on the operational characteristics of each circuit breaker and a number of vacant electrical breaker slots within the electrical panel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, calculating the unused electrical power capacity may include comparing the electrical load on the electrical panel to the overall electrical power capacity of the electrical panel. In some cases, estimating the average electrical power provided by the electrical panel is at least partially based on historical electrical power provided to the electrical panel. Further, the power capacity of the panel may be determined or influenced based on: (i) the rating of the panel itself based on the construction, the material, or design; (ii) the rating of the main breaker, typically sized based on the main service wires coming into the panel; and/or (iii) the main service wires coming in (e.g., the service capacity). In each of these cases, these are directly related to assessing whether an electrical service/panel upgrade is necessary in order to support additional loads, such as additional loads associated with electrical vehicle charging stations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, the method may further include transmitting, automatically, the report to at least one of: an owner of the electrical panel, an energy management provider, a municipality, or a supplier of electric vehicle charging equipment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, the method may further include requesting supplementary information associated with the electrical panel, such as requesting information from a utility, an owner of the panel, a municipality, and so on in order to supplement the electrical panel analysis, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another example, the method may further include training the computer vision software to identify a type of an electrical panel or a type of an electrical breaker.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, a computing device for determining a capability of an electrical panel is disclosed. The computing device includes a processor. The computing device further includes a memory in electronic communication with the processor. The memory stores computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of providing a digital image of the electrical panel to an image recognition module. The memory stores further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of identifying, using the digital image recognition module, an amperage rating of each electrical breaker of a plurality of electrical breakers disposed within the electrical panel. The memory stores further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of calculating an electrical capacity of the electrical panel based at least in part on the amperage rating of each electrical breaker. The memory stores computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of generating a report comprising the capability of the electrical panel at least partially based on the electrical capacity of the electrical panel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another example, calculating the electrical capacity of the electrical panel may include weighting the amperage rating of each electrical breaker to determine a weighted amperage rating for each electrical breaker. Calculating the electrical capacity of the electrical panel may further include estimating an average power provided by each electrical breaker. Calculating the electrical capacity of the electrical panel may further include summing the average power provided by each electrical breaker to estimate a total average power provided by the electrical panel. Calculating the electrical capacity of the electrical panel may further include comparing the total average power to a maximum power output value of the electrical panel. The maximum power output value being at least partially based on one or more vacant electrical breaker slots within the electrical panel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example, the memory may store further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of comparing the estimated total average power to historical power usage data of the electrical panel. The memory may store further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of identifying, using the image recognition module, a date the electrical panel was manufactured. The memory may store further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of identifying, using the image recognition module, a manufacturer of the electrical panel. The memory may store further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of identifying, using the image recognition module, a model of the electrical panel. The memory may store further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of identifying a construction date of a building to which the electrical panel provides power. The memory may store further computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the step of identifying a type of building in which the electrical panel is disposed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another example, the report includes at least one of: (i) information relating to building code compliance or noncompliance; and/or (ii) information relating to modifications to the electrical panel required to support an electric vehicle charging circuit; and/or (iii) information relating to a type or quantity of electric vehicle charging circuits that can be supported by the electrical panel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another example, the digital image depicts the plurality of electrical breakers. Each electrical breaker of the plurality of electrical breakers may have one or more symbols identifiable by the image recognition software. In some cases, the processor is configured to rotate a portion of the digital image depicting the electrical breaker prior to identifying the one or more symbols.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another example, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing computer executable instructions is disclosed that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform the step of providing information relative to an electrical panel to an image recognition software. The computer executable instructions further cause the processor to perform the step of analyzing, using the image recognition software, an attribute of the electrical panel at least partially based on the information. The computer executable instructions further cause the processor to perform the step of calculating an electrical power capacity of the electrical panel based at least in part on the attribute of the electrical panel. The computer executable instructions further cause the processor to perform the step of generating a report comprising the capability of the electrical panel at least partially based on the electrical capacity of the electrical panel.

The characteristics of the electrical breaker may include at least one of a voltage rating, an amperage rating, a single pole configuration, a double pole configuration, tandem breakers and/or substantially any other characteristic or component of the electrical panel. In some cases, the image recognition software may include a deep learning convolutional neural network model.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another example, calculating the electrical capacity of the electrical panel may include determining a maximum electrical power output of the panel based at least in part on the attribute of the electrical panel. Calculating the electrical capacity of the electrical panel may further include estimating an average electrical power output of the electrical panel based at least in part on the attribute of the electrical panel. Calculating the electrical capacity of the electrical panel may further include comparing the maximum electrical power output to the average electrical power output to determine the electrical capacity. In some cases, estimating an average electrical power output of the electrical panel may be further based on an estimated seasonal load of an electrical breaker electrically coupled to the electrical panel.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another example, the report may include a recommendation for modifying the electrical panel to increase the electrical capacity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition to the exemplary aspects and embodiments described above, further aspects and embodiments will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by study of the following description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The disclosure will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements, and in which:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of an electrical system, including a meter, an electrical panel, and associated secondary circuits;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of a panel analysis module;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts an image of a panel;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts a representation of the image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> with an overlay associated with an image recognition operation;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts a portion of the representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> taken at detail <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> depicts the portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in a first orientation;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> depicts the portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in a second orientation;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> depicts an image of another panel;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts a portion of the image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> associated with an image recognition operation;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for generating and sending an electrical panel capacity report;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for evaluating a panel upgrade;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an example user interface associated with an electrical panel capacity report; and</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an example schematic diagram of a computer system for implementing various techniques in the examples described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The description that follows includes sample systems, methods, and apparatuses that embody various elements of the present disclosure. However, it should be understood that the described disclosure may be practiced in a variety of forms in addition to those described herein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The following disclosure relates generally to systems and techniques for analyzing an electrical panel. An electrical panel may broadly encompass any collections of components configured to divide an input electrical power to multiple secondary circuits. Without limitation, the electrical panel may include or be or encompass an electrical box, switchgears, disconnect switches, breakers, overcurrent protectors (or other failsafe devices), grounding components, and associated circuity that cooperate to divide the input electrical power. In one example, the electrical panel may be a residential panel, a commercial panel, an industrial panel or substantially any other type of panel that may be associated with a use or structure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An electrical panel of any type may be generally capable of supporting numerous secondary circuits based on multiple factors including panel loading. In-service electrical panels come in a variety of configurations and may have a number of secondary circuits that may be less than the maximum number of secondary circuits that the particular panel is capable of supporting. As such, in-service electrical panels may be capable of supporting the electrical load and associated mechanical components for additional secondary circuits, such as a secondary circuit associated with an electric vehicle charging station.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, electric vehicles may be charged by plugging in or otherwise electrically coupling the vehicle with a charging station. Electric vehicle use and adoption may be limited by the availability of the charging station or other infrastructure for transferring power to the vehicle. It may therefore be desirable to incorporate a charging station with an existing in-service electrical panel. However, facility-specific electrical characteristics of a given panel, such as existing loads, cable sizes, and service capacities may hinder the ability to determine whether another secondary circuit can be added and/or whether the load requirements of the circuit, such as that for an electrical vehicle charging station (or other use), are compatible with the panel.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The systems and techniques of the present disclosure may mitigate such hindrances, in part, by using image recognition and analysis to determine the condition of the panel and suitability of the panel for additional secondary circuits, such as those associated with a charging station. Broadly, an analysis module, such as that of a computer vision software, may be used to analyze the physical configuration of a given in-service panel. Based on the image of the existing equipment, the analysis module may assess facility-specific electrical characteristics such as existing loads, breaker characteristics, panel characteristics, cable sizes, and service capacities. Such assessment may provide information that can be used to determine the suitability of the panel to support a charging station. Sample elements analyzed by the analysis module include, without limitation, electrical load capacity, availability at the panel for additional circuits, utility service voltage, and amperage rating, among others. The image recognition, analysis, determination, and associated functions may be supported by artificial intelligence, including deep learning modules, in order to promote a streamlined and at-least semi-automated charging station installation process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one implementation, the systems and techniques described herein may use deep learning image recognition technology to recognize different areas of interest on the panel. Sample areas of interest may include, without limitation, a main switch, a single switch, a double pole switch, empty slots, and so on. Each area of interest may in turn be analyzed, such as through optical character recognition (OCR), to recognize important text of the area of interest, including text associated with an amperage of the recognized component. Particular attributes of electrical panel of interest may be calculated including, without limitation, an overall electrical power capacity, an electrical load of the panel, and an unused electrical power capacity. Electrical vehicle charging station specific logic may be implement in order to make a recommendation regarding whether a specific charging station (and/or use with a particular electrical vehicle) may be suitable for installation at the electrical panel of interest. Image metadata may also be used to enhance the analysis. For example, information can be optionally extracted from the image or associated data to identify various tags, such as global positioning system (GPS)/latitude-longitude coordinates, image settings, or dates, some or all of which may be used to evaluate regional specific attributes (e.g., utility, service/building type) or improve OCR by means of preprocessing image adjustments (e.g., detecting a language or regional library/dictionary of words or abbreviations in the image).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which assist in illustrating various features of the present disclosure. The following description is presented for purposes of illustration and description. Furthermore, the description is not intended to limit the inventive aspects to the forms disclosed herein. Consequently, variations and modifications commensurate with the following teachings, and skill and knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present inventive aspects.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a block diagram of an electrical system <b>100</b> is depicted. The sample electrical system <b>100</b> may be associated with a residential, commercial, industrial, or other appropriate use. The systems and techniques described herein may be configured to analyze the electrical system <b>100</b> or components thereof for determining, among other items, whether an electric vehicle charging station may be added to the electrical system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electrical system includes a meter <b>104</b>, an electrical panel <b>108</b>, and secondary circuits <b>112</b>. The meter <b>104</b> may monitor a flow of electric input power to the electrical panel <b>108</b>. The meter <b>104</b> may therefore be associated with a main power supply or other power source, such as that associated with a power grid, solar/battery array, and so on. The electrical panel <b>108</b>, as described herein, includes any collection of components configured to divide the input electrical power and cause or allow the divided power to reach one or more secondary circuits, such as the secondary circuits <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The secondary circuits <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a first circuit <b>112</b><i>a, </i>a second circuit <b>112</b><i>b, </i>and a third circuit <b>112</b><i>c. </i>Each of the secondary circuits <b>112</b> may be used to supply electrical power to a designated area/for a designated purpose. In the case of a residential installation, each secondary circuit may serve a particular room (e.g., kitchen), collection of rooms (e.g., upstairs bedrooms), appliance (e.g., clothes dryers), and so on. In the example system <b>100</b>, the first circuit <b>112</b><i>a, </i>second circuit <b>112</b><i>b, </i>and the third circuit <b>112</b><i>c </i>may be existing, in-use secondary circuits of the electrical panel <b>108</b>. The electrical panel <b>108</b> may or may not be capable of supporting (e.g., physically with space requirements and electrically with respect to load) additional secondary circuits, such as one or more secondary circuits associated with an electrical vehicle charging station.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows charging circuit(s) <b>116</b> as optionally being associated with the secondary circuits <b>112</b>. The charging circuit(s) <b>116</b> may be representative of circuits used to provide electrical power to an electrical vehicle charging station. Because the electrical panel <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is in-use, the charging circuit(s) <b>116</b> may not necessarily be appropriate for installation with the electrical panel <b>108</b>. For example, the electrical panel <b>108</b> may be physically unable to accommodate an additional breaker and associated components that would facilitate the division of the power supply by the electrical panel <b>108</b> to the charging circuit(s) <b>116</b>. As another example, the electrical panel <b>108</b> may be unable to safely accommodate an electrical load associated with the charging circuit(s) <b>116</b>/charging of an electric vehicle at the charging station.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The system and techniques of the present disclosure may be used to analyze an electrical panel, such as the electrical panel <b>108</b>, in order to determine whether the charging circuit(s) can be added. To facilitate the foregoing, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of a panel analysis module <b>200</b> according to examples of the present disclosure. The analysis module <b>200</b> may be configured to execute one or more functions described herein for analyzing the electrical panel. The analysis module <b>200</b> may be executed, in one implementation, via a computing device, including a mobile computing device, such as that described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The panel analysis module <b>200</b> is shown as including an image recognition module <b>204</b>, a data module <b>208</b>, a calculation module <b>212</b>, a reporting module <b>216</b>, and a communication module <b>220</b>. For purposes of illustration, the image recognition module <b>204</b> may be used to collect images of electrical panels. In some cases, the images may be used to initially establish a dataset that can be used to train the deep learning image detector and/or other artificial intelligence based learning module. In other cases, commercially available, crowdsourced, or otherwise preexisting datasets may be used. Numerous images of various different styles and manufacturers of electrical panels for deep learning training may increase the reliability and accuracy of panel detection. For example, the image recognition module <b>204</b> may be used to train the image detector to recognize various notable aspects or features of an electrical panel (e.g., main breaker switch, single pole breakers, empty slots, double pole breakers, and stamped voltage indicators). In some cases, a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model may be used for image recognition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this regard, the image recognition module <b>204</b> may also be configured to process a new image of an in-service panel and recognize one or more features of the panel, in part, using the deep learning image detector, as trained based on the panel dataset. Initially, the image recognition module <b>204</b> may operate to analyze the new image of the in-service electrical panel and identify one or more panel features, such as the main breaker switch, single pole breakers, empty slots, double pole breakers described above. Each respective portion of the image including the panel features may be designated, such as via a bounding box or other marker that designates the portion of the image including the panel feature. Image recognition techniques may then be performed on the portion of the image bounded by the bounding box. For example, the panel feature may include text that includes information associated with the panel feature, such as a service amperage. Image recognition may be used to identify the text and associate the text with the panel feature represented in the bounding box.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Often the text is oriented at an angle other than horizontal. For example, the text may run the length of a switch handle that is generally perpendicular with the ground or horizontal direction. In some cases, the text may be oriented more than 90 degrees, due to a random and unpredictable combination of text distortion due to the angle of the switch itself and/or the source image itself (e.g., due to errors and inconsistency in the angle at which the image was captured). Accordingly, and shown and described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, the image recognition module <b>204</b> may operate to rotate the portion of the image (e.g., the portion bounded by the bounding box and representative of the identified panel feature) 90 degrees in both a clockwise manner and 90 degrees in a counterclockwise manner. Each of the three images may be analyzed to determine which orientation of text is most recognizable via optical character recognition.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The results of the image recognition module <b>204</b> may be stored in the data module <b>208</b>. For example, the image recognition module <b>204</b> may determine a value of main breaker amperage, a quantity and type of secondary breakers and associated amperage, as well as other values, such as a quantity of empty slots of the electrical panel, and other data points. In some cases, the data module <b>208</b> may also include data associated with a geographic location of the panel (e.g., including geolocation of the metadata), various parties associated with the panel (e.g., an owner of the electrical panel, an energy management provider, a municipality, or a supplier of electric vehicle charging equipment, and so on), a type of electrical panel or breaker (e.g., manufacture, size, rated wattage, age, and so on), a location of the panel (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, and so) and substantially any other information that may be used to analyze the electrical panel in conjunction with the data collected and determined by the image recognition module <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The calculation module <b>212</b> may broadly be configured to analyze the output of the image detector and text recognition and determine metrics associated with the electrical panel, including a main-to-actual amperage ratio, estimated panel power availability, and available breaker slots, among other metrics. Additionally, the calculation module <b>212</b> may be used to determine the meaning or associate recognized labels and text on the panel, for example, such as those that may give insight to approximate baseloads, peak, or seasonal loads. Example calculations of the calculation module <b>212</b> are described in greater detail below with reference to the electrical panel examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reporting module <b>216</b> may be configured, in cooperation with the calculation module <b>212</b>, to propose one or more courses of action with respect to the electrical panel and/or with respect to whether an electrical vehicle charging station may be installed at the charging station. As one example, the reporting module <b>216</b> may determine whether an electrical panel upgrade is needed. This may be the case where the electrical panel may be unable to support the anticipated electrical load or other requirements of charging circuit(s) associated with a charging station. If the electrical panel is recommended for upgrade, the reporting module <b>216</b>, in part based on a street address of the panel and/or other geolocation marker, may determine the electric utility company, permitting authority entity, and/or other actions associated with a panel upgrade.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally or alternatively, the reporting module <b>216</b> may propose that certain circuits be combined with tandem breakers in order to make room for additional circuits, approximate baseloads vs peak or seasonal loads from labels for engineers to further analyze, estimate panel service upgrade case, which may be based using the geolocation/satellite imagery. Other determinations may be made using the reporting module <b>216</b>, including but not limited to: (i) identifying the likelihood of another upstream load center in between the panel and service meter, (ii) parsing/classifying a panel make/model/type (e.g., residential, commercial, and so on) for purposes of determining compatible new hardware or the requirement of the panel needing to be replaced (due to new code requirements); and/or (iii) reading, using OCR, identification labels (including, for example, handwritten labels), paired with breaker size/configuration to estimate periodicity impact of the downstream load to the net service load; and/or (iv) reading, using OCR, the meter identifier(s) to use to correlate and request historical data from online data sources. In other cases, other insights may be determined. The communication module <b>220</b> may allow these and other determination to reported to members of a network, including an owner of the electrical panel, an energy management provider, a municipality, or a supplier of electric vehicle charging equipment, among others.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, an analysis and evaluation of a sample electrical panel is shown and described according to the systems and techniques described herein. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows an image <b>300</b>. The image <b>300</b> may an image captured by a user, such as with a camera of a portable electronic or other device. The image <b>300</b> shows an electrical panel <b>304</b>, such as any of the electrical panels described herein. The electrical panel <b>304</b>, for purposes of illustration, may be a residential electrical panel with a 240V service voltage. The electrical panel <b>304</b> is shown as including a main breaker <b>308</b>. The main breaker <b>308</b> may operate as a main service disconnect. The electrical panel <b>304</b> is further shown as including a collection of secondary circuits which may be represented, visually, by a first single breaker <b>312</b><i>a, </i>a second single breaker <b>312</b><i>b, </i>a third single breaker <b>312</b><i>c, </i>a fourth single breaker <b>312</b><i>d, </i>a fifth single breaker <b>312</b><i>e, </i>a sixth single breaker <b>312</b><i>f, </i>and a 2-pole breaker <b>316</b>. The electrical panel <b>304</b> is also shown with a collection of empty slots <b>320</b>. The empty slots <b>320</b> may be configured to accommodate addition breakers or other hardware to support additional secondary circuits, such as those associated with an electric vehicle charging station.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The systems and techniques described herein, for example, through operation of the panel analysis module <b>200</b>, may be configured to identify portions of the image <b>300</b> associated electrical components of the panel <b>304</b>. For example, and as described above, deep learning-based image recognition may be applied to the image <b>300</b> to identify which portion of the image may correspond to an electrical component (e.g., the main breaker <b>308</b>, breakers <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<b>312</b><i>f, </i>and so on). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, a representation <b>350</b> of the image <b>300</b> is depicted in which a collection of overlays or bounding boxes (e.g., <b>328</b> and <b>332</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>) are shown over particular portions of the image. The bounding boxes may be a portion of the image <b>300</b> that the panel analysis module <b>200</b>, or computer vision software more generally, determines includes an image of an electrical component of the electrical panel <b>304</b>. For example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>328</b> as a portion of the image indicative of the main breaker <b>308</b>. As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>332</b><i>a </i>as a portion of the image indicative of or associated with the first single breaker <b>312</b><i>a. </i>As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>332</b><i>b </i>as a portion of the image indicative of the second single breaker <b>312</b><i>b. </i>As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>332</b><i>c </i>as a portion of the image indicative of the third single breaker <b>312</b><i>c. </i>As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>332</b><i>d </i>as a portion of the image indicative of the fourth single breaker <b>312</b><i>d. </i>As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>332</b><i>e </i>as a portion of the image indicative of the fifth single breaker <b>312</b><i>e. </i>As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>332</b><i>f </i>as a portion of the image indicative of the sixth single breaker <b>312</b><i>f. </i>As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a bounding box <b>336</b> as a portion of the image indicative of the 2-pole breaker <b>316</b>. As a further example, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may determine a collection of bounding boxes <b>340</b> as a portion of the image indicative of the collection empty slots <b>320</b>, including having bounding boxes for each individual slot, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">One result of the analysis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> may be the indication of the number and type of electrical components of the electrical panel <b>304</b>. The panel analysis module <b>200</b> may further operate to determine information for each of the electrical components, such as amperage or other value that may be used to assess the suitability of the panel for additional secondary circuits. As one example, a portion of the image represented by the bounding box is analyzed for numerical information. The numerical information may then be associated with a property or characteristic of the identified electrical component.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, a portion of image <b>300</b> represented by the bounding box <b>336</b> is shown. As described above, the bounding box <b>336</b> includes a portion of the image <b>300</b> indicative of the 2-pole breaker <b>316</b>. The 2-pole breaker <b>316</b> may include a handle <b>317</b> having a first text portion <b>318</b><i>a </i>and second text portion <b>318</b><i>b </i>associated therewith. In this case, each of the first text portion <b>318</b><i>a </i>and the second text portion <b>318</b><i>b </i>include the text &#x201c;30,&#x201d; which may be indication of a 30 amp service amperage. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the text portions <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>are arranged along a text axis <b>404</b>. The text axis <b>404</b> may be arranged at an angle from a horizontal axis <b>402</b> (e.g., a horizontal axis of the image) by an angle &#x3c3;. The angle &#x3c3; may be larger than ninety degrees, due to a number of factors including, for example, the orientation of the captured image, lens distortion, and the orientation of the handle <b>317</b> in the electrical panel <b>304</b>. The arrangement of the text of the first and second text portion <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>along the text axis <b>404</b> at the angle &#x3c3; may reduce the accuracy of the optical character recognition to recognize the text as &#x201c;30.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, and as described herein, the panel analysis module <b>200</b> may operate to rotate the image within bounding box <b>336</b> in a first clockwise direction a produce a first modified bounding box <b>336</b>&#x2032;, as shown in FIG, <b>4</b>B. The first modified bounding box <b>336</b>&#x2032; may be a ninety degree rotation, clockwise, of the bounding box <b>336</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the rotation causes the text axis <b>404</b> to correspondingly rotate. The text axis <b>404</b> is therefore shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> at an almost parallel orientation to the horizontal axis <b>402</b> with the numerals &#x201c;30&#x201d; generally in an upright position. By re-orientating the image in this manner, the accuracy of the optical character recognition may be enhanced. For example, the optical character recognition is more likely to recognize the text portions <b>318</b><i>a, </i><b>318</b><i>b </i>as including the text &#x201c;30&#x201d; in the orientation of the first modified bounding box <b>336</b>&#x2032; as compared with that of the bounding box <b>336</b> of the original orientation.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The panel analysis module <b>200</b> may also operate to rotate the image within bounding box <b>336</b> in a second counterclockwise direction to produce a second modified bounding box <b>336</b>&#x2033;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. The second modified bounding box <b>336</b>&#x2033; may be a ninety degree rotation, counterclockwise, of the bounding box <b>336</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the rotation causes the text axis to correspondingly rotate.
