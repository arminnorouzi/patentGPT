More specifically, the disclosure relates to systems and methods for DPF regeneration for a TCCS using vehicle compressed air.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As defined herein, the phrase &#x201c;diesel particulate filter&#x201d; or &#x201c;DPF&#x201d; may refer to a device designed to remove e.g., diesel particulate matter, soot, or the like from the exhaust gas of a prime mover (e.g., a diesel powered compression ignition engine or the like). It will be appreciated that unless specified otherwise, a prime mover described herein refers to a prime mover of an auxiliary power unit (APU), a prime mover of a TCCS, or the like, other than a vehicle prime mover. That is, in some embodiments, there can be two or more distinct diesel engines on a same vehicle: one can be a main/vehicle (e.g., tractor, truck, or the like) engine, and the other can be a diesel powered compression ignition engine (the auxiliary engine) of the APU, TRU, or the like. It will be appreciated that an electric prime mover might not work with a diesel particulate filter. Embodiments disclosed herein can be directed to the diesel particulate filter for the auxiliary diesel powered compression ignition engine.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As defined herein, the phrase &#x201c;vehicle compressed air&#x201d; may refer to air from a vehicle including air from vehicle compressor air tank(s) and/or from any other suitable air sources.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As defined herein, the phrase &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; may refer to an opposite direction from that in which air flows, and/or refer to nearer to the air source. The phrase &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; may refer to the direction in which air flows, and/or refer to away from the air source.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, an air pump (e.g., an electric air pump controlled and driven off an APU system or the like) and airflow control device(s) (e.g., valves or the like) can be used to provide air/oxygen to the DPF. Embodiments disclosed herein can simplify the components needed (e.g., eliminate the components needed for airflow and reuse the components already in the vehicle) to provide air/oxygen to the DPF for DPF regeneration without the use of an air pump. Embodiments disclosed herein can be applicable to e.g., box truck, self-powered truck, trailer, TRU, or the like), or dual prime mover system where a prime mover is independent to a vehicle prime mover.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments disclosed herein can provide compressed air supplied to an exhaust system, and can provide an airflow control device (e.g., metering, on/off device, or the like) to control airflow to the exhaust system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments disclosed herein can provide compressed air line(s) attached to an air source such as vehicle auxiliary or secondary compress air tank(s) or manifold or branched off existing vehicle air lines. The air line(s) can be attached to an exhaust system (e.g., the exhaust system of an APU or a TCCS or the like) with an airflow control device (e.g., on/off solenoid, orifice, multi-position control valve, or the like) in the air line(s). Electrical power for the airflow control device can be from the APU (or the TCCS) or the vehicle system. The control of the airflow control device is performed by a controller (e.g., the APU controller, the TCCS controller, or the like).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It will be appreciated that when the vehicle is operational and DPF regeneration is required, the controller can turn on, adjust the airflow control device in the compressed air system to allow air/oxygen to the DPF, and/or turn on a heater (e.g., an electric heater or the like) to perform DPF regeneration for the collected particulate (e.g., soot or the like). The control of the heater and air supply (by controlling the airflow control device) can be separate from each other and do not need to start or end at the same time or be the same length in duration.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will also be appreciated that when the controller determines that DPF regeneration is complete, the controller can turn itself off, adjust the airflow control device in the compressed air system, and/or turn off the heater. The control of the heater and air supply (via control of the airflow control device) can be separate from each other and do not need to start or end at the same time or be the same length in duration.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will further be appreciated that a pressure sensor on the APU system or on the TCCS can be used to determine when DPF regeneration is required, and can also be used as a diagnostic for a failure in the compressed air line. For example, if the APU is off and the APU controller has not demanded air, but the pressure sensor detects an abnormally high air pressure, a fault can be generated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a MTRS <b>100</b> for a TU <b>125</b> that can be towed, for example, by a tractor (not shown).

The controller can include a processor, memory, and/or communication ports to communicate with e.g., other components of the TCCS or APU or with equipment or systems located in proximity to the TCCS or APU or a cargo load. The controller can communicate with other components using e.g., powerline communications, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) communications, Local Interconnect Network (LIN) communications, Controller Area Network (CAN) communications, etc., and using any suitable communications including wired and/or wireless, analog and/or digital communications. In an embodiment, the communication can include communications over telematics of the TCCS or APU, which the TCCS or APU may include or which may be communicatively connected to the TCCS (e.g., telematics equipment, mobile phone, vehicle communication system, etc.). The TCCS or APU can include sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, motion, voltage, current, battery status, battery charging level, or the like) or the TCCS or APU can communicate with sensors associated or embedded with a cargo. The controller can obtain data sensed by the sensors and control the settings of the components (e.g., the airflow control device <b>240</b>, the heater <b>220</b>, the prime mover <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or the like) of the TCCS or APU.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It will also be appreciated that the method <b>300</b> can include one or more operations, actions, or functions depicted by one or more blocks. Although illustrated as discrete blocks, various blocks may be divided into additional blocks, combined into fewer blocks, or eliminated, depending on the desired implementation. The method <b>300</b> begins at <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At <b>310</b>, the controller performs a sequence of initializations for diesel particulate filter regeneration. The initializations can include e.g., obtaining data from sensor(s). In an embodiment, the system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> can include sensor(s) (e.g., a pressure sensor or the like, not shown) to detect a pressure of the air upstream of (e.g., before passing through) the DPF. In an embodiment, the pressure of the air can be a prime mover exhaust backpressure before passing through the DPF. In an embodiment, a prime mover exhaust backpressure can be defined as an exhaust gas/air pressure that is produced by the prime mover to overcome a resistance (e.g., a hydraulic resistance, or the like) of the exhaust system in order to discharge the gases/air into the atmosphere. The controller can obtain the sensed pressure from the sensor. The method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At <b>320</b>, the controller determines whether DPF regeneration is needed. In an embodiment, the controller obtaining the sensed pressure from the sensor can be performed at <b>320</b>. If the sensed pressure is not greater than a predetermined threshold (e.g., at or about 12 kPa to at or about 20 kPa of gauge pressure, or the like), the controller determines that DPF regeneration is not needed. The method <b>300</b> proceeds back to <b>320</b> and continues monitoring the sensed pressure from the sensor. If the sensed pressure is greater than the predetermined threshold, the controller determines that DPF regeneration is needed. It will be appreciated that it may not be necessary to perform DPF regeneration at the time when the DPF is full (of soot). In an embodiment, DPF regeneration can be performed even when the DPF is not full (of soot) to take advantage of the main prime mover providing energy for DPF regeneration. That is, there can be a minimum trigger pressure threshold to perform DPF regeneration and a maximum trigger pressure threshold when DPF regeneration has to be performed. The method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At <b>330</b>, the controller determines an ON or OFF state of the prime mover (e.g., <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The ON state of the prime mover indicates that the prime mover is running. The OFF state of the prime mover indicates that the prime mover is not running. It will be appreciated that when performing DPF regeneration, it is not desirable for an exhaust gas flow from the prime mover to pass through the DPF, and thus the prime mover should not be in the ON state. In an embodiment, the prime mover status (ON state or OFF state) can be determined by e.g., using a sensor measuring engine speed, crankshaft revolutions per minute (RPM), alternator output, or the like. If the controller determines that the prime mover is in the OFF state, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>340</b>. If the controller determines that the prime mover is in the ON state, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>380</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At <b>380</b>, the controller shuts down the prime mover (e.g., by controlling a fuel solenoid to cut a fuel supply to the prime mover to turn the prime mover off, etc.) so that the prime mover is in the OFF state. In another embodiment, the controller waits until the prime mover is in the OFF state. Once the prime mover is in the OFF state, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>340</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At <b>340</b>, the controller controls the airflow control device <b>240</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to supply air from the air source (compressor tanks <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>285</b>, or the like) to the DPF <b>230</b>. It will be appreciated that the amount of oxygen or air flow to the DPF <b>230</b> may be desired to meet a predetermined range of acceptability. If the amount of air or oxygen is too little, there may not be enough oxygen for DPF regeneration. If the amount of air or oxygen is too much, the DPF regeneration may not achieve the required temperature (e.g., overcooling of the DPF may occur so that the oxidation/reaction temperature cannot be sufficiently maintained or can be slowed down significantly). In an embodiment, there can be a constant percentage of oxygen in the air (or compressed air), and controlling the airflow control device <b>240</b> may be determined based upon, for example, one or more of a desired rate of airflow, a minimum and a maximum amount of air, a size/capacity of the DPF, an amount of particulate (e.g., soot or the like) in the DPF, or the like. It will be appreciated that a desired or certain airflow rate may be desired to provide air for continuous chemical reaction with oxygen to perform the reaction for DPF regeneration. The DPF regeneration sequence including the chemical reaction may take a certain amount of time (e.g., a few minutes or any suitable amount of time) to complete the DPF regeneration. The amount or a total volume of the air needed for DPF regeneration can be based on e.g., the amount of time needed to supply air at the desired rate of airflow and/or the size/capacity of the airflow control device <b>240</b>. It will be appreciated that the amount or total volume of air needed for DPF regeneration can also be determined based on the amount of soot present. For example, if the DPF is filled (with soot) halfway, the total time of regeneration can be reduced, or the airflow control device <b>240</b> (e.g., an air supply valve) can be modulated to match an oxygen to carbon ratio. The method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At <b>350</b>, the controller controls the heater <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to provide heat to the DPF <b>230</b> for DPF regeneration. In an embodiment, controlling the heater <b>220</b> includes turning the heater <b>220</b> on to provide heat to the DPF <b>230</b> for a desired period of time to heat the DPF <b>230</b> to a desired temperature (e.g., soot combustion temperatures or the like) to burn off the accumulated particulate in the DPF <b>230</b>. It will be appreciated that DPF regeneration can require both a desired amount of air (and/or a desired rate of airflow for a desired period of time) and a desired temperature (e.g., via heat from the heater <b>220</b> or the like). It will also be appreciated that since DPF regeneration needs a desired temperature, if the prime mover is in the ON state, airflow through the heater can be e.g., at or about ten times as much airflow through the heater when the prime mover is in the OFF state, and as such, temperature may not rise to the desired/required temperature for DPF regeneration. Thus, the prime mover may be in the off state for DPF regeneration. The method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>360</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At <b>360</b>, the controller determines whether the DPF regeneration is complete. In an embodiment, the DPF regeneration is complete when a predetermined amount of time (measured by, e.g., a timer or the like) has passed after the DPF regeneration is started. If the controller determines that the DPF regeneration is complete, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>370</b>. If the controller determines that the DPF regeneration is not complete, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to <b>340</b>. It will be appreciated that the order of <b>340</b> and <b>350</b> can be interchangeable.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It will be appreciated that when there is not enough air (e.g., for DPF regeneration or other purpose) in the air source (compressor tanks <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>285</b>, or the like), the compressor (e.g., the vehicle compressor <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) (and/or the vehicle prime mover) can start compressing air. For example, when the vehicle prime mover is running, and when the air in the air source (compressor tanks <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>285</b>, or the like) is less than a desired pressure e.g., less than at or about 90 pound per square inch (psi), an air signal line to the vehicle compressor (e.g., an air compressor or the like) can indicate a lack of air pressure in the line, and the compressor can be turned on to pump more air to the air source (compressor tanks <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>285</b>, or the like). When the air in the air source (compressor tanks <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>285</b>, or the like) is at a desired pressure e.g., e.g., at or about 125 psi, the compressor can be turned off (the vehicle prime mover can be still running). In another example, when the vehicle prime mover is not running, the controller can e.g., detect the air pressure (e.g., via a pressure sensor) from the air source (compressor tanks <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>285</b>, or the like) at <b>310</b>. If the air pressure is greater than a desired threshold, the DPF regeneration process can proceed. If the air pressure is not greater than the desired threshold, the controller can generate an alarm and/or stop the method <b>300</b>, or generate an alarm and notify the system or a user to start the vehicle and/or the vehicle compressor to e.g., pump compressed air to the air source (compressor tanks <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>285</b>, or the like). That is, the controller can ensure the amount of air needed for DPF regeneration is less than the amount of air in the air source.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Embodiments disclosed herein can utilize the time when the prime mover <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is not running (i.e., free time) while the vehicle prime mover is running (i.e., free power from the vehicle) to conduct DPF regeneration. In case the vehicle prime mover is not running, and the prime mover <b>210</b> is running, the need for DPF regeneration (e.g., when the sensed pressure of the DPF exceeds a threshold) can trigger shutting down the prime mover <b>210</b> to conduct DPF regeneration.
