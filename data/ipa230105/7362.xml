The television server <b>300</b> includes a database <b>310</b> that includes a list of advertisements each being a multimedia file.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating steps of a method for controlling output of a television device according to one embodiment of the disclosure. The method may be implemented by the television system described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">In use, when the television device <b>100</b> is powered on, a user may operate the control interface (e.g., the remote control <b>180</b>) to enable the television device <b>100</b> to perform a number of functions, such as broadcasting a television program. In this embodiment, the processor <b>110</b> is also configured to execute the background service application, such that the background service application is running in the background (i.e., not perceived by the user).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">When the background service application is activated, in step <b>302</b>, the processor <b>110</b> is configured to control the operation detector <b>130</b> to detect user operation, and to determine whether there is user operation based on the detection.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">Specifically, the operation detector <b>130</b> is configured to detect the user operation by detecting one or more input signals received from the control interface, indicating that the user is operating the control interface.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">In the case that the television device <b>100</b> receives the source signal from the input signal source <b>200</b>, the processor <b>110</b> controls the video/audio decoding unit <b>125</b> to perform the decoding operation on the source signal so as to obtain the video signal and the audio signal from the source signal. Then, the processor <b>110</b> controls the display screen <b>155</b> to display the video signal (i.e., visual content of the television program), and controls the audio output unit <b>160</b> to output the audio signal (i.e., audio content of the television program).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">In some cases, the television device <b>100</b> may be left in an idle state. In the disclosure, the term &#x201c;idle state&#x201d; may represent a number of situations, including that the display screen <b>155</b> is displaying a channel selection screen (meaning that no specific channel is selected, and therefore the display screen <b>155</b> is not outputting content from any channel), or that the display screen <b>155</b> is displaying a homepage of a media platform (such as a stream service, a video platform, etc.). In some embodiments, the idle state may include a situation that the display screen <b>155</b> is displaying an input source selection menu that enables the user to select from one of the available input sources. It is noted that, according to different types of the selected input sources, different situations may be deemed as the idle state. For example, in the case that the selected input source is the digital optical disc storage, the situation that the display screen <b>155</b> is displaying a selection screen provided by the digital optical disc storage may be deemed as the idle state. In the case that the selected input source is the external data storage, the situation that the display screen <b>155</b> is displaying a data folder containing the multimedia files stored in the external data storage may be deemed as the idle state. In another case, after a multimedia file is selected from the selected input source (e.g., the media platform, the external data storage, the digital optical disc storage, etc.), when the multimedia file is selected and played, the situation that the user operates the control interface to pause playback of the multimedia file and accordingly the display screen <b>155</b> is displaying a pause screen during playback of the multimedia file may be deemed as the idle state.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">In step <b>304</b>, the processor <b>110</b> determines whether the television device <b>100</b> is powered on and is currently in the idle state and the user operation is not detected by the operation detector <b>130</b> for a predetermined time period (e.g., 5 to 10 minutes). When the determination is affirmative, the processor <b>110</b> may determine that the television device <b>100</b> has not been broadcasting anything substantial for a while, and an advertisement may be played on the television device <b>100</b> in place until the user operates the control interface again. Accordingly, the flow proceeds to step <b>306</b>. Otherwise, the flow goes back to step <b>304</b> to continue the determination.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">In step <b>306</b>, the processor <b>110</b> records state data related to a current state of the television device <b>100</b>. The current state may include a current screen that the display screen <b>155</b> is displaying, a progress of the multimedia file that is paused, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">Then, in step <b>308</b>, the processor <b>100</b> controls the data storage <b>120</b> to store the state data related to the current state of the television device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043">In step <b>310</b>, the processor <b>110</b> accesses a source of advertisement to obtain a selected advertisement. In this embodiment, the source of advertisement is the television server <b>300</b> which stores the list of advertisements (for example, a table <b>310</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Specifically, the processor <b>110</b> may transmit a request for advertisement to the television server <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044">In response to receipt of the request for advertisement, the television server <b>300</b> may determine which one of the advertisements stored therein may be played by the television device <b>100</b>, and subsequently select one of the advertisements as the selected advertisement, and provide the selected advertisement to the television device <b>100</b>. For example, the television server <b>300</b> may provide the selected advertisement to the television device <b>100</b> by providing a link of the selected advertisement to the television device <b>100</b> or by directly transmitting the multimedia file of the selected advertisement to the television device <b>100</b>. It is noted that the determination by the television server <b>300</b> of the selection of the selected advertisement may be done based on a record of viewing history of the user and/or a record of the advertisements that have been played by the television device <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the processor <b>110</b> may transmit a location of the television device <b>100</b>, and the selection of the selected advertisement may be done based on the location of the television device <b>100</b> (e.g., selecting the advertisements that are provided by parties local to the location of the television device <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">It is noted that in some embodiments, the source of advertisement may be the data storage <b>120</b> which stores the list of advertisements therein. In this case, the processor <b>110</b> is configured to determine what advertisement(s) is/are to be selected as the selected advertisement.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046">In step <b>312</b>, the processor <b>110</b> controls the television device <b>100</b> to play the selected advertisement, which may include visual element and/or audio element that can be outputted by the display screen <b>155</b> and the audio output unit <b>160</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0047">During playback of the selected advertisement, in step <b>314</b>, the processor <b>110</b> continues to control the operation detector <b>130</b> to detect user operation, and determines whether user operation is detected. When it is determined that user operation is detected (e.g., the user operates the remote control <b>180</b>) while the selected advertisement is being played, the flow proceeds to step <b>316</b>. Otherwise, the flow goes back to step <b>312</b> with the selected advertisement being played continuously.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">It is noted that, in some embodiments, in the case that one selected advertisement has been completely played, and no user operation is detected, the processor <b>110</b> may immediately send another request for advertisement to the television server <b>300</b> to access the source of advertisement to obtain another selected advertisement. In some embodiments, the operation of step <b>310</b> involves obtaining multiple selected advertisements, and in the case that no user operation is detected, the processor <b>110</b> controls the television device <b>100</b> to consecutively play the selected advertisements.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0049">Alternatively, after one selected advertisement has been completely played, the processor <b>110</b> may stand by for a predetermined period of time (e.g., 1 to 2 minutes) before accessing the source of advertisement. Afterward, the flow goes back to step <b>312</b>, in which the processor <b>110</b> controls the display screen <b>155</b> to play said another selected advertisement, and continues with the operations of step <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050">In step <b>316</b>, the processor <b>110</b> accesses the data storage <b>120</b> to obtain the state data, and then, in step <b>318</b>, the processor <b>110</b> controls the television device <b>100</b> to resume the current state, which is the state of the television device <b>100</b> prior to playing of the selected advertisement, based on the state data thus obtained. Specifically, the processor <b>110</b> may control the display screen <b>155</b> to display the screen that was being displayed prior to the playing of the selected advertisement, and the user may operate the control interface to control the television device <b>100</b> as usual.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0051">To sum up, the embodiments of the disclosure provide a method and a system for controlling output of a television device. Specifically, when it is determined that the television device is in an idle state and no user operation has been detected for a predetermined time period, the processor of the television device accesses the source of advertisement to obtain a selected advertisement, and controls the television device to play the selected advertisement. In this manner, advertisements may be played during the times when the television device is not playing any substantial content.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0052">In the description above, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details have been set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiment.
