FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a directional control valve.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A working vehicle such as a forklift or a construction machine is configured with a work device such as a fork or a bucket driven by a pressure fluid (hereinafter, often, simply referred to as &#x201c;fluid&#x201d;). To control driving of such a work device, a directional control valve that changes over or stops a flow direction of the fluid has been conventionally used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a working vehicle configured with a work device that generates high output power, in particular, a pressure and a flow rate of the fluid controlled by the directional control valve are set relatively high. A pilot type selector valve with a solenoid proportional pressure reducing valve suited for controlling such a fluid has been developed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">By way of example, a pilot type selector valve disclosed in PTL 1 (JP-A-2004-232764) is configured with a pressure reducing valve that generates a pilot pressure, a proportional solenoid that controls this pressure reducing valve, and a spool driven (moved) in response to the pilot pressure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pilot type selector valve configured with the solenoid proportional pressure reducing valve disclosed in PTL 1 as an example can set the pressure and the flow rate of the fluid controlled by the spool high and is, therefore, suited for an aim to achieve the high power output of the work device. On the other hand, however, the pilot type selector valve becomes larger in size and larger in weight, and has a more complicated structure because of the provision of the solenoid proportional pressure reducing valve. Furthermore, the need to always generate the pilot pressure (standby pressure) for driving the spool causes degradation in the fuel consumption (including power consumption) performance of a vehicle equipped with the directional control valve. Therefore, it is a challenge to realize a selector valve capable of setting the pressure and the flow rate of the fluid controlled by the spool high without relying of a scheme to increase the size of the selector valve.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is conceivable, for example, that configuring the selector valve to simply omit the solenoid proportional pressure reducing valve and to cause a solenoid driving section to directly drive (move) the spool, a small-size, a weight reduction, and a simplified structure can be realized without increasing the size. On the other hand, however, the inventors of the present application discovered that with the direct driving configurations, the higher the pressure and the flow rate of the fluid to be controlled, the more the spool is difficult to actuate in response to a control command, resulting in unstable fluid control.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a directional control valve capable of setting high a pressure and a flow rate of a fluid to be controlled by a spool, avoiding an unstable operation of a spool, and ensuring stable fluid control in a configuration in which solenoid driving section directly drives the spool.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect, the problems described above are solved by the following disclosed solution.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A directional control valve according to the disclosure includes: a housing having a cylindrical spool hole communicating with an inlet port that lets a fluid delivered from an external supply source at a predetermined pressure and an outlet port that lets the fluid to flow out to a working cylinder driving an external work device; a spool that is provided to be movable in the spool hole in an axial direction and that changes an amount of flow of the fluid; a first solenoid driving section having a first needle that is coupled to or integrally formed with a first end portion of the spool and that drives the spool; and a second solenoid driving section having a second needle that is coupled to or integrally formed with a second end portion of the spool and that drives the spool , the directional control valve including a pressure equalization circuit that equally applies a pressure to the first end portion and the second end portion of the spool.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the housing has a first discharge flow passage and a second discharge flow passage to one of which the fluid discharged by movement of a piston of the working cylinder is caused to flow in response to a moving direction of the piston, and as the pressure equalization circuit, one of or each of the housing and an outlet coupled to the housing in a stacked state has a connection flow passage connecting the first discharge flow passage to the second discharge flow passage, and a first pressure equalization flow passage and a second pressure equalization flow passage communicating with the connection flow passage, and the spool hole has a first pressure equalization chamber provided closer to the first end portion of the spool and communicating with the first pressure equalization flow passage to apply a pressure of the fluid in the connection flow passage to the first end portion of the spool, and a second pressure equalization chamber provided closer to the second end portion of the spool and communicating with the second pressure equalization flow passage to apply the pressure of the fluid in the connection flow passage to the second end portion of the spool.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, each of the first pressure equalization chamber and the second pressure equalization chamber has a circumferential groove engraved on an inner circumferential surface of the spool hole as a shape corresponding to a circumferential protrusion provided on an outer circumferential surface of a core used in a casting process of forming the spool hole.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the housing has a first stacking flow passage that communicates with the first pressure equalization chamber and a first stacking opening portion formed open in an opposite surface to a surface in which an opening portion that is an end portion of the first pressure equalization flow passage is provided, and a second stacking flow passage that communicates with the second pressure equalization chamber and a second stacking opening portion formed open in the opposite surface to the surface in which an opening portion that is an end portion of the second pressure equalization flow passage is provided.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, the fluid delivered from the external supply source is set to have a maximum pressure equal to or higher than 10 MPa and a maximum flow rate equal to or higher than 60 liters/min.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the directional control valve according to the disclosure, in a configuration in which the solenoid driving section directly drives the spool, the pressure and the flow rate of the fluid controlled by the spool can be set high.

Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged view of part III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view (schematic diagram) of a housing <b>10</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of part V of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (perspective view at the same angle as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). It is noted that members having the same function are denoted by the same reference sign and not repeatedly described in all the drawings for describing the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The directional control valve <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment exercises control over work of a working cylinder that drives an external work device (e.g., work device used in a working vehicle), that is, changes over and stops a flow direction of a fluid used for the working cylinder <b>4</b> to work.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">First, for solving the aforementioned problems, the inventors of the present application considered adopting, as a directional control valve, a direct acting selector valve, i.e., a selector valve configured with a solenoid driving section that directly moves a spool. This is because such configurations enable omission of a pressure reducing valve and a proportional solenoid for controlling the pressure reducing valve, so that it is possible to realize a small-size, a weight reduction, and a simplified structure as well as an improvement in a fuel consumption performance by reducing a pilot pressure (standby pressure) for driving the spool.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a result of the consideration by trial manufacturing, experiments, and the like, the inventors of the present application found that the direct acting selector valve is capable of stably moving the spool when the pressure and the flow rate of the fluid are relatively low (in a case where a maximum pressure of the fluid is approximately equal to or lower than 10 MPa and a maximum flow rate is so-called a low flow rate or a medium flow rate approximately equal to or lower than 50 liters/min). However, it has become clear a problem that a spool moving operation becomes unstable in a case where the pressure and the flow rate of the fluid are relatively high (in a case where the maximum pressure of the fluid is approximately equal to or higher than 10 MPa and the maximum flow rate is a so-called high flow rate approximately equal to or higher than 60 liters/min).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">After further study, the inventors has found that the problems result from the fact that the direct acting selector valve may generate a greatly low driving force, compared with the conventional solenoid proportional pressure reducing valve since the solenoid driving section of the direct acting selector valve is configured to directly drive (move) the spool. In other words, as the force driving the spool is lower, it is impossible to ignore an influence of the pressure of the fluid that is controlled by the spool and flows in a spool hole, specifically, the pressure of the fluid that is discharged from the working cylinder even if the pressure is quite low (e.g., as low as approximately 0.1 MPa) and that acts as a force moving the spool. As a result, an operation of the spool is not stable (specifically, a phenomenon that the spool does not move accurately in response to a control signal or the like occurs), causing unstable fluid control.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As a method of solving the problem, the solenoid driving section may be made larger in size (e.g., to have a diameter approximately equal to or greater than 80 mm) to enhance a thrust of a needle. This makes it possible to ignore the influence that the pressure of the fluid discharged from the working cylinder acts as the force moving the spool. However, this method leads to increasing in size.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The directional control valve <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, therefore, is capable of solving the complex problems described so far by being configured as follows.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Overall configurations of the directional control valve <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment will first be described. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the directional control valve <b>1</b> is disposed between a main hydraulic pump <b>2</b> that is an external supply source (which is a hydraulic source in this case) of a fluid (which is a pressurized fluid in this case) at a predetermined pressure, and a working cylinder <b>4</b> that actuates a work device such as a fork or a bucket. The directional control valve <b>1</b> acts to control a flow passage and a flow rate of the fluid supplied to and discharged from the working cylinder <b>4</b>. This enables settings of a working direction, an amount of work, a working speed of the work device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The directional control valve <b>1</b> is configured with a housing <b>10</b> and solenoid driving sections <b>30</b> provided on right and left side surfaces of the housing <b>10</b>, respectively (hereinafter, a structurer including the housing <b>10</b> and the solenoid driving sections <b>30</b> are often referred to as &#x201c;main body portion <b>100</b>&#x201d;). It is noted that in the present embodiment, the directional control valve <b>1</b> is also configured with an inlet <b>102</b> coupled to one surface (which will be described as &#x201c;upper surface&#x201d; on the basis of a layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for the sake of convenience of description) of the housing <b>10</b> while being stacked on the upper surface, and an outlet <b>104</b> coupled to the other surface (which will be described as &#x201c;lower surface&#x201d;) on the basis of the layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for the sake of convenience of description) of the housing <b>10</b> while being stacked on the lower surface. By way of example, the inlet <b>102</b> is provided with an inlet port <b>16</b> that lets the fluid delivered from the external supply source (main hydraulic pump <b>2</b>) to flow in. In addition, the main body portion <b>100</b> (housing <b>10</b> in this case) is provided with outlet ports <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B that let the fluid to flow out to the working cylinder <b>4</b>. It is noted that the outlet ports <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B also serve as ports that let the fluid discharged from the working cylinder <b>4</b> to flow in. Moreover, the outlet <b>104</b> is provided with a tank port <b>19</b> that flows out the fluid discharged from the working cylinder <b>4</b> to a tank <b>3</b>. However, the configurations of the directional control valve <b>1</b> are not limited to those described above, and the inlet port <b>16</b> and the tank port <b>19</b> may be directly provided in the housing <b>10</b> without providing the inlet and the outlet (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The housing <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment is provided with a spool hole <b>20</b> that is a cylindrical space part in communication with the inlet port <b>16</b>, the outlet ports <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B, and the tank port <b>19</b>. Furthermore, a spool <b>22</b> that is provided movable in an axial direction and that changes and stops an amount of flow of the fluid is accommodated in the spool hole <b>20</b>. By way of example, the spool <b>22</b> and the spool hole <b>20</b> are each formed to have a circular cross-section, and the spool hole <b>20</b> is formed to penetrate from one side surface to the other side surface of the housing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the solenoid driving sections <b>30</b> are members acting to drive (move) the spool <b>22</b>. In the present embodiment, two solenoid driving sections (specifically, the first solenoid driving section <b>30</b>A and the second solenoid driving section <b>30</b>B) are disposed symmetrically on the two side surfaces of the housing <b>10</b>, respectively. As an example of operation, when an operator operates an operation lever <b>5</b>, then a drive signal in response to an operation is transmitted to the corresponding solenoid driving section <b>30</b> via a control section <b>6</b>, and the solenoid driving section <b>30</b> is driven to move a needle, thereby actuating (moving) the spool <b>22</b> (details of an operating principle will be described later).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the housing <b>10</b> is provided with a supply flow passage <b>11</b> communicating with the inlet port <b>16</b>, a first operation flow passage <b>12</b>A and a second operation flow passage <b>12</b>B communicating with the outlet ports <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B, respectively, and a first discharge flow passage <b>13</b>A and a second discharge flow passage <b>13</b>B communicating with the tank port <b>19</b>. These flow passages are configured to communicate with the spool hole <b>20</b>, and the supply flow passage <b>11</b> is, for example, disposed between the first operation flow passage <b>12</b>A and the second operation flow passage <b>12</b>B. In addition, the first operation flow passage <b>12</b>A is disposed between the supply flow passage <b>11</b> and the first discharge flow passage <b>13</b>A. Furthermore, the second operation flow passage <b>12</b>B is disposed between the supply flow passage <b>11</b> and the second discharge flow passage <b>13</b>B.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Here, the supply flow passage <b>11</b> is a flow passage that is connected to the main hydraulic pump <b>2</b> via the inlet port <b>16</b> and that supplies a fluid at a predetermined pressure (e.g., a high pressure of approximately 20 MPa) delivered from the main hydraulic pump <b>2</b>. In addition, the first operation flow passage <b>12</b>A and the second operation flow passage <b>12</b>B are flow passages that are connected to the working cylinder <b>4</b> via the outlet ports <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B, respectively, and that supply a fluid at a predetermined pressure (e.g., a high pressure of approximately 20 MPa) to the working cylinder <b>4</b> and return a fluid at a predetermined pressure (e.g., a low pressure of approximately 2 MPa) discharged from the working cylinder <b>4</b>. Furthermore, the first discharge flow passage <b>13</b>A and the second discharge flow passage <b>13</b>B are flow passages that are connected to the tank <b>3</b> via the tank port <b>19</b> and that deliver a fluid at a predetermined pressure (e.g., a low pressure of approximately 0.1 MPa) discharged from the working cylinder <b>4</b> and flowing.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present embodiment, with circuit configurations controlled with the spool hole <b>20</b> and the spool <b>22</b>, the fluid discharged by movement of a piston <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the working cylinder <b>4</b> is delivered to one of the first operation flow passage <b>12</b>A and the second operation flow passage <b>12</b>B in response to a moving direction of the piston <b>4</b><i>a </i>(for example, when the piston <b>4</b><i>a </i>moves upward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fluid is discharged from the working cylinder <b>4</b> to the first operation flow passage <b>12</b>A; and when the piston <b>4</b><i>a </i>moves downward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fluid is discharged from the working cylinder <b>4</b> to the second operation flow passage <b>12</b>B.)

It is noted that the needle <b>22</b>A according to the present embodiment is formed integrally with the spool <b>22</b> (into an integral structure worked from one member). However, the needle <b>22</b>A is not limited to this example and may be configured to be formed separately and coupled to a first end portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the spool <b>22</b> (end portion closer to the solenoid driving section <b>30</b>A) (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The case <b>32</b> is a cylindrical member (that may be prismatic instead of being cylindrical) that accommodates the coil <b>36</b>, the fixed iron core <b>38</b>, the needle <b>22</b>A, and the like, and is formed from, for example, a soft magnetic material such as carbon steel or free-cutting steel. This case <b>32</b> is fixed to a side surface of the housing <b>10</b> with bolts or the like (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The coil <b>36</b> is configured such that a long insulating-coated conductor member is wound around the bobbin <b>34</b>. While the conductor member is, for example, a wire rod formed to have a cross-section of a circular shape, a square shape, or the like using a copper alloy or the like, the conductor member may be a tape material, a sheet material, or the like (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fixed iron core <b>38</b> is a member that attracts the needle <b>22</b>A through the magnetic flux lines generated by the excitation of the coil <b>36</b>, and is formed from, for example, a soft magnetic material such as carbon steel or free-cutting steel. In the present embodiment, a base and a stator <b>38</b>C that are disposed to be apart from each other in the axial direction of the coil <b>36</b> are provided as the fixed iron core <b>38</b>. As the base here, a first base <b>38</b>A formed to have a collar portion provided in a first end portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>to extend radially and a second base <b>38</b>B fitted into the first base <b>38</b>A are provided, both having a cylindrical shape.

Moreover, demagnetizing the coil <b>36</b> dissipates the force for the fixed iron core <b>38</b> to attract the needle <b>22</b>A and generates an action to move the needle <b>22</b>A in a direction of returning the needle <b>22</b>A to a neutral position by the urging force of the urging member <b>42</b>.

In addition, a first pressure equalization flow passage <b>23</b>A and a second pressure equalization flow passage <b>23</b>B communicating with the connection flow passage <b>15</b> are provided continuously on both sides of the outlet <b>104</b> and the housing <b>10</b>. Furthermore, a first pressure equalization chamber <b>24</b>A (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and the like) that is provided closer to the first end portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the spool <b>22</b> and that communicates with the first pressure equalization flow passage <b>23</b>A is provided in the housing <b>10</b> (spool hole <b>20</b>). This first pressure equalization chamber <b>24</b>A acts to deliver the fluid in the connection flow passage <b>15</b> toward the first end portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the spool <b>22</b>. Therefore, the pressure of the fluid in the connection flow passage <b>15</b> is applied to the first end portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the spool <b>22</b> (i.e., applied to the spool <b>22</b> in a direction from the first end portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>to the second end portion <b>22</b><i>b</i>).
