The material to be machined is held in position in the lathe with a first mandrel at one end, and optionally a second mandrel at the opposing end, whilst being rotated. At least one mandrel comprises a chuck that is typically threaded to a lathe spindle. A set of jaws on the chuck are used to clamp an object in position such that it can be rotated at high speeds safely.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The jaws may be specialised for specific functions, for example clamping a particular type of profile, geometry or size. Where a different jaw set is required, the existing jaws have to be dismounted from the chuck allowing for the new set to be installed. This becomes time consuming as an entire jaw set may comprise upwards of eight bolts mounting it to the chuck. The bolts may also not be easy to reach, particularly when using smaller chucks and where inner bolts are located within an axially extending portion of the jaw set. Furthermore, when the chuck is mounted to the lathe, the bolts have to be screwed in laterally increasing the chances of them being dropped.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chucks may also only be compatible with a small number of different jaws, typically ones of similar size. This has cost implications for the operator as additional chucks may be required for mounting different jaw sets.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is the aim of the present invention to provide a jaw assembly that overcomes or mitigates one or more of the problems addressed above.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is a jaw assembly for mounting to a woodworking lathe, comprising;<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">a first jaw set comprising an axially extending jaw portion,        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0009">wherein the jaw portion comprises at least one channel that extends in the same axial direction as the jaw portion,</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a second jaw set that is at least partially coaxially locatable within the first jaw set,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">wherein the first and second jaw sets are releasably attachable via at least one fastener located in the channel.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">Optionally, the jaw assembly may comprise a first condition where the first jaw set is mounted to a lathe chuck or spindle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">Optionally, the first jaw set is suitable for clamping a material to be machined in the first condition.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">Optionally, the jaw assembly may comprise a second condition wherein the second jaw set is suitable for clamping a material to be machined whilst being mounted to the first jaw set.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">The first and second jaw sets may be distinct, such that the first jaw set may be suitable for machining a material that is different in shape and/or a dimensional range than a material that is suitable for being machined in the second jaw set.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">The first jaw set may be releasably attached to a lathe chuck/spindle that is configured for receiving the first jaw set. The fastener attaches the first and second jaw sets together. The first jaw set then acts as an intermediate member between the chuck/spindle and second set, such that the second jaw set can clamp an item without the need for changing the lathe chuck for one that is suitable for receiving the second jaw set.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Alternatively, the first jaw set may not be suitable for clamping a material in the first position such that its primary function is to act as an intermediate member to the second jaw set in the second condition.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">Optionally, the channel comprises an open-end that may be suitable for receiving the fastener.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Optionally, the channel may comprise a recess.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Optionally, the recess may be located proximal to a closed-end of the channel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Optionally, the recess may be tapered.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Optionally, the depth of the channel may vary along its axial length.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Optionally, the depth of the channel may be lowest in the recess.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The channel serves as a quick attachment &#x26; release mechanism, such that the first and second jaw sets may be easily attached and detached. The recess is suitable for receiving a portion of the fastener.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Optionally, the fastener comprises a bolt.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Optionally, the bolt may comprise a bolt-head suitable for locating in the channel, optionally in the recess thereof.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">Optionally, the fastener, e.g. the bolt thereof, may comprise a stem, where the stem may be partially threaded.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">Optionally, the stem may be suitable for locating through the open-end of the channel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">Optionally, the bolt-head may be tapered.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">The tapered recess may complement the tapered shape of the bolt-head. The width of the bolt-head may be greater than the width of the channel. The depth of the channel is lower in the recess than at the open-end such that when the bolt-head is located/fastened into the recess, the fastener is prevented from slipping axially from the channel in operation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">Optionally, the fastener may be a captive fastener. The fastener may remain retained on the second jaw set when released from the first jaw set. The fastener may be slidable along the channel, e.g. when removing the first jaw set form the second jaw set.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">Optionally, the fastener may comprise a cap that may be suitable for keeping the fastener captive on the second jaw set.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">Optionally, the cap may be at a first end of the fastener, e.g. the bolt thereof, and the bolt-head may be at the second end.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">Optionally, the cap and bolt-head may be configured such as to prevent the fastener detaching from the second jaw set.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">Optionally, the cap comprises a washer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">Optionally, the cap may comprise a screw portion.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">Optionally, the fastener, e.g. the stem thereof, and cap may comprise complementary engagement members.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">Optionally, the fastener, e.g. the stem thereof, may comprise a recess. The recess may be threaded such as to engage with a screw portion of the cap.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">Optionally, the first jaw set comprises a plurality of first jaw members, optionally four members.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">Optionally, each of the first jaw members may comprise an axially extending jaw portion.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">Optionally, each of the jaw portions of the first jaw members comprises a channel that may extend in the same axial direction as the jaw portion.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">Optionally, the second jaw set comprises a plurality of second jaw members, optionally four members.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">Optionally, the number of first and second jaw members are equal.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">Optionally, each of the first jaw members are releasably attached to a second jaw member via a fastener.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">Optionally, the second jaw members may comprise a base and/or jaw portion.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">Optionally, the second jaw set, e.g. the plurality of second jaw members thereof, each comprise an aperture for receiving a fastener. The aperture may be threaded.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">Optionally, the aperture may be located in the side wall of the base portion.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">The fasteners may engage with the second jaw member via the aperture. The fastener is located through the aperture and the cap is threaded into the recess of the stem.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">Both the cap and bolt-head may be larger in size than the apertures of the second jaw members, such as to prevent the fastener and second jaw member from disengaging unwillingly.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">Once the fastener is attached to the second jaw set, e.g. the second jaw members thereof, the second jaw set can be attached to the first jaw set, e.g. the first jaw members thereof, by sliding the fastener into the open-end of the channel. The fastener e.g. the bolt thereof, can then be tightened/fastened by screwing the threaded portion of the bolt into the second jaw members.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">The fastener also serves as a guide for mounting the second jaw set, e.g. the second jaw members thereof, to the first jaw set, e.g. the first jaw members thereof. The open-end allows the fastener to remain captive on the second jaw set, such that both jaw sets can be attached and detached without disengaging the fastener from the second jaw set. This also makes it far easier to install and can be done easily by one person. For example, if the fastener were not captive such as to allow it to locate into an aperture/hole of the first jaw set (instead of a channel), a second person may be required to hold both jaw sets in alignment whilst a first person inserts the bolt and fastens a nut. The proposed channel method is also less cumbersome, and mitigates completely the chances of pieces such as bolts, screws or nuts being dropped whilst mounting the jaw sets together.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">Optionally, the first jaw set, e.g. the first jaw members thereof, may comprise a back plate, wherein the back plate may be suitable for being releasably mounted to a lathe chuck.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">Optionally, the back plate may comprise engagement portions, for engagement with a lathe chuck.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">Optionally, the back plate engagement portions may be ribs and/or grooves.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">Optionally, the jaw portion may extend from the back plate.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">Optionally, the first jaw set, e.g. the first jaw members thereof, may each comprise a first mounting aperture for receiving an engagement member, e.g. a bolt, for attachment of the first jaw member to a lathe chuck.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">Optionally, the first jaw set, e.g. the first jaw members thereof, may each comprise a second mounting aperture for receiving an engagement member, e.g. a bolt, for attachment of the first jaw member to a lathe chuck.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">Optionally, the first and second mounting apertures may be located either side of the jaw portion.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">Optionally, the jaw portions of the first jaw members may be arched shaped.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">The jaw portions may be arched such that when all the first jaw members are aligned, the jaw portions are suitable for clamping an item to be machined.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">Optionally, the first jaw members, e.g. the jaw portions thereof, comprise a ledge.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">Optionally, the second jaw set, e.g. the jaw members thereof, may comprise an engagement surface that complements the shape of the ledge of the first jaw set.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">Optionally, the ledge of the first jaw members e.g. the jaw portion thereof, are suitable for engagement with the second jaw members, e.g. the engagement surface thereof, in the second condition.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">Optionally, the first and second jaw sets, e.g. the jaw members thereof, may comprise at least one engagement portion, suitable for clamping onto or within a spigot of an item to be machined.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">Optionally, the at least one engagement portions of the first and/or second members may be dove-tailed or serrated.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">Optionally, the at least one engagement portions of the first and/or second jaw members may protrude from the jaw portions of the first and/or second jaw members.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0067">Optionally, the ledge may also serve as an engagement portion, such as to clamp an object in the first condition.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0068">The jaw portion and/or engagement portions of the first and second jaw members may be distinct, such that the first jaw set may be suitable for machining materials of dimensions within a specified range and the second jaw set may be suitable for machining materials within a different specified range. Alternatively, the distinction may allow for the first set to machine a material with a specific profile, e.g. square, whereas the second jaw may be suitable for machining a material with a different profile, e.g. circular.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0069">Optionally, the assembly may comprise a plurality of second jaw sets.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0070">Optionally, the plurality of second jaw sets may be substantially the same as the second jaw set, e.g. in respect of associated fastening arrangements.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0071">Optionally, the plurality of second jaw sets may be interchangeable, such that any of the plurality of second jaw sets may be configured to be releasably attached and coaxially locatable within the first jaw set via a fastener.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">Optionally, the plurality of second jaw sets may each comprise a unique jaw portion such as to provide a specific jaw profile for clamping objects to be machined.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">Optionally, the plurality of second jaw sets may each comprise at least one unique engagement portion, such as to provide a specific jaw profile for clamping a spigot of an object to be machined.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">Optionally, the plurality of second jaw sets may each comprise unique first and/or second engagement portions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">The jaw assembly may comprise a plurality of second jaw sets, wherein the second jaw sets are all interchangeable such that they may be releasably attached to the first jaw set.

The bolt-head <b>43</b> is tapered in shape.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a jaw assembly. The second jaw members <b>31</b> are located coaxially within the first jaw set <b>10</b>. Each first jaw member <b>11</b> is engaged to a second jaw member <b>31</b> via a fastener <b>40</b>. The engagement surface <b>37</b> of the second jaw member <b>31</b> complements the shape of the ledge <b>19</b> of the first jaw member <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0104">The fastener <b>40</b> is threaded to the aperture <b>34</b> located on the side wall of the second jaw member <b>31</b> and fastened, such as to attach the first <b>11</b> and second <b>31</b> jaw members. The tapered angle of the bolt-head <b>43</b> complements the shape of the recess <b>18</b>. The bolt-head <b>43</b> has a recess <b>49</b> for receiving a key to fasten the parts together. The cap <b>42</b> prevents the fastener <b>40</b> from being disengaged completely from the second jaw member <b>31</b>.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Operation</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0105">The jaw assembly defines two operational conditions for use in a lathe.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106">The first condition is substantially shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and comprises the first jaw set <b>10</b> only. In this condition, each of the first jaw members <b>11</b> are mounted to the slider-jaws of a chuck (not shown) via bolts in the first <b>13</b> and second <b>14</b> mounting apertures. The rib <b>21</b> and grooves on the back plate <b>12</b> engage with complementary shaped portions of the chuck. Once mounted, an item such as cylindrical wood stock may be inserted within the axially extending jaw portions and clamped by adjusting the slider-jaws on the chuck.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0107">The second condition is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, with the first <b>10</b> and second <b>30</b> jaw sets attached together via the fastener <b>40</b>. The stem portion <b>44</b> of each fastener <b>40</b> is threaded to the aperture <b>34</b> of the second jaw members <b>31</b>. The cap <b>42</b> is then screwed into the recess <b>45</b> of the stem <b>44</b> preventing disengagement of the second jaw member <b>31</b> and cap <b>42</b>. A substantial portion of the stem <b>44</b> remains exposed on the outer side wall of the second jaw member <b>31</b>, such as to allow for the fastener <b>40</b> to be inserted into the channel <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0108">With the first jaw set <b>10</b> being pre-mounted to the chuck (i.e. in the first condition), the exposed portion of the stem <b>44</b> is located into the open-end <b>17</b> of the channel and moved into the recessed section <b>18</b> such that the second jaw members are coaxially located within the axially extending first jaw members. The fastener <b>40</b> is then fastened by a key in the bolt-head <b>43</b> such that the first <b>11</b> and second <b>31</b> jaw members are locked in place together.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0109">The bolt-head prevents the fastener <b>40</b> from sliding out of the channel <b>16</b> when the lathe is in operation. Similarly, the ledge <b>19</b> and engagement surface <b>37</b> prevent the first and second jaw members disengaging.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0110">Once the first and second jaw sets are mounted together, an item such as a cylindrical piece of wood stock may be inserted into the second jaw members and clamped by inner surface <b>35</b> by adjusting the slider-jaws of the chuck.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0111">It will be understood that the second jaw set is suitable for clamping objects with a smaller diameter than those on the first jaw set. This allows for smaller objects to be machined without swapping the chuck for one suitable for mounting the second jaw set <b>30</b> directly thereto, or dismounting the first jaw set <b>10</b>. This saves both time and cost as it is quicker to assemble and requires less parts.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0112">The jaw assembly may further comprise a plurality of interchangeable second jaw sets that are suitable for being mounted to the first jaw set in the second condition. The additional jaw sets may be substantially the same but each comprise distinct jaw portions such that they are each specialised for clamping different objects from one another in the second condition (for example, sizes or profiles). This allows for a range of jaw sets to be mounted to the lathe without needing to dismount the first jaw set or requiring multiple chucks. This saves time as jaw sets may require upwards of eight bolts for securing to a chuck, whereas mounting the second jaw sets only require four (for a four piece set) for mounting to the first jaw set. As only one chuck is needed to mount the whole range of second jaw sets, this also saves costs. Furthermore, the fasteners on the second jaw members are more accessible as they protrude radially and are held captive, such that they cannot be dropped.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0113">The channel <b>16</b> also serves as a guide and quick release/attachment mechanism between the parts that can be easily done with one person only. When the fastener <b>40</b> is loosely inserted into the channel <b>16</b>, the operator can let go of the second jaw member <b>31</b> which is fully supported by the first jaw member <b>11</b> mounted to the lathe (via the chuck). The operator can then use both hands to fasten the parts together.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0114">In alternative embodiments, the first jaw set is not suitable for clamping an item to be machined in the first condition. The first jaw set serves only as an intermediate member between the lathe chuck and second jaw set such that the second jaw set can be easily mounted and dismounted to a chuck.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0115">In further embodiments, the first and/or second jaw sets may comprise engagement members that are suitable for engaging with a spigot on an item to be machined.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
