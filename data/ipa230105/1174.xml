The contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to a female connector.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In infusion, blood transfusion, and dialysis, medical tubes or the like are used to form a feeding line, and drug solutions, blood, and other fluids are delivered through this feeding line. Medical tubes, syringes, and other medical devices used in the feeding line are connected to each other using a connector set including a male connector and a female connector to which the male connector is connected (see, for example, JP 2013-252165 A).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The male connector includes a lock claw and a channel connection portion having a hollow rod shape that defines a first channel therein. The female connector includes a cap, a housing, and a valve. The cap includes a top wall provided with an opening that allows insertion of the channel connection portion of the male connector and a peripheral wall extending from an outer peripheral edge of the top wall. The housing includes a cylindrical wall having an inner peripheral surface that defines a second channel and an engaging protrusion protruding from an outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical wall to form a lower surface to be engaged with the lock claw to connect the male connector to the female connector and put the male connector into a locked state. The valve includes a sandwiched portion sandwiched between the top wall and the cylindrical wall and a penetration portion placed in the opening in a top view and penetrating the valve in up-and-down direction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the aforementioned female connector in the related art, an outer peripheral surface of the peripheral wall of the cap and an outer peripheral surface of the engaging protrusion of the housing are flush with each other to enable smooth connection with the male connector. In other words, when the male connector is connected to the female connector, the lock claw sequentially and smoothly passes over the outer peripheral surface of the peripheral wall of the cap and that of the engaging protrusion of the housing to be engaged with the lower surface of the engaging protrusion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, in the female connector in the related art, a gap may be formed at a boundary between an upper surface of the engaging protrusion of the housing and a lower end face of the peripheral wall of the cap due to dimensional accuracy, assembly accuracy, and the like of each component. When the lock claw engaged with the lower surface of the engaging protrusion is unlocked by an unintended external force or the like, the lock claw is engaged with the gap. Because it is difficult to discern such an abnormal connected state by appearance, there is a possibility that the connectors are continued to be used in this state.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of this disclosure is to provide a female connector capable of smoothly connecting to a male connector and preventing a lock claw of the male connector from being engaged with a boundary between an engaging protrusion of a housing and a peripheral wall of a cap.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the disclosure, a female connector is connectable with a male connector including a lock claw and a channel connection portion having a hollow rod shape that defines a first channel therein, the female connector including: a cap; a housing; and a valve, the cap including a top wall provided with an opening configured to receive the channel connection portion and a peripheral wall extending from an outer peripheral edge of the top wall, the housing including a cylindrical wall having an inner peripheral surface that defines a second channel and an engaging protrusion protruding from an outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical wall to form a lower surface engaged with the lock claw to connect the male connector to the female connector and put the male connector into a locked state, and the valve including a sandwiched portion sandwiched between the top wall and the cylindrical wall and a penetration portion placed in the opening in a top view and penetrating the valve in up-and-down direction, in which the engaging protrusion and the peripheral wall form a boundary between an upper surface of the engaging protrusion and a lower end face of the peripheral wall, an outer diameter of the lower end face of the peripheral wall is less than an outer diameter of the upper surface of the engaging protrusion at the boundary, and the engaging protrusion has an outer peripheral surface including an enlarged diameter portion with a diameter increasing downward from the boundary.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the enlarged diameter portion has a tapered surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the peripheral wall has an outer peripheral surface including a fixed diameter portion having a constant outer diameter extending upward from the boundary.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the peripheral wall has an outer peripheral surface including a lower edge having a tapered surface or a protruding curved surface with a diameter that increases upward from the boundary.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the outer peripheral surface of the engaging protrusion has a fixed outer diameter over circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to certain embodiments of the disclosure, there is provided a female connector capable of smoothly connecting to a male connector and preventing a lock claw of the male connector from being engaged with a boundary between an engaging protrusion of a housing and a peripheral wall of a cap.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a female connector according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the female connector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a male connector connectable to the female connector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the male connector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the male connector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> being in a locked state when the male connector is connected to the female connector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view for describing the movement of a lock claw when the locked state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is released;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view for describing the movement of a lock claw when a locked state is released in Comparative Example where a lower end face of a peripheral wall and an upper surface of the engaging protrusion have an equal outer diameter at a boundary;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a female connector according to a second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view for describing the movement of a lock claw when the male connector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> connected to the female connector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is unlocked;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view of a female connector according to a third embodiment;
