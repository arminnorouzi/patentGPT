Because of the above-described characteristics of the metal formation inhibiting layer <b>160</b>, it is possible to reduce process operations compared to the formation of the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> through photolithography and it is possible to reduce unnecessary consumption of a material due to etching. The auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be in contact with a side face of the metal formation inhibiting layer <b>160</b> exposed by the opening in the metal formation inhibiting layer <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In case of the top-emission scheme, the light emitted from the organic light emitting layer (e.g., the light emitting stack <b>124</b>) passes through the second electrode <b>126</b>. Accordingly, the second electrode <b>126</b> can be formed to have a small thickness to allow the light to pass therethrough, so that a resistance of the second electrode <b>126</b> increases. For example, when the resistance of the second electrode <b>126</b> increases, power consumption usually increases. The cause of the increase in the power consumption can be an increase in IR drop resulted from an increase in a sheet resistance and a voltage drop of a power supply wiring. In order to reduce the resistance of such second electrode <b>126</b>, the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be connected to the second electrode <b>126</b> through the opening of the metal formation inhibiting layer <b>160</b>. The auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be thicker than the second electrode <b>126</b> in order to reduce the resistance of the second electrode <b>126</b>. For example, the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be opaque. Because the position where the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> is formed is the opening of the metal formation inhibiting layer <b>160</b> corresponding to the bank <b>128</b>, the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> may not overlap the light emitting area. Preferably, a width of the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be smaller than a width of the bank <b>128</b>. Because the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> does not optically affect the light emitted from the organic light emitting layer, the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be opaque by being formed to have a sufficient thickness to reduce the resistance of the second electrode <b>126</b>. Further, the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be formed to be thicker than the metal formation inhibiting layer <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b></figref>, the auxiliary electrodes <b>170</b> can be arranged to intersect each other to be in a mesh or grid structure (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) or can be arranged in one direction to be in a stripe structure (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), but the present disclosure may not be limited thereto. The auxiliary electrodes <b>170</b> can surround the pixels <b>103</b>. The auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> can be connected to the common voltage line <b>166</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or the voltage line <b>150</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in the non-display area. In this embodiment, the common voltage line <b>166</b> is formed outwardly of the display area <b>101</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to surround the display area <b>101</b>, but the common voltage line <b>166</b> is also able to be formed below the organic light emitting device (e.g., <b>120</b>) disposed within the display area.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The encapsulation portion <b>140</b> can be formed on the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> after the formation of the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b>. The encapsulation portion <b>140</b> blocks the penetration of the external moisture or oxygen into the light emitting device <b>120</b>, which may be vulnerable to the external moisture or oxygen. To this end, the encapsulation portion <b>140</b> can include a plurality of inorganic encapsulation layers and organic encapsulation layers respectively disposed between two of the plurality of inorganic encapsulation layers, and the inorganic encapsulation layer can be disposed at an uppermost layer of the encapsulation portion <b>140</b>. In this regard, the encapsulation portion <b>140</b> can include at least two inorganic encapsulation layers and at least one organic encapsulation layer.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the present disclosure, a structure of the encapsulation portion <b>140</b> in which the organic encapsulation layer is disposed between first and second inorganic encapsulation layers will now be described below as an example.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one example, the first inorganic encapsulation layer is formed on the substrate <b>111</b> on which the second electrode <b>126</b> is formed so as to be closest to the light emitting device <b>120</b>. Such first inorganic encapsulation layer is made of an inorganic insulating material that can be deposited at a low temperature, such as the silicon nitride (SiNx), the silicon oxide (SiOx), a silicon oxynitride (SiON), or an aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Accordingly, because the first inorganic encapsulation layer is deposited in a low-temperature atmosphere, during the deposition process of the first inorganic encapsulation layer, it is possible to prevent damage to the light emitting stack <b>124</b>, which may be vulnerable to a high temperature atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The organic encapsulation layer serves as a buffer to relieve stress between layers based on bending of the organic light emitting display apparatus, and enhances a planarization performance. The organic encapsulation layer can be made of an organic material. For the organic encapsulation layer, silicon oxycarbon (SiOCz) can be used or the acryl or epoxy-based resin can be used, but the present disclosure may not be limited thereto. For example, when the organic encapsulation layer is made of SiOCz, the organic encapsulation layer can be formed by a CVD (chemical vapor deposition) process. Further, SiOCz is the inorganic material, but is able to be classified as the organic material under specific conditions. Specifically, SiOCz has different flow properties depending on a silicon and carbon atomic ratio (C/Si ratio). For example, when the flow properties of SiOCz deteriorate, SiOCz has properties close to the inorganic material, so that a performance of compensating for foreign substances is lowered. When the flow properties thereof are improved, SiOCz has properties close to the organic material, so that the performance of compensating for the foreign substances is improved. The C/Si ratio of SiOCz can be controlled by adjusting a ratio of oxygen (<b>02</b>) and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) during the CVD process. In particular, when the organic encapsulation layer is made of SiOCz, a thickness of the encapsulation portion <b>140</b> can be very small so that the thickness of the organic light emitting display apparatus can be reduced advantageously.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">For example, when the organic encapsulation layer is made of the acrylic or epoxy-based resin, the organic encapsulation layer can be formed by a slit coating or a screen printing process. In this regard, as the epoxy-based resin, high-viscosity bisphenol-A-epoxy, low-viscosity bisphenol-F-epoxy, and the like can be used. The organic encapsulation layer can further contain an additive. For example, a wetting agent that reduces a surface tension of the resin for improving uniformity of the resin, a leveling agent for improving surface flatness of the resin, and a defoaming agent for removing air bubbles contained in the resin can be further added as the additive. The organic encapsulation layer can further contain an initiator. For example, it is possible to use an antimony-based initiator or an anhydride-based initiator that hardens a liquid resin by initiating a chain reaction by heat.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition, when a temperature of the resin rises, viscosity of the liquid resin can be rapidly lowered. After a certain period of time, curing starts and the viscosity can rise sharply, and then, the curing is completed. However, because the resin has high fluidity during the certain period of time when the viscosity is lowered, a possibility of an occurrence of over-application may be particularly increased during such period of time.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The organic encapsulation layer functions to cover foreign substances or particles that can occur during the process. For example, in the first inorganic encapsulation layer, defects due to cracks generated by the foreign substances or the particles may exist. However, such curves and foreign substances can be covered by the organic encapsulation layer, and a top face of the organic encapsulation layer can be planarized. For example, the organic encapsulation layer compensates for the foreign substances and planarizes the display area. As a result, the organic encapsulation layer can be referred to as a foreign substance compensating layer.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The second inorganic encapsulation layer can be formed to cover a top face and side faces of the organic encapsulation layer and a top face of the first inorganic encapsulation layer exposed by the organic encapsulation layer. Accordingly, the second inorganic encapsulation layer minimizes or blocks the penetration of the external moisture or oxygen into the first inorganic encapsulation layer and the organic encapsulation layer. Such second inorganic encapsulation layer can be made of the inorganic insulating material such as the silicon nitride (SiNx), the silicon oxide (SiOx), the silicon oxynitride (SiON), or the aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The first and second inorganic encapsulation layers can be made of the same material, and each can be of a plurality of layers.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, the encapsulation portion <b>140</b> can be preferably formed with a total thickness in a range from 10 IA to 30 &#x3bc;m to sufficiently prevent the moisture penetration from the outside and prevent flow of internal particles and influence of internal particles.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As such, as the metal formation inhibiting layer <b>160</b> including the opening is formed at the position corresponding to the bank <b>128</b> on the second electrode <b>126</b> and the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> connected to the second electrode <b>126</b> is formed in the opening, it is possible to minimize the rise of the sheet resistance of the second electrode <b>126</b> and the voltage drop of the power supply wiring.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, it is possible to minimize defect and chamber contamination due to the foreign substances compared to a method for allowing the second electrode <b>126</b> and the auxiliary electrode <b>170</b> to contact with each other using a laser.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Furthermore, a tact time can be shortened to improve productivity. As a result, it is possible to provide a highly reliable organic light emitting display apparatus according to the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A scope of protection of the present disclosure should be construed by the scope of the claims, and all technical ideas within the scope equivalent thereto should be construed as being included in the scope of the present disclosure.
