Hydrogel is widely applied in the biomedical field, due to its physical and chemical properties similar to extracellular matrix as well as good biocompatibility.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polyethylene glycol is a common raw material for preparing hydrogel, including linear polyethylene glycol and multi-arm polyethylene glycol. Due to the low reactivity of the terminal hydroxyl of the polyethylene glycol, it is usually necessary to derivatize polyethylene glycol to produce terminal groups with different functions, such as carboxy, amino, mercapto, and aldehyde groups. Through the chemical reaction of the terminal group, a chemically cross-linked hydrogel can be conveniently prepared, and the hydrogel can also be functionalized by coupling other molecules. The prior art discloses a variety of polyethylene glycol hydrogels, such as polyethylene glycol hydrogel through the reaction of aldehyde group and amino group and polyethylene glycol hydrogel through enzymatic crosslinking reactions. However, the polyethylene glycol hydrogel prepared by the prior art has a slow gel-forming speed, poor stability, low mechanical strength, and the need to add toxic catalysts and other defects that limit its application in the biomedical field.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of above, the technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a polyethylene glycol derivative, a preparation method thereof, and a polyethylene glycol hydrogel capable of producing a rapid crosslinking reaction.
