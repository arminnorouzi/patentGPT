high pressures and usable with low viscosity fluids.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Axial piston pumps with inclined plate generally comprise a head in which there is at least partially a plurality of cylinders arranged in parallel to each other and in each of which a piston slides to pump a liquid. Said cylinders are connected to a liquid source to pump through a suction channel, usually comprising a primary duct and a plurality of branch ducts that place the primary duct in fluid communication with the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Axial pumps with inclined plate for high pressures with three pistons are known, which on one hand are of relatively simple design and construction, particularly as regards the construction and design of the suction channels, and on the other hand have significant fluctuations in flow rate during operation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present invention is to make available an axial piston pump with reduced delivery flow rate fluctuation which is at the same time of compact and efficient construction in fluid-dynamic terms, all within a rational and affordable solution.

fluctuation which is robust and compact and particularly efficient in fluid-dynamic terms.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0013">According to an aspect of the invention, each suction channel may be transversal to the central axe of the respective cylinder and each delivery channel may be transversal to the central axes of the respective cylinder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0014">In this way the axial compactness of the pump is improved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0015">In order to further improve said advantage, according to another aspect of the invention, in which the suction channels may be made entirely in a portion of the head between a first plane and a second plane perpendicular to the central axes of the cylinders, and the delivery channels may all be made in a portion of the head between the second plane and a third plane, the third plane of which is perpendicular to the central axes of the cylinders and positioned to the side of the second plane on a side opposite the first plane.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0016">According to another aspect of the invention, at least a portion of a suction channel is aligned along a direction parallel to the central axes of the cylinders to at least a portion of a delivery channel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0017">In this way the axial compactness of the pump is improved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">Another aspect of the invention envisages that all the delivery channels can extend along their respective central axes which lie on a same plane, separate from a lying plane of respective central axes along which the suction channels extend.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">This characteristic helps to improve the axial compactness of the pump.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">According to another aspect of the invention, the lying plane of the central axes of the delivery channels and the lying plane of the central axes of the suction channels are perpendicular to the central axes of the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">This characteristics described makes it possible to further improve the axial compactness of the pump in relation to the characteristics described above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0022">According to another aspect of the invention, the housing seats of the suction valves may be aligned along a same transversal axis, for example perpendicular, to the central axes of the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0023">This characteristic improves the compactness of the pump and simplifies access to the valves for maintenance purposes, as this arrangement does not require that the machine on which the pump is installed to have particularly large compartments for access to the pump itself.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0024">For example, the housing seats of the delivery valves may also be aligned along a same transversal axis, for example perpendicular, to the central axes of the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">Preferably the housing seats of the delivery valves are positioned on a diagonally opposite side of the pump from the housing seats of the suction valves.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">An aspect of the invention envisages that the pump may comprise a crankcase, inside which there is at least partially housed a rotating plate adapted to act on the pistons, and a plurality of through holes made in the head and adapted to receive the respective tightening screws configured to fix the head to the crankcase, and in which at least one of either a suction channel or a delivery channel crosses a portion of the head positioned between two adjacent through holes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">According to another aspect of the invention, the pump may comprise five suction valves, five respective housing seats and five respective suction channels, of which a first suction channel has a central axis lying on a centreline plane of the pump parallel to the axes of the cylinders, a second suction channel and a third suction channel are placed on opposite sides of the first suction channel and are parallel to the centreline plane, for example they have central axes parallel to the centreline plane, and a fourth suction channel and a fifth suction channel positioned the first on the side of the second suction channel and the second on the side of the third suction channel and arranged on an inclined plane, for example with central axes inclined in relation to the centreline plane.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">This characteristic makes it possible to improve the radial compactness of the head of the pump. It is specified that radial refers to the radial direction in relation to the central axes of the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0029">Another aspect of the invention envisages that at least of either a delivery channel or a suction channel may comprise a first rectilinear stretch and a second rectilinear stretch inclined in relation to the other, each of said stretches being positioned between two different pairs of adjacent through holes for receiving the tightening screws.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0030">This characteristic helps to improve the radial compactness of the pump.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">Preferably the first rectilinear stretch and the second rectilinear stretch are part of a respective different through hole which extends from a side surface of the head towards the inside of the head.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">In this way the channel, which in the embodiment shown is a delivery channel, but it is not excluded that in an alternative embodiment not shown this could be a suction channel, is easy to create, thus obtaining a compact pump the creation of which is at the same time relatively quick.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0033">Further features and advantages of the invention will be more apparent after reading the following description provided by way of a non-limiting example, with the aid of the figures shown in the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view of an axial piston pump according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a section view of the axial piston pump in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, taken along the plane II-II.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a section view according to the plane III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a section view according to the plane IV-IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a front view of another embodiment of the axial piston pump according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a section view of the axial piston pump in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, taken along the plane VI-VI.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0040">With particular reference to these figures, <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; indicates overall an axial piston pump for high pressures, preferably suited for pumping liquids with low viscosity, for example water.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">For example, the axial piston pump <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; is of the type fitted with a fixed inclination rotating plate, as better described below.
