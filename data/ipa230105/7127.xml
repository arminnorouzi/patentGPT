Generic data traffic, composed of packets, travels through the data plane and signaling traffic, also composed of packets, travels through the control plane. When a cellular device, such as a user equipment (UE), connects to a cellular network, two data pipes are typically set up. One is a data default bearer and one is an internet protocol (IP) multimedia system (IMS) default bearer. The IMS default bearer is used for session initiation protocol (SIP) signaling, which is used for setting up voice calls.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">When a UE attempts to place a voice call, such as a voice over long term evolution (VoLTE) call in 4G, a voice over new radio (VoNR) call in 5G, or a voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) call, SIP signaling over the IMS default bearer in the control plane is used to set up an IMS dedicated bearer for a voice call data pipe. A new IMS dedicated bearer is needed for all new calls and call handover (e.g., a call is transferred from one cell to another cell or from one technology, such as VoLTE, VoNR, and VoWiFi, to another). If a new IMS dedicated bearer cannot be set up in time (e.g., 10 to 15 seconds) when a UE is attempting to place a new voice call, the call will be unsuccessful. If a new IMS dedicated bearer cannot be set up in time during a handover, the call will be dropped. Both scenarios degrade user experience.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following summary is provided to illustrate examples disclosed herein, but is not meant to limit all examples to any particular configuration or sequence of operations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A solution for providing a voice call includes: receiving, from a user equipment (UE), a request to initiate a voice call traffic session; requesting setup of a voice call data pipe; based on at least a setup of the voice call data pipe not completing prior to a timer event, transmitting voice packets over a signaling data pipe; and based on at least the voice call data pipe setup completing, ceasing to transmit voice packets over the signaling data pipe and transmitting voice packets over the voice call data pipe.

Placing a voice call includes: requesting, by the UE, to initiate the voice call traffic session; based on at least a first trigger event, transmitting voice packets over the signaling data pipe; and based on at least a second trigger event, ceasing to transmit voice packets over the signaling data pipe and transmitting voice packets over the voice call data pipe.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some examples, the request to initiate a voice call traffic session comprises a new voice call traffic session, which may be a voice over long term evolution (VoLTE) call in a fourth generation (4G) cellular network, a voice over new radio (VoNR) call in a fifth generation (5G) cellular network, or a voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) call. In some examples, the request to initiate a voice call traffic session comprises a handover of an existing voice call traffic session (e.g., any of VoNR, VoLTE, and VoWiFi) to a handover voice call traffic session (e.g., any of VoNR, VoLTE, and VoWiFi). In some examples, the voice call data pipe comprises an internet protocol (IP) multimedia system (IMS) dedicated bearer, which may be a quality of service (QoS) class identifier (QCI) 1 bearer in 4G or a 5G QoS identifier (5QI) 5 bearer in 5G (a QCI-1 bearer or a 5QI-1 bearer). In some examples, the signaling data pipe comprises an IMS default bearer, which may be a QCI-5 bearer in 4G or a 5QI-5 bearer in 5G.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, the first trigger event comprises receiving an instruction, by the UE, from the wireless network, to transmit voice packets over the signaling data pipe, whereas in some other examples, the first trigger event comprises a setup of the voice call data pipe not completing prior to a timer event. That is, the UE may either transmit voice packets over the signaling data pipe upon instruction from the network or upon its own determination that the voice call data pipe did not complete prior to the timer event. In some examples, the second trigger event comprises receiving an instruction, by the UE, from the wireless network, to transmit voice packets over the voice call data pipe, whereas in some other examples, the second trigger event comprises a setup of the voice call data pipe completing. That is, the UE may either cease transmitting voice packets over the signaling data pipe upon instruction from the network or upon its own determination that the voice call data pipe setup completed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Aspects of the disclosure improve the speed and reliability of cellular communications by transmitting voice packets over a signaling data pipe, and based on at least the voice call data pipe setup completing, ceasing to transmit voice packets over the signaling data pipe and transmitting voice packets over the voice call data pipe. This operation provides multiple advantages. Whereas, previously, the caller needed to wait for the voice call data pipe to complete setting up before the caller could begin speaking with the distant party (e.g., the voice call began), aspects of the disclosure insulate the caller from at least some delays in setting up the voice call data pipe for new calls and/or handovers.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Insulating the caller from delays in setting up the voice call data pipe for new calls, permits the caller to begin speaking with the distant party sooner, and may also reduce the number of call failures. This is because the timer for failing a call setup attempt while the user is waiting may be shorter than if the call had already begun (by using the signaling data pipe). The extended allowable time delay for setting up the voice call data pipe may permit a larger number of calls to proceed. Insulating the caller from delays in setting up the voice call data pipe for handovers reduces the number of calls dropped during handovers, because the voice call is not interrupted by a delay in setting up the voice call data pipe through the new cell. Thus multiple advantageous improvements in speed and reliability become available.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects of the disclosure address intelligently employing this capability by balancing the advantageous use with the risk of overly burdening the control plane. In some examples, one or more timers are employed to trigger the use of the control plane for transmitting voice packets only after a sufficient delay in setting up the voice call data pipe.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an arrangement <b>100</b> that advantageously permits a UE <b>102</b> to transmit voice packets over a control plane <b>120</b> of a (cellular) wireless network <b>110</b>. UE <b>102</b> communicates with a serving base station <b>112</b> over an air interface <b>114</b>. Base station <b>112</b> is part of wireless network <b>110</b>, which comprises control plane <b>120</b> and a user plane <b>130</b>. Control plane <b>120</b> comprises an access node <b>122</b>, a session management node <b>124</b>, and a policy node <b>126</b>. User plane <b>130</b> comprises a packet routing node <b>132</b>, and a proxy call session control function (P-CSCF) <b>134</b>. An evolved packet data gateway (ePDG) <b>146</b> interfaces with IP systems that are not trusted by wireless network <b>110</b>, such as a WiFi router <b>142</b>. As illustrated, ePDG <b>146</b> communicates with elements of both control plane <b>120</b> and user plane <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For 4G, access node <b>122</b> may comprise a mobility management entity (MME), session management node <b>124</b> may comprise a packet data network gateway (PGW) control plane function (PGW-C) and a serving gateway (SGW) control plane function (SGW-C), policy node <b>126</b> may comprise a policy and charging rules function (PCRF), and packet routing node <b>132</b> may comprise a PGW user plane function (PGW-U) and an SGW user plane function (SGW-U). For 5G, access node <b>122</b> may comprise an access and mobility management function (AMF), session management node <b>124</b> may comprise a session management function (SMF), policy node <b>126</b> may comprise a policy control function (PCF), and packet routing node <b>132</b> may comprise a user plane function (UPF).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Arrangement <b>100</b> enables UE <b>102</b> to place a voice call, using a voice call traffic session <b>106</b>, to a UE <b>104</b>. For 4G (VoLTE) and 5G (VoNR) the route for voice packets (voice data packets for voice calls) passes from UE <b>104</b> over air interface <b>114</b>, through base station <b>112</b>, user plane <b>130</b> (e.g., packet routing node <b>132</b> and P-CSCF <b>134</b>), and an IMS <b>150</b>, which includes an IMS access gateway (IMS-AGW <b>152</b>) to UE <b>104</b>. For 4G and 5G signaling to set up voice call traffic session <b>106</b> for the voice call passes from UE <b>104</b> over air interface <b>114</b>, through base station <b>112</b> to control plane <b>120</b>, specifically through access node <b>122</b> to session management node <b>124</b>. However, as illustrated, session management node <b>124</b> is communicatively coupled to elements within user plane <b>130</b>. This is so that session management node <b>124</b> is able to instruct packet routing node <b>132</b> and P-CSCF <b>134</b> to assign and release resources. This connectivity provides a path for voice packets through control plane <b>120</b> to IMS <b>150</b> (and thus to UE <b>104</b>) that is parallel to the path through user plane <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For VoWiFi, different options exist. For managed VoWiFi, the route for voice packets passes from UE <b>104</b> over an air interface <b>144</b>, through WiFi router <b>142</b>, user plane <b>130</b>, and IMS <b>150</b> to UE <b>104</b>. Also for managed VoWiFi, signaling to set up voice call traffic session <b>106</b> for the voice call passes from UE <b>104</b> over air interface <b>144</b>, through WiFi router <b>142</b>, and into control plane <b>120</b>. Unmanaged VoWiFi, however, passes from wireless network <b>110</b> through a network <b>660</b>, which is described in further detail in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, to IMS <b>150</b>, outside of wireless network <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A voice packet routing component <b>128</b>, which manages the transmission of voice packets by wireless network <b>110</b>, is illustrated within control plane <b>120</b> and is described in further detail in relation to the following figures. Voice packet routing component <b>128</b> is illustrated as having a timer <b>129</b> and being located within session management node <b>124</b>, although voice packet routing component <b>128</b> may be located elsewhere within control plane <b>120</b>, in some examples. A voice packet routing component <b>118</b> within UE <b>102</b> manages the transmission of voice packets by UE <b>102</b> using a timer <b>119</b>, and is also described in further detail in relation to the following figures.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates exemplary data pipes <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b>, used in arrangement <b>100</b>. When UE <b>102</b> connects to wireless network <b>110</b>, general data pipe <b>202</b> is set up as a data default bearer, as a QCI-9 bearer in 4G or a 5QI-9 bearer in 5G. General data pipe <b>202</b> is used for generic data (e.g., streaming video) and is a non-guaranteed bit rate (non-GBR) bearer with an allowance for a 100 millisecond (ms) packet delay and a 1/1,000,000 packet loss rate. Also, after UE <b>102</b> connects to wireless network <b>110</b>, signaling data pipe <b>204</b> is set up as an IMS default bearer, as a QCI-5 bearer in 4G or a 5QI-5 bearer in 5G. Signaling data pipe <b>204</b> is used for IMS signaling, such as session initiation protocol (SIP) signaling that is used for setting up voice call traffic session <b>106</b>. Signaling data pipe <b>204</b> is also a non-GBR bearer with an allowance for a 100 ms packet delay and a 1/1,000,000 packet loss rate. However, whereas packets in generic data pipe <b>202</b> have a priority of 9, packets in signaling data pipe <b>204</b> have a priority of 1 (highest priority). Typically, default bearers (e.g., general data pipes <b>202</b> and signaling data pipe <b>204</b>) remain active while UE <b>102</b> remains attached to wireless network <b>110</b>, and each has its own IP address.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In typical voice call scenarios, when UE <b>102</b> sends the SIP signaling to wireless network <b>110</b>, a voice call data pipe <b>206</b> is set up to transmit voice packets of voice call traffic session <b>106</b>, and released when voice call traffic session <b>106</b> ends (or is replaced by another data pipe <b>206</b> during a handover). Voice call data pipe <b>206</b> is set up as an IMS dedicated bearer, as a QCI-1 bearer in 4G or a 5QI-1 bearer in 5G. Voice call data pipe <b>206</b> is a guaranteed bit rate (GBR) bearer with an allowance for a 100 ms packet delay and a 1/100 packet loss rate with a priority of 2 (second highest priority). A dedicated bearer is linked to a default bearer to provide a dedicated tunnel for specific traffic (e.g., voice traffic) and share the same IP address.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When UE <b>102</b> sends a request to initiate voice call traffic session <b>106</b> to wireless network <b>110</b> (specifically to session management node <b>124</b>), setup of voice call data pipe <b>206</b> may take time or may require multiple attempts. It is during this delay period that voice packet routing component <b>128</b> transmits voice packets over signaling data pipe <b>204</b> for downlink traffic (to UE <b>102</b>) and voice packet routing component <b>118</b> controls UE <b>102</b> to transmit voice packets over signaling data pipe <b>204</b> for uplink traffic (from UE <b>102</b>). Different schemes may be used to manage this behavior. Either voice packet routing component <b>118</b> may determine that setup of voice call data pipe <b>206</b> has not completed, and begin using signaling data pipe <b>204</b> without instruction from wireless network <b>110</b>, or voice packet routing component <b>118</b> may wait for an instruction from wireless network <b>110</b> (thereby waiting for permission from wireless network <b>110</b> to use signaling data pipe <b>204</b> for voice traffic).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Voice call data pipe <b>206</b>, the typical data pipe used for voice packets, has a lower priority and permits a higher error (or packet loss) rate than signaling data pipe <b>204</b>. Thus, overuse of signaling data pipe <b>204</b> for voice traffic places a high burden on wireless network <b>110</b>. Timer <b>119</b> in voice packet routing component <b>118</b> and timer <b>129</b> in voice packet routing component <b>118</b> provide for a minimum wait time before the use of signaling data pipe <b>204</b> for voice traffic, so that short delays in setting up voice call data pipe <b>206</b> do not trigger the use of signaling data pipe <b>204</b> for voice traffic. This saves the use of signaling data pipe <b>204</b> for voice traffic for scenarios that impact users more significantly, such as when a voice call setup may fail or a voice call may drop during handover.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the transmission of voice packets P<b>301</b>-P<b>303</b> over signaling data pipe <b>204</b> and the transmission of voice packets P<b>304</b>-P<b>306</b> over voice call data pipe <b>206</b>.
