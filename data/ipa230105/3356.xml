The CAN protocol is often used, in some of their variants (CAN-FD is one of the most used ones) to transfer data between the PCM and the light module. However, some car manufacturers decide to limit the bandwidth of the CAN protocol, and this affects the management operations, which usually requires about 5 Mbps. The PCM is a Pixel Control Module, which is a control unit configured to manage the pixel pattern of each light module. Since each headlamp may comprises different light modules arranged to manage partially or totally at least one lighting function, it is important that they are controlled by a single control unit such as the PCM.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current compression methods are not very efficient for high beam patterns, and this compromises the bandwidth reduction which is requested by car manufacturers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This problem is even worse with the modern high resolution modules, where the information amount is much higher, while the limit in the bandwidth does not increase.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A solution for this problem is sought.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention provides a solution for these problems by means of a method for managing image data in an automotive lighting device, the method comprising the steps of<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">providing an image pattern comprising a plurality of pixels, wherein each pixel is characterized by a numeric value related to the luminous intensity of the pixel;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">divide the image pattern in rows or columns of pixels, thus creating a plurality of row patterns;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">choose a first pixel of one of the row patterns and calculating a first gradient value related to the relation between the numeric value of the first pixel and the numeric value of an adjacent pixel;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">calculating, for each pixel, a corresponding gradient value;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">checking, for each pixel, if the difference between the corresponding gradient value and the first gradient fulfills one of a first or second condition;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0013">repeating the former step until finding an end pixel where the difference between the corresponding gradient and the first gradient does not fulfill the first condition;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0014">defining a linear segment between the first pixel and the end pixel;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0015">choosing a different first pixel and repeat the steps of calculating the first gradient value, calculating corresponding gradient values, checking the fulfillment of a first and second conditions, finding the end pixel and define a linear segment until defining segments for the whole row pattern;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0016">compressing the data of the linear segments; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0017">sending the compressed data to a light module of the lighting device.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0018">This method is aimed to manage the image data which is exchanged between a control unit and a light module. The control unit is in charge of calculating the image pattern and the compression data, and may be located in any position of the automotive vehicle, not necessarily physically inside the lighting device. The lighting module is aimed to provide a light pattern, either for lighting or signaling, and is located inside the lighting device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0019">The main advantage of this method is the increase in the compression rate, due to the optimization in the extension of the linear segments. The abovementioned method provides a fast and reliable way of extending the segment until the conditions are not met, thus providing a lower amount of data compared to the original pixels replaced thereby, especially when the image pattern is referred to a high beam pattern. The pseudo-Gaussian shape of the row patterns also contributes to the compression rate being increased, since there are some portions of the row pattern which can be replaced by a linear approximation without a significant loss in data.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0020">In some particular embodiments, the light pixels of the image pattern are grey scale pixels, and more particularly, the luminous intensity of each pixel is according to a scale from 0 to 255.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0021">Light modules usually define the light pattern on a grey scale, where the luminous intensity is graded from 0 to 255. This is a way of quantifying the light pattern so that it becomes able to be converted into light data, and then transmitted and managed by the control unit of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0022">In some particular embodiments, the first condition comprises defining a first threshold value and checking if the absolute value of the difference between the corresponding gradient value and the first gradient is lower or equal than the first threshold value.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0023">For each pixel, the first condition is checked. This first condition compares the corresponding gradient value calculated for each pixel with the first gradient value, which was calculated regarding the first pixel of the segment. When the corresponding gradient value deviates from the first gradient value in an amount which is higher than the first threshold value, the segment will finish in this end pixel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0024">In some particular embodiments, the second condition comprises defining a second threshold value and checking if the absolute value of the corresponding gradient value is lower or equal than the second threshold value.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0025">For each pixel, the second condition is checked. This second condition just verifies that the absolute value of the corresponding gradient value calculated for each pixel is lower than a second threshold value. This is used to detect sudden high gradients.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0026">In some particular embodiments, the method further comprises the step of decompressing the compressed data.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0027">This step is convenient when the original image is to be projected by the light module.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0028">In some particular embodiments, the compressed data is related only to a particular portion of the image pattern.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0029">This cropping step is useful when a big portion of the image is completely dark, so that the compression stage is focused only on the portion which include representative values.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">In a second inventive aspect, the invention provides a lighting device comprising<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0031">a light module comprising a plurality of light sources; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0032">a control unit to carry out the steps of a method according to the first inventive aspect.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0033">This lighting device is able to operate with a lower bandwidth than the traditional ones.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0034">In some particular embodiments, the light module further comprises a processor unit, the processor unit being configured to decompress the compressed data.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0035">With a decompression stage in the proper light module, the bandwidth is narrowed until the module itself.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0036">In some particular embodiments, the light sources are solid-state light sources, such as LEDs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0037">The term &#x201c;solid state&#x201d; refers to light emitted by solid-state electroluminescence, which uses semiconductors to convert electricity into light. Compared to incandescent lighting, solid state lighting creates visible light with reduced heat generation and less energy dissipation. The typically small mass of a solid-state electronic lighting device provides for greater resistance to shock and vibration compared to brittle glass tubes/bulbs and long, thin filament wires. They also eliminate filament evaporation, potentially increasing the life span of the illumination device. Some examples of these types of lighting comprise semiconductor light-emitting diodes (LEDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), or polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED) as sources of illumination rather than electrical filaments, plasma or gas.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0038">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein are to be interpreted as is customary in the art.

Each pattern comprises a string of data, with numbers between 0 and 255, depending on the luminous intensity of the associated pixels. Obviously, the numeric values of these pixels are a simplified example, merely chosen for the sake of a better understanding of the invention, they do not correspond to the luminous intensity of the light pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> represents the first row of the previous Figure.

For each pixel, with respect to the previous Figure, the numeric value of the luminous intensity has been replaced by the corresponding gradient value.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">The first pixel is taken as the starting point of the first linear segment. Then, for each pixel, two conditions are checked. If a pixel fulfills the two conditions, then this pixel belongs to the same linear segment.
