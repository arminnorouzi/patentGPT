Applications</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method S<b>100</b> can be executed by a computer system in conjunction with an additive manufacturing system <b>100</b> (hereinafter the &#x201c;manufacturing system <b>100</b>&#x201d;) to control print duration, dimensional accuracy, and surface finish quality of a 3D-printed part. In particular, the computer system can: interface with a user to assign dimensional tolerances and surface finish qualities (e.g., textures) to regions of a 3D part model; extract these characteristics directly from the model; or retrieve the characteristics from secondary data (e.g., a texture and dimensional tolerance file or lookup table) provided by the user. The computer system can then automatically: segment the 3D part model into a sequence of model layers; segment each model layer into a set of nesting layer shells; and assign print parameters (e.g., exposure time and/or exposure intensity, exposure energy) to each layer shell based on these dimensional tolerances and surface finish qualities.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally, when a region of a volume of resin&#x2014;arranged over a build window in the manufacturing system <b>100</b>&#x2014;is exposed to radiation (e.g., &#x201c;light&#x201d;), monomers and/or oligomers in the exposed region of resin cross-link to form polymers and thus form a solid layer of a part (i.e., a &#x201c;print layer&#x201d;). However, a polymerized region of the volume of resin may differ from the exposed region of the volume of resin. For example, over-exposure of the resin at excess exposure intensity and/or over excess exposure duration (i.e., excess power exposure) may cause the resin to polymerize outwardly past the exposed region of the resin: such that the polymerized region of the resin layer is larger than the exposed region; and/or such that smaller, detailed features defined along the perimeter of the exposed region of the resin layer are lost (or &#x201c;overwhelmed,&#x201d; &#x201c;consumed&#x201d;) by polymerization reactions continuing beyond the exposed region. Such excess power exposure of the resin relative to energy at which the resin polymerizes may therefore reduce the dimensional accuracy, surface finish control, and fidelity of this print layer of the part.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the foregoing example, in addition to extending laterally beyond the exposed region of the volume of resin, such polymerization bleed may also extend vertically (e.g., upwardly) to a preceding print layer of the part, thereby: polymerizing uncured resin present on the surface of the preceding print layer; increasing the size of the preceding print layer; over-coating smaller, detailed features in this preceding print layer; and thus diminishing dimensional accuracy, surface finish control, and fidelity of the preceding print layer of the part.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Conversely, under-exposure of the resin at insufficient exposure intensity and/or over an insufficient exposure duration (i.e., insufficient power exposure) may yield insufficient polymerization of the layer of resin: such that the polymerized region of the layer of resin is smaller than the exposed region; such that smaller, detailed features defined along the perimeter of the exposed region are lost due to insufficient polymerization; and/or such that this layer of resin fails to bond to the preceding print layer of the part. Such insufficient power exposure of the resin relative to energy at which the resin polymerizes may therefore diminish dimensional accuracy, surface finish control, and fidelity of this print layer of the part and increasing likelihood of print failure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, for each model layer of the 3D part model, the computer system can execute the method S<b>100</b> to define a print image and print parameters that, when executed by the manufacturing system <b>100</b>: produce at least a minimum crosslink density across the corresponding part layer and between the part layer and the preceding part layer (e.g., hereinafter &#x201c;target polymerization&#x201d;) to achieve a minimum green strength and inter-layer bond strength of the part; achieve dimensional accuracy of the part layer that fulfills dimensional tolerances assigned to vertices, surfaces, and regions of the corresponding model layer; achieve selective polymerization along the perimeter of the part layer that replicates surface finishes (e.g., textures) assigned to edges of the corresponding model layer; and reduce warpage of the final part due to internal stresses from interlayer shrinkage or thermal expansion effects during fabrication.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, to achieve tighter dimensional tolerances and/or tighter surface finish controls, the computer system can segment a 3D part model into more, thinner model layers and segment each of these model layers into a greater quantity of nested shell layers. Thus, when the manufacturing system <b>100</b> sequentially exposes a layer of resin to print images across to a sequence of nested shell layers, the manufacturing system <b>100</b> can incrementally approach a target cross-section of this part layer: with minimal or no polymerization of resin beyond the dimensional tolerance of the boundary of this target cross-section; and with target polymerization of resin within the dimensional tolerance of the boundary of this target cross-section. Conversely, to achieve faster print times (at the expense of dimensional tolerances and/or surface finish controls), the computer system can segment a 3D part model into fewer, thicker model layers and segment each of these model layers into a smaller quantity of nested shell layers, thereby enabling the manufacturing system <b>100</b> to complete each part layer of the part in less time and thus reduce the total print time for the part.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">3.

The projection subsystem <b>120</b> can emit electromagnetic radiation in one or more wavelength bands tuned to the chemical and physical properties of the resin and its specific curing process. For example, the projection subsystem <b>120</b> (e.g., a digital UV projector) can project electromagnetic radiation in an emissive spectrum of 300-nanometer to 450-nanometers. The projection subsystem <b>120</b> is electrically coupled to the controller; receives potentially software-modified frames corresponding to full or partial cross-sections of a three-dimensional model of the build; and projects electromagnetic radiation through the build window <b>110</b> to selectively photocure volumes of the resin according to build settings and the received frames.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one variation, the manufacturing system <b>100</b> can include a projection subsystem <b>120</b>, which further includes a set of light sources, such as projectors or other electromagnetic emitting devices.

The build window no is arranged above the projection subsystem <b>120</b> and aligned with the projection area of the projection subsystem <b>120</b> such that the focal plane of the projection subsystem <b>120</b> coincides with the resin interface. Generally, the build window no is substantially transparent (e.g., exhibiting greater than 85% transmittance) to the emissive spectrum of the projection subsystem <b>120</b> and thus passes electromagnetic radiation output by the projection subsystem <b>120</b> into the resin above the build window no. The build window no also functions as a rigid support and reference surface for the interface layer of resin arranged thereover. The build window no is statically mounted to a base assembly that can include the projection subsystem <b>120</b>, the build platform <b>102</b> and/or the build chamber <b>130</b> to ensure repeatable, accurate alignment between the build window <b>110</b> and the rest of the base assembly. The interface between the base assembly and the build window no is also gas-impermeable such that a pressure gradient, such as 300 kilopascals, can be sustained across the build window no.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The base assembly can include a build window no manufactured from a pane of transparent, rigid glass, such as amorphous/silicate or crystalline/ceramic glass. In particular, the build window no can be both transparent to UV (or other) light output by the projection subsystem <b>120</b> and can be substantially rigid, hard, and temperature-stable to form a robust, flat reference surface that may exhibit minimal deflection or deformation during multiple build cycles, thereby yielding high and consistent build quality.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one variation, the base assembly can include a build window no that is transmissive to infrared (hereinafter &#x201c;IR&#x201d;) radiation such that a thermal image sensor <b>160</b> positioned below the build window no can accurately calculate the temperature of the resin at the resin interface.

The manufacturing system <b>100</b> can include a linear actuation manufacturing system <b>100</b> (with increments as small as 0.1 microns) mechanically coupled to the build platform <b>102</b>. Additionally, during actuation of the linear actuation manufacturing system <b>100</b>, the controller: can track forces applied by the linear actuation manufacturing system <b>100</b> to the build platform <b>102</b> (e.g., based on a current draw of the linear actuation manufacturing system <b>100</b> or by sampling a force sensor or strain gauge coupled to the build platform <b>102</b>); and implement closed-loop techniques to control movement of the linear actuation manufacturing system <b>100</b> in order to achieve a particular distribution of separation forces. Thus, during the build cycle, the linear actuation manufacturing system <b>100</b> lowers the build platform <b>102</b> to specific heights above build window no such that photocured resin adheres to the build surface of the build platform <b>102</b> facing the build window no. As the manufacturing system <b>100</b> selectively cures successive layers of the build, the manufacturing system <b>100</b> can retract the build platform <b>102</b> upward by a first distance in order to separate the current layer of the build from the build window <b>110</b> and then advance the build platform <b>102</b> in preparation for curing a successive layer of the build.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">3.4 Build Chamber</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The manufacturing system <b>100</b> includes a sealed (i.e. airtight up to five atmospheres build chamber <b>130</b> that encloses) the build window no, build tray <b>140</b>, build platform <b>102</b> and/or any of the other previously described components of the manufacturing system <b>100</b>. The build chamber <b>130</b> is configured to allow access to the build platform <b>102</b> and to allow insertion and removal of the build tray <b>140</b> (e.g., via a hatch/door manufacturing system <b>100</b>) to remove completed builds from the manufacturing system <b>100</b>, to fill the build tray <b>140</b> with resin, and/or to remove and replace the build tray <b>140</b>. Additionally, the build chamber <b>130</b> contains the gaseous environment located above the resin reservoir and the build tray <b>140</b> into which the build platform <b>102</b> is retracted during the manufacturing process.

In one implementation, the upper member of the build tray <b>140</b> defines a rectangular build area. Additionally, the build tray <b>140</b> can define an inner surface that extends upward and perpendicular to the build window <b>110</b>. The inner surface then angles upward and outward in a conical shape, wherein the vertical cross section of the conical inner surface has dimensions proportionally similar to the vertical cross-section of the perpendicular inner surface. Thus, the perpendicular and conical sections of the inner surface define a volume for containing the resin reservoir. However, the build tray <b>140</b> can define any rounded internal volume. Additionally, the build tray <b>140</b> can include integrated heating and/or cooling elements (e.g., resistive cooling elements or water-cooling systems) as further described below. The manufacturing system <b>100</b> can activate the heating and/or cooling elements to adjust the bulk resin temperature within the build tray <b>140</b>, as is further described below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The build tray <b>140</b> can also interlock with reference surfaces in the base assembly. In one implementation, the base assembly and/or the build tray <b>140</b> contain magnets, which kinematically align the build tray <b>140</b> to the base assembly by biasing the build tray <b>140</b> against the reference surfaces in the base assembly.

The thermal image sensor <b>160</b> is electrically coupled to the controller, thereby enabling the controller to record thermal images of the resin interface.

Therefore, for a model layer in the part model, the computer system can generate: a first set of (e.g., two) exposure shells with higher exposure intensities and/or longer exposure durations and associated with a first pre-exposure resin temperature range; and a second set of (e.g., three) exposure shells with lower exposure intensities and/or shorter exposure durations and associated with a second, higher pre-exposure resin temperature range.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0143">For example, the computer system can: detect a first edge in a first model layer in Block S<b>132</b>; calculate a first erosion distance proportional to a first resin temperature range; define a first set of exposure shells in Block S<b>150</b> including a first outer exposure shell inset from the first edge by a first erosion distance and a first inner exposure shell inset from the first outer exposure shell and scheduled for exposure separately from (e.g., before) the first outer exposure shell; define a first set of exposure intensities in Block S<b>160</b> including a first outer exposure intensity assigned to the first outer exposure shell and a first inner exposure intensity greater than the first outer exposure intensity and assigned to the first inner exposure shell; and assign the first set of exposure shells and the first set of exposure intensities to the first resin temperature range.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0144">Similarly, in this example, the computer system can: calculate a first alternate erosion distance&#x2014;less than the first erosion distance&#x2014;proportional to a second resin temperature range less than the first resin temperature range; define a first alternate set of exposure shells including a first alternate outer exposure shell inset from the first edge by the first alternate erosion distance; define a first alternate set of exposure intensities including a first alternate outer exposure intensity greater than the first outer exposure intensity; and assign the first alternate set of exposure shells and the first alternate set of exposure intensities to the second resin temperature range. The computer system can then compile these exposure shells and alternate exposure shells into print images for the first layer of the 3D part model.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0145">In this example, the manufacturing system <b>100</b> can then: load these print images; load a first volume of resin into a first interstitial volume over a build window; and detect a temperature of the first volume of resin, such as via the thermal image sensor described above. Then, in response to the temperature of the first volume of resin falling within the first resin temperature range, the computer system can: expose the first volume of resin according to the first inner exposure shell at the first inner exposure intensity to selectively polymerize resin within an inner region of the first volume of resin; and expose the first volume of resin according to the first outer exposure shell at the first outer exposure intensity to selectively polymerize resin within an outer region of the first volume of resin and to form a first part layer of the part such that a perimeter of the outer region of the first volume of resin approximates the first edge of the first model layer.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="2">14.1 Temperature Gradient</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0146">In another implementation, after exposing a first part layer to a first set of print images according to a first print file during the build, the computer system can read a temperature gradient across the build window from the thermal sensor. The manufacturing system <b>100</b> can then switch to a print file containing a greater average or peak quantity of shell layers per model layer in preparation for printing a next layer of the part if: a) the temperature gradient across the exposed region of the first part layer is large (which may indicate a wide range of green strengths across this first part layer and therefore increased opportunity for internal stresses and warping across the corresponding region of the completed part); and b) this temperature gradient closely follows the edge of the exposed region of the first part layer (i.e., this temperature gradient exhibits consistent offset from the edge of the exposed region of the part layer over multiple temperature ranges). More specifically, if the last part layer exhibits a temperature gradient that is uniform but steeper than a target temperature gradient, the manufacturing system <b>100</b> can elect to polymerize the next part layer with a greater quantity of print images depicting more shell layers in the next model layer in order to reduce the temperature gradient across the next part layer, achieve more consistent green strength across this next part layer, and improve dimensional tolerances across this next part layer.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0147">Conversely, the manufacturing system <b>100</b> can elect the same print file for the next layer of the part, reduce the nominal light intensity of print images depicting inner shells of the next model layer, and/or increase delay time between exposure of successive print images for this next part layer if: a) the temperature gradient across the exposed region of the first part layer is large; and b) the temperature gradient is largest across large features in the first part layer. More specifically, if the last part layer exhibits a temperature gradient that is non-uniform around larger features, the manufacturing system <b>100</b> can elect the same quantity of print images depicting the same quantity of shell layers in the next model layer but decrease exposure power for inner shells&#x2014;which corresponding to larger features&#x2014;and/or increase a delay time between print image exposures for this next part layer in order to reduce the temperature gradient across the next part layer, achieve more consistent green strength across larger features in this next part layer, improve dimensional tolerances across this next part layer, and/or reduce internal stresses within the part.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0148">The systems and methods described herein can be embodied and/or implemented at least in part as a machine configured to receive a computer-readable medium storing computer-readable instructions.
