Resolution is made high by super-resolution processing. In this case, the super-resolution processing is performed after edge enhancement processing is performed. Accordingly, a stereoscopic image with high resolution and high quality can be displayed. Alternatively, after image analysis processing is performed, edge enhancement processing and super-resolution processing are concurrently performed.

For example, an electrical switch, a mechanical switch, or the like can be used as a switch. That is, any element can be used as a switch as long as it can control current, without limitation to a certain element. For example, a transistor (e.g., a bipolar transistor or a MOS transistor), a diode (e.g., a PN diode, a PIN diode, a Schottky diode, an MIM (metal insulator metal) diode, an MIS (metal insulator semiconductor) diode, or a diode-connected transistor), a logic circuit in which such elements are combined, or the like can be used as a switch. An example of a mechanical switch is a switch formed using a MEMS (micro electro mechanical system) technology, such as a digital micromirror device (DMD). Such a switch includes an electrode which can be moved mechanically, and operates by controlling conduction and non-conduction in accordance with movement of the electrode.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the case of using a transistor as a switch, the polarity (conductivity type) of the transistor is not particularly limited to a certain type because it operates just as a switch. However, a transistor having polarity with smaller off-state current is preferably used when the amount of off-state current is to be suppressed. Examples of a transistor with smaller off-state current are a transistor provided with an LDD region, a transistor with a multi-gate structure, and the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Note that in the case of using a transistor as a switch, an n-channel transistor is preferably used as the switch when a potential of a source of the transistor which is operated as the switch is close to a potential of a low-potential-side power supply (e.g., Vss, GND, or 0 V). On the other hand, a p-channel transistor is preferably used as the switch when the potential of the source is close to a potential of a high-potential-side power supply (e.g., Vdd). This is because the absolute value of gate-source voltage can be increased when the potential of the source of the n-channel transistor is close to a potential of a low-potential-side power supply and when the potential of the source of the p-channel transistor is close to a potential of a high-potential-side power supply, so that the transistor can be more accurately operated as a switch. Alternatively, this is because the transistor does not often perform source follower operation, so that the decrease in output voltage does not often occur.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Note that a CMOS switch may be used as a switch with the use of both an n-channel transistor and a p-channel transistor. By using a CMOS switch, the switch can be more accurately operated as a switch because current can flow when either the p-channel transistor or the n-channel transistor is turned on. Thus, voltage can be appropriately output regardless of whether voltage of an input signal to the switch is high or low. Alternatively, since the voltage amplitude value of a signal for turning on or off the switch can be made small, power consumption can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Note that when a transistor is used as a switch, the switch includes an input terminal (one of a source and a drain), an output terminal (the other of the source and the drain), and a terminal for controlling conduction (a gate) in some cases. On the other hand, when a diode is used as a switch, the switch does not include a terminal for controlling conduction in some cases. Therefore, when a diode is used as a switch, the number of wirings for controlling terminals can be further reduced as compared to the case of using a transistor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Note that a display element, a display device which is a device including a display element, a light-emitting element, and a light-emitting device which is a device including a light-emitting element can employ various modes and can include various elements.

In addition, different examples of a plasma display panel are a plasma display panel which has a structure where a plasma tube is sandwiched between film-form electrodes from the top and the bottom, and the like. The plasma tube is formed by sealing a discharge gas, RGB fluorescent materials, and the like inside a glass tube. Note that the plasma display panel can perform display by application of voltage between the electrodes to generate an ultraviolet ray so that a phosphor emits light.

Note that the present invention is not limited to this, and a variety of plasma display panels can be used.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Note that electroluminescence, a cold cathode fluorescent lamp, a hot cathode fluorescent lamp, an LED, a laser light source, a mercury lamp, or the like can be used as a light source of a display device in which a light source is needed, such as a liquid crystal display (e.g., a transmissive liquid crystal display, a transflective liquid crystal display, a reflective liquid crystal display, a direct-view liquid crystal display, or a projection liquid crystal display), a display device including a grating light valve (GLV), or a display device including a digital micromirror device (DMD), for example. Note that the present invention is not limited to this, and a variety of light sources can be used as a light source.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Note that transistors with a variety of structures can be used as a transistor, without limitation to a certain type. For example, a thin film transistor (TFT) including a non-single-crystal semiconductor film typified by amorphous silicon, polycrystalline silicon, microcrystalline (also referred to as microcrystal, nanocrystal, or semi-amorphous) silicon, or the like can be used as a transistor. In the case of using the TFT, there are various advantages. For example, since the TFT can be formed at temperature which is lower than that of the case of using single crystal silicon, manufacturing cost can be reduced or a manufacturing apparatus can be made large. Since the manufacturing apparatus can be made large, the TFT can be formed using a large substrate. Therefore, many display devices can be formed concurrently at low cost. Alternatively, since the manufacturing temperature is low, a substrate having low heat resistance can be used. Therefore, the transistor can be formed using a light-transmitting substrate. Alternatively, transmission of light in a display element can be controlled by using the transistor formed using the light-transmitting substrate. Alternatively, part of a film included in the transistor can transmit light because the thickness of the transistor is small. Therefore, the aperture ratio can be improved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that by using a catalyst (e.g., nickel) in the case of forming polycrystalline silicon. crystallinity can be further improved and a transistor having excellent electrical characteristics can be formed. Accordingly, a gate driver circuit (e.g., a scan line driver circuit), a source driver circuit (e.g., a signal line driver circuit), and a signal processing circuit (e.g., a signal generation circuit, a gamma correction circuit, or a DA converter circuit) can be formed using the same substrate as a pixel portion.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Note that by using a catalyst (e.g., nickel) in the case of forming microcrystalline silicon, crystallinity can be further improved and a transistor having excellent electrical characteristics can be formed. In this case, crystallinity can be improved by just performing heat treatment without performing laser irradiation. Accordingly, a gate driver circuit (e.g., a scan line driver circuit) and part of a source driver circuit (e.g., an analog switch) can be formed using the same substrate as a pixel portion. Note that in the case where laser irradiation for crystallization is not performed, unevenness in crystallinity of silicon can be suppressed. Therefore, high-quality images can be displayed. Note that polycrystalline silicon or microcrystalline silicon can be formed without use of a catalyst (e.g., nickel).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note that it is preferable that crystallinity of silicon be improved to polycrystal, microcrystal, or the like in the whole panel; however, the present invention is not limited to this. Crystallinity of silicon may be improved only in part of the panel. Selective improvement in crystallinity is possible by selective laser irradiation or the like. For example, only a peripheral driver circuit region excluding pixels may be irradiated with laser light. Alternatively, only a region of a gate driver circuit, a source driver circuit, or the like may be irradiated with laser light. Alternatively, only part of a source driver circuit (e.g., an analog switch) may be irradiated with laser light. Accordingly, crystallinity of silicon can be improved only in a region in which a circuit needs to be operated at high speed. Since a pixel region is not particularly needed to be operated at high speed, even if crystallinity is not improved, the pixel circuit can be operated without problems. Thus, a region whose crystallinity is improved is small, so that manufacturing steps can be decreased. Thus, throughput can be increased and manufacturing cost can be reduced. Alternatively, since the number of necessary manufacturing apparatus is small, manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Note that for example, a transistor including a compound semiconductor or an oxide semiconductor, such as ZnO, a-InGaZnO, SiGe, GaAs, IZO, ITO, SnO, TiO, or AlZnSnO (AZTO), a thin film transistor obtained by thinning such a compound semiconductor or an oxide semiconductor, or the like can be used as a transistor. Thus, manufacturing temperature can be lowered and, for example, such a transistor can be formed at room temperature. Accordingly, the transistor can be formed directly on a substrate having low heat resistance, such as a plastic substrate or a film substrate. Note that such a compound semiconductor or an oxide semiconductor can be used not only for a channel portion of the transistor but also for other applications. For example, such a compound semiconductor or an oxide semiconductor can be used for a wiring, a resistor, a pixel electrode, a light-transmitting electrode, or the like. Since such an element can be formed at the same time as the transistor, cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Note that for example, a transistor or the like formed by an inkjet method or a printing method can be used as a transistor. Thus, a transistor can be formed at room temperature, can be formed at a low vacuum, or can be formed using a large substrate. Therefore, the transistor can be formed without use of a mask (reticle), so that the layout of the transistor can be easily changed. Alternatively, since the transistor can be formed without use of a resist, material cost is reduced and the number of steps can be reduced. Alternatively, since a film can be formed where needed, a material is not wasted as compared to a manufacturing method by which etching is performed after the film is formed over the entire surface, so that cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Note that for example, a transistor or the like including an organic semiconductor or a carbon nanotube can be used as a transistor. Thus, such a transistor can be formed over a flexible substrate. A semiconductor device formed using such a substrate can resist shocks.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Note that transistors with a variety of different structures can be used as a transistor. For example, a MOS transistor, a junction transistor, a bipolar transistor, or the like can be used as a transistor. By using a MOS transistor as a transistor, the size of the transistor can be reduced. Thus, a large number of transistors can be mounted. By using a bipolar transistor as a transistor, a large amount of current can flow. Thus, a circuit can be operated at high speed. Note that a MOS transistor and a bipolar transistor may be formed over one substrate. Thus, reduction in power consumption, reduction in size, high-speed operation, and the like can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that for example, a transistor with a multi-gate structure having two or more gate electrodes can be used as a transistor. With the multi-gate structure, a structure where a plurality of transistors are connected in series is provided because channel regions are connected in series. Thus, with the multi-gate structure, the amount of off-state current can be reduced and the withstand voltage of the transistor can be increased (reliability can be improved). Alternatively, with the multi-gate structure, drain-source current does not fluctuate very much even when drain-source voltage fluctuates when the transistor operates in a saturation region, so that a flat slope of voltage-current characteristics can be obtained. By utilizing the flat slope of the voltage-current characteristics, an ideal current source circuit or an active load having an extremely large resistance value can be realized. Accordingly, a differential circuit, a current mirror circuit, or the like having excellent properties can be realized.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Note that for example, a transistor with a structure where gate electrodes are formed above and below a channel can be used as a transistor. With the structure where the gate electrodes are formed above and below the channel, a circuit structure where a plurality of transistors are connected in parallel is provided. Thus, a channel region is increased, so that the amount of current can be increased. Alternatively, with the structure where gate electrodes are formed above and below the channel, a depletion layer can be easily formed, so that subthreshold swing can be improved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Note that for example, a transistor with a structure where a gate electrode is formed above a channel region, a structure where a gate electrode is formed below a channel region, a staggered structure, an inverted staggered structure, a structure where a channel region is divided into a plurality of regions, a structure where channel regions are connected in parallel or in series, or the like can be used as a transistor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Note that for example, a transistor with a structure where a source electrode or a drain electrode overlaps with a channel region (or part of it) can be used as a transistor.

By providing the LDD region, the amount of off-state current can be reduced or the withstand voltage of the transistor can be increased (reliability can be improved). Alternatively, by providing the LDD region, drain-source current does not fluctuate very much even when drain-source voltage fluctuates when the transistor operates in the saturation region, so that a flat slope of voltage-current characteristics can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Note that a transistor can be formed using a variety of substrates, without limitation to a certain type. As the substrate, a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a single crystal substrate or a silicon substrate), an SOI substrate, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a plastic substrate, a metal substrate, a stainless steel substrate, a substrate including stainless steel foil, a tungsten substrate, a substrate including tungsten foil, a flexible substrate, an attachment film, paper including a fibrous material, a base material film, or the like can be used, for example. As a glass substrate, a barium borosilicate glass substrate, an aluminoborosilicate glass substrate, a soda-lime glass substrate, or the like can be used, for example. For a flexible substrate, a flexible synthetic resin such as plastics typified by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), or polyether sulfone (PES), or acrylic can be used, for example. For an attachment film, polypropylene, polyester, vinyl, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinyl chloride, or the like can be used, for example. For a base material film, polyester, polyamide, polyimide, an inorganic vapor deposition film, paper, or the like can be used, for example. In particular, by forming transistors with the use of a semiconductor substrate, a single crystal substrate, an SOI substrate, or the like, transistors with fewer variations in characteristics, sizes, shapes, or the like, with high current supply capability, and with small sizes can be formed. By forming a circuit with the use of such a transistor, power consumption of the circuit can be reduced or the circuit can be highly integrated.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that the transistor may be formed using one substrate, and then, the transistor may be transferred to another substrate. In addition to the above substrates over which the transistor can be formed, a paper substrate, a cellophane substrate, a stone substrate, a wood substrate, a cloth substrate (including a natural fiber (e.g., silk, cotton, or hemp), a synthetic fiber (e.g., nylon, polyurethane, or polyester), a regenerated fiber (e.g., acetate, cupra, rayon, or regenerated polyester), or the like), a leather substrate, a rubber substrate, or the like can be used as a substrate to which the transistor is transferred. By using such a substrate, a transistor with excellent properties or a transistor with low power consumption can be formed, a device with high durability and high heat resistance can be provided, or reduction in weight or thickness can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Note that all the circuits that are necessary to realize a predetermined function can be formed using the same substrate (e.g., a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, a single crystal substrate, or an SOI substrate). Thus, cost can be reduced by reduction in the number of components or reliability can be improved by reduction in the number of connections to circuit components.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Note that it is possible not to form all the circuits that are necessary to realize the predetermined function over the same substrate. That is, some of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function can be formed using one substrate and some of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function can be formed using another substrate. For example, some of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function can be formed using a glass substrate and some of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function can be formed using a single crystal substrate (or an SOI substrate). The single crystal substrate over which some of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function (such a substrate is also referred to as an IC chip) can be connected to the glass substrate by COG (chip on glass), and the IC chip can be provided over the glass substrate. Alternatively, the IC chip can be connected to the glass substrate by TAB (tape automated bonding), COF (chip on film), SMT (surface mount technology), a printed circuit board, or the like. When some of the circuits are formed using the same substrate as a pixel portion in this manner, cost can be reduced by reduction in the number of components or reliability can be improved by reduction in the number of connections to circuit components. In particular, a circuit with high driving voltage, a circuit with high driving frequency, or the like consumes a large amount of power in many cases. Thus, such a circuit is formed using a substrate which is different from the substrate over which the pixel portion is formed (e.g., a single crystal substrate), and an IC chip is formed. With the IC chip, the increase in power consumption can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Note that one pixel corresponds to the minimum unit of an image. Accordingly, in the case of a full color display device having color elements of R (red), G (green), and B (blue), one pixel includes a dot of the color element of R, a dot of the color element of G, and a dot of the color element of B. Note that the color elements are not limited to three colors, and color elements of more than three colors may be used or a color other than RGB may be used. For example, RGBW (W corresponds to white) can be used by addition of white. Alternatively, one or more colors of yellow, cyan, magenta, emerald green, vermilion, and the like may be added to RGB, for example. Alternatively, a color which is similar to at least one of R, G, and B may be added to RGB, for example. For example, R, G, B<b>1</b>, and B<b>2</b> may be used. Although both B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are blue, they have slightly different wavelengths. In a similar manner, R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, G, and B may be used. By using such color elements. display which is closer to the real object can be performed or power consumption can be reduced. Note that one pixel may include a plurality of dots of color elements of the same color. In this case, the plurality of color elements may have different sizes of regions which contribute to display. Alternatively, by separately controlling the plurality of dots of color elements of the same color, gradation may be expressed. This method is referred to as an area-ratio gray scale method. Alternatively, by using the plurality of dots of color elements of the same color, signals supplied to each of the plurality of dots may be slightly varied so that the viewing angle is widened. That is, potentials of pixel electrodes included in the plurality of color elements of the same color may be different from each other. Accordingly, voltage applied to liquid crystal molecules are varied depending on the pixel electrodes. Therefore, the viewing angle can be widened.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note that pixels are provided (arranged) in matrix in some cases. Here, description that pixels are provided (arranged) in matrix includes the case where the pixels are arranged in a straight line and the case where the pixels are arranged in a jagged line, in a longitudinal direction or a lateral direction. Thus, for example, in the case of performing full color display with three color elements (e.g., RGB), the following cases are included: the case where the pixels are arranged in stripes, the case where dots of the three color elements are arranged in a delta pattern, and the case where dots of the three color elements are provided in Bayer arrangement. Note that the size of display regions may be different between dots of color elements. Thus, power consumption can be reduced or the life of a display element can be prolonged.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Note that an active matrix method in which an active element is included in a pixel or a passive matrix method in which an active element is not included in a pixel can be used.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an active matrix method, as an active element (a non-linear element), not only a transistor but also a variety of active elements (non-linear elements) can be used. For example, an MIM (metal insulator metal), a TFD (thin film diode), or the like can also be used. Since such an element has a small number of manufacturing steps, manufacturing cost can be reduced or yield can be improved. Alternatively, since the size of the element is small, the aperture ratio can be improved, so that power consumption can be reduced or higher luminance can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As a method other than the active matrix method, a passive matrix method in which an active element (a non-linear element) is not used can be used. Since an active element (a non-linear element) is not used, the number of manufacturing steps is small, so that manufacturing cost can be reduced or yield can be improved. Alternatively, since an active element (a non-linear element) is not used, the aperture ratio can be improved, so that power consumption can be reduced or higher luminance can be achieved, for example.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Note that a transistor is an element having at least three terminals: a gate, a drain, and a source. The transistor has a channel region between a drain region and a source region, and current can flow through the drain region, the channel region, and the source region. Here, since the source and the drain of the transistor change depending on the structure, the operating condition, and the like of the transistor, it is difficult to define which is a source or a drain. Thus, a region which serves as a source or a region which serves as a drain is not referred to as a source or a drain in some cases. In that case, one of the source and the drain might be referred to as a first terminal, a first electrode, or a first region, and the other of the source and the drain might be referred to as a second terminal, a second electrode, or a second region, for example.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Note that a transistor may be an element having at least three terminals: a base, an emitter, and a collector. Also in this case, one of the emitter and the collector might be referred to as a first terminal, a first electrode, or a first region, and the other of the emitter and the collector might be referred to as a second terminal, a second electrode, or a second region, for example. Note that in the case where a bipolar transistor is used as the transistor, the term &#x201c;gate&#x201d; can be replaced with the term &#x201c;base&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Note that a semiconductor device corresponds to a device having a circuit including a semiconductor element (e.g., a transistor, a diode, or a thyristor). The semiconductor device may correspond to also all devices that can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics and a device having a semiconductor material.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Note that a display device corresponds to a device having a display element. The display device may include a plurality of pixels each having a display element. Note that that the display device may include a peripheral driver circuit for driving the plurality of pixels. The peripheral driver circuit for driving the plurality of pixels may be formed using the same substrate as the plurality of pixels. The display device may include a peripheral driver circuit provided over a substrate by wire bonding or bump bonding, namely, an IC chip connected by chip on glass (COG) or an IC chip connected by TAB or the like. The display device may include a flexible printed circuit (FPC) to which an IC chip, a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a transistor, or the like is attached. Note that the display device may include a printed wiring board (PWB) which is connected through a flexible printed circuit (FPC) and to which an IC chip, a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a transistor, or the like is attached. The display device may include an optical sheet such as a polarizing plate or a retardation plate. The display device may include a lighting device, a housing. an audio input and output device, an optical sensor, or the like.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Note that a lighting device may include a backlight unit, a light guide plate, a prism sheet, a diffusion sheet, a reflective sheet, a light source (e.g., an LED or a cold cathode fluorescent lamp), a cooling device (e.g., a water cooling device or an air cooling device), or the like.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that a light-emitting device corresponds to a device having a light-emitting element or the like. In the case where a light-emitting device includes a light-emitting element as a display element, the light-emitting device is one of specific examples of a display device.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Note that a reflective device corresponds to a device having a light-reflective element, a light diffraction element. light-reflective electrode, or the like.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Note that a liquid crystal display device corresponds to a display device including a liquid crystal element. Liquid crystal display devices include a direct-view liquid crystal display, a projection liquid crystal display, a transmissive liquid crystal display, a reflective liquid crystal display, a transflective liquid crystal display, and the like.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that a driving device corresponds to a device having a semiconductor element, an electric circuit, or an electronic circuit. For example. a transistor which controls input of signals from a source signal line to pixels (also referred to as a selection transistor, a switching transistor, or the like), a transistor which supplies voltage or current to a pixel electrode, a transistor which supplies voltage or current to a light-emitting element, and the like are examples of the driving device. A circuit which supplies signals to a gate signal line (also referred to as a gate driver, a gate line driver circuit, or the like), a circuit which supplies signals to a source signal line (also referred to as a source driver, a source line driver circuit, or the like), and the like are also examples of the driving device.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Note that a display device, a semiconductor device, a lighting device, a cooling device, a light-emitting device, a reflective device, a driving device, and the like overlap with each other in some cases. For example, a display device includes a semiconductor device and a light-emitting device in some cases. Alternatively, a semiconductor device includes a display device and a driving device in some cases.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Note that when it is explicitly described that &#x201c;A and B are connected&#x201d;, the case where A and B are electrically connected. the case where A and B are functionally connected, and the case where A and B are directly connected are included therein. Here, each of A and B is an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a wiring, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, or a layer). Accordingly, another element may be interposed between elements having a connection relation illustrated in drawings and texts, without limitation to a predetermined connection relation, for example, the connection relation illustrated in the drawings and the texts.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, in the case where A and B are electrically connected, one or more elements which enable electrical connection between A and B (e.g., a switch, a transistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a resistor, and/or a diode) can be connected between A and B.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, in the case where A and B are functionally connected, one or more circuits which enable functional connection between A and B (e.g., a logic circuit such as an inverter, a NAND circuit, or a NOR circuit; a signal converter circuit such as a DA converter circuit, an AD converter circuit, or a gamma correction circuit; a potential level converter circuit such as a power supply circuit (e.g., a dc-dc converter, a step-up dc-dc converter, or a step-down dc-dc converter) or a level shifter circuit for changing a potential level of a signal; a voltage source; a current source; a switching circuit; an amplifier circuit such as a circuit which can increase signal amplitude, the amount of current, or the like, an operational amplifier, a differential amplifier circuit, a source follower circuit, or a buffer circuit; a signal generation circuit; a memory circuit; and/or a control circuit) can be connected between A and B. Note that for example, in the case where a signal output from A is transmitted to B even when another circuit is interposed between A and B, A and B are functionally connected.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Note that when it is explicitly described that &#x201c;A and B are electrically connected&#x201d;, the case where A and B are electrically connected (i.e., the case where A and B are connected with another element or another circuit interposed therebetween), the case where A and B are functionally connected (i.e., the case where A and B are functionally connected with another circuit interposed therebetween), and the case where A and B are directly connected (i.e., the case where A and B are connected without another element or another circuit interposed therebetween) are included therein. That is, when it is explicitly described that &#x201c;A and B are electrically connected&#x201d;, the description is the same as the case where it is explicitly only described that &#x201c;A and B are connected&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Note that when it is explicitly described that &#x201c;B is formed on A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B is formed over A&#x201d;, it does not necessarily mean that B is formed in direct contact with A. The description includes the case where A and B are not in direct contact with each other, i.e., the case where another object is interposed between A and B. Here, each of A and B is an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a wiring, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, or a layer).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, for example, when it is explicitly described that &#x201c;a layer B is formed on (or over) a layer A&#x201d;, it includes both the case where the layer B is formed in direct contact with the layer A, and the case where another layer (e.g., a layer C or a layer D) is formed in direct contact with the layer A and the layer B is formed in direct contact with the layer C or the layer D.

Thus, for example, when it is described that &#x201c;a layer B is formed above a layer A&#x201d;, it includes both the case where the layer B is formed in direct contact with the layer A, and the case where another layer (e.g., a layer C or a layer D) is formed in direct contact with the layer A and the layer B is formed in direct contact with the layer C or the layer D.

However, one embodiment of the present invention should not be construed as being limited by the technical terms.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Note that terms which are not defined (including terms used for science and technology, such as technical terms or academic parlance) can be used as terms which have meaning equal to general meaning that an ordinary person skilled in the art understands. It is preferable that terms defined by dictionaries or the like be construed as consistent meaning with the background of related art.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Note that terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d;, and the like are used for distinguishing various elements, members, regions, layers, and areas from others. Therefore, the terms such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d;, and the like do not limit the number of the elements, members, regions, layers, areas, or the like.

Note that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to this, and such terms for describing spatial arrangement can indicate not only the direction illustrated in a diagram but also another direction. For example, when it is explicitly described that &#x201c;B is over A&#x201d;, it does not necessarily mean that B is placed over A, and can include the case where B is placed under A because a device in a diagram can be inverted or rotated by 180&#xb0;.

Note that the embodiments can be implemented in various different ways and it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details of the embodiments can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the following description of the embodiments. Note that in structures described below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by common reference numerals in different drawings, and description thereof is not repeated.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Note that a content (or may be part of the content) described in one embodiment may be applied to, combined with, or replaced by a different content (or may be part of the different content) described in the embodiment and/or a content (or may be part of the content) described in one or a plurality of different embodiments.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Note that in each embodiment, a content described in the embodiment is a content described with reference to a variety of diagrams or a content described with a text described in this specification.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Note that by combining a diagram (or may be part of the diagram) illustrated in one embodiment with another part of the diagram, a different diagram (or may be part of the different diagram) illustrated in the embodiment, and/or a diagram (or may be part of the diagram) illustrated in one or a plurality of different embodiments, much more diagrams can be formed.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Note that in a diagram or a text described in one embodiment, part of the diagram or the text is taken out, and one embodiment of the invention can be constituted. Thus, in the case where a diagram or a text related to a certain portion is described, the context taken out from part of the diagram or the text is also disclosed as one embodiment of the invention, and one embodiment of the invention can be constituted. Therefore, for example, in a diagram (e.g., a cross-sectional view, a plan view, a circuit diagram, a block diagram, a flow chart, a process diagram, a perspective view, a cubic diagram, a layout diagram, a timing chart, a structure diagram, a schematic view, a graph, a list, a ray diagram, a vector diagram, a phase diagram, a waveform chart, a photograph, or a chemical formula) or a text in which one or more active elements (e.g., transistors or diodes), wirings, passive elements (e.g., capacitors or resistors), conductive layers, insulating layers, semiconductor layers, organic materials, inorganic materials, components, substrates, modules, devices, solids, liquids, gases, operating methods, manufacturing methods, or the like are described, part of the diagram or the text is taken out, and one embodiment of the invention can be constituted. For example, M pieces of circuit elements (e.g., transistors or capacitors) (M is an integer, where M&#x3c;N) are taken out from a circuit diagram in which N pieces of circuit elements (e.g., transistors or capacitors) (N is an integer) are provided, and one embodiment of the invention can be constituted. As another example, M pieces of layers (M is an integer, where M&#x3c;N) are taken out from a cross-sectional view in which N pieces of layers (N is an integer) are provided, and one embodiment of the invention can be constituted. As another example, M pieces of elements (M is an integer, where M&#x3c;N) are taken out from a flow chart in which N pieces of elements (N is an integer) are provided, and one embodiment of the invention can be constituted.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Super-resolution processing is processing for generating high-resolution images from low-resolution images. Alternatively, super-resolution processing is processing for restoring lost data in photographing, signal transmitting, or the like. Therefore, by performing super-resolution processing on averaged images whose detailed parts are crushed due to low resolution, images whose detailed parts can be accurately recognized can be generated. Thus, in the case of displaying such high-resolution images, high-quality images can be displayed. For example, in the case of an image of a park where a great number of small stones are disposed or a tree having a great number of small leaves, by performing super-resolution processing, an image of each small stone or each small leaf can be accurately recognized. In a similar manner, by performing super-resolution processing, detailed parts of a character which cannot be read due to blur can be recognized. Thus, the character can be accurately read. That is, the character can be read as if a person viewing the character recovered his/her eyesight. For example, in super-resolution processing, an image having a resolution (the number of pixels) of 1920&#xd7;1080 is generated from an image having a resolution (the number of pixels) of 1440&#xd7;1080 by restoration of image data. That is, it can be said that a super-resolution processing technology is a technology by which the amount of image data is increased from the amount of image data of an original image and resolution conversion is performed. Alternatively, it can be said that a super-resolution processing technology is a technology by which the resolution of an image in a format is not changed but the substantial resolution of the image is increased. Alternatively, it can be said that a super-resolution processing technology is a technology by which a frequency component which is higher than Nyquist frequency determined by standard frequency of an input image is restored in data contained in an image.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In display devices such as television sets, display of images which are perceived as clear images by a person viewing the images is emphasized more than display of original images precisely in some cases. For example, in the case where three-dimensional real world is photographed with a two-dimensional imaging device, depth data is lost. Therefore, in the case where the photographed images are displayed precisely, it is difficult to express stereoscopic effects and reality. Thus, a variety of image processings are performed on the original images. An example of such image processing is edge enhancement processing. By displaying an edge portion of an object emphatically, the object can be displayed clearly and stereoscopic effects and reality can be expressed.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Thus, by performing both edge enhancement processing and super-resolution processing, a realistic image whose detailed parts can be recognized can be displayed. If super-resolution processing is not performed but edge enhancement processing is performed, an image is displayed in a blurred state, though an edge of the image can be seen clearly. On the other hand, if edge enhancement processing is not performed but super-resolution processing is performed, an edge of an image is blurred and the image has little reality, though the image whose detailed parts can be recognized can be displayed. Accordingly, in order to display a realistic image whose detailed parts can be recognized, it is preferable to perform both edge enhancement processing and super-resolution processing. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Note that as for image processing such as edge enhancement processing, one example of this embodiment is not limited to the above example. Different image processing can be performed. As different image processing, for example, smoothing, distortion correction, error processing, flaw correction, color correction, gamma correction, inverse gamma correction, or the like can be performed instead of or in addition to the edge enhancement processing. For example, by color correction, an image with 100% or less NTSC ratio can be converted into an image with 100% or more NTSC ratio.

After that, super-resolution processing is performed on the region on which super-resolution processing should be performed and edge enhancement processing is performed on the region on which edge enhancement processing should be performed. Finally, processing results of the both processings are gathered. That is, the super-resolution processing and the edge enhancement processing are concurrently performed on one image, though the processings are performed on different regions. In this case, on an edge portion, the super-resolution processing is not performed but the edge enhancement processing is performed. In a similar manner, the edge enhancement processing is not performed on a portion on which the super-resolution processing is performed.

However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. For example, before the super-resolution processing is performed, resolution (the number of pixels) has already been high by enlargement processing or the like. That is, resolution (the number of pixels) of the image in a format is made high. In that case, since the resolution has already been high, the resolution itself is not changed before and after the super-resolution processing. That is, the resolution (the number of pixels) of the image in the format is not changed. However, in enlargement processing before the super-resolution processing, missing image data is not restored. That is, the image is just enlarged and display itself does not have high quality. The resolution (the number of pixels) of the image in the format is just made high and substantial resolution is not made high. For example, in the case of an image of a park where a great number of small stones are disposed or a tree having a great number of small leaves, an image of each small stone or each small leaf is not accurately displayed by enlargement processing but is just enlarged in a blurred state. Thus, by performing the super-resolution processing, it is possible to restore missing image data and to generate a high-quality image whose detailed parts can be recognized, though the resolution (the number of pixels) of an image is not changed. That is, it is possible not to change the resolution of the image in the format but to make the substantial resolution high.

In this case, in the case where the image having a resolution of 1920&#xd7;1080 is generated from the image having a resolution of 1440&#xd7;1080 by the enlargement processing, there is no restored data.

For example, it is possible to generate an image having a resolution of 1440&#xd7;1080 from an image having a resolution of 800&#xd7;600 by enlargement processing and to generate an image having a resolution of 1920&#xd7;1080 from the image having a resolution of 1440&#xd7;1080 by super-resolution processing.

Bi-linear interpolation is a method by which four surrounding pixels are extracted and calculated and insufficient images are interpolated in enlargement. In bi-cubic convolution, 16 pixel values (4&#xd7;4 pixel values) in standards of coordinate after conversion are extracted from a coordinate before the conversion. Then, weighted-average calculation is performed by weighting of the extracted 16 pixel values so that the pixel values after the conversion are determined.

By performing super-resolution processing, a high-resolution image can be displayed.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">First, a moving region is detected and speed data of the region is extracted. That is, with respect to an image at given time, an optical flow, which is a vector illustrating the flow of each pixel, is calculated from two images before and after the image. Then, from the extracted speed data, the amount of positional deviation per image in the region is detected with accuracy of less than the size of one pixel. That is, from the calculated optical flow, the amount of positional deviation between images is calculated. Then, in accordance with the amount of detected positional deviation, the level of luminance between pixels is interpolated from a plurality of images in an image column. With such processing, a high-resolution image having resolution which is higher than physical resolution can be generated. Thus, it can be said that the super-resolution processing technology is a technology by which data for restoring a high-resolution image is extracted and restored from a low-resolution image in accordance with motion vector data or the like.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In a similar super-resolution processing technology, for example, first, consecutive frames having close correlation are selected from images. After that, the motion vector of the images are detected with fineness which is close to the size of one pixel. Then, the motion of each pixel is tracked, and a missing high-resolution pixel is estimated from data related to a change in the tracked pixel between respective frames. In this case, since a camera slightly swings, crushing of a photographed low-resolution portion is varied between the frames, though the same portion is photographed. Thus, with this data, the missing pixel can be compensated and high resolution can be realized. That is, it can be said that this processing method is a super-resolution technology by which search is performed sufficiently in a time direction. In the case of this super-resolution technology, motion vectors can be recognized precisely. Thus, a missing pixel between frames, which cannot be acquired in photographing due to the resolution of a camera, can also be restored.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Alternatively, in different super-resolution processing, the similarity of a plurality of frames is found out. After that, the frames having similarity are aligned, and a time change in each pixel is recognized. Then, a method by which a missing high-resolution pixel is estimated and generated can be used.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Alternatively, in different super-resolution processing, first, data related to a consecutive plurality of images is analyzed. Then, a high-frequency component is restored by correction of common portions of photographic objects. Thus, a high-resolution image can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Alternatively, as different super-resolution processing, a reconstruction super-resolution processing method can be used. In the reconstruction super-resolution processing method, first, high-resolution images (initial high-resolution images) are assumed from original low-resolution images. Then, in accordance with a point spread function (PSF) obtained from the model of a camera, the pixel values of all the pixels of the low-resolution images are estimated from the assumed high-resolution images. In other words, the assumed high-resolution images are down-converted by a unique function (an imaging model function) so that low-resolution images having the same resolution as the original low-resolution images are generated. Then, a difference between the estimated value and an observed pixel value (an observed value) is calculated. After that, with respect to the images before subjected to down conversion, high-resolution images in which the above difference is smaller are searched. Note that this search processing can be repeated until convergence so that accuracy is made high, or can be performed only once. Thus, high-resolution images can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Note that as the imaging model function, for example, an imaging element model where processing is performed two-dimensionally (lengthwise and widthwise) by using a one-dimensional linear filter can be used.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the case of this reconstruction super-resolution processing method, high-resolution images are reconstructed by iterative calculation which needs initial high-resolution images. As a calculation method in that case, an ML (maximum-likelihood) method, a MAP (maximum a posterior) method, a POCS (projection on to convex sets) method, or the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the ML method, a square error between an estimated pixel value of an assumed high-resolution image and a pixel value which is actually observed is used as an evaluation function. In the ML method, a high-resolution image in which the evaluation function is minimized is used as an estimated image.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The MAP method is a method by which a high-resolution image in which an evaluation function where the probability information of a high-resolution image is added to a square error is minimized is estimated. In other words, the MAP method is a super-resolution processing method by which a high-resolution image is estimated as an optimization problem for maximizing posterior probability by utilizing foreseeing data related to a high-resolution image.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The POCS method is a method by which a simultaneous equation of pixel values of a high-resolution image and a low-resolution image is formed and sequentially solved.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Note that one frame is formed by merging a plurality of frames of an image. Thus, the image is made to have higher resolution by the increase in the number of pixels. In this case, processing for making resolution higher can be performed such that a return component is canceled.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Alternatively, as a super-resolution processing method, an iteration method, a frequency-domain method, a statistical method, or the like can be used. The iteration method mainly includes three steps: a first step of initial estimation, a second step of imaging, and a third step of reconstructing.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Note that super-resolution processing can be performed on the whole screen. However, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. The super-resolution processing can be performed depending on the content of an image. For example, the super-resolution processing is not performed on an edge portion or a flat portion of an image but the super-resolution processing can be performed on a textual portion of the image. In that case, real-time spectrum analysis is performed on the image. In addition, the super-resolution processing can be performed on only a high-frequency region. By controlling whether the super-resolution processing is performed or not depending on an image, the image can be prevented from deteriorating.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Note that the flat portion is a portion where regions having specific frequency or regions having specific luminance are highly distributed. Thus, a sky whose color distribution is comparatively gradual, a dim background, or the like corresponds to the flat portion. Therefore, it can be said that the flat portion is a region whose color is mainly expressed gradationally in an image.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Note that the textual portion is a high-frequency portion of an image. Since this region has high frequency, it is highly possible that a more detailed portion exist. Therefore, by performing the super-resolution processing on the textural portion, it can be said that the increase in resolution is highly effective.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Note that in the case of performing super-resolution processing, resolution of a variety of regions of an image is recognized and super-resolution processing can be performed on each region at different intensity.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Note that if the resolution of an original image is sufficiently high, super-resolution processing can be omitted. After determining whether the resolution of the original image is high, whether super-resolution processing is performed can be controlled depending on the result.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Although a variety of super-resolution processing technologies have been described above, the super-resolution processing technology in this specification is not limited to them.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Note that an image can be displayed by performing a variety of processings before and after super-resolution processing or before and after edge enhancement processing. Therefore, the content described in any of the other embodiments can be applied to, combined with, or replaced with this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In hold-type displays such as liquid crystal display devices, in the case where fast-moving images are displayed, motion blur occurs and afterimages are seen in some eases. For example, in the case where a character is displayed in a ticker and is moved up and down or right and left, the character is blurred and cannot be accurately recognized in some cases.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Therefore, by performing frame interpolation processing, frame frequency can be improved and the resolution of moving images can be improved. The frame interpolation processing is processing by which frame data is interpolated when display is performed at higher frame frequency in order to reduce afterimages or the like. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, a circle is displayed on the left in an image of a first frame, and the circle is moved from left to right in an image of a second frame and is displayed on the right. In this case, data where a circle is displayed in the center is generated. Processing by which data is generated in this manner is the frame interpolation processing. In addition, by the frame interpolation processing, frame frequency in display can be made high by the number of interpolated frames. By performing display with frame frequency made high by frame interpolation processing in this manner, a smooth image where a circle is moved from left to right can be displayed and afterimages can be reduced. Therefore, since moving images can be displayed without blur, the resolution of the moving images can be improved.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Driving by which frame interpolation is performed and frame frequency is made high to a corresponding extent in this manner is referred to as frame rate doubling. For example, when frame frequency is double, such driving is referred to as double-frame rate driving. When frame frequency is quadruple, such driving is referred to as quadruple-frame rate driving. In the case of the double-frame rate driving, images of frames whose number is the same as the number of original frames are generated by frame interpolation processing. Accordingly, the total amount of data is double, so that images can be displayed at double frame frequency. In a similar manner, in the case of the quadruple-frame rate driving, images of frames whose number is three times as large as the number of original frames are generated by frame interpolation processing. Accordingly, the total amount of data is quadruple, so that images can be displayed at quadruple frame frequency. By performing such frame rate doubling, moving-image characteristics can be improved and afterimages can be reduced. As a display device to which frame rate doubling is applied, a hold-type display device is preferable. For example, the frame rate doubling is preferably applied to a liquid crystal display, an organic EL display, or the like. Since afterimages are easily visible in hold-type display devices, afterimages can be reduced by frame rate doubling.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Thus, by performing both frame interpolation processing and super-resolution processing, the resolution of still images and the resolution of moving images can be improved. If neither frame interpolation processing nor frame rate doubling is performed but only super-resolution processing is performed, images are blurred due to afterimages or the like, though the resolution of the images is made high by the super-resolution processing. Thus, the higher resolution cannot be easily perceived. That is, an advantageous effect of the super-resolution processing is reduced. Alternatively, if super-resolution processing is not performed but only frame interpolation processing and frame rate doubling are performed, the resolution of images to be displayed itself is low, though the moving images can be accurately perceived. Therefore, high-quality images cannot be displayed. Accordingly, regardless of still images or moving images, it is preferable to perform both frame interpolation processing and super-resolution processing in order to display high-resolution images accurately.

As examples of a variety of different processings, there are IP conversion processing, enlargement processing, and the like. Further, different processing is possible.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Note that by performing the frame interpolation processing after the edge enhancement processing is performed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the number of edge enhancement processings can be reduced. The number of frames is small before the frame interpolation processing is performed. Therefore, before the frame interpolation processing is performed, the number of frames on which the edge enhancement processing is performed is also small. Thus, the number of processings can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Note that by performing the frame interpolation processing before the edge enhancement processing is performed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, data for frame interpolation can be accurately generated. Since the edge enhancement processing can be performed on a more accurate high-resolution image, the edge of an object in the image can be more accurately acquired. Thus, a clearer image can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">By performing frame interpolation processing after edge enhancement processing is performed in this manner, the frame interpolation processing can be performed more accurately. Through the edge enhancement processing, part of an image is changed. Therefore, by performing the frame interpolation processing using data before change, the processing can be performed accurately.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Next, it is assumed that by performing super-resolution processing on an image having lateral resolution (the number of pixels) of A and longitudinal resolution (the number of pixels) of B, the image is changed into an image having lateral resolution (the number of pixels) of C and longitudinal resolution (the number of pixels) of D. Alternatively, it is assumed that by performing enlargement processing and the super-resolution processing on an image having the lateral resolution (the number of pixels) of A and the longitudinal resolution (the number of pixels) of B, the image is changed into an image having the lateral resolution (the number of pixels) of C and the longitudinal resolution (the number of pixels) of D. In this case, it can be said that a multiplying factor when the resolution is made high by the super-resolution processing is C/A, where C is divided by A, or D/B, where D is divided by B. In addition, it is assumed that in the case of performing frame rate doubling, frame frequency is N times.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Note that here, each of A, B, C, and D, which represents resolution, is preferably resolution of an image in a format or substantial resolution. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In this case, N&#x3e;(C/A) or N&#x3e;(D/B) is preferable. Alternatively, N&#x2265;(C/A) and N&#x2265;(D/B) are preferable. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. Note that here, each of A, B, C, D, and N is a natural number.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In the case of performing frame interpolation processing for frame rate doubling, even when the amount of frame data to be interpolated is made large, data can be generated without problems. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates double-frame rate driving; however, by adjustment of the position of a circle as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, triple-frame rate driving can be easily realized. That is, in the frame interpolation processing for the frame rate doubling, even when the amount of frame data to be interpolated is made large, big problems do not occur in an image. Alternatively, by making the amount of frame data to be interpolated large, moving-image characteristics can be further improved and afterimages can be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">On the other hand, the super-resolution processing is processing by which resolution data which is lost in photographing or signal transmitting is restored. Therefore, if a large amount of data is lost, it is difficult to restore the data adequately. Accordingly, when the value of (C/A) or (D/B) is too large, problems occur in an image itself and the image is distorted.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">From the above, when both frame interpolation processing and super-resolution processing are performed, N&#x3e;(C/A) or N&#x3e;(D/B) is preferable. Alternatively, N&#x2265;(C/A) and N&#x2265;(D/B) are preferable. Thus, when both the frame interpolation processing and the super-resolution processing are performed and the above relationship is satisfied, a high-quality image in which detailed parts are clear and afterimage feeling is eliminated can be displayed. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Note that in the case of performing frame interpolation processing, in a moving region of a screen, data is additionally generated for the frame interpolation processing in many cases. In addition, in a static region of the screen, data is not additionally generated in many cases. That is, in the screen, there are a region where data is additionally generated by frame interpolation processing and a region where data is not additionally generated. For example, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, in a region <b>301</b> and a region <b>303</b>, data of the first frame before subjected to interpolation and data of the second frame before subjected to the interpolation do not change, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. Therefore, there is no change even in frame data to be interpolated and data is not additionally generated. Data is generated by utilizing the data of the first frame before subjected to the interpolation or the data of the second frame before subjected to the interpolation. On the other hand, in a region <b>302</b>, data of the first frame before subjected to the interpolation and data of the second frame before subjected to the interpolation change, so that there are a region where the circle is erased and a region where the circle is generated. Thus, data is additionally generated.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the case of performing frame interpolation processing in this manner, in a screen, there are a region where data is additionally generated and a region where data is not additionally generated. In addition, such regions change over time. For example, as an example of a region where data is generated, a region can be given in which a character is displayed in a ticker or the like and is moved up and down or right and left. In the case of a character, a symbol, or the like, when afterimages are generated and the character, the symbol, or the like is not easily seen, it is impossible to determine the type of the character, the symbol, or the like, which is a big problem.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Generation of additional data only in parts of regions in a screen when frame interpolation processing is performed in this manner has advantages such as improvement in processing speed, reduction in power consumption, and improvement in processing accuracy.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Further, super-resolution processing can be performed not on all regions in a screen but on parts of the regions in the screen. For example, in the case where a streaming broadcast is displayed on part of a screen, a low-resolution image is displayed on only in that region while being enlarged in some cases. In such a case, by performing super-resolution processing on only the region where the streaming broadcast is displayed, image quality can be improved.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">In the case of performing super-resolution processing only on parts of regions in a screen in this manner, there is an advantage such as improvement in processing speed, reduction in power consumption, improvement in processing accuracy, or reduction in image defects.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Therefore, in a screen, there are a first region where data is additionally generated for frame interpolation processing and a second region where super-resolution processing is performed. Further, a third region where data is not additionally generated for frame interpolation processing and super-resolution processing is not performed can be provided. Furthermore, a region where the first region and the second region do not overlap with each other can be provided in the screen. Alternatively, a region where the first region and the second region overlap with each other can be provided in the screen.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Data is additionally generated for frame interpolation processing in a region where data related to a character or a symbol, such as a ticker in many cases. Super-resolution processing is performed on a region with little motion in many cases. Therefore, in the screen, it is preferable that the region be provided in which the first region where data is additionally generated for the frame interpolation processing does not overlap with the second region where the super-resolution processing is performed. The reason for this is as follows. Since the first region where data is additionally generated for the frame interpolation processing is a moving region, data is additionally generated for the frame interpolation processing in order to make afterimages invisible. However, in such a moving region, even if resolution is made high by super-resolution processing, it may be difficult for eyes to recognize the resolution. Therefore, in such a moving region, it can be said that super-resolution processing is not performed in some cases. The second region where the super-resolution processing is performed is a region whose detailed parts are preferably seen clearly. In the case where a static image such as a still image is displayed, it can be said that detailed parts are seen clearly. Since there is a possibility of occurrence of the above condition, a region can be provided in which a first region where both frame interpolation processing and super-resolution processing are performed, the screen can be displayed with advantages of both of the processings, and data is additionally generated for the frame interpolation processing does not overlap with the second region where the super-resolution processing is performed. Accordingly, a more appropriate image can be displayed. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">By performing both frame interpolation processing and super-resolution processing in this manner, images having high image picture resolution and high moving image resolution can be displayed.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Note that in the case where super-resolution processing is performed after frame interpolation processing is performed, frame frequency is made high for the frame interpolation processing. Therefore, processing speed of the super-resolution processing is not sufficiently high in some cases. Thus, a plurality of processing systems for the super-resolution processing can be provided. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> each illustrate the case where two processing systems for the super-resolution processing are provided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates the case where two processing systems for the super-resolution processing are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates the case where two processing systems for the super-resolution processing are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, the number of processing systems can be optimal.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the case where a plurality of processing systems are provided, processings can be divided among the processing systems by a variety of methods. For example, processing for a right half of a screen can be performed by a first super-resolution processing system, and processing for a left half of the screen can be performed by a second super-resolution processing system. Since image data related to an image is usually transferred in each row, processings can be divided between the first super-resolution processing system and the second super-resolution processing system by division of image data for one row into two pieces of data for the right half and left half of the screen. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Alternatively, processing of a certain frame (e.g., an odd-numbered frame or a frame on which frame interpolation processing is not performed) can be performed by the first super-resolution processing system, and processing of a different frame (e.g., an even-numbered frame or a frame generated by frame interpolation processing) can be performed by the second super-resolution processing system. Thus, even when the processing speed of the super-resolution processing is lower than the frame frequency, processing can be completed normally by alternate processings. Alternatively, since the processing speed of one processing system may be low, power consumption can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to the case where super-resolution processing is performed after frame interpolation processing is performed. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, super-resolution processing can be performed while performing frame interpolation processing. First, image data A is supplied from an image source. Then, image processing such as edge enhancement processing is performed. The image data A is not image data generated by the frame interpolation processing. Therefore, the super-resolution processing can be performed immediately. Next, image data B is supplied from the image source. Then, image processing such as edge enhancement processing is performed. After that, frame data is interpolated using the image data A and the image data B which have already been supplied. When the frame interpolation processing is performed using the image data A and the image data B, the super-resolution processing can be performed using the image data A. That is, the image data A is used for both of the frame interpolation processing and the super-resolution processing. Thus, the super-resolution processing and the frame interpolation processing can be performed concurrently. After that, by the frame interpolation processing with the use of the image data A and the image data B, image data C is generated. Then, super-resolution processing is performed on the image data C obtained by the frame interpolation with the use of the image data A and the image data B. By concurrently performing the frame interpolation processing and the super-resolution processing in this manner, the number of memories for storing the image data A can be reduced. When the image data A is stored in one memory, the super-resolution processing and the frame interpolation processing can be performed by reading of the data. Note that as for image data where frame data is generated, it can be said that the super-resolution processing is performed after the frame interpolation processing is performed. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Note that as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, a plurality of processing systems can be provided for super-resolution processing, and the super-resolution processing and frame interpolation processing can be performed concurrently. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of such a case. For example, after edge enhancement processing is performed, super-resolution processing is performed on at least the image data A by using the second super-resolution processing system. Concurrently, the frame interpolation processing is performed using at least the image data A. That is, the frame interpolation processing and the super-resolution processing are concurrently performed using at least the image data A. After that, the super-resolution processing is performed on image data on which frame interpolation is performed using the first super-resolution processing system. By providing a plurality of super-resolution processing systems in this manner, processings can be performed concurrently. Further, the super-resolution processing can be performed quickly on frame data which is not generated by the frame interpolation with the use of the second super-resolution processing system.

Usually, a signal corresponding to a gray level which is to be expressed in each pixel is supplied to each pixel in a screen. However, since the liquid crystal element has low response speed, even if a signal corresponding to a gray level is supplied, display which corresponds to the gray level cannot be performed in one frame period. After several frame periods, display which corresponds to the gray level is eventually performed. Thus, in supplying voltage to the liquid crystal element, not voltage corresponding to an original gray level but voltage having larger amplitude is supplied to the liquid crystal element. Accordingly, the transmittance of the liquid crystal element is drastically changed. After that, voltage corresponding to the original gray level is supplied. Through the above operation, the response speed of the liquid crystal element can be made high. Driving by which voltage having larger amplitude than voltage corresponding to the original gray level is temporarily supplied to the liquid crystal element before the voltage corresponding to the original gray level is supplied is referred to as overdrive.

In a manner similar to the case of performing overdrive processing, local dimming processing of a backlight can be performed after super-resolution processing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>C and <b>9</b>D</figref> illustrate processing flows of such a case. The processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> corresponds to a processing flow where local dimming processing is added to the processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and a processing flow where frame interpolation processing and local dimming processing are added to the processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In a similar manner, the processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref> corresponds to a processing flow where local dimming processing is added to the processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> and a processing flow where frame interpolation processing and local dimming processing are added to the processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Therefore, the content or the drawing described in the edge enhancement processing or the overdrive processing can be applied to the case where local dimming processing of a backlight is performed in a similar manner. In a similar manner, the content or the drawing described in the local dimming processing of a backlight can be applied to the case where different processing is performed.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">Here, the local dimming of a backlight is a technique by which display is performed with the luminance of a backlight changed in each region in a screen. Therefore, depending on an image, the luminance of the backlight is varied in each region in one screen. For example, in the case where there is a region for displaying a low gray level in a screen, the luminance of a backlight in the region is made low. Further, in the case where there is a region for displaying a high gray level in the screen, the luminance of the backlight in the region is made high. Then, the transmittance of each pixel is determined in accordance with the luminance of the backlight so that an accurate image can be displayed. Thus, in the region for displaying a low gray level in the screen, the luminance of the backlight itself is low, so that adverse effects of light leakage can be reduced. Therefore, in the case of displaying a black image in such a region, the image can be displayed as a completely black image. In addition, in the region for displaying a high gray level in the screen, the luminance of the backlight itself is high, so that sufficiently bright display can be performed. Therefore, in the case of displaying a white image in such a region, luminance is made higher than that in the case of displaying a normal white image, and the image can be displayed with higher peak luminance. Accordingly, contrast can be improved and a clear image can be displayed. Further, since the luminance of the backlight itself can be made low by local dimming, power consumption can be reduced. Thus, in order to perform local dimming, there are processing for determining the luminance of a backlight in each region depending on an image to be displayed and processing for determining the transmittance of each pixel in accordance with the luminance of the backlight so that the image to be displayed can be accurately displayed. These processings or one of these processings is referred to as local dimming processing. Therefore, in the local dimming processing, after processing for determining the luminance of a backlight in each region is performed, processing for determining a video signal supplied to each pixel can be performed. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. Thus, for example, a processing flow in the case where the processing for determining the luminance of a backlight in each region and the processing for determining a video signal supplied to each pixel are separately described can be illustrated as in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C</figref>. A processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> corresponds to a processing flow where local dimming processing as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is added to the processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. A processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> corresponds to a processing flow where local dimming processing as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is added to the processing flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">It is preferable that local dimming processing be performed after super-resolution processing is performed in this manner. When the super-resolution processing is performed, due to restoration of data, new data is added. Thus, the gray level of each pixel is different before and after the super-resolution processing in some cases. Alternatively, before and after the super-resolution processing, there is a region where the gray level of a pixel is changed in a screen. Thus, by performing the local dimming after image data is restored by the super-resolution processing, the local dimming processing can be accurately performed. Therefore, contrast can be improved and an accurate image can be displayed. Accordingly, in order to obtain a high-quality image, it is preferable to perform the super-resolution processing before the local dimming processing is performed. Alternatively, in the local dimming processing, it is preferable to perform the super-resolution processing before the processing for determining the luminance of a backlight is performed. Alternatively, in the local dimming processing, it is preferable to perform the super-resolution processing before the processing for determining a video signal supplied to a pixel is performed. Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Further, in the case of performing the local dimming processing, the luminance of the backlight is low. Thus, even when the transmittance of the pixel is slightly changed, the gray level of actual display is not changed so much. On the other hand, in a state where the luminance of the backlight is low, a more detailed gradation can be expressed by the change in the transmittance of the pixel. That is, the number of gray levels to be displayed can be increased. Therefore, by performing both the local dimming processing and the super-resolution processing, a high-resolution image can be displayed with high power of expression, by which detailed parts can be perceived. In particular, gradation can be expressed adequately in a region of a low gray level in the screen, and display where gradation is crushed can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Note that in a region where a gray level is low in a screen, local dimming processing is performed in many cases. In addition, in a region where a gray level is high in the screen, i.e., a region where luminance is high and bright display is performed, local dimming processing is rarely performed because the luminance of a backlight is not easily lowered. That is, in the screen, there are a region where local dimming processing is performed and a region where local dimming processing is not performed. In addition, such regions change over time. In the case of performing local dimming processing only on parts of regions in a screen in this manner, there is an advantage such as improvement in processing speed, reduction in power consumption, or improvement in processing accuracy.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">Further, super-resolution processing can be performed not on all regions in a screen but on parts of the regions in the screen. In the case of performing super-resolution processing only on parts of regions in a screen in this manner, there is an advantage such as improvement in processing speed, reduction in power consumption, improvement in processing accuracy, or reduction in image defects.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">In the case where processing is performed on parts of regions in a screen, in the screen, there are a first region where local dimming processing is performed and the luminance of a backlight is lowered and a second region where super-resolution processing is performed. Further, a third region where neither the local dimming processing nor the super resolution processing is performed can be provided. Furthermore, a region in which the first region where the local dimming processing is performed and the luminance of the backlight is lowered does not overlap with the second region where the super-resolution processing is performed can be provided in the screen. Alternatively, a region where the first region and the second region overlap with each other can be provided in the screen.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In the region in which the first region where the local dimming processing is performed and the luminance of the backlight is lowered overlaps with the second region where the super-resolution processing is performed, contrast is high, an image can be displayed with smooth gradation expression, and detailed parts of the image can be clearly seen. Thus, a realistic image can be displayed.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Note that in the case of performing local dimming processing, a screen is divided into a plurality of regions, and a backlight is provided in each region. When the length (or the width) of the region or the pitch of the region is compared to the length (or the width) or the pitch of a pixel included in a display device in which super-resolution processing is performed on parts of the regions of the screen and which displays a region of a higher-resolution image, the length (or the width) of the region of the backlight or the pitch of the region is preferably longer than the length (or the width) or the pitch of the pixel included in the display device in which the super-resolution processing is performed on parts of the regions of the screen and which displays the region of a higher-resolution image. This is because in the case of performing the local dimming processing, an image is displayed by controlling not only the luminance of the backlight provided in each region but also the transmittance of the pixel. Therefore, even in the case of displaying an image on which super-resolution processing is performed, a high-resolution image can be clearly displayed sufficiently when the pitch of each pixel is short, though the length (or the width) or the pitch of the region of the backlight is long.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Note that it is preferable that the screen be divided into a plurality of regions where the luminance of the backlight is controlled; however, one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. The luminance of the entire screen can be controlled without division of the screen into a plurality of regions.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In a similar manner, it is preferable that local dimming processing be performed after frame interpolation processing is performed. Since the frame interpolation processing is processing for generating new frame data, an image which is changed is generated by the processing. Thus, the gray level of each pixel is changed. Alternatively, before and after the frame interpolation processing, there is a region where the gray level of a pixel is changed in a screen. Therefore, by performing local dimming processing after new frame data is generated by frame interpolation processing, the local dimming processing can be accurately performed. Thus, contrast can be improved and an accurate image can be displayed. Accordingly, in order to obtain a high-quality image, it is preferable to perform the frame interpolation processing before the local dimming processing is performed. Alternatively, in the local dimming processing, it is preferable to perform the frame interpolation processing before processing for determining the luminance of a backlight is performed.

For example, cyan, magenta, yellow, and the like (CMYK) can be used for the point light source.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">In the case where luminance can be controlled in each color in this manner, local dimming can be performed more precisely.

Note that one example of this embodiment is not limited to this. Only the number of light-emitting diodes of a certain color can be increased. For example, the number of green light-emitting diodes can be twice the number of red or blue light-emitting diodes. By changing the number of light-emitting diodes in each color in this manner, chromaticity can be easily adjusted. Further, a difference in the life of light-emitting diodes between the respective colors can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">Note that colors of the light-emitting diodes are not limited to three colors.

As for the point light sources provided in one region, the luminance of the plurality of point light sources of a certain color is preferably controlled so as to be the same luminance at the same time. That is, luminance is preferably controlled in each color in one region. For example, in the case where three red light-emitting diodes are provided in one region, it is preferable that the luminance of the three light-emitting diodes be raised when the luminance is raised and the luminance of the three light-emitting diodes be lowered when the luminance is lowered. However, since characteristics of light-emitting diodes or the like vary, it is difficult to make the light-emitting diode have the same luminance. Therefore, it is preferable that the light-emitting diodes emit light at the same luminance in consideration of variations in characteristics. For example, it is preferable that the light-emitting diodes emit light at the same luminance in consideration of a variation of approximately 30%. By providing a plurality of point light sources in one region in this manner, unevenness in luminance can be suppressed. Alternatively, deterioration of the point light sources can be suppressed.

In this embodiment, the case of using a display device including a display element whose luminance response with respect to signal writing is slow (response time is long) is described. In this embodiment, a liquid crystal element is described as an example of the display element with long response time. In this embodiment, a liquid crystal element is illustrated as an example of the display element with long response time. However, a display element in this embodiment is not limited to this, and a variety of display elements whose luminance response with respect to signal writing is slow can be used.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">In a general liquid crystal display device, luminance response with respect to signal writing is slow, and it sometimes takes more than one frame period to complete the response even when signal voltage is continuously applied to a liquid crystal element. Moving images cannot be displayed precisely by such a display element. Further, in the case of active matrix driving, time for signal writing to one liquid crystal element is only a period (one scan line selection period) obtained by dividing a signal writing cycle (one frame period or one subframe period) by the number of scan lines, and the liquid crystal element cannot respond in such a short time in many cases. Therefore, most of the response of the liquid crystal element is performed in a period during which signal writing is not performed. Here, the dielectric constant of the liquid crystal element is changed in accordance with the transmittance of the liquid crystal element, and the response of the liquid crystal element in a period during which signal writing is not performed means that the dielectric constant of the liquid crystal element is changed in a state where electric charge is not exchanged with the outside of the liquid crystal element (in a constant charge state). In other words, in a formula where charge=(capacitance)&#xb7;(voltage), the capacitance is changed in a state where the charge is constant. Accordingly, voltage applied to the liquid crystal element is changed from voltage in signal writing, in accordance with the response of the liquid crystal element. Therefore, in the case where the liquid crystal element whose luminance response with respect to signal writing is slow is driven by active matrix driving, voltage applied to the liquid crystal element cannot theoretically reach the voltage in signal writing.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">In the display device in this embodiment, a signal level in signal writing is corrected in advance (a correction signal is used) so that a display element can reach desired luminance within a signal writing cycle. Thus, the above problem can be solved. Further, since the response time of the liquid crystal element becomes shorter as the signal level becomes higher, the response time of the liquid crystal element can also be shorter by writing a correction signal. A driving method by which such a correction signal is added is referred to as overdrive. By overdrive in this embodiment, even when a signal writing cycle is shorter than a cycle for an image signal input to the display device (an input image signal cycle T<sub>in</sub>), the signal level is corrected in accordance with the signal writing cycle, so that the display element can reach desired luminance within the signal writing cycle. The case where the signal writing cycle is shorter than the input image signal cycle T<sub>in </sub>is, for example, the ease where one original image is divided into a plurality of subimages and the plurality of subimages are sequentially displayed in one frame period.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">Next, an example of correcting a signal level in signal writing in a display device driven by active matrix driving is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> is a graph schematically illustrating a time change in signal level in signal writing in one display element, with the time as the horizontal axis and the signal level in signal writing as the vertical axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> is a graph schematically illustrating a time change in display level, with the time as the horizontal axis and the display level as the vertical axis. Note that when the display element is a liquid crystal element, the signal level in signal writing can be voltage, and the display level can be the transmittance of the liquid crystal element. In the following description, the vertical axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> is regarded as the voltage, and the vertical axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> is regarded as the transmittance. Note that in the overdrive in this embodiment, the signal level may be other than the voltage (may be a duty ratio or current, for example). Note that in the overdrive in this embodiment, the display level may be other than the transmittance (may be luminance or current, for example). Liquid crystal elements are classified into two modes: a normally black mode in which black is displayed when voltage is 0 (e.g., a VA mode and an IPS mode), and a normally white mode in which white is displayed when voltage is 0 (e.g., a TN mode and an OCB mode). The graph illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> corresponds to both of the modes. The transmittance increases as the value of the vertical axis becomes larger in the normally black mode, and the transmittance increases as the value of the vertical axis becomes smaller in the normally white mode. That is, a liquid crystal mode in this embodiment may be either a normally black mode or a normally white mode. Note that timing of signal writing is represented on the time axis by dotted lines, and a period after signal writing is performed until the next signal writing is performed is referred to as a retention period F<sub>i</sub>. In this embodiment, i is an integer and an index for representing each retention period. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>B</figref>, i is 0 to 2; however, i can be an integer other than 0 to 2 (only the case where i is 0 to 2 is illustrated). Note that in the retention period F<sub>i</sub>, transmittance for realizing luminance corresponding to an image signal is denoted by T<sub>i</sub>, and voltage for providing the transmittance T<sub>i </sub>in a constant state is denoted by V<sub>i</sub>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, a dashed line <b>5101</b> represents a time change in voltage applied to the liquid crystal element in the case where overdrive is not performed, and a solid line <b>5102</b> represents a time change in voltage applied to the liquid crystal element in the case where the overdrive in this embodiment is performed. In a similar manner, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, a dashed line <b>5103</b> represents a time change in transmittance of the liquid crystal element in the case where overdrive is not performed, and a solid line <b>5104</b> represents a time change in transmittance of the liquid crystal element in the case where the overdrive in this embodiment is performed. Note that a difference between the desired transmittance T<sub>i </sub>and the actual transmittance at the end of the retention period F<sub>i </sub>is referred to as an error &#x3b1;<sub>i</sub>.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">It is assumed that, in the graph illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, both the dashed line <b>5101</b> and the solid line <b>5102</b> represent the case where desired voltage V<sub>0 </sub>is applied in a retention period F<sub>0</sub>; and in the graph illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, both the dashed line <b>5103</b> and the solid line <b>5104</b> represent the case where desired transmittance T<sub>0 </sub>is obtained. In the case where overdriving is not performed, desired voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is applied at the beginning of a retention period F<sub>1 </sub>as shown by the dashed line <b>5101</b>. As has been described above, a period for signal writing is much shorter than a retention period, and the liquid crystal element is in a constant charge state in most of the retention period. Accordingly, voltage applied to the liquid crystal element in the retention period F<sub>1 </sub>is changed along with a change in transmittance and is greatly different from the desired voltage V<sub>1 </sub>at the end of the retention period F<sub>1</sub>. In this case, the dashed line <b>5103</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> is greatly different from desired transmittance T<sub>1</sub>. Accordingly, accurate display of an image signal cannot be performed, so that image quality is decreased. On the other hand, in the case where the overdrive in this embodiment is performed, voltage V<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; which is higher than the desired voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is applied to the liquid crystal element at the beginning of the retention period F<sub>1 </sub>as shown by the solid line <b>5102</b>. That is, the voltage V<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; which is corrected from the desired voltage V<sub>1 </sub>is applied to the liquid crystal element at the beginning of the retention period F<sub>1 </sub>so that the voltage applied to the liquid crystal element at the end of the retention period F<sub>1 </sub>is close to the desired voltage V<sub>1 </sub>in anticipation of a gradual change in voltage applied to the liquid crystal element in the retention period F<sub>1</sub>. Thus, the desired voltage V<sub>1 </sub>can be accurately applied to the liquid crystal element. In this case, as shown by the solid line <b>5104</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, the desired transmittance T<sub>1 </sub>can be obtained at the end of the retention period F<sub>1</sub>. In other words, the response of the liquid crystal element within the signal writing cycle can be realized, despite the fact that the liquid crystal element is in a constant charge state in most of the retention period. Then, in a retention period F<sub>2</sub>, the case where desired voltage V<sub>2 </sub>is lower than V<sub>1 </sub>is described. Also in that case, as in the retention period F<sub>1</sub>, voltage V<sub>2</sub>&#x2032; which is corrected from the desired voltage V<sub>2 </sub>may be applied to the liquid crystal element at the beginning of the retention period F<sub>2 </sub>so that the voltage applied to the liquid crystal element at the end of the retention period F<sub>2 </sub>is close to the desired voltage V<sub>2 </sub>in anticipation of a gradual change in voltage applied to the liquid crystal element in the retention period F<sub>2</sub>. Thus, as shown by the solid line <b>5104</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, desired transmittance T<sub>2 </sub>can be obtained at the end of the retention period F<sub>2</sub>. Note that in the case where V<sub>i </sub>is higher than V<sub>i&#x2212;1 </sub>as in the retention period F<sub>1</sub>, the corrected voltage V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032; is preferably corrected so as to be higher than desired voltage V<sub>i</sub>. Further, when V<sub>i </sub>is lower than V<sub>i&#x2212;1 </sub>as in the retention period F<sub>2</sub>, the corrected voltage V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032; is preferably corrected so as to be lower than the desired voltage V<sub>i</sub>. Note that a specific correction value can be derived by measuring response characteristics of the liquid crystal element in advance. As a method of realizing overdrive in a device, a method by which a correction formula is formulated and included in a logic circuit, a method by which a correction value is stored in a memory as a look-up table and is read as necessary, or the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">Note that there are several limitations on realization of the overdrive in this embodiment in a device. For example, voltage correction has to be performed in the range of the rated voltage of a source driver. That is, in the case where desired voltage is originally high and ideal correction voltage exceeds the rated voltage of the source driver, not all the correction can be performed. Problems in such a case are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>C and <b>19</b>D</figref>. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C</figref> is a graph in which a time change in voltage in one liquid crystal element is schematically illustrated as a solid line <b>5105</b> with the time as the horizontal axis and the voltage as the vertical axis. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>D</figref> is a graph in which a time change in transmittance of one liquid crystal element is schematically illustrated as a solid line <b>5106</b> with the time as the horizontal axis and the transmittance as the vertical axis. Note that since other references are similar to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>B</figref>, description thereof is omitted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>C and <b>19</b>D</figref> illustrate a state where sufficient correction cannot be performed because the correction voltage V<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; for realizing the desired transmittance T<sub>1 </sub>in the retention period F<sub>1 </sub>exceeds the rated voltage of the source driver; thus V<sub>1</sub>&#x2032;=V<sub>1 </sub>has to be given. In this case, the transmittance at the end of the retention period F<sub>1 </sub>is deviated from the desired transmittance T<sub>1 </sub>by the error &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>. Note that the error &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>is increased only when the desired voltage is originally high; therefore, a decrease in image quality due to occurrence of the error &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>is in the allowable range in many cases. However, as the error &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>is increased, an error in algorithm for voltage correction is also increased. In other words, in the algorithm for voltage correction, when it is assumed that the desired transmittance is obtained at the end of the retention period, even though the error &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>is increased, voltage correction is performed on the basis that the error &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>is small. Accordingly, the error is included in correction in the following retention period F<sub>2</sub>; thus, an error &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>is also increased. Further, in the case where the error &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>is increased, the following error &#x3b1;<sub>3 </sub>is further increased, for example, and the error is increased in a chain reaction manner, which results in a significant decrease in image quality. In the overdrive in this embodiment, in order to prevent increase of errors in such a chain reaction manner, when the correction voltage V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032; exceeds the rated voltage of the source driver in the retention period F<sub>i</sub>, an error &#x3b1;<sub>i </sub>at the end of the retention period F<sub>i </sub>is estimated, and the correction voltage in a retention period F<sub>i+1 </sub>can be adjusted in consideration of the amount of the error &#x3b1;<sub>i</sub>. Thus, even when the error &#x3b1;<sub>i </sub>is increased, the effect of the error &#x3b1;<sub>i </sub>on the error &#x3b1;<sub>i+1 </sub>can be minimized, so that increase of errors in a chain reaction manner can be prevented. An example where the error &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>is minimized in the overdrive in this embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>E and <b>19</b>F</figref>. In a graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>E</figref>, a solid line <b>5107</b> represents a time change in voltage in the case where the correction voltage V<sub>2</sub>&#x2032; in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C</figref> is further adjusted to be correction voltage V<sub>2</sub>&#x2033;. A graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>F</figref> illustrates a time change in transmittance in the case where voltage is corrected in accordance with the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>E</figref>. The solid line <b>5106</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>D</figref> indicates that excessive correction is caused by the correction voltage V<sub>2</sub>&#x2032;. On the other hand, the solid line <b>5108</b> in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>F</figref> indicates that excessive correction is suppressed by the correction voltage V<sub>2</sub>&#x2033; which is adjusted in consideration of the error &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and the error &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>is minimized. Note that a specific correction value can be derived from measuring response characteristics of the liquid crystal element in advance. As a method of realizing overdrive in a device, a method by which a correction formula is formulated and included in a logic circuit, a method by which a correction value is stored in a memory as a look-up table and read as necessary, or the like can be used. Further, such a method can be added separately from a portion for calculating correction voltage V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032; or can be included in the portion for calculating correction voltage V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032;. Note that the amount of correction of correction voltage V<sub>i</sub>&#x2033; which is adjusted in consideration of an error &#x3b1;<sub>i&#x2212;1 </sub>(a difference with the desired voltage V<sub>i</sub>) is preferably smaller than that of V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032;. That is, |V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032;&#x2033;&#x2212;V<sub>i</sub>|&#x3c;V<sub>i</sub>&#x2032;&#x2212;V<sub>i</sub>| is preferable.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">Note that the error <b>60</b> <sub>i </sub>which is caused because ideal correction voltage exceeds the rated voltage of the source driver is increased as a signal writing cycle becomes shorter. This is because the response time of the liquid crystal element needs to be shorter as the signal writing cycle becomes shorter, so that higher correction voltage is necessary. Further, as a result of an increase in correction voltage needed, the correction voltage exceeds the rated voltage of the source driver more frequently, so that the large error &#x3b1;<sub>i </sub>occurs more frequently. Therefore, it can be said that the overdrive in this embodiment becomes more effective as the signal writing cycle becomes shorter. Specifically, the overdrive in this embodiment is significantly effective in the case of performing the following driving methods: a driving method by which one original image is divided into a plurality of subimages and the plurality of subimages are sequentially displayed in one frame period, a driving method by which motion of an image is detected from a plurality of images and an intermediate image of the plurality of images is generated and inserted between the plurality of images (so-called motion compensation frame rate doubling), and a driving method in which such driving methods are combined, for example.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0289">Note that the rated voltage of the source driver has the lower limit in addition to the upper limit described above. An example of the lower limit is the case where voltage which is lower than the voltage 0 cannot be applied. In this case, since ideal correction voltage cannot be applied as in the case of the upper limit described above, the error &#x3b1;<sub>i </sub>is increased. However, also in that case, the error &#x3b1;<sub>i </sub>at the end of the retention period F<sub>i </sub>is estimated, and the correction voltage in the retention period F<sub>i+1 </sub>can be adjusted in consideration of the amount of the error &#x3b1;<sub>i </sub>in a manner similar to the above method. Note that in the case where voltage which is lower than the voltage 0 (negative voltage) can be applied as the rated voltage of the source driver, the negative voltage may be applied to the liquid crystal element as correction voltage. Thus, the voltage applied to the liquid crystal element at the end of retention period F<sub>i </sub>can be adjusted so as to be close to the desired voltage V<sub>i </sub>in anticipation of a change in potential due to a constant charge state.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">Note that in order to suppress deterioration of the liquid crystal element, so-called inversion driving by which the polarity of voltage applied to the liquid crystal element is periodically inverted can be performed in combination with the overdrive. That is, the overdrive in this embodiment includes the case where the overdrive is performed at the same time as the inversion driving. For example, in the case where the length of the signal writing cycle is half of that of the input image signal cycle T<sub>in</sub>, when the length of a cycle for inverting polarity is the same or substantially the same as that of the input image signal cycle T<sub>in</sub>, two sets of writing of a positive signal and two sets of writing of a negative signal are alternately performed. The length of the cycle for inverting polarity is made larger than that of the signal writing cycle in this manner, so that the frequency of charge and discharge of a pixel can be reduced. Thus, power consumption can be reduced. Note that when the cycle for inverting polarity is made too long, a defect in which luminance difference due to the difference of polarity is recognized as a flicker occurs in some cases; therefore, it is preferable that the length of the cycle for inverting polarity be substantially the same as or smaller than that of the input image signal cycle T<sub>in</sub>.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Embodiment 8</heading><p id="p-0292" num="0291">Next, another structure example and a driving method of a display device are described. In this embodiment, a method is described by which an image for interpolating motion of an image input from the outside of a display device (an input image) is generated inside the display device in response to a plurality of input images and the generated image (the generation image) and the input image are sequentially displayed. Note that when an image for interpolating motion of an input image is a generation image, motion of moving images can be made smooth, and a decrease in quality of moving images because of afterimages or the like due to hold driving can be suppressed. Here, moving image interpolation is described below. Ideally, display of moving images is realized by controlling the luminance of each pixel in real time; however, individual control of pixels in real time has problems such as the enormous number of control circuits, space for wirings, and the enormous amount of input image data. Thus, it is difficult to realize the individual control of pixels. Therefore, for display of moving images by a display device, a plurality of still images are sequentially displayed in a certain cycle so that display appears to be moving images. The cycle (in this embodiment, referred to as an input image signal cycle and denoted by T<sub>in</sub>) is standardized, and for example, 1/60 second in NTSC and 1/50 second in PAL. Such a cycle does not cause a problem of moving image display in a CRT, which is an impulsive display device. However, in a hold-type display device, when moving images conforming to these standards are displayed without change, a defect in which display is blurred because of afterimages or the like due to hold driving (hold blur) occurs. Since hold blur is recognized by discrepancy between unconscious motion interpolation due to human eyes tracking and hold-type display, the hold blur can be reduced by making the input image signal cycle shorter than that in conventional standards (by making the control closer to individual control of pixels in real time). However, it is difficult to reduce the length of the input image signal cycle because the standard needs to be changed and the amount of data is increased. However, an image for interpolating motion of an input image is generated inside the display device in response to a standardized input image signal, and display is performed while the generation image interpolates the input image, so that hold blur can be reduced without a change in the standard or an increase in the amount of data. Operation such that an image signal is generated inside the display device in response to an input image signal to interpolate motion of the input image is referred to as moving image interpolation.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0292">By a method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment, motion blur can be reduced. The method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment can include an image generation method and an image display method. Further, by using a different image generation method and/or a different image display method for motion with a specific pattern, motion blur can be effectively reduced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams each illustrating an example of a method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref> each illustrate timing of treating each image by using the position of the horizontal direction, with the time as the horizontal axis. A portion represented as &#x201c;input&#x201d; indicates timing at which an input image signal is input. Here, images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b> are focused as two images that are temporally adjacent. An input image is input at an interval of the cycle T<sub>in</sub>. Note that the length of one cycle T<sub>in </sub>is referred to as one frame or one frame period in some cases. A portion represented as &#x201c;generation&#x201d; indicates timing at which a new image is generated from an input image signal. Here, an image <b>5123</b> which is a generation image generated in response to the images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b> is focused. A portion represented as &#x201c;display&#x201d; indicates timing at which an image is displayed in the display device. Note that images other than the focused images are only represented by dashed lines, and by treating such images in a manner similar to that of the focused images, the example of the method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment can be realized.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0293">In the example of the method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, a generation image which is generated in response to two input images that are temporally adjacent is displayed in a period after one image is displayed until the other image is displayed, so that moving image interpolation can be performed. In this case, a display cycle of a display image is preferably half of an input cycle of the input image. Note that the display cycle is not limited to this and can be a variety of display cycles. For example, in the case where the length of the display cycle is shorter than half of that of the input cycle, moving images can be displayed more smoothly. Alternatively, in the case where the length of the display cycle is longer than half of that of the input cycle, power consumption can be reduced. Note that here, an image is generated in response to two input images which are temporally adjacent; however, the number of input images serving as a basis is not limited to two and can be other numbers. For example, when an image is generated in response to three (may be more than three) input images which are temporally adjacent, a generation image with higher accuracy can be obtained as compared to the case where an image is generated in response to two input images. Note that the display timing of the image <b>5121</b> is the same as the input timing of the image <b>5122</b>, that is, the display timing is one frame later than the input timing. However, display timing in the method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment is not limited to this and can be a variety of display timings. For example, the display timing can be delayed with respect to the input timing by more than one frame. Thus, the display timing of the image <b>5123</b> which is the generation image can be delayed, which allows enough time to generate the image <b>5123</b> and leads to reduction in power consumption and manufacturing cost. Note that when the display timing is delayed with respect to the input timing for a long time, a period for holding an input image becomes longer, and the memory capacity which is necessary for holding the input image is increased. Therefore, the display timing is preferably delayed with respect to the input timing by approximately one to two frames.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0294">Here, an example of a specific generation method of the image <b>5123</b> which is generated in response to the images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b> is described. It is necessary to detect motion of an input image in order to interpolate moving images. In this embodiment, a method called a block matching method can be used in order to detect motion of an input image. Note that this embodiment is not limited to this, and a variety of methods (e.g., a method for obtaining a difference of image data or a method of using Fourier transformation) can be used. In the block matching method, first, image data for one input image (here, image data of the image <b>5121</b>) is stored in a data storage means (e.g., a memory circuit such as a semiconductor memory or a RAM). Then, an image in the next frame (here, the image <b>5122</b>) is divided into a plurality of regions. Note that the divided regions can have the same rectangular shapes as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>; however, the divided regions are not limited to them and can have a variety of shapes (e.g., the shape or size varies depending on images). After that, in each divided region, data is compared to the image data in the previous frame (here, the image data of the image <b>5121</b>), which is stored in the data storage means, so that a region where the image data is similar to each other is searched. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> illustrates that the image <b>5121</b> is searched for a region where data is similar to that of a region <b>5124</b> in the image <b>5122</b>, and a region <b>5126</b> is found. Note that a search range is preferably limited when the image <b>5121</b> is searched. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, a region <b>5125</b> which is approximately four times larger than the region <b>5124</b> is set as the search range. By making the search range larger than this, detection accuracy can be increased even in a moving image with high-speed motion. Note that search in an excessively wide range needs an enormous amount of time, which makes it difficult to realize detection of motion. Thus, the region <b>5125</b> has preferably approximately two to six times larger than the area of the region <b>5124</b>. After that, a difference of the position between the searched region <b>5126</b> and the region <b>5124</b> in the image <b>5122</b> is obtained as a motion vector <b>5127</b>. The motion vector <b>5127</b> represents motion of image data in the region <b>5124</b> in one frame period. Then, in order to generate an image illustrating the intermediate state of motion, an image generation vector <b>5128</b> obtained by changing the size of the motion vector without a change in the direction thereof is generated, and image data included in the region <b>5126</b> of the image <b>5121</b> is moved in accordance with the image generation vector <b>5128</b>, so that image data in a region <b>5129</b> of the image <b>5123</b> is generated. By performing a series of processings on the entire region of the image <b>5122</b>, the image <b>5123</b> is generated. Then, by sequentially displaying the image <b>5121</b>, the image <b>5123</b>, and the image <b>5122</b>, moving images can be interpolated. Note that the position of an object <b>5130</b> in the image is different (i.e., the object is moved) between the images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b>. In the generated image <b>5123</b>, the object is located at the midpoint between the images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b>. By displaying such images, motion of moving images can be made smooth, and blur of moving images due to afterimages or the like can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">Note that the size of the image generation vector <b>5128</b> can be determined in accordance with the display timing of the image <b>5123</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, since the display timing of the image <b>5123</b> is the midpoint (&#xbd;) between the display timings of the images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b>, the size of the image generation vector <b>5128</b> is half of that of the motion vector <b>5127</b>. Alternatively, for example, when the display timing is &#x2153; between the display timings of the images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b>, the size of the image generation vector <b>5128</b> can be &#x2153;, and when the display timing is &#x2154; between the display timings of the images <b>5121</b> and <b>5122</b>, the size can be &#x2154;.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">Note that in the case where a new image is generated by moving a plurality of regions having different motion vectors in this manner, a portion where one region has already been moved to a region that is a destination for another region or a portion to which any region is not moved is generated in some cases (i.e., overlap or blank occurs in some cases). For such portions, data can be compensated. As a method for compensating an overlap portion, a method by which overlap data is averaged; a method by which data is arranged in order of priority according to the direction of motion vectors or the like, and high-priority data is used as data in a generation image; or a method by which one of color and brightness is arranged in order of priority and the other thereof is averaged can be used, for example. As a method for compensating a blank portion, a method by which image data of the portion of the image <b>5121</b> or the image <b>5122</b> is used as data in a generation image without modification, a method by which image data of the portion of the image <b>5121</b> or the image <b>5122</b> is averaged, or the like can be used. Then, the generated image <b>5123</b> is displayed in accordance with the size of the image generation vector <b>5128</b>, so that motion of moving images can be made smooth, and the decrease in quality of moving images because of afterimages or the like due to hold driving can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0297">In another example of the method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, when a generation image which is generated in response to two input images which are temporally adjacent is displayed in a period after one image is displayed until the other image is displayed, each display image is divided into a plurality of subimages to be displayed. Thus, moving images can be interpolated. This case can have advantages of displaying a dark image at regular intervals (advantages when a display method is made close to impulsive display) in addition to advantages of a shorter image display cycle. That is, blur of moving images due to afterimages or the like can be further reduced as compared to the case where the length of the image display cycle is just made to half of that of the image input cycle. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, &#x201c;input&#x201d; and &#x201c;generation&#x201d; can be similar to the processings in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>; therefore, description thereof is omitted. For &#x201c;display&#x201d; in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, one input image and/or one generation image can be divided into a plurality of subimages to be displayed. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, the image <b>5121</b> is divided into subimages <b>5121</b><i>a </i>and <b>5121</b><i>b </i>and the subimages <b>5121</b><i>a </i>and <b>5121</b><i>b </i>are sequentially displayed so as to make human eyes perceive that the image <b>5121</b> is displayed; the image <b>5123</b> is divided into subimages <b>5123</b><i>a </i>and <b>5123</b><i>b </i>and the subimages <b>5123</b><i>a </i>and <b>5123</b><i>b </i>are sequentially displayed so as to make human eyes perceive that the image <b>5123</b> is displayed; and the image <b>5122</b> is divided into subimages <b>5122</b><i>a </i>and <b>5122</b><i>b </i>and the subimages <b>5122</b><i>a </i>and <b>5122</b><i>b </i>are sequentially displayed so as to make human eyes perceive that the image <b>5122</b> is displayed. That is, the display method can be made close to impulsive display while the image perceived by human eyes is similar to that in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, so that blur of moving images due to afterimages or the like can be further reduced. Note that the number of division of subimages is two in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>; however, the number of division of subimages is not limited to this and can be other numbers. Note that subimages are displayed at regular intervals (&#xbd;) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>; however, timing of displaying subimages is not limited to this and can be a variety of timings. For example, when timing of displaying dark subimages <b>5121</b><i>b, </i><b>5122</b><i>b, </i>and <b>5123</b><i>b </i>is made earlier (specifically, timing at &#xbc; to &#xbd;), the display method can be made much closer to impulsive display, so that blur of moving images due to afterimages or the like can be further reduced. Alternatively, when the timing of displaying dark subimages is delayed (specifically, timing at &#xbd; to &#xbe;), the length of a period for displaying a bright image can be increased, so that display efficiency can be increased and power consumption can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">Another example of the method for interpolating moving images in this embodiment is an example in which the shape of an object which is moved in an image is detected and different processings are performed depending on the shape of the moving object. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref> illustrates display timing as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref> and the case where moving characters (also referred to as scrolling texts, subtitles, captions, or the like) are displayed. Note that since terms &#x201c;input&#x201d; and &#x201c;generation&#x201d; may be similar to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, they are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref>. The amount of blur of moving images by hold driving varies depending on properties of a moving object in some cases. In particular, blur is recognized remarkably when characters are moved in many cases. This is because eyes track moving characters to read the characters, so that hold blur easily occur. Further, since characters have clear outlines in many cases, blur due to hold blur is further emphasized in some cases. That is, determining whether an object which is moved in an image is a character and performing special processing when the object is the character are effective in reducing hold blur. Specifically, when edge detection, pattern detection, and/or the like are/is performed on an object which is moved in an image and the object is determined to be a character, motion compensation is performed even on subimages generated by division of one image so that an intermediate state of motion is displayed. Thus, motion can be made smooth. In the case where the object is determined not to be a character, when subimages are generated by division of one image as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, the subimages can be displayed without a change in the position of the moving object. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref> illustrates the case where a region <b>5131</b> determined to be characters is moved upward, and the position of the region <b>5131</b> is different between the subimages <b>5121</b><i>a </i>and <b>5121</b><i>b. </i>In a similar manner, the position of the region <b>5131</b> is different between the subimages <b>5123</b><i>a </i>and <b>5123</b><i>b, </i>and between the subimages <b>5122</b><i>a </i>and <b>5122</b><i>b. </i>Thus, motion of characters for which hold blur is particularly easily recognized can be made smoother than that by normal motion compensation frame rate doubling, so that blur of moving images due to afterimages or the like can be further reduced.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Embodiment 9</heading><p id="p-0300" num="0299">In this embodiment, structures and operation of a pixel which can be used in a liquid crystal display device are described.

Each of the region <b>5262</b><i>c </i>and the region <b>5262</b><i>e </i>is a region to which an impurity is added at high concentration and serves as a source region or a drain region.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0354">Note that the semiconductor layer <b>5303</b><i>b </i>is a semiconductor layer to which phosphorus or the like is added as an impurity element and has n-type conductivity.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0355">Note that in the case where an oxide semiconductor or a compound semiconductor is used for the semiconductor layer <b>5303</b><i>a, </i>the semiconductor layer <b>5303</b><i>b </i>can be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0356">For each of the insulating layer <b>5263</b>, the insulating layer <b>5302</b>, and the insulating layer <b>5356</b>, a single-layer structure or a layered structure of an insulating film containing oxygen or nitrogen, such as silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>), silicon nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>), silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0), or silicon nitride oxide (SiN<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0) can be used, for example.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0357">As each of the conductive layer <b>5264</b>, the conductive layer <b>5266</b>, the conductive layer <b>5268</b>, the conductive layer <b>5271</b>, the conductive layer <b>5301</b>, the conductive layer <b>5304</b>, the conductive layer <b>5306</b>, the conductive layer <b>5308</b>, the conductive layer <b>5357</b>, and the conductive layer <b>5359</b>, for example, a conductive film having a single-layer structure or a layered structure, or the like can be used. For example, for the conductive film, the group consisting of aluminum (Al), tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), neodymium (Nd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), platinum (Pt), gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), niobium (Nb), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), palladium (Pd), carbon (C), scandium (Sc), zinc (Zn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), tin (Sn), zirconium (Zr), and cerium (Ce); a single-layer film containing one element selected from the above group; a compound containing one or more elements selected from the above group; or the like can be used. Note that the single-layer film or the compound can contain phosphorus (P), boron (B), arsenic (As), and/or oxygen (O), for example. Alternatively, for example, a film including a high molecular film, a film including conductive plastics (e.g., polyethylene dioxythiophene (PEDOT)), or the like can be used as the conductive film.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0358">For example, a compound containing one or more elements selected from the above plurality of elements (e.g., an alloy), a compound containing nitrogen and one or more elements selected from the above plurality of elements (e.g., a nitride film), a compound containing silicon and one or more elements selected from the above plurality of elements (e.g., a silicide film), a nanotube material, or the like can be used as the compound. For example, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), indium tin oxide containing silicon oxide (ITSO), zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO), cadmium tin oxide (CTO), aluminum-neodymium (Al&#x2014;Nd), aluminum-tungsten (Al&#x2014;W), aluminum-zirconium (Al&#x2014;Zr), aluminum titanium (Al&#x2014;Ti), aluminum-cerium (Al&#x2014;Ce), magnesium-silver (Mg&#x2014;Ag), molybdenum-niobium (Mo&#x2014;Nb), molybdenum-tungsten (Mo&#x2014;W), molybdenum-tantalum (Mo&#x2014;Ta), or the like can be used as an alloy. For example, titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, molybdenum nitride, or the like can be used for a nitride film. For example, tungsten silicide, titanium silicide, nickel silicide, aluminum silicon, molybdenum silicon, or the like can be used for a silicide film. For example, a carbon nanotube, an organic nanotube, an inorganic nanotube, a metal nanotube, or the like can be used as a nanotube material.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0359">Note that silicon (Si) can contain an n-type impurity (e.g., phosphorus) or a p-type impurity (e.g., boron). When silicon contains the impurity, conductivity can be increased or a function which is similar to that of a normal conductor can be realized. Thus, it can be utilized easily as a wiring, an electrode, or the like.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0360">Note that as silicon, silicon with various levels of crystallinity, such as single crystal silicon, polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon), or microcrystalline (microcrystal) silicon; or silicon without crystallinity, such as amorphous silicon; or the like can be used. By using single crystal silicon or polycrystalline silicon as silicon, the resistance of a wiring, an electrode, a conductive layer, a conductive film, a terminal, or the like can be reduced. By using amorphous silicon or microcrystalline silicon as silicon, a wiring or the like can be formed through a simple process.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0361">Note that in the case where a semiconductor material such as silicon is used for the conductive layer, the semiconductor material such as silicon can be formed at the same time as a semiconductor layer of a transistor.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0362">Aluminum and silver have high conductivity, so that signal delay can be reduced. Further, since aluminum and silver can be easily etched, they are easily patterned and can be minutely processed.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0363">Note that since copper has high conductivity, signal delay can be reduced. In the case where copper is used for the conductive layer, a layered structure is preferably used in order to improve adhesion.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0364">Note that molybdenum and titanium are preferable because even if molybdenum and titanium are in contact with an oxide semiconductor (e.g., ITO or IZO) or silicon, molybdenum and titanium do not cause defects easily. Further, molybdenum and titanium are preferable because molybdenum and titanium are easily etched and have high heat resistance. Thus, molybdenum or titanium is preferably used for a conductive layer which is in contact with an oxide semiconductor or silicon.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0365">Note that tungsten is preferable because it has advantages such as high heat resistance.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0366">Note that neodymium is preferable because it has advantages such as high heat resistance. In particular, when an alloy material of neodymium and aluminum is used for the conductive layer, aluminum does not cause hillocks easily. Note that this embodiment is not limited to this, and aluminum does not cause hillocks easily when an alloy material of aluminum and tantalum, zirconium, titanium, or cerium is used. In particular, an alloy material of aluminum and cerium can reduce arcing drastically.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0367">Note that since ITO, IZO, ITSO, ZnO, Si, SnO, CTO, a carbon nanotube, or the like has light-transmitting properties, such a material can be used for a portion through which light passes, such as a pixel electrode, a counter electrode, or a common electrode. In particular, IZO is preferable because it is easily etched and processed. In etching IZO, residues are hardly left. Therefore, when IZO is used for a pixel electrode, defects (e.g., short circuit or orientation disorder) of a liquid crystal element or a light-emitting element can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0368">Note that the conductive layer can have either a single-layer structure or a multi-layer structure. When a single-layer structure is employed, a manufacturing process of a wiring, an electrode, a conductive layer, a conductive film, a terminal, or the like can be simplified, the number of days for a process can be reduced, and cost can be reduced. On the other hand, when a multi-layer structure is employed, a wiring, an electrode, or the like with high quality can be formed while an advantage of each material is utilized and a disadvantage thereof is reduced. For example, when a low-resistant material (e.g., aluminum) is included in a multi-layer structure, the resistance of a wiring can be reduced. As another example, with a layered structure in which a low heat-resistant material is interposed between high heat-resistant materials, the heat resistance of a wiring, an electrode, or the like can be increased while utilizing an advantage of the low heat-resistant material. As an example of such a layered structure, it is preferable to employ a layered structure in which a layer containing aluminum is interposed between layers containing molybdenum, titanium, neodymium, or the like.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0369">Note that when wirings, electrodes, or the like are in direct contact with each other, they adversely affect each other in some cases. For example, one wiring or one electrode is mixed into a material of another wiring or another electrode and changes its properties, whereby an intended function cannot be obtained in some cases. As another example, when a high-resistant portion is formed, a problem may occur so that the portion cannot be formed normally. In such cases, a material whose properties are changed by reaction with a different material can be interposed between or covered with materials which do not easily react with the different material. For example, in the case where ITO and aluminum are connected to each other, titanium, molybdenum, or an alloy of neodymium can be interposed between ITO and aluminum. For example, in the case where silicon and aluminum are connected to each other, titanium, molybdenum, or an alloy of neodymium can be interposed between silicon and aluminum.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0370">Note that such a material can be used for a wiring, an electrode, a conductive layer, a conductive film, a terminal, a via, a plug, or the like.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0371">For each of the insulating layer <b>5265</b>, the insulating layer <b>5267</b>, the insulating layer <b>5269</b>, the insulating layer <b>5305</b>, and the insulating layer <b>5358</b>, an insulating layer having a single-layer structure or a layered structure, or the like can be used, for example. For example, as the insulating layer, an insulating film containing oxygen or nitrogen, such as silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>), silicon nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>), silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0), or silicon nitride oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>) (x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0); a film containing carbon such as diamond-like carbon (DLC); an organic material such as a siloxane resin, epoxy, polyimide, polyamide, polyvinyl phenol, benzocyclobutene, or acrylic; or the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0372">For the light-emitting layer <b>5270</b>, an organic EL element, an inorganic EL element, or the like can be used, for example.
