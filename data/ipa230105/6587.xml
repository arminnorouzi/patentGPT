After that, since the rotational speed falls within &#xb1;5% of the rated speed by the time of passing t1 (before t2+t1), the connection is switched to Y connection when t1 has passed (at t2+t1). Further, after t1 has passed (when t2+2t1), the starting process is terminated, and the operation shifts to the steady operation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary operation of each unit of the motor drive system according to the present embodiment when the inertia is relatively large. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the switch <b>6</b> is turned ON at t0, and turned OFF at 2t2. The switch <b>7</b> is turned ON at t0, turned OFF at t2, and the OFF state is maintained even after 2t2. The switch <b>8</b> is OFF at t0, turned ON at t2, and turned OFF at 2t2. The coils of the motor <b>1</b> are in the Y connection from t0 to t2 and in the A connection from t2 to 2t2.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this case, since the rotational speed of the motor <b>1</b> remains out of &#xb1;5% of the rated speed until t2 has passed after the coils of the motor <b>1</b> is connected in the Y connection, the connection is switched to A connection after t2 has passed. After that, since the rotational speed does not fall within &#xb1;5% of the rated speed even after t2 has passed (at 2t2), it is determined that starting has failed. Accordingly, the starting process is terminated and the motor <b>1</b> is stopped.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating examples of inertia, loads, and successes and failures of starting in the conventional motor drive system and the motor drive system according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A solid line indicates an example of inertia, load, and success and failure of starting in the conventional motor drive system, and a broken line indicates an example of inertia, load, and success and failure of starting in the motor drive system according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the conventional motor drive system, the motor is successfully started in the range of an area <b>1</b>.
