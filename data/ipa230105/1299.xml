The opponent is a player character operated by another player, but may be a computer-controlled character (NPC). Each player selects a character to use for playing from a predetermined character group (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;candidate character group&#x201d;) including a plurality of types of characters selectable as a player character.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The server system <b>1100</b> analyzes stats of a match from a result of the match in the executed game to present to the player. Accordingly, the server system <b>1100</b> performs (1) an individual evaluation process for performing an individual evaluation of gameplay with a player operating a player character as a target player with respect to each stat item based on motion content or a motion result of the player character during a match, (2) an overall evaluation process for performing an overall evaluation of each stat item based on the individual evaluation of each stat item, (3) a player-to-all comparison display control process for displaying the individual evaluation of each stat item in a comparable manner with the overall evaluation of each corresponding stat item, and (4) a player-to-player comparison display control process for displaying the individual evaluations of each stat item of the players who had the match in a comparable manner.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to the present embodiment, the individual evaluation process, the overall evaluation process, the player-to-all comparison display control process, and the player-to-player comparison display control process are performed right after the end of the match. Accordingly, the individual evaluation of each stat item of each player is presented to the relevant player who finished the match in a comparable manner with the overall evaluation and also with the individual evaluation of the opponent player. Furthermore, in response to a separate display request operation requesting the display of the individual evaluation, the player-to-all comparison display control process is performed, and the individual evaluation of each stat item of the player who performed the display request operation is presented to the player in a comparable manner with the overall evaluation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">(1) Individual Evaluation Process</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the individual evaluation process, the gameplay of each player (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;first player&#x201d; and a &#x201c;second player&#x201d; as appropriate) in a match in a finished game is individually evaluated with respect to each stat item with each player as a target player in turn.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an example of stat items. According to the present embodiment, each stat item is defined by one or more of aggregation items as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Each stat item is assigned with a stat item number as an identification number.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The aggregation item is previously defined based on the motion content or the motion result of the player character during the match in relation to the stat item. In particular, the aggregation item may include a type of each motion of an attack or defense, a type or a number of moves performed, a type or a number of moves received from an opponent, a success rate of an invincible counterattack, a number of moves requiring many frames for performing or for a stiff time, timing of each motion (information on whether the motion is made in an early stage of the match or near the end), a winning rate, or the like.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, a stat item &#x201c;combo damage&#x201d; is an item for evaluating magnitude of damage caused to the opponent by a combo attack, and includes an aggregation item relating to a degree of magnitude of the combo attack (combo firepower). A stat item &#x201c;aggressiveness&#x201d; includes an aggregation item of the motion content or the motion result relating to an evaluation of proficiency in an attack. A stat item &#x201c;defense ability&#x201d; includes an aggregation item of the motion content or the motion result relating to an evaluation of an ability to respond to an attack.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, according to the game of the present embodiment, a stiff time is set to each motion made by the player character. The stiff time is a time required before the player character can start a next motion after executing a certain motion. Any input operation for the next motion is invalidated until the stiff time ends. Accordingly, from a viewpoint of the opponent, the stiff time is an &#x201c;attack opportunity&#x201d; that the opponent can hit an attack for sure without being blocked. A stat item &#x201c;invincible counterattack&#x201d; is an item for evaluating whether the player was able to cause damage without missing the attack opportunity due to the stiff time, or the magnitude of the damage caused by the invincible counterattack, and includes an aggregation item relating to the number of invincible counterattacks or firepower of the counterattack, for example.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, a procedure for calculating a unit score is set for each aggregation item included in the stat item. In particular, a number of times that a motion of motion content indicated by the relevant aggregation item is performed during the match is counted, and a point for each performance is multiplied by the number of times of performance to obtain the unit score. Or, a number of times that a motion result indicated by the relevant aggregation item is achieved during the match is counted, and a point for each achievement is multiplied by the number of times of achievement to obtain the unit score. Or, the number of times of performance or achievement is compared with a threshold for a threshold determination, and when the number exceeds the threshold, the unit score is added. Or, when the motion content indicated by the relevant aggregation item is performed during the match, or when the motion result indicated by the relevant aggregation item is achieved, the unit score is added. For example, as for a record R<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the number of combo attacks causing larger damage to the opponent is counted to obtain the unit score. As for a record R<b>13</b>, when the number of invincible counterattacks during the match exceeds a predetermined number, the unit score of a predetermined value is added. As for a record R<b>15</b>, when a time taken to knockout the opponent is less than a predetermined time period and it is determined that a &#x201c;quick K.O.&#x201d; is achieved, the unit score of a predetermined value is added. The procedure described herein is only an example, and the method of the individual evaluation is not especially limited.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">After the unit score of each aggregation item is calculated as described above, the unit scores are added up for each stat item to obtain a score of each stat item.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, after the score of each stat item is calculated, the score is aggregated with the scores obtained from matches played by the target player before, and, for example, an average value of a total score is calculated as an aggregate score so as to calculate through aggregation the individual evaluation of each stat item relating to the target player. More specifically, according to the present embodiment, among the matches played by the target player before, the scores of the matches using the same player character as the player character used in a latest match are averaged to calculate the aggregate score. As a result, the individual evaluation of each stat item of the target player is calculated through the aggregation according to a type of used character. A total value or a median may be calculated instead of the average value.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Then, the aggregate score is ranked. In order to rank the aggregate score, a previously prepared rank conversion table is referred to for identifying a rank corresponding to the aggregate score. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an example of a data configuration of the score conversion table. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the rank conversion table is a data table where an allowable value of the aggregate score is divided into five value ranges respectively assigned with five ranks of &#x201c;SS&#x201d;, &#x201c;S&#x201d;, &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;C&#x201d; from highest to lowest.

Definition data of the display bodies I is prepared for each stat item. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an entire range of an allowable comparison value is divided into five value ranges, and the correspondence relations between the value ranges and the display bodies I are set. More specifically, each of the display bodies I illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a face icon with an expression that changes brighter as the comparison value is higher, and darker as the comparison value is lower.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Then, the display body I is determined for each stat item in accordance with the definition data of the display bodies I illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.

This indicates that the individual evaluation of the &#x201c;invincible counterattack&#x201d; attached with the display body Ib with a brighter expression is higher than the overall evaluation, and the individual evaluation of the &#x201c;aggressiveness&#x201d; attached with the display body Ic is moderate (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) compared with the overall evaluation.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">With the player-to-all comparison display, the individual evaluation of each stat item based on the motion content or the motion result of the player character during the match can be presented to the display target player in a comparable manner with the overall evaluation of each stat item according to the same character. For example, this presentation can be implemented by attaching the display body I corresponding to the comparison value of each stat item between the individual evaluation and the overall evaluation. As a result, the player can recognize not only the individual evaluation of his/her own evaluated and calculated through the aggregation for each stat item, but also whether his/her individual evaluation is higher or lower than the overall evaluation by the expression of the display body I displayed in the same field.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">(4) Player-to-Player Comparison Display Control Process</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the player-to-player comparison display control process, the control for the &#x201c;player-to-player comparison display&#x201d; is performed right after the end of the match with each player (the first player and the second player) in the match as the display target player, and the player-to-player comparison display displays the individual evaluations of each stat item of both players in a comparable manner.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the player-to-player comparison display.

Although it is not shown in the drawings, when the player-to-all comparison display is displayed in the similar mode, the score of each stat item relating to the latest match, the aggregate score, and the rank can be presented to the display target player in a comparable manner with the overall average score. As a result, as for a stat item that has a low aggregate score and rank and is a weak point of the player, the player can focus on the latest score and see whether the score is higher or lower than the overall average score, for example.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Modification Example 3</heading><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, the individual evaluation and the overall evaluation are performed according to the type of used character, and then the player-to-all comparison display is controlled. However, the evaluation may be performed according to a game setting relating to the match. The game setting may be the limited time period of the match, the number of rounds, or the type of game stage, for example. The individual evaluation of each stat item may be evaluated and calculated through the aggregation according to any one of these game settings, and the overall evaluation may be calculated according to the same setting.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">In particular, assume that the evaluation is performed according to the limited time period. In the individual evaluation process, the game setting information <b>575</b> in the player-specific individual evaluation data <b>560</b> of the target player is referred to, and the match-specific data <b>563</b> including the same setting of the limited time period as the setting in the latest finished match are extracted. Then, the extracted data are aggregated with the score of each stat item calculated for the latest match so as to calculate the aggregate score and the rank for each stat item. As a result, the individual evaluation of each stat item of the player in the match is calculated through the aggregation according to the limited time period. At this time, similarly to the embodiment described above, the individual evaluation may be calculated according to the type of used character.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Then, in the overall evaluation process, the overall average score is calculated from the individual evaluations of each stat item evaluated and calculated through the aggregation according to the limited time period in relation to the respective players in the individual evaluation process, and the calculated overall average score is set as the overall evaluation according to the limited time period. In such a case as well, the overall evaluation may be calculated according to the type of used character.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Then, in the player-to-all comparison display control process, the individual evaluation of each stat item according to the limited time period of the latest match evaluated and calculated through the aggregation in relation to the target player is displayed in a comparable manner with the overall evaluation of each stat item according to the same limited time period.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">The individual evaluation may be calculated through the aggregation according to a combination of two or three of the game settings including the limited time period, the number of rounds, and the type of game stage. Then, the overall evaluation may be performed according to the same combination of these game settings, and the player-to-all comparison display may be controlled according to the same combination of these game settings. In particular, the individual evaluation is calculated through the aggregation in relation to the matches including all the two or three game settings. Then, the overall evaluation is calculated based on the individual evaluation, and the comparison display of the individual evaluation and the overall evaluation is controlled.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">As a result, the individual evaluation of each stat item can be presented to the player in a comparable manner with the overall evaluation in relation to the matches including the same game settings.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Modification Example 4</heading><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Furthermore, when a game event of a match is held regularly or irregularly in relation to the game, the individual evaluation may be calculated through the aggregation according to a type of game event. Then, the overall evaluation may be calculated according to the type of game event, and the player-to-all comparison display may be controlled according to the type of game event. The game event includes a game event such as a tournament in which recruited participants play matches, a competition for competing for a game score of a match, or a game event that gives a special reward such as prize money or a prize to participants who played a match.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Furthermore, when the tournament or the competition described above includes a game stage (a match stage) that changes as the participant wins and advances, the individual evaluation may be calculated through the aggregation for each match stage, the overall evaluation may be calculated for each match stage, and the player-to-all comparison display may be controlled for each match stage.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Alternatively, the individual evaluations may be calculated through the aggregation separately for a match in the game event such as the tournament or the competition described above and for an ordinary match. Then, the individual evaluation of the match in the game event and the individual evaluation of the ordinary match may be displayed in a comparable manner. As a result, the player can see whether the player is good at playing the match in the game event (whether the player is strong), or not (whether the player is weak).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Modification Example 5</heading><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Furthermore, the individual evaluations of the same player at different timing may be displayed in a comparable manner. For example, a current score of each stat item of the display target player and a score of each stat item at given timing in the past (e.g., a week before, a month before, or half a year before) may be displayed in a comparable manner. In such a case, in the server system <b>1100</b>, the game management section <b>230</b> serving as a third comparison control section performs a control for displaying a result of the individual evaluation at first timing and a result of the individual evaluation at second timing in a comparable manner for each stat item. As a result, the current individual evaluation of each stat item of the player can be presented to the player in a comparable manner with the individual evaluation of each stat item in the past.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Modification Example 6</heading><p id="p-0191" num="0190">Furthermore, according to the embodiment described above, the overall evaluation is performed using the individual evaluations of all registered users. However, the overall evaluation may be performed using the individual evaluations of part of entire players. For example, the overall evaluation may be calculated using the individual evaluations of members of a group that the target player belongs to.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Modification Example 7</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Furthermore, according to the embodiment described above, in the player-to-player comparison display, the individual evaluations of each stat item between the players who had the match are displayed in a comparable manner. However, instead of the opponent player, the individual evaluations of each stat item between the player and any other player serving as a comparison target player may be displayed in a comparable manner. For example, the comparison display may be performed with a player enrolled in a friend list of the display target player as the comparison target player, or with a player who had the match with the display target player before as the comparison target player. Alternatively, upon acceptance of a selection operation of the player from the display target player, the selected player may be set as the comparison target player. The comparison display may be performed in the display mode using the display bodies I as in the embodiment described above, or in the display mode for displaying the individual evaluations of each stat item of both players side by side as in the modification examples 1 and 2.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Modification Example 8</heading><p id="p-0193" num="0192">Furthermore, according to the embodiment described above, the comparison display between the individual evaluation and the overall evaluation, and the comparison display between the individual evaluations of the players are performed right after the end of the match. However, timing of the comparison display is not particularly limited. For example, each of the comparison display may be performed right before the match starts. Furthermore, a menu for requesting each of the comparison display may be prepared, and the comparison display may be performed upon selection of the menu.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Modification Example 9</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Furthermore, according to the embodiment described above, the individual evaluation of each stat item is performed according to the type of used character, and the overall evaluation of each stat item is performed according to the same type of used character. However, the individual evaluation may be performed according to a combination of the type of used character and the type of opponent character of the opponent, and the overall evaluation may be performed according to the same combination.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">In particular, the individual evaluation of each stat item is calculated for each player according to the combination of the used character used by the player in the match and the opponent character in the match. Then, the overall evaluation is calculated through the aggregation of the individual evaluations of respective players according to the combination of the used character and the opponent character. Then, the individual evaluation according to the combination of the used character and the opponent character may be displayed in a comparable manner with the overall evaluation calculated according to the same combination, or the individual evaluation of another player calculated according to the same combination.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Modification Example 10</heading><p id="p-0196" num="0195">The game that the present disclosure is applicable to is not limited to a match game where characters fight against each other such as the match-type fighting game according to the embodiment described above. For example, in a single-play time-attack racing game, the individual evaluation may be performed with items such as &#x201c;acceleration&#x201d;, &#x201c;course taking&#x201d;, or &#x201c;cornering&#x201d; as the stat items, and the comparison display may be performed with respect to the overall evaluation of each of these stat items, or the individual evaluation of each of these stat items of another player.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Although only some embodiments of the present disclosure have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this disclosure.
