In particular, one or more aspects of the disclosure relate to item validation and image evaluation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thwarting unauthorized activity on one or more accounts is an important function. As unauthorized actors become more sophisticated, it can be difficult to identify unauthorized instruments. Further, even systems configured to identify unauthorized instruments can identify false positives. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a system for further evaluating instruments, for instance, after an initial evaluation, to determine whether the instrument is unauthorized, identify aspects of an authorized or unauthorized instrument, and the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. The summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is neither intended to identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor to delineate the scope of the disclosure. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the description below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects of the disclosure provide effective, efficient, scalable, and convenient technical solutions that address and overcome the technical problems associated with accurately evaluating instruments for authenticity and validity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some examples, a system, computing platform, or the like, may receive an instrument and associated data. In some examples, the instrument may have been previously evaluated or processed to determine validity and/or authenticity.

Differences between such instruments may result in a false positive. In some cases, an identifier may be used to identify whether an instrument is associated with a known instrument source even when instruments from that particular source have not already been processed and included in the user profile. In some cases, authentication processes may be improved through use of a feedback loop to hold and evaluate the instruments before associated data is included in the user's profile.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These features, along with many others, are discussed in greater detail below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not limited in the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals indicate similar elements and in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> depict an illustrative computing environment for implementing item validation and image evaluation functions in accordance with one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> depict an illustrative event sequence for implementing item validation and image evaluation functions in accordance with one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative method for implementing and using a system to perform item validation and image evaluation functions, according to one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a user interface in accordance with one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a user interface in accordance with one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example of an illustrative operating environment in which various aspects of the disclosure may be implemented in accordance with one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an illustrative block diagram of workstations and servers that may be used to implement the processes and functions of certain aspects of the present disclosure in accordance with one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example of a user interface in accordance with one or more aspects described herein;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an illustrative method for implementing and using a system to perform bill pay profile evaluation functions, according to one or more aspects described herein; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an illustrative method for implementing and using a system to implement feedback loop functions, according to one or more aspects described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following description of various illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, various embodiments in which aspects of the disclosure may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is noted that various connections between elements are discussed in the following description. It is noted that these connections are general and, unless specified otherwise, may be direct or indirect, wired or wireless, and that the specification is not intended to be limiting in this respect.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some aspects of the disclosure relate to item validation and image evaluation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As mentioned above, protecting user data and thwarting unauthorized activity is a priority for most users. In some examples, unauthorized actors may generate unauthorized or invalid checks or other instruments. The checks or other instruments may be generated to appear similar to valid checks or other instruments of the user, but, in some examples, might not be identical. For instance, one or more of static (e.g., payee line, payer information, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, date, and the like) elements, and/or one or more dynamic elements (e.g., signature, date information, amount information, payee information, or the like) may be slightly or substantially different from a valid instrument. Accordingly, systems may identify similarities or differences to determine whether the instrument is likely valid or authentic. However, these systems do not offer substantial information as to why an instrument was deemed valid or invalid and also may be inaccurate and identify false positives.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, aspects described herein are directed to systems for further analyzing checks or other instruments to identify why the check or other instrument was deemed valid or invalid and to eliminate the likelihood of false positives. In some examples, a system, computing platform, or the like, may receive a check or other instrument. In some arrangements, additional data may also be received, such as a validity score associated with the check or other instrument.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some arrangements, a user profile may be retrieved, such as from a database. The user profile may include information associated with the user (e.g., name, contact information, account information, and the like), as well as a plurality of checks or other instruments associated with the user that were previously processed. The check or instrument being evaluated may be compared to the plurality of checks or other instruments in the user profile to evaluate validity identify matching or non-matching elements, and the like. One or more user interfaces may be generated displaying the check or instrument being evaluated and one or more checks or other instruments from the user profile and similarities or differences may be identified on the user interface.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some cases, the user may utilize an electronic service (e.g., a bill pay service, and the like) that allows a user online access to their account and/or to a service authorized to generate authentic checks or other instruments to be sent to a third party. In some cases, these checks or instruments may trigger a false positive, such as when similar checks or instruments have not been included in the user profile. Because the bill pay issued checks or instruments have been generated from a known source, a unique bill pay identifier may be checked and used, when identified, to compare the check or instrument to a bill pay profile. A validated bill pay check or instrument may then be added to a user's profile.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some cases, a check or instrument may be incorrectly identified as being valid and improperly included in a user's profile. To avoid such situations, a received check or instrument may be placed on a hold status for a defined period of time (e.g., a waiting period of 21 days, 30 days, and the like). During the waiting period, the check may be periodically (e.g., daily) checked against a first data source associated with fraudulent items reported by users and/or to a second data source associated with potential fraudulent items returned from a third party. Matching items may be flagged and/or prevented from being included in the user's profile. In some cases, a fraudulent or otherwise invalid check or instrument may be inadvertently included in a user's profile. To address such situations, information associated with checks and/or instruments in the user's profile may be compared with items stored in the first data source associated with fraudulent items reported by users and/or with items stored in the second data source associated with potential fraudulent items returned from a third party. In some cases, this comparison is done once. In some cases, the comparison may be performed periodically, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or the like. If a match is found, the particular check or instrument may be flagged and/or removed from the user's profile to prevent matching items from inadvertently being accepted in the future.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Accordingly, outputs from the evaluation described herein may be used to further update, validate and/or refine systems used to perform initial evaluations of checks or other instruments to determine validity.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">These and various other arrangements will be discussed more fully below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> depict an illustrative computing environment for implementing and using a system for item validation and image evaluation in accordance with one or more aspects described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the computing environment <b>100</b> may include one or more computing devices and/or other computing systems. For example, the computing environment <b>100</b> may include a potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b>, a check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b>, external data computing device <b>130</b>, a first local user computing device <b>150</b>, a second local user computing device <b>155</b>, a first remote user computing device <b>170</b>, a second remote user computing device <b>175</b>, a bill pay system <b>180</b>, a claims computing system <b>182</b>, and a returns computing system <b>184</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b> may be configured to host and/or execute a machine learning engine to provide intelligent, dynamic image evaluation and item validation with respect to checks or other instruments or documents that have been identified as potentially fraudulent or otherwise unauthorized. For instance, the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b> may include one or more computing devices, servers, or the like, configured to receive checks or other instruments from a variety of sources. For instance, checks may be received via online or mobile banking applications executing on a user computing device, such as the remote user computing device <b>170</b>, <b>175</b>, from an automated teller machine (ATM) or other self-service kiosk, from a banking application or device associated within a financial institution location, or the like. In some cases, checks may be issued against a user's account in response to a bill pay request. The bill pay request may be generated in response to user direct user interaction or through predefined criteria to automate bill pay functions through use of a bill pay service operating on the bill pay computing system <b>180</b> of a financial institution computing system. The user may interact with the bill pay computing system <b>180</b> via a computing device via a web interface and/or through an application interface operating on a user's mobile device.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some examples, the checks may be received by the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b> and may be processed, in real-time or near real-time, to evaluate the validity of the check or other instrument. In some examples, processing the check or other instrument may include comparing the check to one or more checks in a user profile and/or a bill pay profile associated with users drafting the checks (e.g., account holder, payer, or the like) and generating a score representing a likelihood that the check is fraudulent. For instance, the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b> may compare the received check to the plurality of checks in the user profile to evaluate various regions, fields or aspects of the check to determine whether the received check matches one or more checks in the user profile. Based on a number of matching items, a score may be determined. For instance, if several regions, fields, or the like, match, a low score may be generated indicating that there is a low likelihood that the check is fraudulent. If few or no items match, a high score may be generated indicating that it is very likely that the check is fraudulent.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b> may convert the check to a digital image or may store a digital image of the check (e.g., if received via electronic systems such as online or mobile banking applications). This check image data, as well as the generated score, may be transmitted to the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, all checks processed by the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b> may be transmitted to the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b>. In other examples, only certain checks may be transmitted, such as those meeting certain criteria (e.g., having a generated score within a predetermined range, having particular data fields that match or do not match, history of fraudulent or unauthorized activity associated with an account of the check, or the like).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b> may receive the check and may perform an additional comparison of the check to the plurality of checks in a user profile. In some examples, this additional evaluation of the check or check image data may be performed to provide additional information related to why a particular score was generated for the check. In systems implemented by large entities, such as a financial institution, millions of checks are being processed and evaluated every day. Accordingly, providing a secondary system to generate additional information related to why a particular score was generated for a check would increase efficiency, accuracy of checks flagged as fraudulent, aid in updating and validating systems for generating scores, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b> may display the check being evaluated along with one or more other checks in the user profile. A secondary comparison may be performed and regions or fields that match or do not match may be highlighted or otherwise visually indicated (e.g., by generating a border around a region or field, by inserting a callout or other icon near a region or field, a bill pay identifier, or the like). For instance, if the check being evaluated matches one or more other checks (or portions or regions of the checks match) the check being evaluated and the matching check may be displayed with matching points highlighted. Alternatively, if the check being evaluated does not match one or more checks within the user profile, the check being evaluated may be displayed with the check from the profile that does not match and non-matching regions or fields may be highlighted. In some examples, the check being evaluated and the matching/non-matching check from the user profile and/or the bill pay profile may be displayed simultaneously. In some cases, an identifier retrieved from a data store of the claims computing system <b>182</b> and/or from a data store of the returns computing system <b>184</b> may be highlighted on an image of the check being evaluated.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some arrangements, the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing device <b>110</b> may evaluate a plurality of fields or regions. For instance, static elements of the checks, such as the payee line, location of the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, signature line, position of check number, location of name of account holder, or the like, may be evaluated. In some examples, a pixel associated with a particular point of each static element may be compared. For instance, a pixel associated with a position of a start of the MICR line on the check being evaluated may be compared to a pixel associated with a position of a start of the MICR line on checks in the user profile. If the pixels or pixel locations (e.g., based on x and y coordinates) match, that may be one factor indicating that the check is likely not fraudulent. Pixel locations for various other elements may be compared similarly.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some cases, one or more of the plurality of fields or regions including, but not limited to, the payee line, location of the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, signature line, position of check number, location of name of account holder, or the like, may be used as a bill pay identifier. In some cases, a location, shape, size of a bill pay identifier may differ between different printing runs of bill pay checks due to one or more manufacturing or printing variations. A financial institution may scan or otherwise generate a bill pay profile entry associated with one or more checks from a printing run, a manufacturer or the like. Such bill pay profile entries may be used as a validated representation of an authentic bill pay check or instrument. In some cases, the checks used in generating the bill pay profile may be randomly and/or sequentially sampled from checks received from one or more manufacturers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition to static elements being compared, dynamic check elements may also be compared. For instance, a signature or position of a signature, a start of data including a date of the check, a start of data including an amount of the check, or the like may be evaluated. In some examples, machine learning may be used to evaluate these and other elements of the check.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, upon identifying matching or non-matching elements, data may be provided to a user indicating the matching/non-matching elements, and/or providing options for additional actions. For instance, if the check is a match, the system may provide an option to add the check to a user profile.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The local user computing device <b>150</b>, <b>155</b> and the remote user computing device <b>170</b>, <b>175</b> may be configured to communicate with and/or connect to one or more computing devices or systems shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

For example, the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b> may include one or more computers (e.g., laptop computers, desktop computers, servers, server blades, or the like).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As mentioned above, the computing environment <b>100</b> also may include one or more networks, which may interconnect one or more of the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b>, the check receiving and the processing computing device <b>120</b>, the local user computing device <b>150</b>, the local user computing device <b>155</b>, the remote user computing device <b>170</b>, and/or the remote user computing device <b>175</b>. For example, the computing environment <b>100</b> may include the private network <b>190</b> and the public network <b>195</b>. The private network <b>190</b> and/or the public network <b>195</b> may include one or more sub-networks (e.g., Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), or the like). The private network <b>190</b> may be associated with a particular organization (e.g., a corporation, financial institution, educational institution, governmental institution, or the like) and may interconnect one or more computing devices associated with the organization. For example, the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b>, the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b>, the local user computing device <b>150</b>, and the local user computing device <b>155</b>, may be associated with an organization (e.g., a financial institution), and the private network <b>190</b> may be associated with and/or operated by the organization, and may include one or more networks (e.g., LANs, WANs, virtual private networks (VPNs), or the like) that interconnect the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing platform <b>110</b>, the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b>, the local user computing device <b>150</b>, and the local user computing device <b>155</b>, and one or more other computing devices and/or computer systems that are used by, operated by, and/or otherwise associated with the organization.

The bill pay computing system <b>180</b> may allow a user to automate bill payment functionalities by allowing a financial institution associated with the user account to generate and send a physical bill to a third party. In some cases, the user may coordinate with a particular creditor to automate bill payments on a recurring basis. In some cases, a user may manually request a check to be sent to a third party on a case-by-case basis. The bill pay computing system <b>180</b> may process user requests upon a triggering condition, such as a recurring payment day or a user request. Based on a triggering condition, the bill pay computing system <b>180</b> may print a check on a blank bill play check and include user identifying information (e.g., a name, an account number, a routing number, a payee name, a payee address, a numerical amount, a textual representation of the numerical amount, a bill pay system signature, and the like).

If, after the waiting period, the check or instrument has not matched to the claims information or returns information, the check or instrument may be processed for inclusion into the profile, such as through the methods of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">At step <b>1000</b>, a check image and associated data may be received from a system, such as the check receiving and processing computing device <b>120</b>. In some examples, the check may have been previously processed by the check receiving and processing computing device and a validity score may be determined indicating a likelihood that the check or check image is valid or fraudulent. The check image may then be placed in a waiting room, at step <b>1002</b>, for a specified duration of time (e.g., about 10 days, about 20 days, about 30 days, and the like).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">At step <b>1004</b>, the check image in the waiting room may be compared with claims information and/or returns information retrieved from the claims computing system <b>182</b> and/or the returns computing system <b>184</b>. This check may be done on a periodic basis, such as on a daily basis at the end of a business day.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">At step <b>1006</b>, the potential counterfeit check evaluation computing device may determine whether the check matched with a check identified in the returns information and/or the claims information. If so, the check may be marked as being invalid at step <b>1008</b>. If, at step <b>1006</b>, no match was found, a determination whether the waiting period has elapsed may be made at step <b>1010</b>. If not, the claim is returned to the waiting room until the next time to check for matches has arrived. If the wait time has elapsed at <b>1010</b>, the check image may be marked as potentially being valid and capable of being included in a user profile or a bill pay profile. The check may then be evaluated against an existing user profile or bill pay profile. In some cases, the check may automatically be included in the profile under certain conditions.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">One or more aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in computer-usable data or computer-executable instructions, such as in one or more program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices to perform the operations described herein.
