No. 17/147,983, filed Jan. 13, 2021, which claims the benefit of Provisional Patent Application No. 62/960,304, filed Jan. 13, 2020, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference and made a part hereof.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to a portable lighting device, such as a flashlight, having multiple integrated mounting features providing multiple mounting configurations allowing for hands-free lighting in various situations and locations. In one mounting configuration, an external base such as a tripod is removably affixed to the lighting device. In other mounting configurations, the portable lighting device is: self-supported on a surface through the use of a moveable member (e.g., a &#x201c;kickstand&#x201d;), removably clipped to an external mount, and removably affixed by a magnet to a surface.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing lighting products enable a wide range of indoor, outdoor, and nighttime activities. Electronic lighting is typically provided from fixed installations (e.g., a roof, a wall, or ceiling), where a light source receives electrical power from a fixed, wired power source. Such lighting is useful in illuminating a particular area, but lacks the flexibility of a portable lighting source. Portable lighting sources, such as flashlights or lanterns, have been developed to provide illumination in varied locations and situations. However, such portable lighting sources can be difficult to orient when not held by a user. In the event that a user needs hands-free lighting, other methods of orienting the portable lighting system are needed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is an unmet need for a portable lighting device, such as a flashlight, that includes mounting features that allow for multiple mounting configurations while allowing the portable lighting device to remain oriented in a user-defined position without the need for the user to hold on to the device. A full discussion of the features and advantages of the present invention is deferred to the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The drawing figures depict one or more implementations in accord with the present teachings, by way of example only, not by way of limitation.

In a first mounting configuration, an openable securement means <b>428</b> allows the portable light <b>10</b> to be removably affixed to an external object (e.g., loop on a backpack). In a second mounting configuration, a coupling means <b>514</b> enables the portable light <b>10</b> to be removably affixed to or engaged with a support surface having ferromagnetic materials or properties. In a third mounting configuration, a mounting means <b>622</b> allows the portable light <b>10</b> to be coupled to a threaded projection, such as a tripod. In a fourth mounting configuration, a multi-positional member <b>710</b> is deployed to support the portable light <b>10</b> on a surface in order to position the light that is emitted from the illumination assembly <b>300</b> at a desired angle and orientation. As such, the figures and the following description provide a portable lighting device <b>10</b> that can be selectively mounted in a plurality of ways to suit a user's lighting needs. The multiple mounting features and resultant multiple mounting configurations provide for hands-free lighting in various situations and locations, which increase the utility and functionality of the lighting device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The portable light <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>14</b> that includes a front body or bezel <b>210</b>, a central support <b>410</b>, a rear body <b>610</b>, and an interior retaining means <b>430</b>. The housing <b>14</b> is designed to encase and protect the electronic components <b>60</b> of the portable light <b>10</b>. Housing <b>14</b> including multiple mounting features and can be made from various materials (e.g., plastic, metal, etc.) and may be made using any suitable technique (e.g., injection molding, 3D printing, etc.). In certain embodiments, part of the housing <b>14</b> (e.g., the front bezel <b>210</b> and the rear body <b>610</b>) may be made from one material (e.g., plastic), and another part of the housing <b>14</b> (e.g., central support <b>410</b>) may be made from a second material (e.g., metal).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>11</b></figref>, the front bezel <b>210</b> of the housing <b>14</b> includes an opening therein <b>214</b> and a pair of rearward extending projection <b>216</b><i>a</i>, <b>216</b><i>b</i>. The rearward extending projection <b>216</b><i>a</i>, <b>216</b><i>b </i>are configured to: (i) extend into grooves <b>434</b><i>a</i>, <b>434</b><i>b </i>that are formed within the interior retaining means <b>430</b> and (ii) past a rear extent <b>440</b> of the interior retaining means <b>430</b> in order to removably couple the front bezel <b>210</b> to the interior retaining means <b>430</b>. By coupling the front bezel <b>210</b> to the interior retaining means <b>430</b>, the front bezel <b>210</b> is also indirectly coupled to the remaining elements of the housing <b>14</b>. The front bezel <b>210</b> is configured to retain the optic <b>110</b> within housing <b>14</b>. Specifically, the lens <b>110</b> includes an optic ridge <b>112</b> that surrounds the optic <b>110</b>. The optic <b>110</b> and the optic ridge <b>112</b> are dimensioned such that: (i) the front surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the optic <b>110</b> is substantially flat with the extent of the front bezel <b>210</b> and (ii) the optic ridge <b>112</b> is positioned behind an extent of the front bezel <b>210</b>. This allows the front bezel <b>210</b> to retain the optic <b>110</b> within the housing <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, the central support <b>410</b> that includes: (i) a body <b>427</b>, (ii) a securement means <b>428</b>, and (iii) a peripheral segment <b>424</b>. The body <b>427</b> has a periphery that extends around the exterior of the body <b>427</b> and to the lowermost extent of the securement means <b>428</b> and the peripheral segment <b>424</b>. The periphery of the central support body <b>427</b> extends past the outermost edge of the front bezel <b>210</b> and the rear body <b>610</b>. This allows the central support body <b>427</b> to protect the front bezel <b>210</b> and the rear body <b>610</b> from impacts that may be experienced by the housing <b>14</b>, when the housing <b>14</b> is dropped during use. This is desirable because it increases the durability of the light <b>10</b>. The periphery of the body <b>427</b> is preferably substantially rectangular-shaped and more preferably substantially square-shaped. It should be understood that the periphery of the body <b>427</b> has a different shape, such as circle, triangle, pentagon, trapeze, ellipse, star, hexagon, octagon, rhombus, heart, or any other polygon.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The body <b>427</b> also includes an opening <b>429</b> that is integrally formed in the center of the body <b>427</b>. The opening is designed to receive an extent of the front bezel <b>210</b> and the rear body <b>610</b>, such that the central support <b>410</b> is positioned between the front bezel <b>210</b> and the rear body <b>610</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, when the front bezel <b>210</b>, central support <b>410</b>, and rear body <b>610</b> are coupled to one another, the central support <b>410</b> is positioned closer to the front of the lens <b>110</b>. This configuration also helps protect the lens <b>110</b> and the light source <b>312</b> because these components are typically more fragile than the power source <b>432</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The central support <b>410</b> includes the securement means <b>428</b> that is integrally formed with the body <b>427</b>. In the embodiment shown in the Figures, the securement means <b>428</b> is a clip assembly <b>431</b> that may be known as a carabineer. The clip assembly <b>431</b> includes: (i) a vertical member, (ii) a hinged member <b>414</b> connected to the vertical member by hinge pin <b>418</b>, and (iii) a curvilinear extent <b>412</b> that is configured to engage a terminal extent of the hinged member <b>414</b>. The hinged member <b>414</b> is biased in the closed position, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>5</b>-<b>7</b>, and <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, by a spring <b>416</b>. The application of force on the hinged member <b>414</b> overcomes this biasing force to move the hinged member <b>414</b> to the open position, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. It should be understood that other securement means <b>428</b> configured to attach the light <b>10</b> to another object are contemplated by this disclosure. Such securement means <b>428</b> include: alligator clips, clamps, coiled rings, or connectors (e.g., bayonet-style, quarter-turn, pin and socket, etc.)</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The central support <b>410</b> also includes the peripheral segment <b>424</b> that is integrally formed with the central portion of the body <b>427</b> and the securement means <b>428</b>. The peripheral segment <b>424</b> includes a first projection <b>424</b><i>a </i>and a second projection <b>424</b><i>b </i>that provide an irregular periphery <b>425</b> that is configured to allow the peripheral segment <b>424</b> to be used as an opener for a bottle or can. In particular, the irregular periphery <b>425</b> allows a user to place an extent of a cap of a bottle within an opening <b>423</b> in the peripheral segment <b>424</b>. The user can then apply upwardly directed force on the bottle in order to remove the cap from the bottle.

The multi-positional assembly <b>710</b> is configured to function as a support member or kickstand for the light <b>10</b>, which allows the user to place the light <b>10</b> on a support surface (&#x201c;SS&#x201d;) and direct the light at a specific angle. In other words, a user may place the light <b>10</b> on the support surface SS, wherein a lower edge of the arrangement of side walls <b>660</b> and an extent of a multi-positional assembly <b>710</b> are in contact with the support surface SS. As shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the user can then alter the angle of the emitted light by moving the multi-positional assembly <b>710</b> closer or further away from the rear wall <b>650</b>. To ensure that the multi-positional assembly <b>710</b> remains at the desired distance away from the rear wall <b>650</b>, the multi-positional assembly <b>710</b> includes an elongated body <b>713</b> that has a plurality of projections <b>712</b> that is configured to interact with a plurality of projections <b>628</b> that extend from the rear wall <b>650</b>. Here, the multi-positional assembly's <b>710</b> plurality of projections <b>712</b> is temporarily deformable, such that when a user applies a sufficient upwardly directed force on the multi-positional assembly <b>710</b>, the projections <b>712</b> deform to allow the multi-positional assembly <b>710</b> to move from a first or retracted position to a second or deployed position.

The electronic components <b>1000</b> include: (i) an illumination assembly <b>120</b> and (ii) a power supply assembly <b>550</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the illumination assembly <b>120</b> includes: (i) a lens <b>110</b>, (ii) a light source <b>312</b>, and (iii) light source PCB <b>310</b>. The lens <b>110</b> is a lens between light source <b>312</b> and forward most extent of the front bezel <b>210</b>. The lens <b>110</b> may be a lens and may have a cross-sectional shape that is: (i) substantially rectangular, (ii) convex, or (iii) concave. This cross-sectional shape may be chosen based on the desired light distribution and the type of light source <b>312</b>. The lens <b>110</b> is a primary optic because it overlays multiple emitters of the emitter assembly and the individual emitters do not have additional optics. Alternatively, the lens <b>110</b> may be a secondary optic, if the individual emitters that are contained within the light source <b>312</b> have their own optics. This may be true if traditional, standard, single package LEDs are utilized instead of a Chip on Board (&#x201c;COB&#x201d;) LED or surface-mount device LED. The lens <b>110</b> may be made from a clear plastic or from durable glass material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The light source <b>312</b> may be formed from various different types of emitter assemblies. For example, the light source <b>312</b> may be comprised of: (i) a standard LED, (ii) organic LED, (iii) induction light panel, (iv) silicon quantum dot phosphor (SiQD-phosphor), or (v) surface-mount device LED. In addition, different color emitters (e.g., red, green, blue) may be contained within the light source <b>312</b>. Specifically, the light source <b>312</b> may be composed of between 1 and 60 individual emitters, preferably between 10 and 40 individual emitters, and most preferably between 15 and 30 individual emitters. In some embodiments, every individual emitter of light source <b>312</b> is configured to illuminate when power is applied to the light source <b>312</b> through switch <b>516</b>. The primary light source <b>312</b> may produce between 0 and 3000 lumen, preferably between 0 and 1000, and most preferably between 0 and 300.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The light source PCB <b>310</b> is configured to supply power to the light source <b>310</b>. For example, the light source PCB <b>310</b> may be configured to only illuminate a percentage of the emitters contained within the light source <b>310</b>. For example, a user may be able to select the desired individual emitters that the user wants to illuminate, while keeping other individual emitters unilluminated, which can vary the brightness of the emitted light. In another embodiment, the light source PCB <b>310</b> may only supply a limited amount of power to all or a subset of the emitters. Lowering the suppled power will reduce the light that is emitted from the light source <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, and <b>11</b></figref>, the light <b>10</b> includes the power supply assembly <b>550</b> that includes: (i) a control PCB <b>510</b>, (ii) a power source <b>432</b>, (iii) a charging port <b>512</b>, and (iv) an operational switch <b>516</b>. The control PCB <b>510</b> includes a charging/discharging port <b>512</b>, which meets the USB-C standard. Meeting this standard allows the light <b>10</b> to: (i) receive electrical current from an external source (110 v wall outlet) in order to charge the internal power source <b>432</b> and (ii) supply electrical current from power source <b>432</b> to an external device such as a mobile phone. In other embodiments, the charging/discharging port <b>512</b> may only be a charging port or may only be a discharging port. For example, port <b>512</b> may take the form of a micro-USB port, which can only receive electrical current from an external supply and cannot discharge current to charge an external device. Finally, in an alternative embodiment, port <b>512</b> could be removed and the power source <b>432</b> could recharge through wireless recharging mechanisms or could provide power to an external device wirelessly.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The switch <b>516</b> of the light <b>10</b> enables the user to alter the operational mode of the light <b>10</b>. This is done by altering the current that can pass from the power source <b>432</b> to flow to the light source <b>312</b> to illuminate or turn &#x201c;On&#x201d; the light <b>10</b>. In an illustrated embodiment, switch <b>516</b> is activated by pressing switch protector <b>426</b> that the user depresses and releases to change the operational mode of the light <b>10</b>. For example, the user: (i) may depress the switch <b>516</b> one time to turn &#x201c;On&#x201d; the light source <b>312</b>, (ii) may depress the switch <b>516</b> two times to turn &#x201c;Off&#x201d; the light source <b>312</b>, or (iii) may depress the switch <b>516</b> three times to place the light source <b>312</b> in a flashing mode. In another example, the user may depress and hold the switch <b>516</b>, which causes the light source <b>312</b> to continuously switch operational modes until the switch <b>516</b> is released. In a further example, the user may depress and hold the switch <b>516</b>, which causes the light source <b>312</b> to reduce the amount of light that is emitted from the light <b>10</b> such that the light source <b>312</b> is dimmed. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments, the light <b>10</b> may include multiple light sources <b>312</b>. For example, the light <b>10</b> may have between 1 and 15 light sources <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should also be understood that switch <b>516</b> may be replaced with an assembly that is configured to utilize switches, sliders, or sensors physically coupled to the light <b>10</b> (e.g., motion, light, sound, or heat). In other embodiments, the switch <b>516</b> may be replaced with an assembly that is configured to connect to any of the following devices using wired (802.11, FireWire, etc.) or wireless protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, etc.): (i) sensors (e.g., motion, light, sound, or heat) that are positioned at a distance from the light <b>10</b> or (ii) other devices (e.g., cell phone, laptop, RF remote control, remote devices described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/812,852, and which is fully incorporated herein by reference, or other devices that are connected to the light <b>10</b> via the internet) that that are positioned at a distance from the light <b>10</b>. In even further embodiments, the light may have any combination of the above devices or sensors. For example, light <b>10</b> may include switch <b>516</b> along with a light sensor that is positioned within housing <b>14</b>. It should be understood that the light <b>10</b> and specifically the light source <b>312</b> may be controlled by any of the above disclosed devices or sensors. For example, the light <b>10</b> may be placed within an operational mode that allows the light <b>10</b> to turn ON in response to sensing a flash by a secondary device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The power source <b>432</b> is configured to provide current to the light source <b>312</b>. In particular, the power source <b>432</b> may be a non-removable, rechargeable battery. In other embodiments, the power source <b>432</b> may be a removable non-rechargeable battery, a removable rechargeable battery, a combination of removable rechargeable batteries, a combination of removable rechargeable batteries disposed within a battery cartridge, a combination of non-removable rechargeable batteries disposed within a battery cartridge, a DC power supply that is configured to connect to a 12-volt car battery, a DC power supply that is configured to connect to a 110-volt alternative current outlet, or any other type of power supply that is known to a person of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While some implementations have been illustrated and described, numerous modifications come to mind without significantly departing from the spirit of the disclosure; and the scope of protection is only limited by the scope of the accompanying claims. For example, the overall shape of the light <b>10</b>, or the shape of individual components of the light <b>10</b>, may be altered to be any one of the following shapes a triangular prism, a rectangular prism, a cylinder, a pentagonal prism, a hexagonal prism, octagonal prism, sphere, a cone, a tetrahedron, a cuboid, a dodecahedron, an icosahedron, a torus, an octahedron, an ellipsoid, or any other similar shape.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light <b>10</b> may include a speaker and a wireless module (e.g., a module that is compatible with Bluetooth, NFC, Felica, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, RFID, cellular, WiMAX, ISM, or any combination of these technologies) to enable a user to play music from the light <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The light <b>10</b> may include a female receptacle <b>515</b> that is configured to receive an extent of a male projection in order to couple the light <b>10</b> in a substantially vertical position.
