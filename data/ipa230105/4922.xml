In some cases, the practices may be implemented in categories such as workforce acquisition, workforce management, and workforce optimization. For example, HCM may be applied to applications such as core administrative support (e.g., personnel administration, payroll services, portal/employee self-service, etc.), strategic HCM support (e.g., workforce planning, competency management, performance management, compensation planning, time and expense management, training, recruitment, contingent workforce management, etc.), and other HCM support (e.g., workforce sharing, workforce reporting and analytics, workflow, etc.).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some aspects, HCM may support company (e.g., enterprise, employer) monitoring and management of various workforces. Example aspects of the present disclosure may support HCM techniques for monitoring, evaluating, scheduling, and managing members (e.g., workers, employees, managers) of one or more workforces based on parameters such as associated skillsets, objective performance metrics, and subjective performance metrics.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Accordingly, for example, aspects of the present disclosure may support workforce management in association with human capital. Human capital may be defined as the collective stock of skills, attributes, knowledge, expertise of members of a workforce. The techniques described herein may support advantages such as increased productivity, increased profitability, and increased workforce management among one or more organizations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of a platform, system, and database supportive of employee ranking, employee scheduling, and labor sharing.

For example, numerous constraints specific to an individual business must be adhered when creating a schedule that accommodates for worker availability, worker ability, and open time slots to be filled. For example, some workers may wish to maximize their respective hours, but the same workers may have availability preferences (e.g., desired working times, desired positions or tasks, etc.), task preferences, and or skillsets which may not align with time-slots to be filled.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Some businesses, in general, may wish to maximize profit while also abiding by the preferences and/or skillsets associated with the pool of workers included in an available workforce. In some cases, individual workers may vary based on skillset and/or productivity, which may impact the ability of an employer (e.g., a manager) to efficiently assign workers to available time-slots and/or available positions (e.g., workstations) associated with a work schedule. In some cases, the productivity of a worker may be based on a combination of subjective ratings (e.g., reliability, flexibility, skill level, etc.) and objective performance metrics (e.g., measurable metrics based on criteria such as punctuality, efficiency, etc.). Techniques supportive of selecting and assigning workers for a work schedule while optimizing for a variety of metrics (e.g., employer preferences, worker preferences, worker productivity, worker skillsets, etc.) are desired.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to example aspects of the present disclosure, techniques are described for applying analytic hierarchy process (AHP) techniques for scheduling workers with respect to available work shifts or time-slots of a schedule. In an example, each worker may be provided with a communications device via which the worker may receive, view, accept, and/or reject a proposed schedule (e.g., one or more proposed work shifts or time-slots associated with a time period). A server (e.g., using a ranking manager and/or scheduling manager described herein) may prepare a schedule based on various metrics associated with each worker of the workforce.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the server (e.g., a ranking manager implemented at the server) may gather a number of metrics for each worker, such as objective metrics (e.g., attendance, punctuality, efficiency) and subjective metrics. The subjective metrics may be, for example, subjective and sparser data provided by one or more judges (e.g., current managers, former managers) with respect to worker performance. In an example, the server may combine the objective metrics and subjective metrics using AHP, based on which the server may produce a composite ranking (e.g., a single overall metric, also referred to herein as composite worker ranking) for each worker.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The server (e.g., a scheduling manager implemented at the server) may apply the composite ranking as an input to an objective function when determining (e.g., establishing, setting) a proposed work schedule. In some aspects, the server may determine a proposed work schedule that minimizes the objective function subject to a set of parameters or constraints. In some examples, the objective function may be parameterized to provide varying weights to different criteria in the scheduling process.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Example aspects applying AHP techniques for producing composite worker rankings and scheduling workers based on the composite worker rankings are described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> through <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Aspects of the scheduling techniques described herein may be implemented to realize one or more advantages. For example, the described techniques may support improved scheduling efficiency compared to some systems. Some example advantages may include: an ability to combine objective and subjective performance metrics; an ability to parameterize different objectives in the objective function; an ability to use historical information (e.g., past schedules) to as a parameter for determining current schedules; and an ability to combine worker evaluations generated by multiple judges (e.g., managers).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Dynamic and Iterative Scheduling of Workers</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to other example aspects of the present disclosure, techniques are described for iteratively scheduling workers based on composite worker rankings and feedback from workers. In an example, the techniques may include multiple scheduling passes or iterations for proposing work shifts (and/or time-slots) to a set of workers based on a priority order corresponding to composite worker rankings. In some aspects, the techniques may include a set of algorithms (e.g., scheduling algorithms, worker acceptance algorithm, worker rejection algorithm) for processing acceptance and rejection decisions by workers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, a server (e.g., scheduling manager) may offer a shift to a first worker having the highest composite worker ranking (e.g., most productive workers). If the first worker rejects the shift (or the first worker does not accept the shift within a minimum decision time), the server may offer the same shift to a second worker having the second highest composite worker ranking. Alternatively, or additionally, if the first worker accepts the shift, the server (e.g., in another scheduling pass) may offer a next available shift to the second worker. The server may continue offering and assigning shifts to workers until a final schedule is complete (e.g., all shifts have been accepted by and assigned to a worker).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some examples, once the final schedule is complete, the server may assign the workers to workstations (e.g., work tasks) associated with the assigned shifts. In an example, the server may offer the workstations to the workers over multiple scheduling passes or iterations based on the priority order corresponding to the composite worker rankings. In some aspects, when assigning the workers to the workstations, the server may apply the set of algorithms (e.g., worker acceptance algorithm, worker rejection algorithm) described herein for processing acceptance and rejection decisions by the workers.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Example aspects of iteratively scheduling workers to work shifts and workstations based on the composite worker rankings are described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Aspects of the scheduling techniques described herein may be implemented to realize one or more advantages. For example, the described techniques may support improved scheduling efficiency compared to some systems. Some other example advantages may include improved scheduling transparency and scheduling control compared to some systems.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Labor Sharing Platform</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to some example aspects of the present disclosure, techniques are described for labor sharing among members (e.g., enterprises, organizations) of a consortium. A &#x2018;consortium&#x2019; may also be referred to herein as a network of members. For example, aspects of the present disclosure include an HCM platform that supports the sharing of worker data (e.g., skill sets, scheduling information, preference information, etc.) and/or worker demand between members of the consortium, for example, through enterprise data exchange. The platform may support matching available workers within the consortium to worker demand (e.g., work tasks).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, a server (e.g., an enterprise manager implemented at the server) may identify a work task associated with a first member of the consortium. The server may select, from among a set of workers associated with a second member of the consortium, one or more workers that may be compatible with the work task. For example, the server may identify and select a worker that is compatible with the work task based on parameters associated with the work task (e.g., task type, scheduling information associated with the work task, compensation, location) and/or worker data associated with the worker (e.g., skill set information, scheduling information, preference information associated with work tasks). In an example, the server may output a notification associated with the work task to a device of the selected worker. In some aspects, the notification may include an indication of the work task, the parameters associated with the work task, and/or identification information (e.g., name, location) of the first member associated with the work task.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some aspects, the platform may support worker matching in response to referral requests (e.g., an indication of a work task, a request for a worker capable of performing the work task) indicated by members of the consortium. For example, the identified work task may be associated with a referral request by the first member. In some other aspects, the platform may support worker matching in response to referral recommendations indicated by members. The referral recommendations may include, for example, an indication of an available workers, skill set information associated with the available workers, scheduling information (e.g., scheduling availability) associated with the available workers.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Aspects of the scheduling techniques described herein may be implemented to realize one or more advantages. For example, the described techniques may support increased worker retention and higher worker satisfaction by offering workers increased work opportunities (e.g., work hours) and increased work flexibility. In some aspects, the described techniques for labor sharing may support reduced overhead associated with HCM (e.g., reducing overhead associated with recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, and hiring workers). For example, some other enterprises may operate in silos and may involve relatively less efficient and less effective recruitment processes.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Example aspects of labor sharing among members of a consortium are described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> through <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a system <b>200</b> that supports an enterprise platform for worker ranking, worker scheduling, and labor sharing in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some examples, the system <b>200</b> may be implemented by aspects of the system <b>100</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

In some other aspects, Part II may include a condition that the quantity of split-shifts per worker per day (e.g., across all stores) does not exceed 1.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0217">Part III may include techniques for automatically accommodating, via a soft constraint, cases in which satisfying a condition associated with Part II (e.g., a maximum of 37.5 (configurable) hours per week per worker) would result in an open time-slot (or work shift) that is not allocated to any worker. For example, Part III supports the assignment of one or more workers to fill the open time-slot (or portions of the open time-slot), even if such assignment results in a worker(s) exceeding the maximum of 37.5 hours per week. In some aspects, Part III may include a further condition (e.g., a hard constraint) specifying a maximum of 40 (configurable) hours per week per worker, for example, for a worker(s) assigned to fill the open time-slot. In an example, a weight associated with exceeding the maximum of 37.5 hours per week per worker may be relatively less than a weight associated with accommodating labor demands for all time-slots of a schedule.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0218">Part IV may include conditions and formulations supportive of working a split-shift at different stores. For example, the first shift and the second shift assigned to a worker may be at different stores.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0219">Part V may include techniques associated with addressing cases of multiple workstations or task types associated with a time-slot. For example, Part V may incorporate scheduling workers of different worker types to time-slots (without assigning workers to specified workstations or work tasks), followed by assigning the scheduled workers to workstations or work tasks associated with the assigned time-slots. For example, Part V may incorporate considering worker type (e.g., managers, indoor workers, delivery drivers, etc.) and task type when scheduling shifts.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0220">In an example, Part V may include a two-step process in which the first step includes allocating workers to time-slots via the techniques described herein for scheduling shifts, thus allocating workers to time-slots but not yet assigning them to the multiple workstations. In the second step, for example, a Lagrange relaxation method is used within each time-slot to assign the workers to workstations associated with the time-slots.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0221">In an example case of delivery services, the number of worker types may be set to 3 (e.g., managers, indoor workers, and delivery drivers). In some aspects, the separation of tasks by worker type (e.g., category) may provide advantages for separately scheduling shifts that do not overlap by category.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0222">In another example, the category for &#x2018;indoor worker&#x2019; may have multiple sub-categories to be scheduled. Aspects of Part V may support adaptive reassignment (e.g., by a manager in real-time, autonomously or semi-autonomously by a scheduling manager <b>112</b> in real-time, etc.) of workers to tasks, workstations, or sub-categories of the workstations during a work shift. In an example, the sub-categories may be defined according to store, brand, etc. In some aspects, all or a portion of the sub-categories may be the same between stores, brands, etc. In some aspects, a worker type (e.g., a manager) may be assignable to work any sub-category associated with &#x2018;indoor workers.&#x2019;</p><p id="p-0225" num="0223">In another example, Part V may accommodate individual worker's capability factors (e.g., a worker qualified to open or close a store, workers unqualified to open or close the store). For example, the capability factor, f<sub>jk </sub>described herein may be generalized to be f<sub>ijk </sub>to include time-slot indices i (e.g., adding time-slots as a parameter). For example, opening and closing a store may be work tasks to be completed at the beginning and end of a workday. In some aspects, when scheduling workers for a work task (e.g., opening or closing a store), the corresponding f<sub>ijk </sub>for a worker who is not qualified for the work task (e.g., not capable of the work task, not approved for the work task by a manager) would equal &#x2018;0&#x2019; for any time-slots (e.g., closing times, opening times) associated with the work task.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0224">In some other examples, Part V may accommodate store-specific conditions. For example, a condition specific to a store may specify that no &#x2018;indoor workers&#x2019; are to be scheduled for time-slot that occurs prior to a target time (e.g., 4 PM) on any day. For example, the condition may imply that a manager (e.g., not other worker types) is needed in the time-slots which occur prior to the target time.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0225">An example of the two-step process (also referred to herein as a two-stage process) associated with Part V is described herein. Some scheduling cases may exist in which the separability described herein (e.g., scheduling based on worker type, task type, workstation, or associated sub-categories) does not hold or may not be implemented. Part V may include scheduling techniques for determining scheduled shifts for workers, while evaluating the possibility that although the workers are scheduled to shifts, one or more of the workers scheduled for a shift may change roles within time-slots associated with the shift. In some aspects, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., scheduling application <b>107</b>) may support algorithmically scheduling workers to different roles within the time-slots.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0226">In an example, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., scheduling manager <b>112</b>) or a communication device <b>105</b> (e.g., scheduling application <b>107</b>) may change or modify scheduled sub-category assignments from time-slot to time-slot based on changes or modifications to the type of work stations from time-slot to time-slot. For such example cases, the server <b>110</b> may generalize the capability factor f<sub>jk </sub>for each worker to accommodate multiple corresponding capabilities for multiple workstation tasks. In an example, the total demand for all workstations within a time-slot may be equal to the sum of the demands for each workstation within the time-slot.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0227">In an example of the first stage of the two-stage process, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., scheduling manager <b>112</b>) may schedule worker shifts using the same objective function described herein with respect to worker scheduling. For the first stage (e.g., with respect to shift scheduling), the capabilities {f<sub>jk</sub>} of each worker j may be set as equal to 1/d<sub>i</sub>, where d<sub>i</sub>=&#x3a3;<sub>m=1</sub><sup>M</sup><sup><sub2>i</sub2></sup>d<sub>im </sub>and M<sub>i</sub>=number of workstations in a time-slot i. In some aspects, this assumption with respect to worker capabilities and workstations may support computational tractability.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0228">In an example of the second stage of the two-stage process, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., scheduling manager <b>112</b>) may match the scheduled shift workers to the multiple workstation demands within a time-slot. In some aspects, matching the scheduled shift workers to the multiple workstation demands may be treated as an assignment problem (as opposed to a scheduling problem since time is not involved). For the second stage, the server <b>110</b> may generalize the capability factors {f<sub>jk</sub>} for each worker j associated with a store k as f<sub>jkm</sub>, reflecting a worker's capabilities for any of the multiple workstation tasks m within the time-slot i.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0229">In some examples, the system <b>100</b> may support treating the matching of scheduled shift workers to multiple workstation demands as an assignment problem inclusive of aspects of a weapon-to-target assignment (WTA) problem.

For example, each worker may define, in the worker data <b>1050</b>, a worker profile inclusive of qualifications, scheduling availabilities, preferences, etc. associated with the worker (e.g., a work resume).</p><p id="p-0386" num="0385">In some aspects, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support establishing data provenance for sharing worker data and/or enterprise demand data between members of the consortium <b>1005</b>. In some aspects, in establishing data provenance, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support providing data control to members of the consortium <b>1005</b> (and associated with workers). For example, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support member (and worker) authorization and control of how much data (e.g., member data and/or worker data included in encrypted blockchain data) can be shared by the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> with another member of the consortium <b>1005</b> (or with a worker of the other member). For example, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may share or refrain from sharing any portion of the worker data <b>1050</b> in accordance with worker permissions.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0386">In another example, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may share or refrain from sharing any portion of the worker data <b>1050</b> in accordance with contractual agreements between members of the consortium <b>1005</b>. For example, the first member of the consortium <b>1005</b> may be a hardware store (e.g., Home Depot), and the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support conditional sharing of worker data (e.g., do not share worker data of the first member with members of the consortium <b>1005</b> that are competitor hardware stores).</p><p id="p-0388" num="0387">In some aspects, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support the transport or exchange of the worker data <b>1050</b> between members of the consortium <b>1005</b>, without storing the worker data <b>1050</b>. For example, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support the direct exchange of worker data and/or enterprise demand data between members of the consortium <b>1005</b>, without the worker data and/or enterprise data passing through the domain <b>1010</b>.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0388">Data provenance (also referred to as &#x201c;data lineage&#x201d;) may include metadata that is paired with data records detailing the origin of, changes to, and details supporting the confidence or validity of data. In some aspects, data provenance may be defined as the origins, custody, and ownership of data.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0389">At <b>1055</b>, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., enterprise manager <b>113</b>, enterprise management application <b>108</b>) may send an invite to a worker to set up an account with the domain <b>1010</b>. For example, the server <b>110</b> may send a web-link including information associated with registering with the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b>. In an example aspect of the registration process, the server <b>110</b> may provide (e.g., to a communication device <b>105</b> of the worker) a survey including a set of fields for inputting any quantity of work qualifications, skill sets, work preferences, etc. of the worker. In some aspects, based on the amount of information provided by the worker, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may provide or suggest a corresponding amount of work opportunities to the worker, thereby supporting elevated work opportunities through options, control, and growth.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0390">At <b>1060</b>, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., enterprise manager <b>113</b>) may determine a worker profile for the worker. In an example, the worker profile may include calculations, inferences, and/or predictions (e.g., by the enterprise manager <b>113</b>) of conditions under which the worker prefers to work. The conditions, for example, may include parameters such as pay rate (e.g., hourly pay, salary), work location, commuting distance, commute time, type of work, etc. In some aspects, the server <b>110</b> may determine the worker profile based on the survey associated with the registration process.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0391">At <b>1065</b>, the server <b>110</b> may provide notifications to a worker (e.g., to a communication device <b>105</b> of the worker). In an example, the notifications may include indications of members (e.g., enterprises, organizations) associated with the worker. In some other examples, the notifications may include indications of members and/or work tasks to which the worker has been referred.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0392">According to example aspects of the present disclosure, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., enterprise manager <b>113</b>) may identify a work task associated with a first member of the consortium <b>1005</b>. The server <b>110</b> may select, from among a set of workers associated with a different member (e.g., the second member) of the consortium <b>1005</b>, one or more workers that may be compatible with the work task. For example, the server <b>110</b> may identify and select a worker that is compatible with the work task based on parameters associated with the work task (e.g., task type, scheduling information associated with the work task, compensation, location) and/or worker data associated with the worker (e.g., skill set information, scheduling information, preference information associated with work tasks).</p><p id="p-0394" num="0393">In an example, the server <b>110</b> (e.g., enterprise manager <b>113</b>) may transmit a notification associated with the work task to a communication device <b>105</b> of the selected worker. In some aspects, the notification may include an indication of the work task (e.g., task description, scheduling information), the parameters associated with the work task (e.g., pay rate, location information, etc.), and/or identification information associated with the first member (e.g., name, location). In some aspects, the server <b>110</b> may transmit the notification via a communications link described herein. The notification may be, for example, a text message, an e-mail message, a push notification via an enterprise management application <b>108</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0394">In some aspects, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support worker matching in response to referral requests (e.g., an indication of a work task, a request for a worker capable of the work task) indicated by members of the consortium <b>1005</b>. For example, a member may be unable to give a worker enough hours for a work week, and the member may want to mitigate any possibility of losing the worker to another employer due to the lack of hours. Via the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b>, the member may refer the worker to another member(s) of the consortium (e.g., a direct referral). In an example, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support placement of the worker with another member on a first-come-first-serve basis. In some aspects, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support placement of the worker with another member based on best fit (e.g., based on worker preferences, worker qualifications, member preferences, scheduling parameters, etc.).</p><p id="p-0396" num="0395">In an example, a first member of the consortium <b>1005</b> may contact a second member of the consortium <b>1005</b> (e.g., via the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b>) to transmit a requests for workers. For example, a store manager associated with the first member may contact (e.g., via the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b>, via the enterprise management application <b>108</b>) a store manager associated with the second member regarding a request. In another example, a server <b>225</b>-<i>a </i>(e.g., an enterprise manager <b>113</b>) associated with the first member may autonomously or semi-autonomously contact a server <b>225</b>-<i>b </i>(e.g., an enterprise manager <b>113</b>) associated with the second member regarding a request.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0396">In some aspects, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support referral recommendations from a member of the consortium <b>1005</b> to another member. For example, the platform may support worker matching in response to referral recommendations indicated by members. For example, a first member of the consortium <b>1005</b> may transmit, to other members of the consortium <b>1005</b>, an indication of an available worker(s), skill set information associated with the available worker(s), scheduling information associated with the available worker(s), or the like. The labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support manual referral recommendations (e.g., via a manager via an enterprise management application <b>108</b>), as well as autonomous or semi-autonomous referral recommendations (e.g., via an enterprise manager <b>113</b>).</p><p id="p-0398" num="0397">Aspects of the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support improvements to other enterprise platforms associated with worker recruitment, worker retention, worker evaluation, etc. In an example, an employer (e.g., a member of the consortium <b>1005</b>) may seek workers from the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> without individually reviewing details of each worker. For example, an employer may easily identify and locate workers based on worker skillsets and/or worker attributes. In an example, an employer may easily identify, locate, and propose work opportunities to workers that are working at similar establishments and that have comparable or desirable skills (e.g., worker skillsets, worker attributes, etc.). For example, a retailer may identify, locate, and propose work opportunities to workers that are working at similar retailers.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0398">In some cases, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support worker recruitment by employers (e.g., members of the consortium <b>1005</b>). In some aspects, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support worker verification on behalf of an employer. That is, for example, using the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b>, an employer can get verified employment, an employer may obtain verified worker information associated with workers, and/or an employer may verify recruitment and hiring of a worker. Further, as described herein, a member of the consortium <b>1000</b> (e.g., employers, enterprises) may reliably evaluate workers based on ratings provided by managers (e.g., supervisors) and/or workers associated with the member.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0399">Other aspects of the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support improvements to labor paradigms associated with other techniques associated with worker recruitment. For example, aspects of the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may provide workers with an improved number of options for where they work, improved control over when and how much they work, and more growth opportunities through career development and promotions.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0400">In another aspect, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may provide employers with more options for recruiting and retaining talent (e.g., a workforce shared among different members of the consortium <b>1005</b>), more control with a fluid and dynamic workforce, and more growth through productivity and business intelligence.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0401">In some aspects, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support a framework that may be worker centric and/or member (e.g., organization, enterprise) centric. An example of worker centric and organization centric support is illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0402">Aspects of the present disclosure may incorporate any combination of the worker ranking techniques and worker scheduling techniques described herein with the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b>. For example, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support the application of AHP techniques for producing composite worker rankings for workers associated with members and/or non-members of the consortium <b>1005</b>. In some examples, the labor sharing platform <b>1000</b> may support scheduling such workers (e.g., using iterative scheduling described herein) and assigning workers to workstations (work tasks) based on the composite worker rankings.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0403"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> through <b>16</b></figref> illustrate example user interfaces that support an enterprise labor sharing platform in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.
