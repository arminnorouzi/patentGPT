Computer systems, appliances, and network segments are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for illustrative purposes only and do not in any way limit the scope of the present disclosure. Routers, firewalls, load balancers, network switches and various other components may be omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for clarity. Various other computer systems, components, appliances, and/or methods of their interconnection may be compatible with the methods and systems described herein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The example distributed computer system <b>100</b> may comprise various components, including, e.g., one or more presentation servers <b>110</b>A-<b>110</b>B, one or more application servers <b>135</b>A-<b>135</b>B, one or more database servers <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B, one or more authentication servers <b>150</b>, and/or various other components. The above-described and other components of the example distributed computer system <b>100</b> may be interconnected by one or more networks <b>120</b>A-<b>120</b>N, which may include one or more virtual or physical networks, such as local area networks and/or wide area networks.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an illustrative example, an application server <b>135</b> may operate in a batch processing mode to receive (e.g., via a network interface or a file system) and process a plurality of adjustment records associated with one or more financial accounts. In an illustrative example, the adjustment records may be provided by one or more files encoded in one or more formats that are supported by the application server <b>135</b> (e.g., an XML format, a comma-delimited format, or a proprietary spreadsheet format).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another illustrative example, a request to process a set of adjustment records may be submitted by a user via a graphical user interface of a client <b>125</b>. In certain implementations, the request initiated by the client <b>125</b> may be routed, over one or more networks <b>120</b>A-<b>120</b>N, to an edge server <b>130</b>, which may then select, e.g., based on a load balancing scheme, a presentation server <b>110</b> to which the client request should be forwarded.

The request processing by application server <b>135</b> may comprise issuing one or more requests to one or more database servers <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B. The presentation server <b>110</b> may then wrap the response produced by the application server <b>135</b> into one or more HTTP response messages and return the response messages to client <b>125</b> (e.g., via an edge server <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an illustrative example, processing the adjustment records by the application server <b>135</b> may involve identifying the received set of transaction records as representing adjustment records, saving an account snapshot including transaction records reflecting previously processed transactions associated with the affected financial account, rolling back previously processed transactions that have respective effective dates matching or following the earliest date among effective dates of the adjustment records, merging the adjustment records and the previously processed transaction records to produce a plurality of adjusted transaction records, processing adjusted transaction records to produce the updated state of the account, and/or comparing the saved account snapshot to the updated state of the account in an attempt to produce adjustment events. If one or more adjustment events have been produced, they may be processed using one or more event processing rules, as described in more detail herein below. The updated state of the financial account and adjusted transaction records may be saved to one or more databases maintained by database servers <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example set of adjustment records <b>200</b> associated with a financial account. As noted herein above, the adjustment records may be provided by one or more files encoded in one or more predefined formats (e.g., an XML, format, a comma-delimited format, or a proprietary spreadsheet format). As schematically illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the example set of adjustment records <b>200</b> may include one or more transaction records, such that each transaction record includes the transaction effective date (field <b>220</b>), and one or more transaction amount fields (e.g., Compensation Received field <b>230</b> and Employee Contribution field <b>240</b>). The set of adjustment records may optionally include the Date Received field <b>210</b> indicating the date on which the set of adjustment records has been received for processing. Alternatively, the Date Received may be set by the processing server (e.g., the application server <b>135</b>) to match the current date.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, all the adjustment records share the same transaction type. Alternatively, each adjustment record may include a transaction type field, which may be digitally encoded and/or represented by a human-readable textual string.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, all the adjustment records are related to the same account. Alternatively, each adjustment record may include identifiers of one or more financial accounts affected by the transaction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various other examples, an adjustment record may include identifiers of one or more external entities associated with the transaction (e.g., third-party accounts), identifiers of one or more currencies of the transaction, identifiers of one or more financial instruments associated with the transaction, non-financial data (e.g., one or more event dates, such as account holder date of birth, date of commencing or ceasing employment, etc.), and/or a textual transaction description.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the adjustment records are represented by delta type records, which may be merged with the previously processed transactions by additively combining the specified transaction amounts for a previously processed transaction and an adjustment record, which have the same transaction type, as described in more detail with reference to an illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Alternatively, the adjustment records may be represented by replacement type records, which may be merged with the previously processed transactions by replacing the transaction amount of the previously processed transaction. Regardless of whether the adjustment was represented by a delta record or a replacement record, the merging process would involve identifying, for the adjustment record, a corresponding previously processed transaction of the same transaction type which has the same or later effective date, rolling back the identified transaction, and processing the adjustment transaction, as described in more detail herein below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As current transaction records (i.e., transaction records for which pre-existing transactions of the same type with an equal or later transaction date exist) and adjustment records received by the processing server may have the same or similar formats, the processing server should be able to determine whether a given transaction record represents a current transaction record or an adjustment record. In certain implementations, the processing server may determine that a given transaction record represents an adjustment record if the effective transaction date specified by the transaction record precedes the latest effective date of the previously processed transactions of the same type associated with the affected financial account.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Responsive to determining that one or more received transaction records represent adjustment records, the processing server may save an account snapshot. The account snapshot may include transaction records reflecting previously processed transactions associated with the affected financial account. In an illustrative example, the account snapshot may only include transaction records reflecting previously processed transactions having respective effective dates within a specified reporting period (e.g., the current year). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example account snapshot <b>300</b> including transaction records reflecting previously processed transactions associated with the financial account associated with the adjustment records. As schematically illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the account snapshot <b>300</b> may include one or more transaction records, such that each transaction record includes the Date Received field <b>310</b> indicating the date on which the transaction record has been received for processing, the transaction effective date (field <b>320</b>), and one or more transaction amount fields (e.g., Compensation Received field <b>330</b>, Compensation Limited field <b>340</b>, Limited Employee Contribution field <b>350</b>, and Match Calculated field <b>360</b>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Responsive to saving the account snapshot, the processing server may identify a set of transactions to be adjusted by applying the received set of adjustment records. As schematically illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the set of previously processed transactions <b>390</b> may include all previously processed transactions that have the effective dates matching or following the earliest effective date of the set of adjustment records.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Upon saving the account snapshot, the processing server may roll back the identified previously processed transactions <b>390</b>, returning the account to the initial account state <b>400</b>, which reflects only previously processed transactions preceding the earliest effective date of the set of adjustment records, as schematically illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Upon rolling back the identified previously processed transactions <b>390</b>, the processing server may merge the received adjustment records and the identified set of transactions <b>390</b> to produce a plurality of adjusted transaction records, as schematically illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As noted herein above, the adjustment records of the illustrative example described herein with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b></figref> are represented by delta type records. The set of adjustment records <b>510</b> represented by delta type records may be merged with the previously processed transaction records <b>520</b> by iterating through the set of adjustment records <b>510</b> in the chronological order of their respective effective dates. For each adjustment record of the set of adjustment records <b>510</b>, a corresponding previously processed transaction may be identified, such that the adjustment record and the identified previously processed transaction have the same transaction type and effective date. Responsive to identifying the corresponding previously processed transaction, an adjusted transaction record may be generated and appended to the set of adjusted transactions <b>530</b>. While having the same transaction type and effective date as the identified previously processed transaction that is being adjusted, the newly generated adjusted transaction would have the transaction amount represented by a sum of the transaction amounts of the previously processed transaction and the corresponding adjustment record. In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the adjustment record having the effective date of Mar. 17, 2017 is matched with a previously processed transaction having the same effective date, and an adjusted transaction is generated having the value of each transaction amount field represented by a sum of the corresponding fields of the two transactions being merged. For example, the adjusted Compensation Received value may be represented by a sum of the corresponding fields of the two transactions being merged ($64,900=$15,000+$49,900), and the adjusted Employee Contribution value may be represented by a sum of the corresponding fields of the two transactions being merged ($6,490=$1,500+$4,990).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The processing server may then process the adjusted transaction records by iterating through the adjusted transaction records in the chronological order of their respective effective dates and applying each adjusted transaction record to the current state of the account. For the first adjusted transaction to be processed, the current state of the account is represented by the saved account snapshot, while for each subsequent adjusted transaction to be processed, the current state of the account is represented by the result of processing the previous transaction.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain implementations, the adjustment records may be represented by replacement type records, merging of which with the previously processed transactions would involve identifying, for each replacement type adjustment record, a corresponding previously processed transaction record having the same effective date and transaction type. The identified previously processed transaction should be discarded, while the transaction described by the corresponding adjustment records should be processed instead.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain implementations, the computer system may suspend one or more normal transaction processing triggers for processing the adjustment records. Such transaction processing triggers may specify certain actions (e.g., automated notifications, database table updates, or execution of specified procedures) that would be caused by processing the current date transactions. However, execution of such actions may not be always desirable when the adjustment records are processed (e.g., certain retroactive notifications would only confuse the receiving party; certain actions of workflows cannot be executed retroactively, etc.).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Upon processing all adjustment records of the set of adjustment records, the set of adjusted transactions <b>530</b> may be combined with the previously saved account snapshot <b>300</b> to produce the adjusted account data <b>610</b>, as schematically illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The adjusted account data <b>610</b> may then be compared to the previously saved account snapshot <b>300</b> in an attempt to produce adjustment events. The comparison may involve iterating through the account snapshot <b>300</b>, and identifying, for each original transaction of the account snapshot <b>300</b>, a corresponding adjusted transaction of the adjusted account data <b>610</b>, such that the corresponding adjusted transaction has the same transaction type and the same effective date as the original transaction. Responsive to determining that a transaction amount of the adjusted transaction differs from the corresponding transaction amount of the previously processed transaction of the snapshot <b>300</b>, the processing server may generate an adjustment event record including the effective date, the event type, and the adjusted transaction amount.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> schematically illustrates an adjustment summary table <b>710</b> including a plurality of records corresponding to the plurality of records of the previously saved account snapshot <b>300</b>. The adjustment summary table <b>710</b> may be produced by comparing the records of the account snapshot <b>300</b> and corresponding adjusted transaction of the adjusted account data <b>510</b>. Therefore, each record of the adjustment summary table <b>710</b> may include the effective transaction date <b>720</b>, the adjustment amounts (e.g., Delta Limited Employee Contribution <b>730</b> and Delta Match Calculated <b>740</b>), and the adjusted amounts (e.g., Employee Contribution <b>750</b> and Match <b>760</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For any record of the adjustment summary table <b>710</b> that includes a non-zero adjustment amount, a corresponding adjustment event record may be generated and appended to the event set <b>770</b>. Each adjustment event record may include the effective date <b>780</b>, the event type <b>790</b>, the adjusted transaction amount <b>795</b>, and, optionally, the previous transaction amount (not shown in the sample adjustment summary table <b>710</b>). The event type may be determined based on the name of the field the value of which has been adjusted. The textual description of the event type may be produced by appending the word &#x201c;Change&#x201d; to the name of the field the value of which has been adjusted; e.g., Employee Contribution Change.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The processing server may process the adjustment events using one or more event processing rules. In certain implementations, an event processing rule may specify one or more actions to be performed responsive to evaluating a conditional statement.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The processing server may iterate through the event set <b>770</b>, and identify one or more event processing rules matching the event type of each event record of the event set <b>770</b>. Responsive to identifying a matching rule, the processing server may evaluate a conditional statement specified by the rule and perform the actions specified by the conditional statement. A conditional statement to be evaluated by the event processing rule may compare an event type and/or one or more event parameters (e.g., event dates, account types) to specified values. In an illustrative example, actions to be performed may include generating and transmitting notifications to the account holder and/or other parties. In another illustrative example, actions to be performed may include executing specified workflows.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As noted herein above, examples of transactions being processed may include non-financial transactions affecting the financial data (e.g., various event dates). For non-financial transactions, the event processing rules may specify the actions to be performed responsive to detecting an adjustment of non-financial data fields. In an illustrative example, adjustment of the date of birth of an account holder may result in an earlier eligibility for certain plan benefits associated with the account. In another illustrative example, adjustment of the date of hire of the account holder may result in adjusting the vesting date associated with certain vesting rights associated with the account.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram of an example method <b>800</b> for applying retroactive adjustments to financial accounts, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.

In certain implementations, the computer system may determine that the received set of records represents adjustment records, by ascertaining that each of the received records has a respective effective date preceding a certain date (e.g., the current date or the latest effective date of the previously processed transactions associated with the financial account). In various illustrative examples, each adjustment record may include an identifier of a transaction type, an identifier of an external entity associated with the transaction, an identifier of a currency of the transaction, an identifier of a financial instrument associated with the transaction, an amount of the transaction, a date of an event associated with the financial account, non-financial data associated with the financial account, and/or a textual description of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block <b>820</b>, the computer system may save a snapshot of the financial account.
