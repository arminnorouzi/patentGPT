heat exchanger connected directly or indirectly to a reactor used for producing polysilicon by using chlorosilane as a raw material.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application claims the priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-110347 filed on Jul. 1, 2021, the contents of which are entirely incorporated by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A polysilicon rod can be produced using chlorosilane as a raw material mainly by a CVD reaction carried out by a Siemens method. As the raw material chlorosilane, high-purity chlorosilane is used, and reaction exhaust gas after the CVD reaction in the reactor is cooled with a heat exchanger and separated into hydrogen and unreacted substance-containing chlorosilane.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The reaction exhaust gas discharged from the reactor contains chlorosilane polymers (chlorosilane oligomers) and has a high boiling point and high viscosity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the reactor is opened, air comes into contact with chlorosilanes attached to the inside of the reactor and the exhaust gas tube, so that hydrolysates are also generated and exist as solids.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the temperature in the reactor becomes high, silicon powder is generated in the inside air of the reactor and deposited on the exhaust gas tube and the heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The highly viscous, high-boiling-point chlorosilane, the hydrolysates described above, and the silicon powder are mixed to become dirt on the wall surface of the pipe or the heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the high-boiling-point chlorosilane is left to stand in the air, hydrolysis heat accumulates to cause natural ignition. In addition, since hydrogen is generated during hydrolysis, there is a risk of explosion in the sealed space.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">JP 03-285811 A describes a method of washing a polymer (high-boiling-point chlorosilane) attached to the inside of pipe with high-boiling-point chlorosilane gas.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">JP 2016-13965 A describes a method of hydrolyzing a solid attached to the inside of a device under as inert gas atmosphere.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by Invention</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Examples of a by-product of a CVD reaction using chlorosilane include chlorosilane oligomers. Those included in CVD exhaust gas are typically a mixture of various polymers and exhibit a high boiling point and a high viscosity. When the high-boiling-point chlorosilane (chlorosilane oligomers) is attached to reaction exhaust gas pipe or a heat exchanger surface, pipe clogging and/or a decrease in heat exchange efficiency occur. Thus, the reaction exhaust gas pipe and the heat exchanger should be cleaned periodically.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Meanwhile, JP 03-285811 A states that polymers (high-boiling-point chlorosilane) attached to the inside of pipe are washed with gaseous chlorosilane. However, the actual pipe contains solids as a result of hydrolysis of high-boiling-point chlorosilane with air mixed when the reactor is opened, and silicon powder generated in the air in the reactor. For this reason, in the method in which chlorosilane is vaporized and condensed in the pipe, the physical force for detaching the deposits is weak, and a sufficient cleaning effect cannot be thus exerted.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, JP 2016-13965 A describes a method of hydrolyzing a solid attached to the inside of a device under an inert gas atmosphere, but actually, it takes time to hydrolyze a material in a solid state in pipe.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">High-boiling-point chlorosilane attached to reaction exhaust gas pipe and a heat exchanger is generated in the air in the reactor. This includes silicon powder and solids such as hydrolysates generated from air mixed when the reactor is opened. That is, a mixture of the high-boiling-point chlorosilane and the solids is a main component of deposits in the pipe and the heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a CVD exhaust gas hazard assessment test, the falling test for high-boiling-point chlorosilane is evaluated as grade 8 (very low). By contrast, the failing test for hydrolysates is evaluated as grade 2 (high), and the ballistic mortar test for hydrolysates is evaluated as high as 13 to 28% (TNT). In addition, when high-boiling-point chlorosilane is left to stand in the air, hydrolysis heat accumulates to cause natural ignition. The most hazardous substance is a hydrolysate of high-boiling-point chlorosilane. The occurrence is hard to be prevented during open-air production.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of the above contents, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a cleaning system or a cleaning method of easily and safely cleaning pipe and a heat exchanger connected directly or indirectly to a reactor used for producing polysilicon by using chlorosilane as a raw material.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0017">[Concept 1]</li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A cleaning system comprising:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">a first pipe connected to a reactor used for producing polysilicon by using chlorosilane as a raw material;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">a heat exchanger connected to the first pipe;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">a second pipe provided between the heat exchanger and the first pipe; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">a driving unit provided at the first pipe or the second pipe, wherein</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">a cleaning liquid circulates through the first pipe, the heat exchanger and the second pipe by the driving unit.<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0024">[Concept 2]</li></ul></p><p id="p-0025" num="0025">The cleaning system according to concept 1 may further comprise a chlorosilane tank provided at the second pipe and configured to store liquid chlorosilane produced by the heat exchanger, wherein</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">the chlorosilane stored in the chlorosilane tank may circulate as the cleaning liquid through the first pipe, the heat exchanger, and the second pipe.<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0027">[Concept 3]</li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">The cleaning system according to concept 1 or 2 may further comprise a storage unit connected to the first pipe, the second pipe or the heat exchanger, wherein</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">chlorosilane may be supplied as the cleaning liquid from the storage unit.<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">[Concept 4]</li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">A cleaning method using the cleaning system according to any one of concepts 1 to 3 may comprise</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">performing cleaning of the first pipe and the heat exchanger without detaching the first pipe or the heat exchanger from the cleaning system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a reaction system including a cleaning system according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a reaction system including a cleaning system according to a modification embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the configuration when an Example in the present invention is implemented.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0036">A reaction system in an embodiment of the invention includes one or more reaction apparatuses such as a CVD reaction apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">The reaction apparatus includes a reactor <b>10</b>, electrodes <b>220</b> provided at the reactor <b>10</b>, U-shaped electrode wiring <b>210</b> attached to the electrodes <b>220</b>, a supply unit <b>260</b> for supplying a supply gas to the reactor <b>10</b>, and a discharge unit <b>270</b> for discharging an exhaust gas from the reactor <b>10</b>. In the reaction apparatus, polycrystalline polysilicon is produced, for example, by using a Siemens method for growing polysilicon by a CVD reaction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">A discharge pipe such as CVD reaction exhaust gas pipe is connected co the discharge unit <b>270</b>. This discharge pipe is referred to as first pipe <b>20</b> in this embodiment. The first pipe <b>20</b> is connected to a heat exchanger <b>30</b> such as an exhaust gas cooling heat exchanger <b>30</b>. That is, the exhaust gas is discharged from the reactor <b>10</b> such as a CVD reaction apparatus to the heat exchanger <b>30</b> via the first pipe <b>20</b>. If the configuration of this embodiment is not adopted, chlorosilane oligomers (high-boiling-point chlorosilane), hydrolysates, and/or silicon powder accumulate and are deposited onto the first pipe <b>20</b> and the heat exchanger <b>30</b> at that time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">In the heat exchanger <b>30</b>, the exhaust gas is cooled to become a liquid containing chlorosilane. Such a chlorosilane liquid produced from the condensed chlorosilanes after the reaction is guided via second pipe <b>60</b> to a chlorosilane tank <b>40</b>. On the other hand, the hydrogen gas, for example, contained in the condensed chlorosilanes after the reaction is discharged from the heat exchanger <b>30</b> via regeneration-use hydrogen gas pipe <b>70</b>. After a predetermined treatment, the hydrogen gas is returned to the reactor <b>10</b> and recycled. Although chlorosilane contained in the exhaust gas exhausted from the reactor <b>10</b> is in a gaseous state up to the middle of the heat exchanger <b>30</b> and the first pipe <b>20</b>, the chlorosilane is cooled by the heat exchanger <b>30</b> and the chlorosilane is in a liquid state on the downstream side of the heat exchanger <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">Chlorosilane composed of a liquid in the chlorosilane tank <b>40</b> receives driving force from a driving unit <b>50</b> such as a pump, and is discharged from the chlorosilane tank <b>40</b> to the second pipe <b>60</b> on a side (lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) different from the heat exchanger side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the second pipe <b>60</b> in this embodiment is connected to the first pipe <b>20</b>. Accordingly, the chlorosilane liquid discharged into the second pipe <b>60</b> flows via the first pipe <b>20</b> into the heat exchanger <b>30</b>, and then flows into the chlorosilane tank <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, circulation of &#x201c;chlorosilane tank <b>40</b>&#x2192;second pipe <b>60</b>&#x2192;first pipe <b>20</b>&#x2192;heat exchanger <b>30</b>&#x2192;second pipe <b>60</b>&#x2192;chlorosilane tank <b>40</b>&#x201d; is repeated.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">Since the high-boiling-point chlorosilane can be dissolved in chlorosilane (monomer), use of chlorosilane as a cleaning liquid enables cleaning. However, material mainly composed of high-boiling-point chlorosilane, chlorosilane hydrolysates, and silicon powder is attached to the first pipe <b>20</b> and the heat exchanger <b>30</b>. Since this material is attached to the pipe wall due to the adhesiveness of high-boiling-point chlorosilane, it is difficult to permeate through and dissolve the material, and no effect is exerted unless chlorosilane for cleaning is made to flow actively and fluid power is imposed on the pipe wall.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">Thus, in this embodiment, a configuration is adopted in which a chlorosilane liquid is supplied to the first pipe <b>20</b> provided between the reactor <b>10</b> and the heat exchanger <b>30</b>, and the first pipe <b>20</b> and the heat exchanger <b>30</b> are filled with the chlorosilane liquid. Then, by circulating at as fast a flow rate as possible using the driving unit <b>50</b> such as a pump, the high-boiling-point chlorosilane component can be dissolved, and the silicon powder and the hydrolysates can be washed away. Conventionally, it has been necessary to detach and clean the first pipe <b>20</b> and the heat exchanger <b>30</b> having dirt attached. However, such a configuration as in this embodiment may be adopted to clean the first pipe <b>20</b> and the heat exchanger <b>30</b> without detaching them as in the conventional case.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">Note that a large amount of chlorosilane discharged from the reactor <b>10</b> adheres to the first pipe <b>20</b> and the upstream side of the heat exchanger <b>30</b>. However, on the downstream side of the heat exchanger <b>30</b>, such a large amount of chlorosilane is not attached due to the self-cleaning effect of the chlorosilane that has become a liquid. Therefore, this embodiment can exert, more specifically, a significant effect of cleaning the chlorosilane attached to the first pipe <b>20</b> and the upstream side of the heat exchanger <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">The high-boiling-point chlorosilane and solids, which have been washed away, are concentrated and separated in a subsequent distillation step and so on. The degree of concentration depends on the viscosity of the liquid, but it is desirable that at least 50% of chlorosilane monomers exist as a solvent. The resulting material should have a viscosity so as to be able to flow through pipe including the first pipe <b>20</b> and the second pipe <b>60</b>. As a result, detoxification is readily enabled in incineration treatment and/or hydrolysis treatment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">Examples of desirable chlorosilane for cleaning include, but are not limited to, chlorosilane (mainly a mixture of trichlorosilane and silicon tetrachloride) recovered through the first pipe <b>20</b> from the viewpoint of quality and cost.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">Chlorosilane collected from the exhaust gas temporarily stored in the chlorosilane tank <b>40</b> after liquefied and condensed is supplied to and circulated through the first pipe <b>20</b>, which is an exhaust gas line, by the driving unit <b>50</b> such as a cleaning-use chlorosilane pump.

In this case, the switching unit <b>110</b> may execute control such that the cleaning liquid does not flow into the third pipe <b>130</b>. On the other hand, a cleaning liquid composed of a chlorosilane liquid may be discharged. In this case, the cleaning liquid may flow only into the third pipe <b>130</b> by means of the switching unit <b>110</b>, and the cleaning liquid composed of a chlorosilane liquid does not flow into the second pipe <b>60</b> on the downstream side of the switching unit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">A closing part configured to prevent chlorosilane from flowing into the reactor <b>10</b> from a discharge unit <b>270</b> when chlorosilane is circulated may be provided between the reactor <b>10</b> and a connection part between the first pipe <b>20</b> and the second pipe <b>60</b> or in the reactor <b>10</b>. Providing such a closing part makes it possible to prevent a cleaning liquid such as a chlorosilane liquid to be circulated from erroneously flowing into the reactor <b>10</b>. The closing part may be a closing cap <b>90</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) used for circulation cleaning. It is also conceivable to provide a closing valve <b>150</b> as the closing part (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). However, since the temperature tends to be high in the reactor <b>10</b> and in the vicinity thereof, it may be difficult to use the closing valve <b>150</b> as the closing part. In this regard, by adopting a structure like the closing cap <b>90</b>, it is possible to prevent a cleaning liquid such as a chlorosilane liquid from erroneously flowing into the reactor <b>10</b> at low cost without any concern about the problem of heat.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0050">Conditions related to the cleaning effect include an in-tube linear velocity, a liquid temperature, and a cleaning time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0051">The faster the in-tube linear velocity, the better. The velocity may be 0.01 m/s or more, and preferably 0.1 m/s or more. The higher the cleaning temperature, the better. The cleaning temperature may be 10&#xb0; C. or higher, and preferably 25&#xb0; C. or higher. However, when the cleaning temperature exceeds the boiling point of chlorosilane as a circulation liquid, cavitation occurs on the suction side of the pump. Thus, it is preferable that the cleaning temperature does not exceed the boiling point of chlorosilane. The circulation time depends on the thickness of the high-boiling-point chlorosilanes deposited inside, but the time from filling to circulation/discharge is from 2 to 48 hours. This conditions are favorable. During this time, polycrystalline silicon cannot be produced using the reaction apparatus. As a result, it is beneficial that cleaning can be performed quickly and efficiently in order to secure the operating time of the apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Modification Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0052">In view of the above, the description has been given using the configuration in which chlorosilane discharged from the reactor <b>10</b> is liquefied and the liquefied chlorosilane is circulated.
