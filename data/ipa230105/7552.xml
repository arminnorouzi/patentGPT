The UE is served by a Master Node (MN), in the first cell and by a Secondary Node (SN) in a third cell. The UE receives a CHO configuration from the first network node acting as the MN. The CHO configuration includes an indication to release configurations of any one or more out of: Multi Radio Access Technology Dual Connectivity (MR-DC), and SN terminated bearers.

In some aspects, they relate to handling a Conditional Handover (CHO) of the UE from a first cell to a second cell in a wireless communications network.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a typical wireless communication network, wireless devices, also known as wireless communication devices, mobile stations, stations (STA) and/or User Equipments (UE), communicate via a Local Area Network such as a Wi-Fi network or a Radio Access Network (RAN) to one or more core networks (CN). The RAN covers a geographical area which is divided into service areas or cell areas, which may also be referred to as a beam or a beam group, with each service area or cell area being served by a radio access node such as a radio access node e.g., a Wi-Fi access point or a radio base station (RBS), which in some networks may also be denoted, for example, a NodeB, eNodeB (eNB), or gNB as denoted in 5G. A service area or cell area is a geographical area where radio coverage is provided by the radio access node. The radio access node communicates over an air interface operating on radio frequencies with the wireless device within range of the radio access node.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Specifications for the Evolved Packet System (EPS), also called a Fourth Generation (4G) network, have been completed within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and this work continues in the coming 3GPP releases, for example to specify a Fifth Generation (5G) network also referred to as 5G New Radio (NR). The EPS comprises the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), also known as the Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio access network, and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), also known as System Architecture Evolution (SAE) core network. E-UTRAN/LTE is a variant of a 3GPP radio access network wherein the radio access nodes are directly connected to the EPC core network rather than to RNCs used in 3G networks. In general, in E-UTRAN/LTE the functions of a 3G RNC are distributed between the radio access nodes, e.g. eNodeBs in LTE, and the core network. As such, the RAN of an EPS has an essentially &#x201c;flat&#x201d; architecture comprising radio access nodes connected directly to one or more core networks, i.e. they are not connected to RNCs. To compensate for that, the E-UTRAN specification defines a direct interface between the radio access nodes, this interface being denoted the X2 interface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multi-antenna techniques can significantly increase the data rates and reliability of a wireless communication system. The performance is in particular improved if both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas, which results in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication channel. Such systems and/or related techniques are commonly referred to as MIMO.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conditional Handover</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In 3GPP NR Release 16, the concept of conditional handover is being considered. The proposed additions to the specifications can be found in e.g. R2-1912781 and R2-1912636 as shown in 3GPP FIG. 9.2.3.x.2-1: Intra-Access and Mobility management Function (AMF)/User Plane Function (UPF) Conditional Handover (HO) which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>(Steps <b>0</b>-<b>7</b>) and <b>1</b><i>b </i>(Step <b>8</b>) and comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">Step <b>0</b>/<b>1</b>.

In that procedure, as the UE has both an MN and an SN connection, the SN may still be in good conditions and could possibly remain as the SN after the change of MN.

In 3GPP the relation between CHO procedures and Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) has not been explicitly discussed. MR-DC may also be referred to as Multi-RAT Dual Connectivity or to Multi-Radio dual connectivity. In other words, the following was not discussed:<ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0104">If a UE operating in MR-DC may receive a CHO configuration;</li>        <li id="ul0019-0002" num="0105">If a UE monitoring CHO conditions may be configured to start operating in MR-DC.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0070" num="0106">A related discussion that is not in the scope of embodiments herein is the support for conditional PSCell addition and conditional PSCell change. In conditional PSCell addition the UE is not operating in MR-DC when it receives a conditional HO like configuration comprising trigger and/or execution conditions and an RRCReconfiguration to be stored and only applied when the associated conditions are fulfilled. In conditional PSCell change the UE is operating in MR-DC when it receives a conditional HO like configuration comprising trigger and/or execution conditions and an RRCReconfiguration to be stored and only applied when the associated conditions are fulfilled.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0107">A first problem some embodiments herein solves has to do with mobility reliability issues in a given area within the network where the UE could also benefit from MR-DC e.g. for traffic aggregation and/or routing. While the UE in MR-DC can receive handover commands, these may fail to be received and/or executed. Or the UE may detect a Radio Link Failure (RLF) while it is operating in MR-DC. There could be areas where the network wants to configure a UE with CHO target candidates to avoid and/or minimize the risk of Radio Link Failure (RLF)s and handover failures (HOFs). At the same time, the network is capable of configuring UEs with Dual Connectivity. The solution for this problem is described below and comprises the UE being configured with MR-DC while monitors CHO, and the UE being configured with CHO while it is operating in MR-DC.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0108">A second problem relates to a UE being configured with MR-DC while it monitors CHO, or the UE being configured with CHO while it is operating in MR-DC, in particular the handling of SN related configurations such as e.g. SN terminated bearers. In a legacy procedure shown above, an MN decides to trigger a handover for a UE operating in MR-DC and, indicates both MCG and SG configuration, either NR SCG configuration if the UE is in NR-DC, or E-UTRA SCG configurations if the UE is in NE-DC, to the target MN, e.g., T-gNB according to step <b>2</b> in FIG. 10.8.2-1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a, b </i></figref>above. Hence, if the target MN is not interested to keep the UE in MR-DC after the handover, the target MN includes in the HO command the field mrdc-SecondaryCellGroupConfig and sets it to release, as shown below according to 3GPP TS 38.331:</p><p id="p-0073" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;1&#x3e;
