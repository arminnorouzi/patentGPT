Fibers of the SNS extend through tissue in almost every organ system of the human body and can affect characteristics such as pupil diameter, gut motility, and urinary output. Such regulation can have adaptive utility in maintaining homeostasis or in preparing the body for rapid response to environmental factors. Chronic over-activation of the SNS, however, is a common maladaptive response that can drive the progression of many disease states. Excessive activation of the renal SNS, in particular, has been identified experimentally and in humans as a likely contributor to the complex pathophysiology of arrhythmias, hypertension, states of volume overload (e.g., heart failure), and progressive renal disease.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sympathetic nerves of the kidneys terminate in the renal blood vessels, the juxtaglomerular apparatus, and the renal tubules, among other structures. Stimulation of the renal sympathetic nerves can cause, for example, increased renin release, increased sodium reabsorption, and reduced renal blood flow. These and other neural-regulated components of renal function are considerably stimulated in disease states characterized by heightened sympathetic tone. For example, reduced renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate as a result of renal sympathetic efferent stimulation is likely a cornerstone of the loss of renal function in cardio-renal syndrome, (i.e., renal dysfunction as a progressive complication of chronic heart failure). Pharmacologic strategies to thwart the consequences of renal sympathetic stimulation include centrally-acting sympatholytic drugs, beta blockers (e.g., to reduce renin release), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers (e.g., to block the action of angiotensin II and aldosterone activation consequent to renin release), and diuretics (e.g., to counter the renal sympathetic mediated sodium and water retention). These pharmacologic strategies, however, have significant limitations including limited efficacy, compliance issues, side effects, and others.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partially schematic perspective view illustrating a renal neuromodulation system including an irrigated treatment device configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a partially schematic side view of a neuromodulation catheter with a distal portion of a guidewire positioned within a blood vessel of a human patient and configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> are partially schematic side views of the neuromodulation catheter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> with an irrigated treatment assembly in a first state and a second state, respectively, within the blood vessel of the human patient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> is a front view of the irrigated treatment assembly in the second state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> looking proximally down a longitudinal axis of the blood vessel of the human patient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partially schematic side view of a neuromodulation catheter having an irrigated treatment assembly in a deployed state within a blood vessel of a human patient and configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partially schematic side view of a neuromodulation catheter having an irrigated treatment assembly in a deployed state within a blood vessel of a human patient and configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph depicting an energy delivery algorithm that may be used in conjunction with neuromodulation systems configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a process or method for treating a patient using a neuromodulation system configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates modulating renal nerves and/or evaluating the neuromodulation therapy with the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a conceptual illustration of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and how the brain communicates with the body via the SNS.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an enlarged anatomic view of nerves innervating a left kidney to form the renal plexus surrounding the left renal artery.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> are anatomic and conceptual views, respectively, of a human body depicting neural efferent and afferent communication between the brain and kidneys.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> are anatomic views of the arterial vasculature and venous vasculature, respectively, of a human.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The following disclosure describes neuromodulation catheter systems with controlled irrigation capabilities and methods for using such systems. More specifically, neuromodulation systems configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology utilize a neuromodulation catheter having an irrigated treatment assembly. The disclosed neuromodulation systems are configured to deliver coordinated neuromodulation energy and irrigation fluid to the irrigated treatment assembly at a treatment site within a blood vessel (e.g., a renal blood vessel) of a patient. The disclosed systems are configured to adjust/modify one or more parameters of energy delivery and irrigation throughout treatment based on, for example, patient tissue characteristics at the treatment site, treatment assembly component characteristics, irrigation fluid characteristics, power at which energy is currently being applied, and other related parameters.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Using conventional neuromodulation systems and methods, a lesion's depth can be increased at a target site within a patient by increasing power at which energy is delivered to the tissue. The temperature of an electrode (or electrodes) used to deliver such energy, however, also increases as power is increased. In some cases, the increased temperature of the electrode can lead to coagulation of blood and charring of the vessel tissue. This tissue damage can, in turn, lead to other adverse effects, including downstream infarction or other undesirable tissue damage. For this reason, some conventional systems incorporate irrigation to provide cooling at the treatment site and to avoid some of the adverse effects experienced with non-irrigated catheters. Nevertheless, irrigated ablation systems have been shown to create undesirably larger lesions than non-irrigated catheters, and several adverse effects associated with tissue damage after use of these irrigated catheters have been documented, including renal artery stenosis, arterial access site issues, and/or significant eGFR decline.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">There are several reasons for the continued presence of adverse effects associated with the use of conventional irrigated catheters. For example, irrigation fluid in these conventional systems is typically applied in an uncontrolled fashion, with limited control over flow rates and timing of delivery and limited control over temperature of the infusate. These practices can skew temperature measurements taken by the neuromodulation system during treatment. In particular, irrigation fluid may cause these conventional systems to report an electrode temperature somewhere between the temperature of the irrigation fluid (e.g., room temperature) and a patient's body temperature, which becomes increasingly inaccurate over the course of treatment (especially as power is increased). Thus, in many circumstances, any electrode temperature information conveyed back to the system's generator after use of irrigation fluid cannot reliably be used as a measure of ablation progress. As a result, these conventional irrigated systems inaccurately track the size of the lesions created and the condition of treated tissue. Although this issue not as much of a concern when ablating certain anatomical structures (e.g., heart tissue), this lack of control is especially problematic when ablating near electrically vulnerable, thin-walled, or other arterial structures. For example, renal anatomy is typically more complicated in the local heterogeneity of anatomical structures than heart tissue. Thus, greater control and care when performing renal denervation is required than can be offered by conventional irrigated systems.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In contrast with conventional systems and techniques, neuromodulation systems and methods in accordance with embodiments of the present technology are configured to deliver coordinated neuromodulation energy and irrigation fluid to a treatment site. In some embodiments, these systems and methods are configured to actively monitor characteristics (e.g., temperature, impedance, etc.) of the tissue and/or of the neuromodulation element(s) at the treatment site. The systems and methods can use this diagnostic information to monitor treatment progress and/or to adjust (i) characteristics (e.g., type, power level, duration, frequency, etc.) of neuromodulation energy applied to the treatment site in relation to a control algorithm of the neuromodulation procedure and/or (ii) characteristics (e.g., volume, temperature, type, duration, rate, etc.) of the irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment site. Accordingly, systems configured in accordance with the present technology are expected to achieve greater control of lesion characteristics during the neuromodulation procedure and to improve the likelihood that the neuromodulation procedure will be successful, especially in blood vessels with impaired and/or low blood flow. For example, systems and methods in accordance with embodiments of the present technology are expected to achieve greater lesion depth without the adverse effects noticed in patients after use of conventional systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Specific details of several embodiments of the present technology are described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b></figref>.

The control algorithm <b>150</b> may be executed on a processor (not shown) of the system <b>100</b>. One or more sensors (e.g., pressure, temperature, impedance, flow, chemical, ultrasound, electromagnetic, etc.) of the treatment assembly <b>120</b> and/or of the treatment device <b>110</b> can generate diagnostic information/measurements regarding patient tissue at the treatment site and/or regarding components of the treatment assembly <b>120</b>. The diagnostic information can be used as feedback for the control algorithm <b>150</b> and can allow the system <b>100</b> to adjust the control algorithm <b>150</b> (e.g., based on a comparison of the diagnostic information to predetermined parameter profile ranges). In particular, the system <b>100</b> can adjust characteristics (e.g., type, power level, duration, frequency, etc.) of neuromodulation energy delivered to the neuromodulation element(s) <b>126</b> and/or characteristics (e.g., volume, temperature, type, rate, duration, etc.) of irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment assembly <b>120</b>.

For example, the console <b>102</b> may include a user interface that can receive user input and/or provide the diagnostic information to the user. The feedback from the diagnostic information can allow a clinician to determine the effectiveness of the applied energy during the treatment and/or shortly thereafter (e.g., while the patient is still catheterized). Likewise, while the patient is still catheterized, a clinician may decide to repeat, pause, and/or terminate treatment based on feedback from the diagnostic information (e.g., to avoid tissue damage). Accordingly, this feedback may be useful in helping the clinician increase the likelihood of success of the current or subsequent treatments and/or avoid adverse effects of the treatment(s).

Control of Applied Energy and Irrigation Characteristics</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed above, neuromodulation systems (e.g., the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology can be configured to deliver coordinated neuromodulation energy (e.g., RF energy) and irrigation fluid to a treatment assembly of a treatment device in accordance with an automated control algorithm <b>150</b> and/or under the control of a clinician. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows one embodiment of an automated control algorithm <b>150</b> that may be implemented by a controller <b>106</b> (e.g., the controller <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when a clinician initiates treatment, the control algorithm <b>150</b> can include instructions that cause a console (e.g., the console <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to gradually adjust the power of energy applied to a treatment site to a first power level P<sub>1 </sub>(e.g., 5 watts) over a first time period t<sub>1 </sub>(e.g., 15 seconds). The power can increase generally linearly during the first time period. As a result, the console can increase its power output at a generally constant rate of P<sub>1</sub>/t<sub>1</sub>. Alternatively, the power may increase non-linearly (e.g., exponential or parabolic) with a variable rate of increase.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally or alternatively, the control algorithm <b>150</b> can include instructions that coordinate delivery of irrigation fluid to the treatment site before, during, and/or after neuromodulation energy is applied to the treatment site, adjusted, and/or modified. For example, the control algorithm <b>150</b> can include instructions that direct the system (e.g., a console and/or an irrigation pump) to deliver irrigation fluid with characteristics corresponding to the increase in power to the first power level P<sub>1</sub>. In some embodiments, the instructions can direct the system to deliver a specific type (e.g., saline, distilled water, etc.) and/or volume of irrigation fluid to the treatment site. In these and other embodiments, the instructions can direct the system to (i) deliver irrigation fluid at a specified temperature (e.g., room temperature, body temperature, or another temperature above or below room temperature), (ii) deliver irrigation fluid at a specified flow rate, and/or (ii) deliver irrigation fluid for a specified duration. In these and still other embodiments, instructions can direct the system to adjust (e.g., increase, decrease, change, and/or terminate) any of these irrigation fluid characteristics as the power is adjusted (e.g., increased, decreased, and/or held constant). In still other embodiments, the control algorithm <b>150</b> can include instructions to refrain from delivering irrigation fluid until a specified power level is reached, a specified electrode temperature is reached, and/or for a specified period of time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once P<sub>1 </sub>and t<sub>1 </sub>are achieved, the control algorithm <b>150</b> may hold at P<sub>1 </sub>until a new time t<sub>2 </sub>for a predetermined period of time t<sub>2</sub>&#x2212;t<sub>1 </sub>(e.g., 3 seconds). The control algorithm <b>150</b> may similarly hold the irrigation fluid characteristics constant until t<sub>2 </sub>and/or may adjust the irrigation fluid characteristics (e.g., based on monitored parameters of the tissue at the treatment site and/or of components of the treatment device, as described in greater detail below). At t<sub>2</sub>, power is increased by a predetermined increment (e.g., 1 watt) to P<sub>2 </sub>over a predetermined period of time, t<sub>3</sub>&#x2212;t<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., 1 second). The control algorithm <b>150</b> can include instructions directing the system to adjust irrigation fluid characteristics in accordance with this power increase. The power ramp in predetermined increments of about 1 watt over predetermined periods of time may continue until a maximum power P<sub>MAX </sub>is achieved or some other condition is satisfied (e.g., a maximum irrigation flow rate/volume and/or a minimum irrigation fluid temperature is reached). Optionally, the power may be maintained at the maximum power P<sub>MAX </sub>for a desired period of time or up to the desired total treatment time (e.g., up to about 120 seconds). In these and other embodiments, the controller can continually change the irrigation fluid characteristics based on, for example, (i) monitored parameters of the tissue at the treatment site and/or of the components of the treatment device and/or (ii) the progress of the neuromodulation procedure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore and before, during, and/or after the neuromodulation procedure, the controller can monitor (e.g., using one or more sensors of the treatment assembly) one or more parameters corresponding to tissue at the treatment site, to the patient, to the irrigation fluid, and/or to components (e.g., neuromodulation elements) of a treatment device. For example, the controller can continuously or periodically monitor temperature, time, impedance, power, flow velocity, volumetric flow rate, blood pressure, heart rate, parameters of return energy, and/or other parameters. The controller can use diagnostic information/measurements of the parameters as feedback regarding the progress of the neuromodulation procedure, the state (e.g., temperature) of treatment device components, and/or of the condition of the tissue at the treatment site. In some embodiments, the controller (i) can check the monitored parameters against predetermined parameter profiles to determine whether the parameters individually or in combination fall within the ranges set by the predetermined parameter profiles, and (ii) can accordingly coordinate and/or adjust characteristics of the neuromodulation energy and/or of irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment site. For example, the controller can check whether the monitored parameters fall within ranges set by the predetermined parameter profiles given certain neuromodulation energy characteristics and/or irrigation fluid characteristics. If the monitored parameters fall within the ranges, then treatment may continue in accordance with the control algorithm <b>150</b>. If the monitored parameters fall outside the ranges, however, the controller can adjust the control algorithm <b>150</b> accordingly.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, if temperature measurements relating to the tissue at the treatment site and/or to components (e.g., the neuromodulation elements) of the treatment device are too high for a currently applied power level, the controller can adjust and/or modify the control algorithm <b>150</b> (e.g., until the parameters are within the parameter profile range(s)). In some embodiments, the controller can decrease, pause, and/or terminate the applied power; can lengthen or shorten t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>, etc. of the control algorithm <b>150</b>; and/or can modify the duty cycle, frequency, or other parameters of the control algorithm <b>150</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the controller can change characteristics of the irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment site. For example, the controller can increase and/or decrease the flow rate of, the volume of, and/or the temperature of the irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment site. In these and other embodiments, the controller can change the type of irrigation fluid released at the treatment site and/or the duration for which irrigation fluid is applied to the treatment site. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the controller can adjust (e.g., increase, decrease, alter, adjust, and/or otherwise change) or hold constant the control algorithm <b>150</b> in response to other events noted by the control algorithm <b>150</b>. For example, the controller can appropriately adjust the control algorithm <b>150</b> in response to (i) one or more parameters outside of (e.g., above and/or below) predetermined parameter profile range(s); and/or (ii) a sudden, unexpected, and/or undesired change in measured parameters/characteristics of the tissue and/or of the components of the treatment device (e.g., even when the parameters/characteristics fall within the parameter profile range(s)). The system may also be equipped with various audible and visual alarms to allow the controller to alert the operator of certain conditions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the system can include one or more safety thresholds that prevent the controller from adjusting characteristics of the energy and/or of the irrigation fluid above and/or below the thresholds. For example, while the neuromodulation energy is applied at or above a specified power level and/or for longer than a specified duration, the system can prevent the controller from (i) decreasing the flow rate below a specified threshold and/or (ii) increasing the temperature of the irrigation fluid above a specified threshold. In other embodiments, to prevent the system (e.g., one or more sensors on neuromodulation elements of the treatment device) from reporting an inaccurate (e.g., temperature) measurement regarding components of the treatment device and/or the tissue at the treatment site, the system can prevent the controller from (i) increasing the flow rate of the irrigation fluid above a specified threshold and/or (ii) decreasing the temperature of the irrigation fluid below a specified threshold. In still other embodiments, the system can prevent the controller from increasing the power level of the neuromodulation energy above a specified threshold (e.g., when the maximum flow rate and/or volume of irrigation fluid supplied to the treatment site is reached and/or when the minimum temperature of irrigation fluid is reached).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this manner, the controller can deliver coordinated neuromodulation energy and irrigation fluid to the treatment site. As a result, the controller can hold the temperature of the neuromodulation elements constant and/or within a desired range through controlled and/or continued use of irrigation fluid having desired characteristics. This permits the neuromodulation system to achieve greater lesion depths by increasing the power of the neuromodulation energy applied to the blood vessel without coagulation of blood or charring of the vessel tissue associated with elevated electrodes temperatures during therapy. The maximum power that can safely be delivered to the patient during therapy is therefore increased. In particular, neuromodulation systems configured in accordance with the present technology permit power to be safely increased until a maximum power level of the energy generator is achieved, until a maximum irrigation flow rate/volume is achieved, until a minimum irrigation fluid temperature is achieved, and/or until the system otherwise prevents the controller from increasing the power further (e.g., in accordance with preset safety thresholds). In some embodiments, the maximum irrigation flow rate and/or volume can be determined by (i) irrigation pump capacity; (ii) a patient's blood dilution limit (ensuring adequate blood supply to an end-organ); (iii) safety factors determined from pre-clinical models, general human anatomical knowledge, specific patient anatomy, and/or ablation location; and/or (v) achievement of specific lesion depth. In addition, because irrigation fluid is applied in a controlled manner (e.g., only when needed, with desired characteristics, and/or at flow rates typically less than conventional irrigated systems) throughout the neuromodulation procedure, diagnostic information reported to the controller regarding the progress of the neuromodulation procedure, the condition of the tissue at the treatment site, and/or the condition of components of the treatment device remain meaningful and accurate. As a result, the neuromodulation system of the present technology is better able to avoid tissue damage and adverse effect of neuromodulation treatment typically noted after use of conventional neuromodulation systems.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a routine <b>670</b> directed to a method of treating a patient configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. The routine <b>670</b> can be performed by, for example, various components of the neuromodulation system (e.g., a console, a controller, a control algorithm, an irrigation pump, and/or a treatment device) and/or a clinician operating the neuromodulation system. The routine <b>670</b> can begin at block <b>671</b> by positioning a treatment assembly of a treatment device intravascularly (e.g., within a renal artery) or within another suitable body lumen (e.g., within a ureter) within a patient.

At block <b>673</b>, the routine <b>670</b> can additionally or alternatively include delivering irrigation fluid having desired characteristics via irrigation outlets in the treatment assembly. Delivery of the irrigation fluid can be controlled, for example, in accordance with the control algorithm. For example, the routine <b>670</b> can (i) deliver neuromodulation energy at a first power level after and/or over a first period of time and/or (ii) deliver a first type of irrigation fluid with desired characteristics (e.g., at a first volume, temperature, and/or flow rate) corresponding to the ramp in power. In some embodiments, the routine <b>670</b> can deliver irrigation fluid having specified characteristics to hold the temperature of neuromodulation elements on the treatment assembly within a desired temperature range. In these and other embodiments, the routine <b>670</b> can refrain from delivering irrigation fluid to the treatment site until the neuromodulation energy reaches a specified power level and/or until the neuromodulation elements and/or tissue at the treatment site reach a specified temperature.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the routine <b>670</b> can continue to increase the power of the neuromodulation energy and/or to modify the characteristics of the irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment site in accordance with the control algorithm. For example, the routine <b>670</b> can increase the power of the neuromodulation energy to a second power level (e.g., after a second period of time) and apply the neuromodulation energy to tissue at the treatment site at the second power level (block <b>672</b>). Additionally, the routine <b>670</b> can adjust and/or modify the characteristics of the irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment site in accordance with this power increase. For example, the routine <b>670</b> can increase the volume and/or flow rate of irrigation fluid delivered to the treatment site as the power of the neuromodulation energy is increased (block <b>673</b>). In these and other embodiments, the routine <b>670</b> can decrease the temperature at which the irrigation fluid is supplied to the treatment site and/or can alter the type of irrigation fluid supplied to the treatment site (block <b>673</b>). In other embodiments, the routine <b>670</b> (i) can keep the irrigation fluid characteristics constant, (ii) stop delivery of irrigation fluid to the treatment site, and/or (iii) wait to adjust and/or modify the characteristics of the irrigation fluid supplied to the treatment site until the second power level is reached and/or until the neuromodulation elements reach a specified temperature (block <b>673</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the routine <b>670</b> can continue to deliver neuromodulation energy and/or irrigation fluid in accordance with the control algorithm until a maximum power value and/or other safety thresholds of the neuromodulation system is/are reached (blocks <b>672</b> and <b>673</b>). At this point, the routine <b>670</b> can prevent an increase in power if a maximum volume and/or flow rate of irrigation fluid is reached. Additionally or alternatively, the routine <b>670</b> can prevent an increase in power if a minimum temperature of irrigation fluid is reached and/or a maximum temperature of the neuromodulation elements is reached.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At any point before, during, and/or after positioning and/or deploying the treatment assembly, the routine <b>670</b> can monitor (e.g., continuously and/or simultaneously) one or more parameters relating to the patient and/or to components (e.g., neuromodulation elements and/or electrodes) of the neuromodulation system (block <b>674</b>). For example, the routine <b>670</b> can use one or more sensors located on or near neuromodulation elements of the treatment device to measure the temperature, impedance, duration, power, flow velocity, volumetric flow rate, blood pressure, heart rate, parameters of return energy, and/or other parameters of the tissue at the treatment site, of the patient, of the irrigation fluid, and/or of the neuromodulation elements of the treatment device. The routine <b>670</b> can use this diagnostic information as feedback regarding the progress of a neuromodulation procedure (e.g., the size and/or depth of a lesion formed during treatment), the condition of the tissue at the treatment site, and/or the condition of components of the neuromodulation system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the routine <b>670</b> can determine whether to adjust and/or modify one or more characteristics of the neuromodulation energy applied to the treatment site and/or of the irrigation fluid supplied to the treatment site, respectively, based at least in part on the diagnostic information.

If specific parameters and/or a predetermined number of parameters fall within the parameter profile ranges, the routine <b>670</b> can continue to apply neuromodulation energy and/or irrigation fluid in accordance with the control algorithm (blocks <b>672</b> and/or <b>673</b>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the other hand, if one or more of the parameters fall outside (e.g., above and/or below) the predetermined parameter profile ranges, the routine <b>670</b> can decide to adjust and/or modify one or more characteristics of the neuromodulation energy (block <b>675</b>) and/or of the irrigation fluid (block <b>676</b>) applied to the treatment site. For example, if the routine <b>670</b> determines the temperature of the tissue at the treatment site and/or of the neuromodulation elements is above the predetermined temperature profile range (e.g., given the current energy characteristics, the current stage in the neuromodulation procedure, the current irrigation fluid characteristics, and/or safety threshold(s)), the routine <b>670</b> can alter and/or modify the control algorithm to alter and/or modify the power level of the neuromodulation energy (block <b>675</b>).

For example, one or more sensors of the neuromodulation system can monitor parameters of the neuromodulation system and/or of the patient before energy and/or irrigation fluid is delivered to the treatment site. In other embodiments, irrigation fluid can be applied to the treatment site before neuromodulation energy is applied to the treatment site and/or adjusted.

The neuromodulation device <b>110</b> provides access to the renal plexus RP through an intravascular path P, such as a percutaneous access site in the femoral (illustrated), brachial, radial, or axillary artery to a targeted treatment site within a respective renal artery RA. By manipulating the proximal portion <b>114</b> of the elongated shaft <b>112</b> from outside the intravascular path P, a clinician may advance the elongated shaft <b>112</b> through the sometimes tortuous intravascular path P and remotely manipulate the distal portion <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the elongated shaft <b>112</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b> is delivered intravascularly to the treatment site using a guidewire <b>715</b> in an OTW technique. At the treatment site, the guidewire <b>715</b> can be at least partially withdrawn or removed, and the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b> can transform or otherwise be moved to a deployed arrangement for recording neural activity and/or delivering energy at the treatment site. In other embodiments, the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b> may be delivered to the treatment site within a guide sheath (not shown) with or without using the guidewire <b>715</b>. When the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b> is at the treatment site, the guide sheath may be at least partially withdrawn or retracted and the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b> can be transformed into the deployed arrangement. In other embodiments, the elongated shaft <b>112</b> may be steerable itself such that the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b> may be delivered to the treatment site without the aid of the guidewire <b>715</b> and/or the guide sheath.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Image guidance, e.g., computed tomography (CT), fluoroscopy, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), or another suitable guidance modality, or combinations thereof, may be used to aid the clinician's positioning and manipulation of the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b>. For example, a fluoroscopy system (e.g., including a flat-panel detector, x-ray, or c-arm) can be rotated to accurately visualize and identify the target treatment site. In other embodiments, the treatment site can be determined using IVUS, OCT, and/or other suitable image mapping modalities that can correlate the target treatment site with an identifiable anatomical structure (e.g., a spinal feature) and/or a radiopaque ruler (e.g., positioned under or on the patient) before delivering the neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b>. Further, in some embodiments, image guidance components (e.g., IVUS, OCT) may be integrated with the neuromodulation device <b>110</b> and/or run in parallel with the neuromodulation device <b>110</b> to provide image guidance during positioning of neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b>. For example, image guidance components (e.g., IVUS or OCT) can be coupled to neuromodulation assembly <b>120</b> to provide three-dimensional images of the vasculature proximate the treatment site to facilitate positioning or deploying the multi-electrode assembly within the target renal vascular structure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Energy from the neuromodulation elements <b>126</b> may then be applied to target tissue to induce one or more desired neuromodulating effects on localized regions of the renal artery RA and adjacent regions of the renal plexus RP, which lay intimately within, adjacent to, or in close proximity to the adventitia of the renal artery RA. The purposeful application of the energy may achieve neuromodulation along all or at least a portion of the renal plexus RP. The neuromodulating effects are generally a function of, at least in part, power, time, contact between the energy delivery elements and the vessel wall, and blood flow through the vessel. The neuromodulating effects may include denervation, thermal ablation, and/or non-ablative thermal alteration or damage (e.g., via sustained heating and/or resistive heating). Desired thermal heating effects may include raising the temperature of target neural fibers above a desired threshold to achieve non-ablative thermal alteration, or above a higher temperature to achieve ablative thermal alteration. For example, the target temperature may be above body temperature (e.g., approximately 37&#xb0; C.) but less than about 45&#xb0; C. for non-ablative thermal alteration, or the target temperature may be about 45&#xb0; C. or higher for the ablative thermal alteration. Desired non-thermal neuromodulation effects may include altering the electrical signals transmitted in a nerve.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Hypothermic effects may also provide neuromodulation. For example, a cryotherapeutic applicator may be used to cool tissue at a treatment site to provide therapeutically-effective direct cell injury (e.g., necrosis), vascular injury (e.g., starving the cell from nutrients by damaging supplying blood vessels), and sublethal hypothermia with subsequent apoptosis. Exposure to cryotherapeutic cooling can cause acute cell death (e.g., immediately after exposure) and/or delayed cell death (e.g., during tissue thawing and subsequent hyperperfusion). Embodiments of the present technology can include cooling a structure at or near an inner surface of a renal artery wall such that proximate (e.g., adjacent) tissue is effectively cooled to a depth where sympathetic renal nerves reside. For example, the cooling structure is cooled to the extent that it causes therapeutically effective, cryogenic renal-nerve modulation. Sufficiently cooling at least a portion of a sympathetic renal nerve is expected to slow or potentially block conduction of neural signals to produce a prolonged or permanent reduction in renal sympathetic activity.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">D. Renal Neuromodulation</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Renal neuromodulation is the partial or complete incapacitation or other effective disruption of nerves of the kidneys (e.g., nerves terminating in the kidneys or in structures closely associated with the kidneys). In particular, renal neuromodulation can include inhibiting, reducing, and/or blocking neural communication along neural fibers (e.g., efferent and/or afferent neural fibers) of the kidneys. Such incapacitation can be long-term (e.g., permanent or for periods of months, years, or decades) or short-term (e.g., for periods of minutes, hours, days, or weeks). Renal neuromodulation is expected to contribute to the systemic reduction of sympathetic tone or drive and/or to benefit at least some specific organs and/or other bodily structures innervated by sympathetic nerves. Accordingly, renal neuromodulation is expected to be useful in treating clinical conditions associated with systemic sympathetic over activity or hyperactivity, particularly conditions associated with central sympathetic overstimulation. For example, renal neuromodulation is expected to efficaciously treat hypertension, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic and end stage renal disease, inappropriate fluid retention in heart failure, cardio-renal syndrome, polycystic kidney disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, osteoporosis, erectile dysfunction, and sudden death, among other conditions.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Renal neuromodulation can be electrically-induced, thermally-induced, chemically-induced, or induced in another suitable manner or combination of manners at one or more suitable treatment sites during a treatment procedure. The treatment site can be within or otherwise proximate to a renal lumen (e.g., a renal artery, a ureter, a renal pelvis, a major renal calyx, a minor renal calyx, or another suitable structure), and the treated tissue can include tissue at least proximate to a wall of the renal lumen. For example, with regard to a renal artery, a treatment procedure can include modulating nerves in the renal plexus, which lay intimately within or adjacent to the adventitia of the renal artery.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Renal neuromodulation can include a cryotherapeutic treatment modality alone or in combination with another treatment modality. Cryotherapeutic treatment can include cooling tissue at a treatment site in a manner that modulates neural function. For example, sufficiently cooling at least a portion of a sympathetic renal nerve can slow or potentially block conduction of neural signals to produce a prolonged or permanent reduction in renal sympathetic activity. This effect can occur as a result of cryotherapeutic tissue damage, which can include, for example, direct cell injury (e.g., necrosis), vascular or luminal injury (e.g., starving cells from nutrients by damaging supplying blood vessels), and/or sublethal hypothermia with subsequent apoptosis. Exposure to cryotherapeutic cooling can cause acute cell death (e.g., immediately after exposure) and/or delayed cell death (e.g., during tissue thawing and subsequent hyperperfusion). Neuromodulation using a cryotherapeutic treatment in accordance with embodiments of the present technology can include cooling a structure proximate an inner surface of a body lumen wall such that tissue is effectively cooled to a depth where sympathetic renal nerves reside. For example, in some embodiments, a cooling assembly of a cryotherapeutic device can be cooled to the extent that it causes therapeutically-effective, cryogenic renal neuromodulation. In other embodiments, a cryotherapeutic treatment modality can include cooling that is not configured to cause neuromodulation. For example, the cooling can be at or above cryogenic temperatures and can be used to control neuromodulation via another treatment modality (e.g., to protect tissue from neuromodulating energy).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Renal neuromodulation can include an electrode-based or transducer-based treatment modality alone or in combination with another treatment modality. Electrode-based or transducer-based treatment can include delivering electricity and/or another form of energy to tissue at a treatment location to stimulate and/or heat the tissue in a manner that modulates neural function. For example, sufficiently stimulating and/or heating at least a portion of a sympathetic renal nerve can slow or potentially block conduction of neural signals to produce a prolonged or permanent reduction in renal sympathetic activity. A variety of suitable types of energy can be used to stimulate and/or heat tissue at a treatment location. For example, neuromodulation in accordance with embodiments of the present technology can include delivering RF energy, pulsed energy, microwave energy, optical energy, focused ultrasound energy (e.g., high-intensity focused ultrasound energy), or another suitable type of energy alone or in combination. An electrode or transducer used to deliver this energy can be used alone or with other electrodes or transducers in a multi-electrode or multi-transducer array. Furthermore, the energy can be applied from within the body (e.g., within the vasculature or other body lumens in a catheter-based approach) and/or from outside the body (e.g., via an applicator positioned outside the body). Furthermore, energy can be used to reduce damage to non-targeted tissue when targeted tissue adjacent to the non-targeted tissue is subjected to neuromodulating cooling.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Neuromodulation using focused ultrasound energy (e.g., high-intensity focused ultrasound energy) can be beneficial relative to neuromodulation using other treatment modalities. Focused ultrasound is an example of a transducer-based treatment modality that can be delivered from outside the body. Focused ultrasound treatment can be performed in close association with imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance, computed tomography, fluoroscopy, ultrasound (e.g., intravascular), optical coherence tomography, or another suitable imaging modality). For example, imaging can be used to identify an anatomical position of a treatment location (e.g., as a set of coordinates relative to a reference point). The coordinates can then entered into a focused ultrasound device configured to change the power, angle, phase, or other suitable parameters to generate an ultrasound focal zone at the location corresponding to the coordinates. The focal zone can be small enough to localize therapeutically-effective heating at the treatment location while partially or fully avoiding potentially harmful disruption of nearby structures. To generate the focal zone, the ultrasound device can be configured to pass ultrasound energy through a lens, and/or the ultrasound energy can be generated by a curved transducer or by multiple transducers in a phased array (curved or straight).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Heating effects of electrode-based or transducer-based treatment can include ablation and/or non-ablative alteration or damage (e.g., via sustained heating and/or resistive heating). For example, a treatment procedure can include raising the temperature of target neural fibers to a target temperature above a first threshold to achieve non-ablative alteration, or above a second, higher threshold to achieve ablation. The target temperature can be higher than about body temperature (e.g., about 37&#xb0; C.) but less than about 45&#xb0; C. for non-ablative alteration, and the target temperature can be higher than about 45&#xb0; C. for ablation. Heating tissue to a temperature between about body temperature and about 45&#xb0; C. can induce non-ablative alteration, for example, via moderate heating of target neural fibers or of vascular or luminal structures that perfuse the target neural fibers. In cases where vascular structures are affected, the target neural fibers can be denied perfusion resulting in necrosis of the neural tissue. Heating tissue to a target temperature higher than about 45&#xb0; C. (e.g., higher than about 60&#xb0; C.) can induce ablation, for example, via substantial heating of target neural fibers or of vascular or luminal structures that perfuse the target fibers. In some patients, it can be desirable to heat tissue to temperatures that are sufficient to ablate the target neural fibers or the vascular or luminal structures, but that are less than about 90&#xb0; C. (e.g., less than about 85&#xb0; C., less than about 80&#xb0; C., or less than about 75&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Renal neuromodulation can include a chemical-based treatment modality alone or in combination with another treatment modality. Neuromodulation using chemical-based treatment can include delivering one or more chemicals (e.g., drugs or other agents) to tissue at a treatment location in a manner that modulates neural function. The chemical, for example, can be selected to affect the treatment location generally or to selectively affect some structures at the treatment location over other structures. The chemical, for example, can be guanethidine, ethanol, phenol, a neurotoxin, or another suitable agent selected to alter, damage, or disrupt nerves. A variety of suitable techniques can be used to deliver chemicals to tissue at a treatment location. For example, chemicals can be delivered via one or more needles originating outside the body or within the vasculature or other body lumens. In an intravascular example, a catheter can be used to intravascularly position a therapeutic element including a plurality of needles (e.g., micro-needles) that can be retracted or otherwise blocked prior to deployment. In other embodiments, a chemical can be introduced into tissue at a treatment location via simple diffusion through a body lumen wall, electrophoresis, or another suitable mechanism. Similar techniques can be used to introduce chemicals that are not configured to cause neuromodulation, but rather to facilitate neuromodulation via another treatment modality.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">E. Related Anatomy and Physiology</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As noted previously, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a branch of the autonomic nervous system along with the enteric nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. It is always active at a basal level (called sympathetic tone) and becomes more active during times of stress. Like other parts of the nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system operates through a series of interconnected neurons. Sympathetic neurons are frequently considered part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), although many lie within the central nervous system (CNS). Sympathetic neurons of the spinal cord (which is part of the CNS) communicate with peripheral sympathetic neurons via a series of sympathetic ganglia. Within the ganglia, spinal cord sympathetic neurons join peripheral sympathetic neurons through synapses. Spinal cord sympathetic neurons are therefore called presynaptic (or preganglionic) neurons, while peripheral sympathetic neurons are called postsynaptic (or postganglionic) neurons.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">At synapses within the sympathetic ganglia, preganglionic sympathetic neurons release acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that binds and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons. In response to this stimulus, postganglionic neurons principally release noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Prolonged activation may elicit the release of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Once released, norepinephrine and epinephrine bind adrenergic receptors on peripheral tissues. Binding to adrenergic receptors causes a neuronal and hormonal response. The physiologic manifestations include pupil dilation, increased heart rate, occasional vomiting, and increased blood pressure. Increased sweating is also seen due to binding of cholinergic receptors of the sweat glands.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for up- and down-regulating many homeostatic mechanisms in living organisms. Fibers from the SNS innervate tissues in almost every organ system, providing at least some regulatory function to physiological features as diverse as pupil diameter, gut motility, and urinary output. This response is also known as sympatho-adrenal response of the body, as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla (but also all other sympathetic fibers) secrete acetylcholine, which activates the secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) and to a lesser extent noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Therefore, this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Science typically looks at the SNS as an automatic regulation system, that is, one that operates without the intervention of conscious thought. Some evolutionary theorists suggest that the sympathetic nervous system operated in early organisms to maintain survival as the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for priming the body for action. One example of this priming is in the moments before waking, in which sympathetic outflow spontaneously increases in preparation for action.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">1. The Sympathetic Chain</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the SNS provides a network of nerves that allows the brain to communicate with the body. Sympathetic nerves originate inside the vertebral column, toward the middle of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral cell column (or lateral horn), beginning at the first thoracic segment of the spinal cord and are thought to extend to the second or third lumbar segments. Because its cells begin in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, the SNS is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow. Axons of these nerves leave the spinal cord through the anterior rootlet/root. They pass near the spinal (sensory) ganglion, where they enter the anterior rami of the spinal nerves. However, unlike somatic innervation, they quickly separate out through white rami connectors which connect to either the paravertebral (which lie near the vertebral column) or prevertebral (which lie near the aortic bifurcation) ganglia extending alongside the spinal column.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In order to reach the target organs and glands, the axons should travel long distances in the body, and, to accomplish this, many axons relay their message to a second cell through synaptic transmission. The ends of the axons link across a space, the synapse, to the dendrites of the second cell. The first cell (the presynaptic cell) sends a neurotransmitter across the synaptic cleft where it activates the second cell (the postsynaptic cell). The message is then carried to the final destination.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the SNS and other components of the peripheral nervous system, these synapses are made at sites called ganglia, discussed above. The cell that sends its fiber is called a preganglionic cell, while the cell whose fiber leaves the ganglion is called a postganglionic cell. As mentioned previously, the preganglionic cells of the SNS are located between the first thoracic (T1) segment and third lumbar (L3) segments of the spinal cord. Postganglionic cells have their cell bodies in the ganglia and send their axons to target organs or glands.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The ganglia include not just the sympathetic trunks but also the cervical ganglia (superior, middle and inferior), which sends sympathetic nerve fibers to the head and thorax organs, and the celiac and mesenteric ganglia (which send sympathetic fibers to the gut).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">a. Innervation of the Kidneys</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows, the kidney is innervated by the renal plexus (RP), which is intimately associated with the renal artery. The renal plexus (RP) is an autonomic plexus that surrounds the renal artery and is embedded within the adventitia of the renal artery. The renal plexus (RP) extends along the renal artery until it arrives at the substance of the kidney. Fibers contributing to the renal plexus (RP) arise from the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, the aorticorenal ganglion and the aortic plexus. The renal plexus (RP), also referred to as the renal nerve, is predominantly comprised of sympathetic components. There is no (or at least very minimal) parasympathetic innervation of the kidney.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Preganglionic neuronal cell bodies are located in the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Preganglionic axons pass through the paravertebral ganglia (they do not synapse) to become the lesser splanchnic nerve, the least splanchnic nerve, first lumbar splanchnic nerve, second lumbar splanchnic nerve, and travel to the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the aorticorenal ganglion. Postganglionic neuronal cell bodies exit the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the aorticorenal ganglion to the renal plexus (RP) and are distributed to the renal vasculature.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">b. Renal Sympathetic Neural Activity</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Messages travel through the SNS in a bidirectional flow. Efferent messages may trigger changes in different parts of the body simultaneously. For example, the sympathetic nervous system may accelerate heart rate; widen bronchial passages; decrease motility (movement) of the large intestine; constrict blood vessels; increase peristalsis in the esophagus; cause pupil dilation, piloerection (goose bumps) and perspiration (sweating); and raise blood pressure. Afferent messages carry signals from various organs and sensory receptors in the body to other organs and, particularly, the brain.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Hypertension, heart failure and chronic kidney disease are a few of many disease states that result from chronic activation of the SNS, especially the renal sympathetic nervous system. Chronic activation of the SNS is a maladaptive response that drives the progression of these disease states. Pharmaceutical management of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been a longstanding, but somewhat ineffective, approach for reducing over-activity of the SNS.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As mentioned above, the renal sympathetic nervous system has been identified as a major contributor to the complex pathophysiology of hypertension, states of volume overload (such as heart failure), and progressive renal disease, both experimentally and in humans. Studies employing radiotracer dilution methodology to measure overflow of norepinephrine from the kidneys to plasma revealed increased renal norepinephrine (NE) spillover rates in patients with essential hypertension, particularly so in young hypertensive subjects, which in concert with increased NE spillover from the heart, is consistent with the hemodynamic profile typically seen in early hypertension and characterized by an increased heart rate, cardiac output, and renovascular resistance. It is now known that essential hypertension is commonly neurogenic, often accompanied by pronounced sympathetic nervous system overactivity.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Activation of cardiorenal sympathetic nerve activity is even more pronounced in heart failure, as demonstrated by an exaggerated increase of NE overflow from the heart and the kidneys to plasma in this patient group. In line with this notion is the recent demonstration of a strong negative predictive value of renal sympathetic activation on all-cause mortality and heart transplantation in patients with congestive heart failure, which is independent of overall sympathetic activity, glomerular filtration rate, and left ventricular ejection fraction. These findings support the notion that treatment regimens that are designed to reduce renal sympathetic stimulation have the potential to improve survival in patients with heart failure.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Both chronic and end stage renal disease are characterized by heightened sympathetic nervous activation. In patients with end stage renal disease, plasma levels of norepinephrine above the median have been demonstrated to be predictive for both all-cause death and death from cardiovascular disease. This is also true for patients suffering from diabetic or contrast nephropathy. There is compelling evidence suggesting that sensory afferent signals originating from the diseased kidneys are major contributors to initiating and sustaining elevated central sympathetic outflow in this patient group; this facilitates the occurrence of the well-known adverse consequences of chronic sympathetic over activity, such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">i. Renal Sympathetic Efferent Activity</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Sympathetic nerves to the kidneys terminate in the blood vessels, the juxtaglomerular apparatus and the renal tubules. Stimulation of the renal sympathetic nerves causes increased renin release, increased sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) reabsorption, and a reduction of renal blood flow. These components of the neural regulation of renal function are considerably stimulated in disease states characterized by heightened sympathetic tone and clearly contribute to the rise in blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The reduction of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate as a result of renal sympathetic efferent stimulation is likely a cornerstone of the loss of renal function in cardio-renal syndrome, which is renal dysfunction as a progressive complication of chronic heart failure, with a clinical course that typically fluctuates with the patient's clinical status and treatment. Pharmacologic strategies to thwart the consequences of renal efferent sympathetic stimulation include centrally acting sympatholytic drugs, beta blockers (intended to reduce renin release), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers (intended to block the action of angiotensin II and aldosterone activation consequent to renin release) and diuretics (intended to counter the renal sympathetic mediated sodium and water retention). However, the current pharmacologic strategies have significant limitations including limited efficacy, compliance issues, side effects and others.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">ii. Renal Sensory Afferent Nerve Activity</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The kidneys communicate with integral structures in the central nervous system via renal sensory afferent nerves. Several forms of &#x201c;renal injury&#x201d; may induce activation of sensory afferent signals. For example, renal ischemia, reduction in stroke volume or renal blood flow, or an abundance of adenosine enzyme may trigger activation of afferent neural communication. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, this afferent communication might be from the kidney to the brain or might be from one kidney to the other kidney (via the central nervous system). These afferent signals are centrally integrated and may result in increased sympathetic outflow. This sympathetic drive is directed towards the kidneys, thereby activating the RAAS and inducing increased renin secretion, sodium retention, volume retention and vasoconstriction. Central sympathetic over activity also impacts other organs and bodily structures innervated by sympathetic nerves such as the heart and the peripheral vasculature, resulting in the described adverse effects of sympathetic activation, several aspects of which also contribute to the rise in blood pressure.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The physiology therefore suggests that (i) modulation of tissue with efferent sympathetic nerves will reduce inappropriate renin release, salt retention, and reduction of renal blood flow, and that (ii) modulation of tissue with afferent sensory nerves will reduce the systemic contribution to hypertension and other disease states associated with increased central sympathetic tone through its direct effect on the posterior hypothalamus as well as the contralateral kidney. In addition to the central hypotensive effects of afferent renal denervation, a desirable reduction of central sympathetic outflow to various other sympathetically innervated organs such as the heart and the vasculature is anticipated.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">2. Additional Clinical Benefits of Renal Denervation</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As provided above, renal denervation is likely to be valuable in the treatment of several clinical conditions characterized by increased overall and particularly renal sympathetic activity such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic end stage renal disease, inappropriate fluid retention in heart failure, cardio-renal syndrome, and sudden death. Since the reduction of afferent neural signals contributes to the systemic reduction of sympathetic tone/drive, renal denervation might also be useful in treating other conditions associated with systemic sympathetic hyperactivity. Accordingly, renal denervation may also benefit other organs and bodily structures innervated by sympathetic nerves, including those identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. For example, as previously discussed, a reduction in central sympathetic drive may reduce the insulin resistance that afflicts people with metabolic syndrome and Type II diabetics. Additionally, patients with osteoporosis are also sympathetically activated and might also benefit from the down regulation of sympathetic drive that accompanies renal denervation.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">3. Achieving Intravascular Access to the Renal Artery</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In accordance with the present technology, neuromodulation of a left and/or right renal plexus (RP), which is intimately associated with a left and/or right renal artery, may be achieved through intravascular access. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows, blood moved by contractions of the heart is conveyed from the left ventricle of the heart by the aorta. The aorta descends through the thorax and branches into the left and right renal arteries. Below the renal arteries, the aorta bifurcates at the left and right iliac arteries. The left and right iliac arteries descend, respectively, through the left and right legs and join the left and right femoral arteries.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows, the blood collects in veins and returns to the heart, through the femoral veins into the iliac veins and into the inferior vena cava. The inferior vena cava branches into the left and right renal veins. Above the renal veins, the inferior vena cava ascends to convey blood into the right atrium of the heart. From the right atrium, the blood is pumped through the right ventricle into the lungs, where it is oxygenated. From the lungs, the oxygenated blood is conveyed into the left atrium. From the left atrium, the oxygenated blood is conveyed by the left ventricle back to the aorta.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As will be described in greater detail later, the femoral artery may be accessed and cannulated at the base of the femoral triangle just inferior to the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. A catheter may be inserted percutaneously into the femoral artery through this access site, passed through the iliac artery and aorta, and placed into either the left or right renal artery. This comprises an intravascular path that offers minimally invasive access to a respective renal artery and/or other renal blood vessels.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The wrist, upper arm, and shoulder region provide other locations for introduction of catheters into the arterial system. For example, catheterization of either the radial, brachial, or axillary artery may be utilized in select cases. Catheters introduced via these access points may be passed through the subclavian artery on the left side (or via the subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries on the right side), through the aortic arch, down the descending aorta and into the renal arteries using standard angiographic technique.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">4. Properties and Characteristics of the Renal Vasculature</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Since neuromodulation of a left and/or right renal plexus (RP) may be achieved in accordance with the present technology through intravascular access, properties and characteristics of the renal vasculature may impose constraints upon and/or inform the design of apparatus, systems, and methods for achieving such renal neuromodulation. Some of these properties and characteristics may vary across the patient population and/or within a specific patient across time, as well as in response to disease states, such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, vascular disease, end-stage renal disease, insulin resistance, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, etc. These properties and characteristics, as explained herein, may have bearing on the efficacy of the procedure and the specific design of the intravascular device. Properties of interest may include, for example, material/mechanical, spatial, fluid dynamic/hemodynamic and/or thermodynamic properties.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As discussed previously, a catheter may be advanced percutaneously into either the left or right renal artery via a minimally invasive intravascular path. However, minimally invasive renal arterial access may be challenging, for example, because as compared to some other arteries that are routinely accessed using catheters, the renal arteries are often extremely tortuous, may be of relatively small diameter, and/or may be of relatively short length. Furthermore, renal arterial atherosclerosis is common in many patients, particularly those with cardiovascular disease. Renal arterial anatomy also may vary significantly from patient to patient, which further complicates minimally invasive access. Significant inter-patient variation may be seen, for example, in relative tortuosity, diameter, length, and/or atherosclerotic plaque burden, as well as in the take-off angle at which a renal artery branches from the aorta. Apparatus, systems and methods for achieving renal neuromodulation via intravascular access should account for these and other aspects of renal arterial anatomy and its variation across the patient population when minimally invasively accessing a renal artery.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition to complicating renal arterial access, specifics of the renal anatomy also complicate establishment of stable contact between neuromodulatory apparatus and a luminal surface or wall of a renal artery. For example, navigation can be impeded by the tight space within a renal artery, as well as tortuosity of the artery. Furthermore, establishing consistent contact is complicated by patient movement, respiration, and/or the cardiac cycle because these factors may cause significant movement of the renal artery relative to the aorta, and the cardiac cycle may transiently distend the renal artery (i.e. cause the wall of the artery to pulse).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Even after accessing a renal artery and facilitating stable contact between neuromodulatory apparatus and a luminal surface of the artery, nerves in and around the adventia of the artery should be safely modulated via the neuromodulatory apparatus. Effectively applying thermal treatment from within a renal artery is non-trivial given the potential clinical complications associated with such treatment. For example, the intima and media of the renal artery are highly vulnerable to thermal injury. As discussed in greater detail below, the intima-media thickness separating the vessel lumen from its adventitia means that target renal nerves may be multiple millimeters distant from the luminal surface of the artery. Sufficient energy should be delivered to or heat removed from the target renal nerves to modulate the target renal nerves without excessively cooling or heating the vessel wall to the extent that the wall is frozen, desiccated, or otherwise potentially affected to an undesirable extent. A potential clinical complication associated with excessive heating is thrombus formation from coagulating blood flowing through the artery. Given that this thrombus may cause a kidney infarct, thereby causing irreversible damage to the kidney, thermal treatment from within the renal artery should be applied carefully. Accordingly, the complex fluid mechanics and thermodynamic conditions present in the renal artery during treatment, particularly those that may impact heat transfer dynamics at the treatment site, may be important in applying energy (e.g., heating thermal energy) and/or removing heat from the tissue (e.g., cooling thermal conditions) from within the renal artery.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The neuromodulatory apparatus should also be configured to allow for adjustable positioning and repositioning of the energy delivery element within the renal artery since location of treatment may also impact clinical efficacy. For example, it may be tempting to apply a full circumferential treatment from within the renal artery given that the renal nerves may be spaced circumferentially around a renal artery. In some situations, a full-circle lesion likely resulting from a continuous circumferential treatment may be potentially related to renal artery stenosis. Therefore, the formation of more complex lesions along a longitudinal dimension of the renal artery and/or repositioning of the neuromodulatory apparatus to multiple treatment locations may be desirable. It should be noted, however, that a benefit of creating a circumferential ablation may outweigh the potential of renal artery stenosis or the risk may be mitigated with certain embodiments or in certain patients and creating a circumferential ablation could be a goal. Additionally, variable positioning and repositioning of the neuromodulatory apparatus may prove to be useful in circumstances where the renal artery is particularly tortuous or where there are proximal branch vessels off the renal artery main vessel, making treatment in certain locations challenging. Manipulation of a device in a renal artery should also consider mechanical injury imposed by the device on the renal artery. Motion of a device in an artery, for example by inserting, manipulating, negotiating bends and so forth, may contribute to dissection, perforation, denuding intima, or disrupting the interior elastic lamina.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Blood flow through a renal artery may be temporarily occluded for a short time with minimal or no complications. However, occlusion for a significant amount of time should be avoided because to prevent injury to the kidney such as ischemia. It could be beneficial to avoid occlusion all together or, if occlusion is beneficial to the embodiment, to limit the duration of occlusion, for example to 2-5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Based on the above described challenges of (1) renal artery intervention, (2) consistent and stable placement of the treatment element against the vessel wall, (3) effective application of treatment across the vessel wall, (4) positioning and potentially repositioning the treatment apparatus to allow for multiple treatment locations, and (5) avoiding or limiting duration of blood flow occlusion, various independent and dependent properties of the renal vasculature that may be of interest include, for example, (a) vessel diameter, vessel length, intima-media thickness, coefficient of friction, and tortuosity; (b) distensibility, stiffness and modulus of elasticity of the vessel wall; (c) peak systolic, end-diastolic blood flow velocity, as well as the mean systolic-diastolic peak blood flow velocity, and mean/max volumetric blood flow rate; (d) specific heat capacity of blood and/or of the vessel wall, thermal conductivity of blood and/or of the vessel wall, and/or thermal convectivity of blood flow past a vessel wall treatment site and/or radiative heat transfer; (e) renal artery motion relative to the aorta induced by respiration, patient movement, and/or blood flow pulsatility; and (f) the take-off angle of a renal artery relative to the aorta. These properties will be discussed in greater detail with respect to the renal arteries. However, dependent on the apparatus, systems and methods utilized to achieve renal neuromodulation, such properties of the renal arteries, also may guide and/or constrain design characteristics.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As noted above, an apparatus positioned within a renal artery should conform to the geometry of the artery. Renal artery vessel diameter, D<sub>RA</sub>, typically is in a range of about 2-10 mm, with most of the patient population having a D<sub>RA </sub>of about 4 mm to about 8 mm and an average of about 6 mm. Renal artery vessel length, L<sub>RA</sub>, between its ostium at the aorta/renal artery juncture and its distal branchings, generally is in a range of about 5-70 mm, and a significant portion of the patient population is in a range of about 20-50 mm. Since the target renal plexus is embedded within the adventitia of the renal artery, the composite Intima-Media Thickness, IMT, (i.e., the radial outward distance from the artery's luminal surface to the adventitia containing target neural structures) also is notable and generally is in a range of about 0.5-2.5 mm, with an average of about 1.5 mm. Although a certain depth of treatment is important to reach the target neural fibers, the treatment should not be too deep (e.g., &#x3e;5 mm from inner wall of the renal artery) to avoid non-target tissue and anatomical structures such as the renal vein.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">An additional property of the renal artery that may be of interest is the degree of renal motion relative to the aorta induced by respiration and/or blood flow pulsatility. A patient's kidney, which is located at the distal end of the renal artery, may move as much as 4&#x2033; cranially with respiratory excursion. This may impart significant motion to the renal artery connecting the aorta and the kidney, thereby requiring from the neuromodulatory apparatus a unique balance of stiffness and flexibility to maintain contact between the energy delivery element and the vessel wall during cycles of respiration. Furthermore, the take-off angle between the renal artery and the aorta may vary significantly between patients, and also may vary dynamically within a patient, e.g., due to kidney motion. The take-off angle generally may be in a range of about 30&#xb0;-135&#xb0;.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">F.
