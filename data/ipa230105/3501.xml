ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The simplest known extensometers work on the principle of varying their own electrical resistance value as a function of their deformation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, there are also more complex types of extensometers based on piezoresistive or magnetostrictive properties, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7,913,569 B2 and EP 0329479 B1.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Extensometers of this kind are usually used to detect and measure the deformation of a structure. In particular, as illustrated by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, these extensometers <b>3</b> are coupled to the structure <b>5</b> of which the deformation is to be measured and have two cables <b>7</b> emerging from this structure <b>5</b>, to which cables the equipment <b>9</b> necessary for powering the extensometer has to be connected in order to be able to measure its resistance and consequently derive the deformation of the structure therefrom. This equipment <b>9</b> may be ohmmeters, for example.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This solution is particularly inconvenient and impractical.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In cases in which a deformation measurement is required at a plurality of points of a structure, for example in laboratory tests, flight tests and when monitoring the health of the structure (&#x201c;structural health monitoring&#x201d;), the use of a plurality of extensometers arranged at the various points of the structure is required. Each of these extensometers needs to be connected via two cables to equipment necessary for powering the extensometer in order to be able to measure its resistance and consequently derive the deformation of the structure therefrom. A complex and heavy set-up is therefore required to be able to measure the deformation of the structure at various points, since each time it will be necessary to move said equipment between the various extensometers and work will be required to connect said equipment to each extensometer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,115 A describes an apparatus for contactless interrogation of a sensor, U.S. Pat.

Nevertheless, the aforementioned problems of inconvenience and lack of practicality remain unresolved.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a system and a method for measuring a deformation of a structure arranged to be installed on an aircraft which allow the convenience and practicality of using systems for measuring a deformation of a structure of an aircraft to be improved.

The invention is able to assume other embodiments and to be implemented or constructed in practice in different ways. It should also be understood that the phraseology and terminology have a descriptive purpose and should not be construed as limiting. The use of &#x201c;include&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; and their variations are to be understood as encompassing the elements set out below and their equivalents, as well as additional elements and the equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a system <b>1</b> for measuring a deformation of a structure arranged to be installed on an aircraft comprises deformation sensor means <b>2</b> including two electrical connection terminals T. The deformation sensor means <b>2</b> are arranged to be associated with said structure and to assume an electrical resistance value between said electrical connection terminals T. The resistance value is indicative of the deformation of said structure. The electrical connection terminals T of the deformation sensor means <b>2</b> are short-circuited so as to recreate a closed circuit <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The system <b>1</b> for measuring a deformation of a structure arranged to be installed on an aircraft also comprises magnetic field excitation means <b>6</b> arranged to generate a magnetic field concatenated with this closed circuit <b>4</b>, so that an induced current i is generated in the closed circuit <b>4</b>. These magnetic field excitation means <b>6</b> include a laser generator arranged to emit a laser signal having amplitude that varies over time according to a frequency.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other words, the magnetic field excitation means <b>6</b> may be a system or a device or an apparatus for generating lasers.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, the system <b>1</b> for measuring a deformation of a structure arranged to be installed on an aircraft comprises electromagnetic radiation transmission means <b>8</b> included in the closed circuit <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">These electromagnetic radiation transmission means <b>8</b> include an antenna. In other words, the electromagnetic radiation transmission means <b>8</b> may be a circuit or a system or an apparatus for electromagnetic radiation transmission that includes an antenna or may directly be an antenna associated with the closed circuit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electromagnetic radiation transmission means <b>8</b> are arranged to emit an electromagnetic radiation <b>10</b> generated by the induced current i which flows in the closed circuit <b>4</b>. The value of the electromagnetic radiation is a function of the value of electrical resistance assumed by the deformation sensor means <b>2</b> that is indicative of the deformation of this structure. In particular, the value of the induced current i is inversely proportional to the value of the electrical resistance assumed by the deformation sensor means <b>2</b>, and the value of the magnetic radiation <b>10</b> is proportional to the value of the induced current i. The value of the magnetic radiation will therefore be linked to the value of the electrical resistance assumed by the deformation sensor means <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, the system <b>1</b> for measuring a deformation of a structure arranged to be installed on an aircraft comprises electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> arranged to receive the electromagnetic radiation <b>10</b> transmitted by the antenna of said electromagnetic radiation transmission means <b>8</b>, and control means <b>14</b> arranged to determine the deformation of the structure as a function of the value of electromagnetic radiation received by the electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> also include an antenna. In other words, the electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> may be a circuit or a system or an apparatus for receiving electromagnetic radiation that includes an antenna or may directly be an antenna.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By virtue of the antennas of the electromagnetic radiation receiving means and the electromagnetic radiation transmission means, the system advantageously also makes it possible to be able to measure deformation values without the need for the electromagnetic radiation transmission means <b>8</b> and the electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> of the system to be substantially in contact with one another.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The deformation sensor means <b>2</b> may preferably include at least one extensometer. In other words, the deformation sensor means <b>2</b> may be a circuit or a system or an apparatus including the extensometer or may directly be an extensometer sensor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The system for measuring a deformation of a structure arranged to be installed on an aircraft may clearly also include a plurality of said deformation sensor means <b>2</b> included in respective closed circuits <b>4</b>. Each closed circuit may clearly include respective electromagnetic radiation transmission means.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Advantageously, since the magnetic field excitation means <b>6</b> include a laser generator, it would be possible to induce all of the currents in the various closed circuits <b>4</b> present by means of this single laser generator.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other embodiments, the magnetic field excitation means <b>6</b> may preferably also include a magnetic induction coil arranged to generate a magnetic field having an amplitude which varies over time according to a frequency.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the laser signal generated by the laser generator or the magnetic field generated by the coil may have a sinusoidal curve. The fact that the laser signal or the magnetic field have a curve that varies over time is necessary so that an electromotive force is generated in the closed circuit and that an induced correct is consequently generated that flows in the closed circuit. This will also be clarified in the following part of the description by means of using formulae.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the magnetic field excitation means <b>6</b>, the electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> and the control means <b>14</b> may be remote with respect to said structure of the aircraft. In other words, the magnetic field excitation means <b>6</b>, the electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> and the control means <b>14</b> may not be installed on the structure, but instead may be comprised in devices external to the structure, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">By way of example, the electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> and the control means <b>14</b> being remote with respect to said structure of the aircraft is understood to mean, for example, the case in which the deformations of the structure are measured in laboratory tests, in which the structure is tested individually and is not installed on the aircraft, or the case in which the deformations of the structure are measured on the ground, when the structure is installed on a complete vehicle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In different embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation receiving means <b>12</b> may be installed remotely with respect to the structure but may be installed on the aircraft comprising this structure.
