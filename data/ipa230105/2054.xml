A typical commercial aircraft includes one or more lavatories within an internal cabin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Space within a commercial aircraft is limited. Notably, a lavatory within a commercial aircraft is typically relatively small. A larger lavatory would necessarily occupy more space within a commercial aircraft, and may prevent additional passenger seating within an internal cabin. Aircraft operators typically prefer to have additional passenger seating within an internal cabin, as the additional passenger seating leads to increased revenues.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Persons of reduced mobility (such as individuals having disabilities, injuries, or a reduced ability to move) who use wheelchairs may use a separate board to transfer from a wheelchair to a toilet. The board is typically a separate and distinct device. However, such a separate and distinct board may be lost. Further, individuals may opt not to use the board due to the extra steps of retrieving the board and positioning it between a wheelchair and a toilet, particularly within the confined space of a lavatory of an aircraft. Further, during use, a wheelchair may inadvertently move, thereby causing the board to shift or fall, which may cause discomfort or even injury to the individual.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As another example, aisle transfer seats having wheels can be used to transfer a person of reduced mobility from a passenger seating area to a lavatory. Typically, the individual transfers from a seat within the internal cabin to the aisle transfer seat, then maneuver down an aisle to a specially designed, large or convertible lavatory for persons of reduced mobility. Such specially designed and/or convertible lavatories are large in footprint to provide space within the lavatory to allow the person of reduced mobility sufficient room to maneuver and transfer off the aisle transfer seat to the toilet.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A need exists for a system and method for allowing individuals to independently more easily and efficiently use an existing lavatory, such as within an internal cabin of a commercial aircraft. Further, a need exists for a safe, readily accessible, consistent, independent, and easy-to-use system and method for transferring between different areas within a lavatory.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With those needs in mind, certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a system configured to transfer an individual between an area and a toilet within a lavatory. The system includes a base, one or more rollers coupled to the base, and a seating assembly coupled to the base. The seating assembly includes a backrest, a toilet overlay seat configured to be disposed over the toilet, and a seat cover that is movable between a covering position over the toilet overlay seat, and a lavatory use position in which the toilet overlay seat is exposed. A counterbalance is coupled to one or both of the base or the seating assembly. The counterbalance is moveable between a stowed position and a deployed position in relation to the toilet.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In at least one embodiment, the seating assembly is configured to move relative to the base. For example, the seating assembly is configured to rearwardly slide relative to the base over the toilet.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In at least one embodiment, the base includes lateral guide rails that slidably retain one or more portions of the seating assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In at least one embodiment, the system also includes a handle operatively coupled to the counterbalance. The handle is configured to be engaged to move the counterbalance between the stowed position and the deployed position.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a further example, the handle couples to the counterbalance through a ratchet mechanism. In a further example, the handle includes a release button operatively coupled to the ratchet mechanism, and configured to release the ratchet mechanism from a locked position.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In at least one embodiment, the system also includes a latch configured to be selectively engaged to selectively lock and unlock the seating assembly in translated positions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As an example, the counterbalance includes a first extension beam connected to a second connection beam by a cross beam.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In at least one embodiment, at least a portion of the base is configured to magnetically couple to a portion of the lavatory.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In at least one embodiment, the base includes one or more suction cups configured to secure the transfer system in position within the lavatory.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for transferring an individual between an area and a toilet within a lavatory. The method includes coupling a counterbalance to one or both of a base or a seating assembly, wherein the seating assembly is coupled to the base, wherein the seating assembly comprises a backrest, a toilet overlay seat configured to be disposed over the toilet, and a seat cover that is movable between a covering position over the toilet overlay seat, and a lavatory use position in which the toilet overlay seat is exposed; and moving the counterbalance between a stowed position and a deployed position in relation to the toilet.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective front view of an aircraft, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective internal view of a lavatory, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a perspective top view of a transfer system configured to transfer an individual over a toilet, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a perspective top view of the transfer system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> having a seat cover in a lavatory use position.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a counterbalance, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a counterbalance, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a perspective interior view of the lavatory having the transfer system away from the toilet, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a perspective interior view of the lavatory having the transfer system proximate to the toilet, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a perspective interior view of the lavatory having the transfer system with a counterbalance in a deployed position, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a perspective interior view of the lavatory having the transfer system with a seating assembly in a lavatory use position, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of a transfer method, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of a method for transferring an individual between an area and a toilet within a lavatory, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of certain embodiments will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings. As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and preceded by the word &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should be understood as not necessarily excluding the plural of the elements or steps. Further, references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features. Moreover, unless explicitly stated to the contrary, embodiments &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or &#x201c;having&#x201d; an element or a plurality of elements having a particular condition can include additional elements not having that condition.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods for transferring to a toilet within a lavatory, such as within an internal cabin of an aircraft. The systems and methods described herein allows an individual to stay on a seating assembly throughout a duration of use of a lavatory, thereby reducing a potential of falling within the lavatory, while transferring to and from the toilet. Further, the systems and methods described herein allow current and future standard lavatories to be used by a person of reduced mobility. Accordingly, there is no need for specially configured lavatories. Embodiments of the present disclosure provide persons of reduced mobility with more lavatory and airplane use options. Further, embodiments of the present disclosure minimize or otherwise reduce the need for specially designed, large, and/or convertible lavatories for persons of reduced mobility.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a transfer system that allows a person of reduced mobility to independently use any type of aircraft (or other) lavatory, without having to transfer within the lavatory from the transfer seat to the toilet. In at least one embodiment, the transfer system includes a fold down seat cover allowing the system to be used as a transfer seat in a first configuration (no visible opening in seat base). A handle is operatively coupled to a counterbalance, which can be behind a seat back, for example. The counterbalance in a deployed position provides a brace that is configured to engage a toilet, such as a top surface of a seat at a back of the toilet. The transfer system is further configured to slide backwards over the toilet, while the counterbalance in the deployed position prevents the transfer system from tipping rearwardly as the transfer system is moved back over the toilet.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In at least one embodiment, a ratchet mechanism assists the counterbalance in engaging toilets of different heights. Further, the transfer system can include a release button that disengages the counterbalance from a locked state, thereby allowing the counterbalance to be rotated back to a stowed position.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In at least one embodiment, a latch (such as located in a forward position) is configured to be pulled allowing a seating assembly to slide completely backwards over the toilet. When pushed back, the latch is released locking the slide in this position. The latch allows the sliding portion to be locked at different positions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In at least one embodiment, a magnetic system can be used to lock the transfer system in position in relation to a toilet. For example, an electromagnet can be disposed in the floor of the lavatory at a position that is configured to locate the transfer system to the toilet. The transfer system can have one or more magnetic plates (such as formed of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron) that are attracted to the electromagnet when activated (such as via a switch), thereby locking the transfer system in position. In at least one embodiment, a lever arm can move the metallic plate(s) relative to the magnet. An individual can operate the switch (such as via a button) to engage the magnetic lock and push the button again to release.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As another example, the transfer system can include one or more suction cups that are configured to align with smooth surface pads within the lavatory. Easy to access levers can be coupled to the suction cups and allow them to be moved between stowed and deployed positions. As another example, latches or slide bolts can be fitted to the transfer system to lock it in position in relation to a toilet.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective front view of an aircraft <b>10</b>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
