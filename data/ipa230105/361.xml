While CPR and ECLS improve initial survival, many patients do not survive to hospital discharge, and those that do survive often have significant neurologic impairment. A major impediment to developing and improving neuroprotective strategies in patients who are suffering from, or recovering from, a Cardiac Arrest is that there is no efficient way to guide and control CPR, ECLS, or any other medical procedure to minimize neurologic impairment due to Cardiac Arrest.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An embodiment includes a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) cerebral monitoring device comprising a measurement probe including one or more optical emitters and one or more optical detectors, an optical instrument including an optical source and an optical detector, and a controller.

However, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuitry have been described at a relatively high-level, without detail, in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Introduction</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following description describes systems and methods for guiding medical personnel and/or controlling medical devices to perform and/or adjust medical procedures based on cerebral tissue parameters. Specifically, a non-invasive device that monitors brain oxygen levels is incorporated into lifesaving medical equipment that ensures that patients receive treatment to maximize their brain oxygen levels, thus maximizing their quality of life upon recovery. Real-time measurements of cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen saturations are taken, and a graphical-user interface outputs medical instructions and/or oxygen levels such as oxygen balance, oxygen saturation, etc. to caregivers. These oxygen levels may be used to automatically control medical equipment such as CPR compression bands, defibrillators and ECLS circulatory pumps, or displayed on the graphical user interface to help caregivers manually determine how to adjust treatment when performing CPR and ECLS, and when to switch from CPR to ECLS.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example of an operational flow <b>100</b> for medical procedure guidance/control based on cerebral monitoring. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example, patient <b>102</b> may be in a state of cardiac arrest. Optical measurement probes <b>104</b>, and optional sensors <b>106</b> (e.g. blood pressure, peripheral blood flow (including carotid blood flow), heart rate, optical measurement probes positioned on other parts of the body (carotid, heart, arms, legs, etc.)) are attached to patient <b>102</b> by a caregiver (not shown). In one example, system <b>108</b> includes a controller, user input/output and optional automated medical sensors and devices. System <b>108</b> controls optical measurement probes <b>104</b> (e.g. attached to the scalp of patient <b>102</b>) to illuminate cerebral tissue with light (e.g. multi-spectral light) from at least one light source, and then detect light exiting the cerebral tissue with at least one optical detector. Each optical measurement probe <b>104</b> includes of at least one emitter-detector pair. System <b>108</b> then analyzes cerebral monitoring signals received from optical measurement probes <b>104</b> to compute cerebral tissue parameters (e.g. optical absorption, optical scattering, blood flow, tissue oxygenation, hemoglobin concentration and cerebral metabolism).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">System <b>108</b> may also analyze monitoring signals from optional sensors to determine other parameters. As described above, these optional sensors may include blood pressure sensors, heart rate sensors, etc. These optional sensors may also include additional optical measurement (e.g. the same as optical measurement probes <b>104</b>) that are attached to other parts of the body such as the carotid, heart, arms and legs to measure peripheral blood flow. In one example, system <b>108</b> may control these other optical measurement probes to illuminate tissue of these other parts of the body with light (e.g. multi-spectral light) from at least one light source, and then detect light exiting the tissue of these other parts of the body with at least one optical detector. System <b>108</b> may then analyze these optional tissue monitoring signals received from the other optical measurement probes to compute optional tissue parameters for the other parts of the body (e.g. optical absorption, optical scattering, blood flow, tissue oxygenation, hemoglobin concentration, etc.).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one scenario, system <b>108</b> instructs the caregiver via user input/output (e.g. via display screen, color, haptics, virtual reality) to perform/adjust medical procedures (e.g. manual CPR procedures such as chest compressions) for treating the patient based on the cerebral tissue parameters, based on optional parameters detected by optional sensors <b>106</b>, and based on optional patient information (e.g. medical history, age, weight, systemic hemodynamics, other organ optical measurements, etc.). In another scenario, system <b>108</b> controls automated medical devices (e.g. automated CPR device) to perform/adjust medical procedures or medications (e.g. automated CPR procedures such as chest compressions, medication delivery) for treating the patient based on the cerebral tissue parameters, based on optional parameters detected by optional sensors <b>106</b>, and based on optional patient information (e.g. medical history, age, weight, systemic hemodynamics, other organ optical measurements, etc.).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a third scenario, system <b>108</b> can both instruct the caregiver and control the automated medical devices. For example, system <b>108</b> can control the automated CPR device to perform chest compressions, while instructing the caregiver via user input/output to administer medication.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For a manual CPR scenario, for example, the medical procedures could include user instructions for chest compression depth/rate, air flow rate/volume/composition and any other procedure utilized during manual CPR. For an automated CPR scenario, the medical procedures could be the automated control of a chest compression device, artificial lung, artificial heart or pump, or any other device utilized during automated CPR.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although CPR is described above, it is noted that the system could be used for instructing the user (e.g. the caregiver) or controlling automated devices for assisting in other medical procedures/treatments including, but not limited to ECLS of a patient or any medical procedures/treatments where cerebral tissue parameters are important to preventing/minimizing neurological damage.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Device Hardware</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a view of a control system <b>200</b> for implementing the medical procedure guidance/control based on cerebral monitoring described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

In addition, the number and positioning of optical emitters <b>208</b> and optical detectors <b>210</b> are also set based on these factors.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, the optical instrument <b>204</b> in the system may include eight optical sources <b>204</b>A (e.g. lasers), comprising two duplicated sets of four unique near-infrared wavelengths (multi-spectral), and the measurement probes <b>206</b> may each include two optical emitters <b>208</b> spaced at various distances from a single optical detector <b>210</b>. In operation, CPU <b>202</b>A controls multiplexer <b>204</b>B to sequentially output each of the first set of four lasers from the first optical emitter, followed by sequentially outputting each of the second set of the four lasers from the second optical emitter.

In one example, CPU <b>202</b>A may control optical multiplexer <b>204</b>B to perform time division multiplexing to sequentially drive the source lasers' <b>204</b>A output (each for a period of time T, each with specific emission wavelength), which are amplitude modulated using RF optical modulator <b>204</b>C onto an RF optical carrier (e.g. 110 MHz), for transmission of light to optical emitters <b>208</b>, each with a specific position on an optical probe <b>206</b>.

More specifically, steps <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> may include a combination of frequency domain diffuse optical spectroscopy (FD-DOS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) referred to herein as FD-DOS/DCS to dictate light emission and detection schema (e.g. optical instrument <b>204</b> and measurement probe <b>206</b>), analyze the light signals and compute the cerebral tissue parameters. FD-DOS uses RF amplitude modulated laser sources to quantify both optical scattering and optical absorption in the tissue which is beneficial to more accurately determine the cerebral tissue parameters, as compared to optical instruments where RF modulation and resulting phase information is not used. More generally, any optical instrument <b>204</b> and measurement probe <b>206</b> configuration which is able to quantify optical scattering and optical absorption at multiple wavelengths may be used in place of FD-DOS.
