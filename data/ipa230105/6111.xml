id="p-0051" num="0048">The present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the disclosure are shown. This disclosure may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">In the drawings, the relative sizes of elements, layers, and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Additionally, the use of cross-hatching and/or shading in the accompanying drawings is generally provided to clarify boundaries between adjacent elements. As such, neither the presence nor the absence of cross-hatching or shading conveys or indicates any preference or requirement for particular materials, material properties, dimensions, proportions, commonalities between illustrated elements, and/or any other characteristic, attribute, property, etc., of the elements, unless specified.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;under,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of explanation to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or in operation, in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; or &#x201c;under&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the example terms &#x201c;below&#x201d; and &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein should be interpreted accordingly. Similarly, when a first part is described as being arranged &#x201c;on&#x201d; a second part, this indicates that the first part is arranged at an upper side or a lower side of the second part without the limitation to the upper side thereof on the basis of the gravity direction.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">It will also be understood that when a layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another layer or substrate, it can be directly on the other layer or substrate (e.g., without any intervening layers therebetween), or intervening layers may also be present. The same reference numbers indicate the same components throughout the specification.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">It will be understood that, although the terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another element. For instance, a first element discussed below could be termed a second element without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure. Similarly, the second element could also be termed the first element.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present disclosure. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;have,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;including,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of the stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; and similar terms are used as terms of approximation and not as terms of degree, and are intended to account for the inherent deviations in measured or calculated values that would be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art. &#x201c;About&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; as used herein, is inclusive of the stated value and means within an acceptable range of deviation for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, considering the measurement in question and the error associated with measurement of the particular quantity (i.e., the limitations of the measurement system). For example, &#x201c;about&#x201d; may mean within one or more standard deviations, or within &#xb1;30%, 20%, 10%, 5% of the stated value. Further, the use of &#x201c;may&#x201d; when describing embodiments of the present disclosure refers to &#x201c;one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">When one or more embodiments may be implemented differently, a specific process order may be performed differently from the described order.

Accordingly, Applicant reserves the right to amend this specification, including the claims, to expressly recite any sub-range subsumed within the ranges expressly recited herein. All such ranges are intended to be inherently described in this specification such that amending to expressly recite any such subranges would comply with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112(a) and 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 132(a).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">The electronic or electric devices and/or any other relevant devices or components according to embodiments of the present disclosure described herein may be implemented utilizing any suitable hardware, firmware (e.g. an application-specific integrated circuit), software, or a combination of software, firmware, and hardware. For example, the various components of these devices may be formed on one integrated circuit (IC) chip or on separate IC chips.

For example, the insulating film <b>38</b> may surround at least an outer surface of the light emitting layer <b>33</b>, and may extend in one direction in which the light emitting element ED extends. The insulating film <b>38</b> may serve to protect the first semiconductor layer <b>31</b>, the second semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, the light emitting layer <b>33</b>, and the electrode layer <b>37</b>. The insulating film <b>38</b> may be formed to surround side surface portions of the first semiconductor layer <b>31</b>, the second semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, the light emitting layer <b>33</b>, and the electrode layer <b>37</b>, but may be formed to expose both ends of the light emitting element ED in the length direction thereof.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0269">It has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> that the insulating film <b>38</b> is formed to extend in the length direction of the light emitting element ED to cover side surfaces of the first semiconductor layer <b>31</b> to the electrode layer <b>37</b>, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto.

Accordingly, risk of an electrical short circuit that may occur when the light emitting layer <b>33</b> is in direct contact with an electrode through which an electrical signal is transferred to the light emitting element ED may be prevented or reduced. In addition, the insulating film <b>38</b> protects an outer surface of the light emitting element ED as well as the light emitting layer <b>33</b>, and may thus prevent or reduce a decrease in luminous efficiency.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0272">In one or more embodiments, an outer surface of the insulating film <b>38</b> may be surface-treated.

Here, to maintain the light emitting element ED in a state in which the light emitting element ED is dispersed without being agglomerated with other adjacent light emitting elements ED in the ink, a hydrophobic or hydrophilic treatment may be performed on a surface of the insulating film <b>38</b>.
