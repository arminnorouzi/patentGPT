Every human has a multiplicity of emotional expressions based on underlying feeling(s) or thought(s). Every human being whether understood or not has different emotion al states ranging from happiness, sorrow, anger, or disappointment, etc. And emotions change sometimes without warning and in an unregulated manner for kids, the developmentally challenged, nonverbal and/or cognitive deficient adults, and others. Humans have more than two emotions, but most toys express only two emotions, some only express one emotion.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In short, current emotionally expressive toys tend to be binary.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As can be seen, there is a need for a multi-faced toy enabling users to express a plurality of different emotions like sadness, anger, happiness, and surprise in a successive manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Acting as both a toy and a developmental/communication tool, the present invention can be used for indicating and expressing the emotional state of an individual user as they enjoy it as a toy. The present invention adds more depth to expressing human emotions as in sometimes vague and hard-to-decipher emotional states can be singularly and clearly represented. It also gives the developmentally challenged, non-verbal child and/or adult suffering from cognitive difficulties more options to express to others how they feel at a given time as well as how they feel differently over a duration of time. The present invention may embody emotional logs adapted to track daily emotional health in long-term health facilities or other clinical settings.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This multi-faced toy/device when selectively moved to a particular emotional expression helps the individual zero in on what emotion(s) they are feeling at a particular time for the benefit of others. Accordingly, the individual can selectively communicate to others their shifting emotional states, thereby allowing for empathy to be expressed if necessary or as a critical indicator for mental state regulation and observation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention enables a plurality of emotional expressions for non-verbal users who are having a hard time verbalizing their emotions. In sum, the present invention aids a user in expressing emotional state to others, thereby serving as a communication device, toy, and rehabilitation tool all rolled into one.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect of the present invention, an emotion signaling toy including a facial object having a plurality of emotional indicium spaced along its outer surface; and a head-shaped portion defining a receptacle socket that communicates with an external environment via an opening, wherein the facial object operatively associates with the receptacle socket in a ball and socket configuration so that only one of the plurality of emotional indicium is visible through the opening.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the present invention, the emotion signaling toy further includes two diametrically opposing bearing points on each along an exterior of the facial object and along an interior of the receptacle socket, wherein said bearing points facilitate the ball and socket configuration, wherein each of the plurality of emotional indicium comprises a facial representation associated with happiness, sorrow, anger, or disappointment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect of the present invention, a method of non-verbally signaling emotions, the method includes providing the above-mentioned emotion signaling toy and selectively rotating the facial object so that one of the plurality of emotional indicium is visible through the opening.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front elevation view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side elevation view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, so that only one emotional-representative facet or face protrude beyond a furthest-most point of the head-shaped portion and is thus visible through the head-shaped portion's opening; the receptacle cavity is shown in phantom for clarity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a section view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, illustrating a ball and socket configuration and the operatively associated rotational movement about a polar axis <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front elevation view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, showing the facial object rotated to a first emotionally expressive facet or face.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a front elevation view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, showing the facial object rotated to a second emotionally expressive facet or face.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front elevation view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, showing the facial object rotated to a third emotionally expressive facet or face.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention.

Spaced apart along an exterior surface of the facial object are a plurality of emotionally indicative representations. The head-shaped portion provides an opening communicating to the external environment so that a user of the present invention can selectively swivel the facial object so that one of the plurality of emotionally indicative representations is visible through the opening, thereby signaling a present emotional state, while enjoying the present invention as a toy.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>8</b></figref>, the present invention may include an emotion communication toy <b>10</b>. The emotion communication toy <b>10</b> provides a head-shaped portion <b>11</b>. The head-shaped portion <b>11</b> defines a receptacle socket <b>12</b> or cavity that communicates with the external environment via an opening <b>13</b>. The opening <b>13</b> may occupy the furthest most point or plane of the head-shaped portion <b>11</b>. Along an interior surface of the receptacle socket <b>12</b> may be a plurality of socket bearings points <b>18</b>. In one embodiment the receptacle socket <b>12</b> provides two diametrically opposing socket bearings points <b>18</b>. The two diametrically opposing socket bearings points <b>18</b> may define a polar axis about which rotation is facilitated by the opposing socket bearings points <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention includes a spherical or ovoid facial object <b>14</b>. A plurality of emotional indicium <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C, and <b>16</b>D may be spaced apart along an exterior of the facial object <b>14</b>. When there are four emotional indicium, they will be radially spaced apart at 90-degree increments. It is understood that there may be more or less than emotional indicium. Also, in certain embodiments, an emotion indicium may have spacing such that two emotional indicium may be visible through the opening <b>13</b> simultaneously, thereby affording a user to expressing &#x2018;mixed-emotions&#x2019; embodying more than one emotional state.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The facial object <b>14</b> may provide a plurality of ball bearing points <b>19</b>. In one embodiment, the facial object <b>14</b> may provide diametrically opposing ball bearings points <b>19</b>. The facial object <b>14</b> may be dimensioned and adapted to operatively associate in the receptacle socket <b>12</b>, defining a ball and socket configuration. In the ball and socket configuration the ball and socket bearing points <b>19</b> and <b>18</b> operatively associate so that the facial object <b>14</b> can be rotated within the receptacle socket <b>12</b> about the polar axis <b>40</b> that passes through the two socket bearing points <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The bearing points <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> may be adhesive hook and loop, magnet or other components enabling the facial object <b>14</b> to attach and swivel in the receptacle socket <b>14</b>. The facial object <b>14</b> may be plushie material or any other conducive and child-friendly materials.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each emotional indicium <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C, and <b>16</b>D may represent a different face expressing a different emotional state. Through the ball and socket configuration a user may swivel the facial object <b>14</b> to show a particular emotion, visible through the opening <b>13</b>, while concealing other emotions, thereby revealing one emotion at a time. Thereby, the present invention adds more depth to expressing human emotions. The present invention also gives the developmentally challenged, or non-verbal child or adult more options to express to others how they feel at a given time by rotating the facial object <b>14</b> within the receptacle socket <b>12</b> and allowing the emotive indicia <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>D associated with their emotional state to be displayed outside the receptacle socket <b>12</b> via the opening <b>13</b>. Accordingly, a user is enabled to selectively show an array of emotions as they please. Emotional logs can be used to track the displayed emotive indicium <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>D, thereby capturing a snapshot of the user's emotional health in long-term health facilities or in clinical settings. A method of making the present invention may include the following. Using plushie material a manufacture may create a circular three-dimensional (<b>3</b>D) spheroid or ovoid with at least four emotional indicia <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>D spaced along its outer surface, wherein each emotional indicia may be faces expressing different emotions or emotional indicia, such as laughing, crying, anger, and smiling, etc. The head-like portion <b>11</b> may also be made of plushie material with a cavity or socket to connect the <b>3</b>D multi-faced object. Embedded along both an interior of the receptacle cavity <b>12</b> and the exterior of the facial object <b>14</b> will be aligned and cooperative bearing points <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. The bearing points <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> may include ball bearings, magnet, or the like to allow for rotative attachment of the two objects (facial object and receptacle cavity) being held in place.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The emotion communication toy <b>10</b> can help signal the emotional health of the user, e.g., a user can implicitly signal if they have a propensity for self-harm or signal where along a spectrum the user is in the emotional development. Mental health centers can use the emotion communication toy <b>10</b> as part of their programs to help measure and identify emotional cues. In the field of psychology and mental rehabilitation, soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can use the emotion communication toy <b>10</b> to convey emotions while in therapy.
