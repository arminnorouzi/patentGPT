Modulation schemes with high data rates (for example, 5G or 5th Generation Wireless) generally require higher output power than previous generations. Similarly, to help with thermal management and preserve the system battery life, it can be beneficial to increase amplifier efficiency. To achieve lower cost and smaller form factor, design solutions often obtain the best performance when they push the physical limits of the GaAs-based HBTs in regards to electrical stress.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Amplifier linearity measurements can include channel power ratios, such as an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR<b>1</b>) and an alternative channel power ratio (ACPR<b>2</b>), and/or channel leakage power ratios, such as an adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR<b>1</b>) and an alternative channel leakage power ratio (ACLR<b>2</b>). ACPR<b>2</b> and ACLR<b>2</b> can be referred to as second channel linearity measurements. ACPR<b>2</b> and ACLR<b>2</b> values can correspond to measurements at an offset of about 1.98 MHz from a frequency of interest. Measurement of linearity can also include EVM (Error Vector Magnitude), a measure of modulation accuracy, represented by the variation in amplitude from input to output (AM-AM distortion) and variation in phase from input to output as a result of amplitude variation (AM-PM). EVM can also have dynamic elements (DEVM) and static elements (SEVM) as some elements of distortion can vary as a function of time. Even systems that use DPD (Digital Pre-Distortion) to help linearize the output can have several limitations such that the intrinsic linearity of the GaAs-based HBT amplifiers can benefit from meeting specific criteria.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some situations, the most linear amplifier mode is Class-A, but some compact mobile handset GaAs HBT amplifiers target Classes and architectures that can obtain higher efficiency. In practice, some modern amplifiers operate in Class-AB or in switching modes such as Class-E when the output can be linearized with DPD or other means. Additional benefits in efficiency can be found with systems that raise or lower the output power supply Vcc using a separate or integrated PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit) such as a system that uses APT (Average Power Tracking) or ET (Envelope Tracking). As an example, when a handset battery's output is raised or lowered (e.g., from 3.4V) by a PMIC with Vcc provided by a buck-boost converter, efficiency can be improved. Some ET systems can use Vcc=5V or 5.5V when peak RF output power is desired such that the Class-E amplifier might have output collectors that see 3&#xd7; Vcc at peak power. When compared to a system with Vcc fixed to 3.4V, it is apparent that such systems could greatly benefit from GaAs-based HBT devices that are more rugged, or that have a wider or larger Safe Operating Area (SOA).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The power amplifier's &#x201c;ruggedness&#x201d; can refer to a measure of the ability to survive an electrical stress event. In some cases, within limits, ruggedness can be increased with protection circuitry, although in some cases a component can have an intrinsic ruggedness without protection circuitry. We can describe and characterize an amplifier's safe operating range with progressive measurements that push stress conditions to find where the power amplifier fails. An amplifier that can survive higher stress conditions will be considered to be more rugged, and thus, less likely to succumb to a failure on the field. The full characterization of an amplifier's ruggedness involves multiple dimensions. Factors that can characterize ruggedness include: input power (in regards to how overdriving affects the output), output power, output mismatch (or VSWR&#x2014;Voltage Standing Wave Ratio), output power supply (might be denoted as Vcc, Vdd, or Vbatt), and temperature. For any given topology, the power amplifier's ruggedness can be directly correlated to the SOA of the GaAs-based HBTs, however, the amplifier's ruggedness can be enhanced by over-stress protection circuitry. Protection circuitry is generally triggered by a high stress event, such as an excessively high voltage, excessive current draw, or excessive temperature where the trigger device might be a sensor on the GaAs-based HBT IC or another component in the same module. In some cases, the protection circuitry, which tends to limit, clip, or turn-off the amplifier, cannot be triggered where the circuit should be functioning linearly. And so, it would be also possible to define the range of operation where the amplifier can function linearly, which can be a range that can be captured within the same amplifier's safe operating range. The transistor's SOA can set the fundamental limit for both the maximum linear and safe operating ranges. Thus, it can be desirable to optimize the transistors for ruggedness. In particular, the collector design of GaAs-based HBTs can be important for improving the ruggedness of transistors.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For an individual transistor, the safe operating area (SOA) can be defined by the output curve of the transistor where the collector current (Ic) is plotted against the collector voltage (Vce). One of the metrics of SOA is BV<sub>CEO</sub>, the breakdown voltage from collector to emitter with an open circuit at the base. BV<sub>CEO </sub>can be a direct current (DC) measurement. An important metric of the SOA is the snapback point of the output curve (BVcex, Ic_BVcex) which indicates the turning point of the transistor where the collector voltage starts decreasing while the collector current keeps increasing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The ruggedness of a power amplifier can be an indication of how much power can be delivered while maintaining sufficient linearity, and/or what are the worst-case conditions the power amplifier can survive under. Generally, a power amplifier includes a matching circuit (such as for impedance matching). If the matching circuit is excessively mismatched with the transistor, sufficient power can be reflected back into the output and cause permanent damage to a transistor or devices in the amplifier output circuitry. Thus, a power amplifier that is able to operate and withstand a larger mismatch would have increased ruggedness. For example, some power amplifiers can be configured to withstand a mismatch ratio of 3 to 1, or 5 to 1, or 7 to 1, or 10 to 1, or more. Also, a higher amount of delivered power can result in more returned power that will increase the electrical stress on the output array and thus also increase the potential of part failing under test or on the field. Thus, a power amplifier that is required to operate linearly at higher power levels (e.g., produced by higher voltages) can benefit from having increased ruggedness to be able to function without breaking.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some cases, ruggedness can be tested by using a set mismatch ratio (e.g., 10 to 1) and increasing the voltage (and resulting power) until the power amplifier breaks. For example, a power amplifier that was able to operate at 5.15 volts with a mismatch ratio of 10 to 1 would be considered to be more rugged than a power amplifier that breaks at 5 volts under the same conditions. Also, a power amplifier that was able to operate at the same voltage with a higher mismatch ratio would be considered to be more rugged than a power amplifier that can only operate under similar parameters but at a lower mismatch ratio. The temperature can also affect the ruggedness of the power amplifier. Generally, a power amplifier can fail more easily at lower ambient temperatures (e.g., within its operable range). For example, a power amplifier (e.g., with an operating range of &#x2212;30 degrees C. to 85 degrees C. for the ambient temperature) may be to pass a ruggedness test (e.g., at 5.15 volts and a mismatch ratio of 10 to 1) at a relatively high temperature (e.g., 85 degrees C. or 30 degrees C.), whereas the power amplifier may fail to pass a similar ruggedness test with the same parameters (e.g., 5.15 volts and a mismatch ratio of 10 to 1) but at a relatively low temperature (e.g., &#x2212;30 degrees C.). Thus, ruggedness tests can be performed at different temperatures and the worst-case temperature can be used to set the upper limits on output power, Vcc, and mismatch. The ruggedness of a power amplifier can be a description of the amount of RF power (or corresponding voltage) that the power amplifier can handle with a specified degree of mismatch and at a specified temperature.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A higher collector voltage (Vce) can result in improved efficiency for power amplifiers. A higher collector voltage Vce can also be used to produce higher power. However, a power amplifier may more easily break as its individual transistors operate at higher collector voltages and currents (e.g., as a result of the higher power levels), such as if operating beyond the SOA as defined primarily by the snapback point of the transistor output curves. Accordingly, some power amplifiers with improved ruggedness can have improved efficiency, such as by operating at higher voltages. In some embodiments, the collector thickness of a transistor can be increased to improve the ruggedness. However, increasing the collector thickness can degrade the performance of the power amplifier. In some embodiments, the doping concentration of the collector can be configured to compensate for the increased collector thickness to provide transistors and/or power amplifiers with improved ruggedness without degrading performance.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally described, aspects of the present disclosure relate to a bipolar transistor having a collector with a thickness of more than 1.1 microns.

Second, in some embodiments, the collector can include a region of high doping concentration (e.g., a doping spike) adjacent to the base (or between the base and the graded region of the collector), which can be used to compensate for the thick collector, such as by improving linearity. Third, in some embodiments, the collector can include a step at the transition between flat doped collector region and a graded collector region, and that discontinuity can be used to adjust the transition frequency (f<sub>T</sub>) to maintain performance parameters (e.g., linearity, gain, and/or efficiency) of the transistor with a large collector thickness for improved ruggedness, for example.

An example characterization sequence is shared for a common-emitter GaAs HBT amplifier: Initially set the power supply Vcc to the nominal voltage (which might be 4.5V, 5.0V, or 5.5V), then set the RF input power to +10 dBm, and then sweep the output mismatch ratio from 1:1 to 10:1 on the output over all possible phase angles. The output will be significantly overdriven and electrical stress will increase as the output VSWR in increased. After each sweep of VSWR, the voltage at Vcc is stepped progressively higher (e.g., in increments of 0.1V or similar) until the power amplifier fails.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that the ruggedness testing could be performed without additional over-drive protection circuitry on the power amplifier, but in some instance this may not be practical as when protection circuitry is present. The protection circuitry can effectively expand the safe operating range. Thus, ruggedness characterization of an amplifier can factor in both the SOA of the GaAs-based HBT transistors and, where applicable, the effectiveness of the protection circuitry to prevent or delay failure in the event of a stress event. For example, some power amplifiers can have protection features that can limit or cut-off operation when a stress event occurs. The transistors disclosed herein can withstand higher stresses, and the protection features can be set to limit operation at higher threshold values (e.g., of voltage and/or power). In an example, if the peak power of an existing PA needs to be increased from 32 dBm to 36 dBm, the protection circuitry threshold voltage cutoff should also be increased from 5V to 5.2 volts, 5.3 volts, 5.5 volts, or 5.7 volts, or any values or ranges therebetween, although other configurations are possible. Also, in the event of a stress event that invokes the protection features, the transistors disclosed herein can be more likely to survive the stress event because of the improved ruggedness relative to the current state-of-the-art transistors.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Common-emitter amplifier stages designed and optimized for handset applications using some transistors are used in applications with Vcc up to 5.5V, in some cases. In practice, the amplifier and any associated protection circuitry, can exceed this specification by a sufficient margin and over the full range of temperatures requested by the handset manufacturer. As a possible guideline, one could strive to demonstrate no failures at 5% or higher Vcc (5.25V) over a full range VSWR and temperature. The worst case temperature can be, for example, at &#x2212;30 deg C where the amplifier gain can be expected to be the highest. This can be the lowest temperature test case that a handset manufacturers may request in the analysis, in some cases. In the context of a similar common-emitter based mobile handset amplifier alternatively built with transistors <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, applications will be able to support Vcc at least about <b>10</b>% higher than the current-state-of-the-art: up to 6V (or greater).
