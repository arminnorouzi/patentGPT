It is very important to identify narrow passages present in the environment to obtain an effective path planning. However, path planning in narrow passage scenario is quite challenging. The existing standard techniques such as Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) samples the free space randomly and connects the sample points, called roadmap, to generate a path between the source and destination points. However, because of the probability property of the sampling strategy of the PRM, the sampling probability of each region in the map remains the same. Therefore, when the number of sampling points is constant, more the sampling points are generated for the large area the area of a free space while making it difficult to obtain sample points in narrow passages, where the area of free space is much less. Similarly, in RRT, the sampling of random points for expansion of the tree is uniform, hence making it very important to identify narrow passages present in the environment while generating sampling points to effectively improve the sample density in such regions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The disclosed technique for narrow passage path sampling based on levy flight is an improvisation of existing techniques.
