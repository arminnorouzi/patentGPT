The individual banknotes are then conveyed towards one or more processing modules, which are configured to process, in particular to count and/or examine and/or sort, the banknotes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the invention to provide a feeder device and method for feeding a stack of value documents, in particular banknotes, to a singler device, a singler module and a system for processing value documents which are improved, in particular regarding handling, robustness and stability as well as flexibility and reliability of the feeding process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object is achieved by a feeder device and method according to the independent claims, a singler module comprising such a feeder device and a system for processing value documents comprising such a singler module.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, a feeder device for feeding a stack of value documents, in particular banknotes, to a singler device, which is configured to withdraw individual value documents from the stack, comprises: a stop element having a front side and a back side, the front side being configured to serve as a stop for a rear side of the stack and to guide the stack at the rear side of the stack towards the singler device; two lateral guide elements provided at the front side of the stop element and configured to guide the stack at two lateral sides of the stack towards the singler device; two support elements, on which the lateral guide elements are mounted, in particular fixed; and two or more bearing elements by which the support elements are movably mounted on the stop element to allow the respective positions of the lateral guide elements and/or the distance of the lateral guide elements relative to each other to be changed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a second aspect, a singler module comprises a singler device, which is configured to withdraw individual value documents from a stack of value documents, in particular banknotes, and a feeder device according to the first aspect for feeding the stack of value documents to the singler device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a third aspect, a system for processing value documents, in particular banknotes, comprises one or more processing modules configured to process, in particular to transport and/or count and/or examine and/or sort, the value documents and at least one singler module according to the second aspect.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a fourth aspect, a method for feeding a stack of value documents, in particular banknotes, to a singler device, which is configured to withdraw individual value documents from the stack, uses a feeder device comprising a stop element having a front side and a back side, the front side being configured to serve as a stop for a rear side of the stack and to guide the stack at the rear side of the stack towards the singler device, two lateral guide elements provided at the front side of the stop element and configured to guide the stack at two lateral sides of the stack towards the singler device, two support elements, on which the lateral guide elements are mounted, in particular fixed, and two or more bearing elements by which the support elements are movably mounted on the stop element, wherein the method comprises the following steps: changing the respective positions of the lateral guide elements and/or the distance of the lateral guide elements relative to each other; depositing a stack of value documents between the two lateral guide elements at the front side of the stop element; and guiding the stack of value documents at the rear side of the stack along the front side of the stop element and at two lateral sides of the stack along the lateral guide elements towards the singler device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of present disclosure are preferably based on the approach of movably mounting the support elements, on which the lateral guide elements are attached, on the stop element by means of bearing elements. Preferably, the type and/or total number of the bearing elements is or are, respectively, chosen such that frictional forces between the bearing elements, on the one hand, and the stop element, on the other hand, are smaller than frictional forces occurring in case of a slide bearing, where, e.g., the support elements are guided directly or sliding on, i.e. by touching, the stop element.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this way, the position of at least one of the lateral guide elements and/or the distance or width between the lateral guide elements can be easily changed by manually shifting at least one of the lateral guide elements to the desired position or positions, respectively, without the need of applying excessive forces to the lateral guide elements and/or the danger of breaking or deforming the lateral guide elements, even in cases where a manual force is applied close to an upper or lower end of the lateral guiding elements. This allows for a simple, flexible and reliable adjustment of the width between the support elements to different sizes of stacks of value documents to be processed and/or positioning of a stack of value documents relative to the center of a singler device by placing the stack either (more or less) symmetrically to the center of an input section of the singler device, or with some offset to the left or right with respect to the center of the input section of the singler device. Further, although the bearing mechanism according to present disclosure allows for a smooth and easy adjustment of the position(s) of and/or width between the lateral guide elements, the lateral guide elements stably remain at their respectively set positions, rather than moving unguided from their respectively set positions in case of vibrations.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In summary, present disclosure provides a feeder device and method, singler module and system for improved handling, robustness and stability as well as flexibility and reliability regarding the feeding process.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, at least one of the bearing elements comprises and/or is a roller element. By using roller elements, frictional forces between the bearing elements, on the one hand, and the stop element, on the other hand, can be significantly reduced compared to providing a slide bearing between the support elements and the stop element, so that adjusting the positions and/or width of the lateral guide elements is further improved.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The roller elements can be made of metal. It is, however, preferred that the roller elements have a roller surface which is made of and/or comprises an elastic material, in particular rubber. Preferably, the roller elements comprise a roller body, which can be, e.g., made of metal, which is overmolded with the elastic material so as to obtain the roller surface. In this way, low frictional forces and a smooth running of the roller bearings are achieved.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the roller elements are rotatably mounted on the support elements. It is further preferred, that the back side of the stop element comprises guide rails, which are preferably recessed in the back side of the stop element, and wherein the support elements are movably mounted on the back side of the stop element by means of the roller elements which are guided in the guide rails. In this way, a very robust and reliable bearing of the support elements on the back side of the stop element is achieved.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, in total three bearing elements, in particular roller elements, are provided at different positions on each support element. Alternatively or additionally, the bearing elements, in particular the roller elements, are provided at in total three different positions on each support element. In this way, a movement of the respective support element can be reliably limited to a linear movement in parallel to a plane of the stop element, while simultaneously frictional forces can be kept low.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the feeder device further comprises a coupling element which is configured to couple the support elements with each other such that by moving one of the lateral guide elements in a first direction, the other lateral guide element is moved in a second direction opposite to the first direction, and to decouple the support elements from each other so as to allow moving and positioning the lateral guide elements independently from each other. In this way, the feeder device can be easily switched between two adjustment states, wherein the width between the support elements can be rapidly and easily adapted to different sizes of stacks of value documents to be processed (support elements in coupled state) or the position of the stack of value documents relative to the center of the singler device can be changed (support elements in decoupled state).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the coupling element comprises a gear wheel which configured to be brought into an engaged position in which the gear wheel engages with toothed racks provided at the support elements to couple the support elements with each other, and a disengaged position in which the gear wheel disengages with the toothed racks provided at the support elements to decouple the support elements from each other. In this way, a particularly simple, robust and reliable coupling and decoupling of the support elements can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the coupling element, in particular the gear wheel, is mounted on the stop element by means of a spring-loaded clutch mechanism, which is configured to be actuated, in particular by a knob, from the front side of the stop element or by a pneumatic or electric or hydraulic or linear actuator so as to couple or decouple the support elements with each other or from each other, respectively. For example, a user can actuate a mechanical actuator, in particular by manually rotating a knob, provided at the front side of the stop element to have the support elements coupled or decoupled by the clutch mechanism. Preferably, a rotation of the knob to two different positions will cause the spring-loaded gear wheel to move from rear to front, and vice versa, and will engage or disengage, respectively, with the toothed racks on the support elements. Alternatively, coupling and decoupling can be initiated by actuating an electrical switch provided at the front side of the stop element and configured to activate a rotary or linear actuator.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further advantages, features and possible applications of the present disclosure are shown in the following description in connection with figures, which show:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> an example of a system for processing value documents;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> an example of a singler module in a perspective front view;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> an example of a feeder device in a perspective rear view;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> an example of a support element in a perspective view;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> an example of a feeder device in a perspective front view (left) and rear view (right);</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a front view (left) of a knob and a side view (right) of a gear wheel in a disengaged position (a) and an engaged position (b); and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> a perspective front view of an example of a feeder device, wherein an upper part of the stop element is omitted for illustration purposes.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of an example of a system for processing value documents, in particular banknotes.

Further, there may be certain features on the documents which cause problems during singling, e.g., due to certain printed features which are located exactly in line with singling elements (roller(s), belt(s)) of the singler device. In such cases, the user can turn the knob <b>14</b> into the position shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>, in which the gear wheel <b>13</b> does not engage with the toothed racks <b>12</b> of the support elements <b>7</b>, so that he or she can position of the lateral guide elements <b>4</b> independently as desired to ensure that singling and/or processing of the documents is (at least partially) shifted towards the left or right side or occurs on the left or right side of the singler device and/or processing system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">After having positioned the lateral guide elements <b>4</b> accordingly, the user can rotate the knob <b>14</b> into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>, in which the gear wheel <b>13</b> engages with the toothed racks <b>12</b> of the support elements <b>7</b>, so that both lateral guide elements <b>4</b> will move synchronously to each other with respect to the new center plane of the feeder device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In summary, the feeder device <b>6</b> disclosed herein can be easily adjusted by a user for the purpose of a so-called biased processing of documents, in particular value documents, which is preferred to a &#x201c;centered&#x201d; processing of the documents in the center of the system, by independently placing and/or shifting the lateral guide elements <b>4</b> to the left or right side with respect to the singler device. Further, the adjustment mechanism of the feeder device <b>6</b> is very robust and yet smooth-running, so that the lateral guide elements <b>4</b> can be moved easily and safely, in particular without the danger of breaking during manual adjustment, while not moving automatically or uncontrollably or unguided from their respectively set positions due to vibrations of the processing system.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
