In order to view a target, a user must approximately align their eye pupil to the plane of the exit pupil along the primary optical axis of the optical system in order to avoid severe vignetting or total loss of the observed target.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Eye relief is defined as the distance along the primary optical axis measured from the vertex of last optical surface (the surface that is directly observed by the user) of the optical system to the plane of exit pupil. Typical optical systems have fixed eye relief, such that the distance between the plane of the exit pupil and the last optical surface of the optical system cannot be changed. This makes it difficult to deploy the same optical system for different types of applications, such as several different firearms, telescopes, microscopes, or medical imaging devices. For example, firearms requiring different chickweld positions, different ammunition calibers, and having different recoil effects each call for different eye reliefs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In at least one aspect, the application describes an optical system with adjustable eye relief with significant working range. The optical system employs an aperture stop configured to shift axially along an optical axis between a set of lenses. The axial shift of the aperture stop causes an axial shift of the exit pupil while the exit pupil size remains the same, independent of the distance in axial shift of the aperture stop.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This is completed by using an afocal group inside of the optical system to produce a real image of the aperture stop. Afocal imagery of the pupil keeps the pupil size the same at all possible values of the eye relief. The absolute value of transverse magnification of the afocal group may be greater than 1, so even a small axial shift of the aperture stop can dramatically change eye relief. Optical systems as described herein provide no decolimation of the image when the eye relief is adjusted, no changes in exit pupil diameter, no excessive vignetting to be perceived by a user, and minimal time of adjustment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect, an optical system with adjustable eye relief is provided. The optical system includes a relay lens assembly. The relay lens assembly is defined by a collimating lens and a focusing lens. The optical system includes an aperture stop. The aperture stop is configured to shift axially along an optical axis between the collimating lens and the focusing lens. The optical system also includes an afocal lens assembly. The afocal lens assembly is defined by the focusing lens and an eyepiece. Additionally, an axial shift of the aperture stop along the optical axis between the collimating lens and the focusing lens changes an eye relief of the eyepiece based on a transverse magnification of the afocal lens assembly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some exemplary embodiments of the optical system, the axial gain factor of the optical system is equal to the square of a transverse magnification of the afocal lens assembly.

Particularly, the subject technology provides an apparatus and methods of using the same to adjust the distance from an outer surface of an eyepiece lens in an optical system to the position where an exit pupil is formed. In this regard, the same optical system may be deployed for different applications. For example, optical systems as described herein may be used in combination with several different types of guns and rifles requiring varied chickweld positioning, ammunition calibers, and having varied recoil effects.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show an eyepiece <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b </i>of an optical system <b>100</b>. The optical system <b>100</b> may be used in an optical system, such as a telescopic sight in a firearm, telescope, a microscope, medical imaging device, or the like. In each case, the eyepiece <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b </i>produces a corresponding eyebox <b>104</b><i>a, </i><b>104</b><i>b. </i>The eyebox <b>104</b><i>a, </i><b>104</b><i>b </i>defines a volume position behind an optical system relative to a target. The volume position includes at least lateral and axial dimensions relative an optical axis. When a user aligns their eye within the eyebox <b>104</b><i>a, </i><b>104</b><i>b, </i>they may see a full field of view of a target on each magnification setting of the optical system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, each eyebox <b>104</b><i>a, </i><b>104</b><i>b </i>includes a corresponding eyebox depth <b>112</b><i>a, </i><b>112</b><i>b </i>along the optical axis <b>108</b>.

Thus, as the distance light travels from the collimating lens <b>206</b> increases, spherical wavefronts of the light may become flatter and closer to plane waves, which may be perfectly collimated. Diverging light from a direction of the first focal plane <b>202</b> may be received by the collimating lens <b>206</b>. The collimating lens <b>206</b> may thereafter emit parallel light in return. Because parallel light does not converge, the collimating lens <b>206</b> creates an infinite image of the first focal plane <b>202</b>. According to the present disclosure, infinite image can be used to articulate that an image is located at infinity. The focal length of the collimating lens <b>206</b> may vary based on a required collimation, convergence, or divergence. The collimating lens <b>206</b> may have a finite focal length.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other implementations, light emitted from the collimating lens <b>206</b> may diverge or converge as it propagates. Where the collimating lens <b>206</b> includes a converging lens, the focal length of collimating lens <b>206</b> is positive and is defined by the distance at which a beam of collimated light from the first focal plane <b>202</b> will be focused to a single spot. Where the collimating lens <b>206</b> includes a diverging lens the focal length of collimating lens <b>206</b> is negative and is defined by the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the collimating lens <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Aperture stop <b>210</b> may be disposed between the collimating lens <b>206</b> and a focusing lens <b>208</b>. The aperture stop <b>210</b> may be disposed along optical axis <b>108</b>. The aperture stop <b>210</b> may include an opening through which light passes. Aperture stop <b>210</b> may be configured to receive light from the collimating lens <b>206</b>. In this regard, aperture stop <b>210</b> may pass the infinite image of the first focal plane <b>202</b> produced by collimating lens <b>206</b>. The image may include rays that are not blocked by aperture stop <b>210</b>, including light that passes through the opening of the aperture stop <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The aperture stop <b>210</b> may be positioned along a rail, track, actuating device, or a similar movement system such that the aperture stop <b>210</b> can shift axially, along the optical axis, either automatically or with user input. In this regard, the aperture stop <b>210</b> may be positioned in different locations between the collimating lens <b>206</b> and the focusing lens <b>208</b> through axial shifting maneuvers enabled by the rail, track, actuating device, or a similar movement system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The focusing lens <b>208</b> may be disposed at an end portion of the relay lens assembly <b>204</b>, such that it receives light after the collimating lens <b>206</b> and the aperture stop <b>210</b> within optical system <b>200</b>. The focusing lens <b>208</b> may be disposed along optical axis <b>108</b>. The focusing lens <b>208</b> may include a curved mirror or lens. For example, the focusing lens <b>206</b> may include a convex or concave lens. Alternatively, the focusing lens <b>208</b> may include a flat mirror or lens. Though, it should be understood that any lens or mirror may be suitable for implementations described herein. The focusing lens may align light from the aperture stop <b>210</b> in a specific direction, such as downstream optical axis <b>108</b> away from a target and toward a user. Light traveling through emanating through the aperture stop <b>210</b> may be aligned at one or more foci of the focusing lens <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The focusing lens <b>208</b> may converge the image of the aperture stop toward an exit pupil <b>218</b> and produce the image by way of an eyepiece <b>216</b>. It should be noted that focusing lens <b>208</b> can perform two imaging operations. Focusing lens <b>208</b> can take the collimated input produced by collimating lens <b>206</b> and focus it at second focal plane <b>212</b>. Focusing lens <b>208</b> can also pick up aperture stop <b>210</b> as a finite object, and create its image at a location other than second focal plane <b>212</b>. This intermediate image can then be reimaged by the eyepiece <b>216</b> into exit pupil <b>218</b>. In this way, second focal plane <b>212</b> may be the real image of first focal plane <b>202</b>, and exit pupil <b>218</b> the real image of aperture stop <b>210</b>. Light emitted from the focusing lens <b>208</b> may converge as it propagates. The focusing lens <b>208</b> may include a converging lens such that the focal length of focusing lens <b>208</b> is positive and is defined by the distance at which a beam of collimated light from the aperture stop <b>210</b> will be focused to a single spot.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other implementations, the focusing lens <b>208</b> may diverge the image of the aperture stop as it propagates. In this regard, light emitted from the focusing lens <b>208</b> may diverge as it propagates. The focusing lens <b>208</b> may include a diverging lens such that the focal length of focusing lens <b>208</b> is negative and is defined by the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the focusing lens <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optical system <b>200</b> may include an afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> defined by the focusing lens <b>208</b> and the eyepiece <b>216</b>. The afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may relay an image of the aperture stop <b>210</b> or light propagating therethrough. The afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may be disposed downstream of the first focal plane <b>202</b>, relay lens assembly <b>204</b>, and/or the aperture stop <b>210</b>. The afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may optically transform light emanating from the aperture stop <b>210</b> and may extend the length of optical system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may maintain a cross-section of light emanating from the first focal plane <b>202</b>. For example, the afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may allow a beam of light from the aperture stop <b>210</b> to propagate therethrough to a user where the beam of light undergoes zero net convergence or divergence. In this regard, the afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may include an infinite effective focal length. As such the distance between the focusing lens <b>208</b> and the eyepiece <b>216</b> may equal the sum of focal lengths of the focusing lens <b>208</b> and the eyepiece <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although the afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may not alter the divergence or convergence of the beam of light exiting the aperture stop <b>210</b>, afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may alter a transverse footprint of the beam of light, increasing magnification. As such, afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may provide transverse magnification to the beam of light exiting the aperture stop <b>210</b>. Transverse magnification may refer to magnification measured in planes perpendicular or transverse to the optical axis <b>108</b>. For example, the height of the footprint of the beam of light exiting the aperture stop <b>210</b> may be increased by afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> through a transverse magnification factor. A negative transverse magnification denotes an inverted image. Transverse magnification as described herein is different than longitudinal magnification which defines a factor by which an image increases in size, as measured along the optical axis. The transverse magnification of the afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> may remain as a constant value.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The optical system <b>200</b> may include an axial gain factor. The axial gain factor refers to a factor by which an exit pupil <b>218</b> shifts axially relative the components within optical system <b>200</b>. The axial gain factor may determine a distance <b>220</b> between the outer surface of the last lens of the eyepiece <b>216</b> to a position where the exit pupil <b>218</b> is formed. The exit pupil may include a transverse plane along the optical axis <b>108</b>. A user's eye positioned at the exit pupil <b>218</b> allows the user to obtain a full viewing angle of the beam of light exiting the aperture stop <b>210</b>. If the user's eye is outside of the exit pupil <b>218</b>, a reduced field of view of the beam of light exiting the aperture stop <b>210</b> will be obtained.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Where the traverse magnification of the afocal lens assembly <b>214</b> is M, an axial gain factor of the optical system <b>200</b> is represented by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Axial Gain Factor=M<sup>2 </sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Where the absolute value of M is greater than 1, unexpectedly large axial shifts of an exit focal plane can <b>218</b> be observed.

In this regard, the axial shift of the aperture stop <b>212</b> along the optical axis <b>108</b> is rationally related to the axial gain factor such that the axial gain factor defines a multiple to which the eye relief <b>220</b> increases based on the axial shift of the aperture stop <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first-order design implementation of an optical system <b>200</b> with adjustable eye relief is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> displays optical system <b>200</b> in two different configurations, the two different configurations differing based on a position of the aperture stop <b>210</b>.
