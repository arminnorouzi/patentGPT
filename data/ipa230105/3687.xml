All other embodiments obtained by a person ordinary skilled in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure without any creative efforts fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the related technologies, combined utilization of functions of microfluidic devices and a variety of detection devices has been realized successfully, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and fluorescence detection. However, in combined utilization, the microfluidic device and the detection device are separated from each other, and the large size of the detection device makes it impossible to integrate with the microfluidic device with a small size in the same chip.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In view of the above, the present disclosure provides a micro total analysis system, an operating method and a manufacturing method thereof, which can solve the problem in the related technologies that, the microfluidic device and the detection device are separated from each other, the detection device has a large size and the microfluidic device and the detection device cannot be integrated in the same chip.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present disclosure provides a micro total analysis system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the micro total analysis system includes at least one micro total analysis unit. Each micro total analysis unit includes:</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">a microfluidic device, which includes a first electrode <b>110</b> and a dielectric layer <b>120</b> connected to each other, and the dielectric layer <b>120</b> is configured to drive a to-be-measured droplet to move based on a voltage of the first electrode <b>110</b>; and</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">an acoustic wave detection device, which includes a second electrode <b>130</b> connected to the dielectric layer <b>120</b>, the dielectric layer <b>120</b> is reused as a transducer of the acoustic wave detection device, and is configured to generate an acoustic wave toward the to-be-measured droplet based on a voltage of the second electrode <b>130</b>, and generate a detection result corresponding to the to-be-measured droplet based on a received acoustic wave.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the dielectric layer in each micro total analysis unit can be used as a part of the microfluidic device to drive the to-be-measured droplet to move based on the voltage of the first electrode, and can also be used as a part of the acoustic wave detection device to generate the acoustic wave toward the to-be-measured droplet based on the voltage of the second electrode, and generate the detection result corresponding to the to-be-measured droplet based on the received acoustic wave, thereby realizing integration of the microfluidic device and the acoustic wave detection device in the same chip. Therefore, the technical solution according to the present disclosure enables the microfluidic device and the acoustic wave detection device to be integrated in the same chip.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, two thin-film transistors (TFT) are formed on a base substrate of each micro total analysis unit, one of the TFTs is a driving TFT, and the other of the TFTs is a detection TFT. The driving TFT is connected to the first electrode <b>110</b> and is configured to provide, a voltage for driving the droplet to move, to the first electrode <b>110</b> in a case that an electrical connection between a source of the driving TFT and a drain of the driving TFT are turned on. The detection TFT is connected to the second electrode <b>130</b> and is configured to provide, a voltage for causing the dielectric layer <b>120</b> to emit the acoustic wave, to the second electrode <b>130</b> in a case that an electrical connection between a source of the detection TFT and a drain of the detection TFT are turned on. The above two TFTs may be manufactured by a back channel etch (BCE) process, or may be manufactured by an amorphous silicon (a-Si) process.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first electrode <b>110</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b> are located on a side of the two TFTs facing away from the base substrate, and the dielectric layer <b>120</b> covers the first electrode <b>110</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b>, and is connected to the first electrode <b>110</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b>. For example, the acoustic impedance of metal molybdenum (Mo) is 64.2 Mrayl, and both the first electrode <b>110</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b> may be made of metal Mo.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first electrode <b>110</b> of each micro total analysis unit may be an electrode located only on one side of the to-be-measured droplet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, so that an electric field for driving the to-be-measured droplet to move is formed between the first electrodes <b>110</b> in the multiple micro total analysis units, and then the to-be-measured droplet is driven to move in the micro total analysis system.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first electrode <b>110</b> of each micro total analysis unit may be two electrodes disposed on opposite sides of the to-be-measured droplet, an electric field for driving the to-be-measured droplet to move is formed between the two electrodes, and then the to-be-measured droplet is driven to move in the micro total analysis unit.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the dielectric layer <b>120</b> has a dielectric property. The dielectric layer <b>120</b> is polarized after receiving the voltage provided by the first electrode <b>110</b>. According to the principle that the like charges repel each other, the polarized dielectric layer <b>120</b> can apply a repulsive force to the to-be-measured droplet so as to drive the to-be-measured droplet to move. In addition, increase in charge density results in increase in the repulsive force, improving the driving force on the to-be-measured droplet, and realizing the effect that the first electrode <b>110</b> can drive the to-be-measured droplet to move with a low driving voltage.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the dielectric layer <b>120</b> also has a piezoelectric property. The dielectric layer <b>120</b> may generate vibration under control of the voltage of the second electrode <b>130</b> to emit the acoustic wave, i.e., acting as the transducer of the acoustic wave detection device; and may also generate a voltage signal corresponding to the acoustic wave when vibrated by the acoustic wave, i.e., acting as a detector.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the case where the first electrode <b>110</b> is located only on one side of the to-be-measured droplet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dielectric layer <b>120</b> is located on the same side of the to-be-measured droplet. In this case, the dielectric layer <b>120</b> emits an acoustic wave and receives an acoustic wave in a time division manner. In emitting the acoustic wave, the dielectric layer <b>120</b> generates, according to the voltage provided by the second electrode <b>130</b>, vibration to emit the acoustic wave; and in receiving the acoustic wave, the second electrode <b>130</b> does not provide voltage to the dielectric layer <b>120</b>, and the dielectric layer <b>120</b> vibrates to deform according to the received acoustic wave, so as to obtain the corresponding voltage signal.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a case where the first electrode <b>110</b> includes two electrodes on opposite sides of the to-be-measured droplet, the dielectric layer <b>120</b> includes two dielectric layers <b>120</b> on opposite sides of the to-be-measured droplet, and each of the two dielectric layers <b>120</b> is located between the to-be-measured droplet and the electrode. One of the dielectric layers <b>120</b> is configured to generate vibration according to the voltage provided by the second electrode <b>130</b> so as to emit an acoustic wave, while the other of the dielectric layers <b>120</b> is configured to vibrate according to a received acoustic wave so as to generate deformation, thereby obtaining the corresponding voltage signal.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the case where the dielectric layer <b>120</b> is located on only one side of the to-be-measured droplet, the emitted acoustic wave needs to be reflected back to the dielectric layer <b>120</b> from the other side of the to-be-measured droplet.
