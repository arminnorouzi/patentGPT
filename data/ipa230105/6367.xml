China has allocated new and higher frequency bands for operators to widen and use 5G, and the 5G frequency bands allocated for the operators are different. Specifically, China Mobile's 5G frequency bands are 2.515-2.675 GHz and 4.8-4.9 GHz; China Telecom's 5G frequency band is 3.4-3.5 GHz; and China Unicom's 5G frequency band is 3.5-3.6 GHz. How to use one antenna to cover all the forgoing 5G frequency bands has become the key to saving the site resources of the base station. The 5G frequency band, due to the relatively large frequency band span, is fully covered only by increasing the size of the traditional broadband base station antennas. However, increasing the antenna size and saving the site resources of the base station are contradictory.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a 5G broadband dual-polarized base station antenna of a multimode resonance structure, for achieving broadband characteristics.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To implement the foregoing objective, the present disclosure provides the following solutions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A 5G broadband dual-polarized base station antenna of a multimode resonance structure includes a first resonance structure, a main radiating unit, a feed balun set, and a metal reflecting plate, where the feed balun set is disposed on the metal reflecting plate, the main radiating unit is disposed on a first feed balun and a second feed balun, and the first resonance structure is disposed on the main radiating unit;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">the main radiating unit includes a second resonance structure and a third resonance structure, the first resonance structure is configured to control a resonance point at a high frequency, and the third resonance structure is configured to control a resonance point at a low frequency; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">the feed balun set is configured to provide a balance current for the main radiating unit and the first resonance structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the first resonance structure is provided with a plurality of vias.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the main radiating unit is provided with a plurality of vias.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the feed balun set includes the first feed balun and the second feed balun, the first feed balun and the second feed balun have the same structure, each of the first feed balun and the second feed balun includes a F-shaped feed structure disposed on the front as well as metal patches, a groove, upper pins, and lower pins that are disposed on the back, the first feed balun and the second feed balun cross through the grooves, the upper pins run through the vias of the main radiating unit and the vias of the first resonance structure sequentially to provide the balance current for the main radiating unit and the first resonance structure, and fix the main radiating unit and the first resonance structure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the metal reflecting plate is provided with vias, and the lower pins run through the vias of the metal reflecting plate to fix the feed balun set and the metal reflecting plate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, the metal reflecting plate is made of aluminium and is 1 mm thin.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, there are two upper pins and two lower pins.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, there are four vias on each of the main radiating unit, the first resonance structure, and the metal reflecting plate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Based on specific embodiments provided in the present disclosure, the present disclosure has the following technical effects:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The 5G broadband dual-polarized base station antenna of a multimode resonance structure provided by the present disclosure includes: a first resonance structure, a main radiating unit, a feed balun set, and a metal reflecting plate, where the feed balun set is disposed on the metal reflecting plate, the main radiating unit is disposed on a first feed balun and a second feed balun, and the first resonance structure is disposed on the main radiating unit; the main radiating unit includes a second resonance structure and a third resonance structure, the first resonance structure is configured to control a resonance point at a high frequency, and the third resonance structure is configured to control a resonance point at a low frequency; and the feed balun set is configured to provide a balance current for the main radiating unit and the first resonance structure.

The resonance structure (<b>10021</b>) controls the resonance point at a high frequency. The resonance structure (<b>10022</b>) controls the resonance point at a low frequency. In this case, the main radiating unit (<b>1002</b>) further has four vias (<b>1100</b>) (<b>1101</b>) (<b>1102</b>) (<b>1103</b>) that are connected to the feed baluns (<b>1003</b>) (<b>1004</b>).

The main radiating unit (<b>1002</b>) is provided with the two resonance structures (<b>10021</b>) (<b>10022</b>). The resonance structure (<b>10022</b>) mainly generates a first resonance point. The position of the resonance point can be changed by adjusting the length of the resonance structure (<b>10022</b>) branch. The resonance structure (<b>10021</b>) mainly generates a second resonance point. The position of the second resonance point can be changed by adjusting the length of the resonance structure (<b>10021</b>) branch.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first resonance structure (<b>1001</b>) is located at the top of the antenna, and is fed by using the feed baluns (<b>1003</b>) (<b>1004</b>).

The position of the third resonance point can be changed by changing the size of the first resonance structure (<b>1001</b>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The feed baluns (<b>1003</b>) (<b>1004</b>) transform the provided unbalanced current into a balance current required by the main radiating unit (<b>1002</b>) and the first resonance structure (<b>1001</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The metal reflecting plate (<b>1005</b>) decreases backward radiation of each antenna unit to increase the antenna gain.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The main radiating unit (<b>1002</b>) generates two resonance points at a relatively low frequency band. When the positions of the two resonance points are close to each other, the bandwidth of the antenna can achieve a return loss greater than 10 dB in a frequency band. The resonance structure (<b>10022</b>) generates the first frequency point. The position of the first resonance point can be changed by adjusting the size of the branch on the resonance structure (<b>10022</b>), while the adjacent resonance structures are coupled to widen the bandwidth. The resonance structure (<b>10021</b>) generates a second resonance point. The position of the second resonance point can be shifted by changing the size of the branch on the resonance structure (<b>10021</b>), while the resonance structure (<b>10021</b>) and the resonance structure (<b>10022</b>) are coupled to further widen the bandwidth generated by the second resonance point. The positions of the two resonance points are changed by properly adjusting the size of the branches on the two resonance structures (<b>10021</b>) (<b>10022</b>). Under the combined action of the two generated resonance points, the antenna achieves a return loss greater than 10 dB in a relatively low frequency band. The third resonance point can be generated by loading the first resonance structure (<b>1001</b>) above the main radiating unit (<b>1002</b>). The position of the resonance point is at a high frequency. The position of the third resonance point is adjusted by properly changing the size of the first resonance structure (<b>1001</b>). The antenna's final antenna return loss is greater than 10 dB in the 2.5-5.5 GHz frequency band.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The simulation results of the 5G broadband dual-polarized base station antenna of a multimode resonance structure are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Adjusting the resonance structure (<b>10022</b>) on the main radiating unit (<b>1002</b>) enables the generated resonance point to be located near 2.7 GHz, the resonance point generated by the resonance structure (<b>10021</b>) to be located near 4.4 GHz, and the resonance point generated by the resonance structure (<b>1001</b>) to be located near 5.1 GHz. Under the combined action of the three resonance points, the operation bandwidth of the antenna is 2.5-5.5 GHz, while the port isolation is greater than 30 dB. The simulation result of the gain of the 5G broadband dual-polarized base station antenna of the multimode resonance structure at each frequency point is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, showing that the gains of the antenna in its operation frequency band are relatively stable.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each embodiment of this specification is described in a progressive manner, each embodiment focuses on the difference from other embodiments, and the same and similar parts between the embodiments may refer to each other.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this specification, some specific embodiments are used for illustration of the principles and implementations of the present disclosure.
