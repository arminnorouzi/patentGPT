id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to seed material pellets of elongated form each comprising at least one seed of elongated form, wherein the pellets consist of the seeds embedded within a matrix, and wherein at least 80% of the seeds are oriented in directions essentially parallel to the pellets.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Seed material pellets of the kind described above are known from the document DE 10 2005 040 873 A1. The insofar known pellets comprise one single seed in each pellet, wherein the seed is coated with a matrix consisting of a plurality of layers of different composition. The production process of these pellets is complicated and related with high costs due to the multilayer structure of the matrix surrounding the single seed. Furthermore, the total weight of a pellet is rather low and only little above the weight of a single seed, resulting in that the pellets are easily washed away from the area where the pellets have been brought out, typically washing a higher number of pellets to a few parts of the area being a bit lower than the rest of the area. Consequently the area shows growth in a very inhomogeneous manner. This is in particular undesirable when planting a lawn or supplementing an existing lawn in places of need of additional grass plants.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The document DE 43 09 679 A1 discloses seed material pellets each comprising several seeds, wherein one seed is embedded in a core matrix and further seeds are embedded in a mantle matrix different from the core matrix, wherein the mantle matrix in addition comprises more than one layer. These seed material pellets are also difficult to make and consequently have high production costs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The document DE 849 195 discloses a machine for making seed material pellets, wherein the resulting pellets are of spherical form. This particular machine is rather unsuitable for elongated seeds, since there is considerable risk to damage the seeds during the manufacturing process.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is the technical object of the invention to provide seed material pellets comprising elongated seeds, which are easily manufactured, show low to absent damage in the embedded seeds, and provide uniform sowing results, even after watering of the area of sowing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>show two cross sections through a seed material pellet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a longitudinal cross section through a seed material pellet and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a cross section in the plane A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a top view of an apparatus for the production of seed material pellets.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a side view of an apparatus for the production of seed material pellets.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BASICS OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve this technical object, the invention teaches seed material pellets of elongated form each comprising at least two seeds of elongated form, wherein the pellets consist of the seeds embedded within a matrix, wherein at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, most preferably at least 90%, of the seeds are oriented in directions essentially parallel to the pellets, wherein the matrix does not comprise distinct layers of different constitution.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The term &#x201c;elongated form&#x201d; is defined such that the pellet and the seed have a first dimension, which is the maximum extension of the pellet or seed. The pellet and the seed have a second dimension orthogonal to the first extension, which is smaller than the first extension. The ratio of the first extension to the second extension (hereinafter called form ratio) typically is in the range from 1,5:1 to 15:1, preferably in the range from 3:1 to 10:1. The general form may be essentially cylindrical, essentially in form of a barrel, or essentially a rotation ellipsoid (with or without cut off ends). In the latter cases the curvature may vary over the length of the pellet or seed, in particular also change signs. An example for a pellet with a curvature with changing sign is the dumbbell form or a chain of dumbbell forms. In the described cases, the cross section orthogonal to the longitudinal axis is essentially circular, but such cross section may as well be non-circular, e.g. of essentially elliptic form. In any case, the first dimension is the maximum extension IS parallel to a longitudinal axis, whereas the second dimension is the maximum extension within all cross sections orthogonal to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;embedded&#x201d; means that a seed is completely surrounded and in direct contact with the matrix material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The term &#x201c;essentially parallel&#x201d; means that the longitudinal axes of the pellets and the seeds are essentially parallel, i.e. the angle of these two axes to each other is less than 45&#xb0;, in particular less than 20&#xb0;, preferably less than 10&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Orientation of the seeds in directions essentially parallel to the pellets means that the respective longitudinal axes are essentially parallel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the invention the matrix into which the seeds are embedded is essentially uniform in constitution (nevertheless allowing other particles than seeds being additionally embedded into the nevertheless uniform actual matrix material). In particular the seeds are not coated with materials constituting a core mantle structure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Seed material pellets according to the invention are produced with simple manufacturing processes and thus cost effective in the production, due to the essentially uniform constitution of the matrix. Furthermore, seed material pellets of the invention have a total weight sufficient to ensure that subsequent watering after sowing will not wash away considerable amounts of the pellets. In fact, the seed material pellets of the invention may be engineered to any desired specific total weight without significantly altering the actual manufacturing process or the principle constitution of the pellets. This in the end ensures that a sowing area shows better uniformity in the distribution of plants growing from the seeds. Furthermore, the form ration of the pellets may be engineered according to the needs of a specific sowing area. For example for a well leveled sowing area a form ratio of the pellets may be comparatively low, i.e. in the range from 1,5:1 to 5:1. In sowing areas, which are not leveled, like embankments or hillsides, the form ratio preferably is comparatively high, i.e. for example in the range 3:1 to 10:1, by which the risk for the pellets to roll downhill and/or being washed away by water (rain or sprinkling) is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following preferred but non-limiting embodiments are described in detail.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably one pellet comprises 2 to 15 seeds. A pellet typically has a total weight in the range of 10 to 500 mg, preferably 50 to 250 mg. The weight of one seed may be in the range of 2 to 5 mg. The weight of (all) the seeds in one pellet is typically in the range of 4 to 75 mg.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The maximum diameter (second dimension) of the pellets may be in the range of 1 to 5 mm, preferably 1,5 to 2,5 mm. The maximum dimension (first dimension) of the pellets is higher than the maximum diameter of the pellets, preferably in the range of 6 to 20 mm.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The matrix is of essentially homogenous constitution. This means that the matrix material, wherein the seeds and optionally other particles are embedded, does (essentially) not vary in constitution spatially.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Particulate compounds different from the seeds may be additionally embedded in the matrix. Examples of such compounds comprise organic or inorganic fibers, preferably selected from the group consisting of natural treated or untreated organic fibers, wood fibers, coconut fibers, peat fibers, flax fibers, hemp fibers and cotton fibers, and/or particles comprising compounds selected from the group consisting of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, soil chemistry humins, plant hormones, in particular for the stimulation of gibberellins, amino acids, carbohydrates, in particular glucose, ribose, galactose, unsaturated C11 to C28 fatty acids, ionic compounds comprising K, Mg, Mn, Fe and/or Cu ions, and fertilizers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The matrix preferably is porous in order to allow water to enter into the matrix so that dissolution or disintegration of the matrix may be promoted in an enhanced manner. The porosity may in particular be in the range of 0,001 to 0,900, preferably 0,050 to 0,300, calculated as the total volume of cavities in the matrix divided through the total volume of the matrix, including the cavities.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally any matrix material useful in the field of seed materials may be employed. Preferably the matrix is selected form the group consisting of water soluble organic polymers, in particular polyvinyl alcohols (PVAL), polysaccharides, dextrin, starch, pectin, cellulose, hemicelluloses, cellulose acetate, ethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, oxyethylcellulose, oxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin, lignin, plant gums, alginate, chitin, proteins, inorganic binders, planting earth, clay, and bentonite.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Generally the invention is useful for all kinds of seeds, which exhibit an elongated form. Preferably the seeds are selected from the group consisting of Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae having elongated form, in particular perennial grasses, lawn grasses, wheat, rye, oat, maize, millet, rice, teff, amaranth, buckwheat, and barley.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Specifically preferred are lawn grass seeds.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Seed material pellets of the invention are obtainable in that the seeds are embedded in the matrix and the matrix comprising the seeds is formed to produce the pellets.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention also relates to a sowing method, wherein seed material pellets according to the invention are distributed onto the soil of a sowing area, the seed material pellets are optionally pressed into the soil, and the sowing area is watered.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention finally relates to the use of seed material pellets according to the invention for sowing within a sowing area, in particular for sowing a lawn.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the following the invention is explained in more detail with reference to non-limiting examples.

This apparatus comprises a conveyor belt <b>4</b>. A plate <b>5</b> is arranged above the conveyor belt <b>4</b>. This plate consists of a first region <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a second region <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The first region <b>5</b><i>a </i>stands in an angle of 3&#xb0; to the surface of the conveyor belt <b>4</b>, such that the space between the first region <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the conveyor belt <b>4</b> becomes narrower in the run direction of the conveyor belt surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The second region <b>5</b><i>b</i>, in contrast, is essentially parallel to surface of the conveyor belt <b>4</b>. The second region <b>5</b><i>b </i>has side edges <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, which approach one another forming the tip <b>8</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0042">The pellets according to the invention are made as following. Initially, seeds, matrix material and optionally other particles are mixed with each other such that the weight ratio matrix/seeds is for example about 8. Then spherical pellets are formed from this mixture by in the art well known processes, wherein each spherical pellet has a total weight of about 1 to 5 g and contains about seeds. The seeds have no preferred orientation within these spherical pellets.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0043">In order to transform these spherical pellets into the pellets of the invention, the former are supplied to the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> at a position where the distance of the plate <b>5</b> to the conveyor belt <b>4</b> is largest. The conveyor belt <b>4</b> transports the spherical pellets in direction of the second region <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>5</b>, thereby increasingly compressing the pellets between the first region <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>5</b> and the conveyor belt <b>4</b>, such that the spherical pellets are transformed into cylinders. Such transformation is possible due to the ductile properties of the matrix material. Along the runway between the first region <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the plate and the conveyor belt <b>4</b> the diameter of the cylinders decreases and the length of the cylinders increases. During this rolling process not only the form of the pellets is transformed from a sphere to a cylinder, but at the same time the elongate seeds in the pellets become oriented essentially in parallel to the cylinder axis of a pellet. Without wanting to be bound to theory, the reason for this orientation of the seeds is that upon the rotation and transportation between the plate <b>5</b> and the conveyor belt <b>4</b> transverse forces act on the seeds within the matrix, thus rotating seeds into orientations, which are essentially parallel to the rotational axis of the pellets, which is the cylinder axis of the pellets. A great advantage of the process using the described apparatus is that the seeds are rotated very slowly and carefully within the matrix into the orientation of the cylinder axis, thus avoiding that seeds are irreversibly harmed such that they will not be of any use any more. When the cylindrical pellets leave the space between the first region <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>5</b> and the conveyor belt <b>4</b>, they enter into the second region <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>5</b> and the conveyor belt <b>4</b>. Here the side edges <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> of the second region <b>5</b><i>b </i>act as separation elements, effecting that a cylindrical pellet coming from the first region <b>5</b><i>a </i>will be divided into a number of shorter cylindrical pellets, in the example about 8. The resulting cylindrical pellets leaving the apparatus at the right hand are the final pellets of the invention. Typically a drying step may be incorporated before the pellets go to the customer.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
