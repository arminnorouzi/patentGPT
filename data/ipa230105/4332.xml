The system <b>100</b> includes a server <b>104</b>, printing systems <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>108</b>-<b>2</b>, and client devices <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>112</b>-<b>3</b>. The printing systems <b>108</b>, and the client devices <b>112</b> are connected to the server <b>104</b> via communication links <b>106</b>. The system <b>100</b> enables cloud- or web-based printing, and hence the communication links <b>106</b> may utilize suitable wide area networks (WAN), including cellular networks and the Internet. The communication links <b>106</b> may further utilize local area networks defined by one or more routers, switches, wireless access points, or the like.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The server <b>104</b> provides a cloud-based printing service so that a connected client device <b>112</b> may print to a printing system <b>108</b> via the server <b>104</b>. More specifically, the server <b>104</b> is configured to enable cloud printing without requiring account creation or authentication. To enable this, the server <b>104</b> maps print system network identifiers (e.g., a uniform resource locator or URL) to each printing system <b>108</b>. The print system network identifier is configured for identifying print parameters for print jobs. That is, print jobs may be initiated directly using the print system network identifier and may be processed without requiring authentication by the requesting client device <b>112</b>. Thus, the print system network identifier is also configured to bypass authentication at the server <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In operation, the server <b>104</b> generates at least one print system network identifier for each printing system <b>108</b> registered with the server <b>104</b>. Each print system network identifier maps to a corresponding printing system <b>108</b> and is configured for identifying print parameters for the print job. That is, the print system network identifier allows the print parameters for a print job to be specified at the client devices <b>112</b>. For example, the print system network identifier may correspond to a web page in which end users may input print parameters, submission of which acts as a print request when received at the server <b>104</b>. Alternately, the print parameters may be appended as variables to the print system network identifiers to form a print job network identifier, which acts as a print request when received at the server <b>104</b>. Thus, access to the print system network identifiers enables print requests to be directly generated based on the print system network identifier.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The print system network identifiers may therefore be shared or distributed, including to third parties to reduce the number of back-and-forth communications required between the parties. For example, in a conventional model, an end user may request and download a document from a third party, and then generate a print request to print the document. In the present example, the end user may provide the print system network identifier to the third party. The third party may then generate the print request to print the document using the print system network identifier directly, and without the end user downloading the document. Advantageously, since the print request is generated using the print system network identifier directly, the third party may bypass authentication requirements with the server <b>104</b> and proceed to generate the print request.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The printing systems <b>108</b> may include any suitable systems configured to communicate with the server <b>104</b> via the communication links <b>106</b> and to print documents or other data. For example, the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> includes a printer <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> and a separate computing device <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a print server, or the like, which is interconnected with the printer <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> to bridge between the printer <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> and network communications with the server <b>104</b>. The printing system <b>108</b>-<b>2</b> includes a cloud-enabled printer <b>109</b>-<b>2</b> having an integrated printer communications interface <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> to allow the printer <b>109</b>-<b>2</b> to communicate directly with the server <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The client devices <b>112</b> may be computing devices, such as desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile devices, kiosks, other servers, tablets, or other suitable computing devices. In particular, the client devices <b>112</b> are configured to communicate with the server <b>104</b> via the communication links <b>106</b> to initiate print jobs at one of the printing systems <b>108</b>. The client devices <b>112</b> include suitable hardware (e.g., including communication interfaces, processors, memories, user interfaces, and the like) to enable the functionality described herein. For example, the client devices <b>112</b> may implement a web browser application to access the print system network identifier and to allow the user to input print parameters for a particular print job.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the server <b>104</b>, including certain internal components, is shown in greater detail. The server <b>104</b> includes a processor <b>200</b> interconnected with a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, such as a memory <b>204</b>. The memory <b>204</b> includes a combination of volatile memory (e.g. Random Access Memory or RAM) and non-volatile memory (e.g. read only memory or ROM, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory or EEPROM, flash memory). The processor <b>200</b> and the memory <b>204</b> may each comprise one or more integrated circuits.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The memory <b>204</b> stores computer-readable instructions for execution by the processor <b>200</b>. In particular, the memory <b>204</b> stores a control application <b>208</b> which, when executed by the processor <b>200</b>, configures the processor <b>200</b> to perform various functions discussed below in greater detail and related to the printing operation of the server <b>104</b>. The application <b>208</b> may also be implemented as a suite of distinct applications. The processor <b>200</b>, when so configured by the execution of the application <b>208</b>, may also be referred to as a controller <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functionality implemented by the processor <b>200</b> may also be implemented by one or more specially designed hardware and firmware components, such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and the like in other embodiments. In an embodiment, the processor <b>200</b> may be, respectively, a special purpose processor which may be implemented via dedicated logic circuitry of an ASIC, an FPGA, or the like in order to enhance the processing speed of the dimensioning operations discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The memory <b>204</b> also includes a repository <b>212</b> storing rules and data for printing operations. For example, the repository <b>212</b> may define, for each printing system <b>108</b>, a print system network identifier, printing configuration rules, and other data pertaining to the printing system <b>108</b> (e.g., a nickname, print job thresholds, or the like). The printing configuration rules may include driver interfaces, communication protocols for sending print parameters and print data, or the like. In particular, each printing system <b>108</b> may have different printing configuration rules, and hence the repository <b>212</b> may define appropriate printing configuration rules for each printing system <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The server <b>104</b> also includes a communications interface <b>216</b> interconnected with the processor <b>200</b>. The communications interface <b>216</b> includes suitable hardware (e.g. transmitters, receivers, network interface controllers and the like) allowing the server <b>104</b> to communicate with other computing devices&#x2014;such as the printing systems <b>108</b> and the client devices <b>112</b>&#x2014;via the links <b>106</b>. The specific components of the communications interface <b>216</b> are selected based on the type of network or other links that the server <b>104</b> is to communicate over. The server <b>104</b> can be configured, for example, to communicate with the client devices <b>112</b> to receive print requests, and to send print instructions to the printing systems <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The processor <b>200</b> may also be connected to one or more input and/or output devices <b>224</b>. The input devices <b>224</b> can include one or more keyboards, mice, touch-sensitive display screens or the like. The output devices <b>224</b> can further include one or more display screens, sound generators, or the like for providing output or feedback to an operator.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The functionality of the server <b>104</b>, as implemented via execution of the applications <b>208</b> by the processor <b>200</b> will now be described in greater detail, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a method <b>300</b> of cloud-based printing, which will be described in conjunction with its performance in the system <b>100</b>, and in particular, by the server <b>104</b>, with reference to the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. In other examples, the method <b>300</b> may be performed in other suitable systems.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At block <b>305</b>, the server <b>104</b> generates a print system network identifier corresponding to each of the printing systems <b>108</b> associated with the server <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the server <b>104</b> may host a cloud-printing service available at the network identifier &#x201c;print.com&#x201d;. When the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> is registered with the cloud-printing service hosted by the server <b>104</b>, the server <b>104</b> may generate a print system network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>1</b>&#x201d; mapped to the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>. Similarly, when the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>2</b> is registered with the cloud-printing service hosted by the server <b>104</b>, the server <b>104</b> may generate another print system network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d; mapped to the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>2</b>. In some examples, network identifier may include a token to map to a given printing system (i.e., &#x201c;printer<b>108</b>-<b>1</b>&#x201d; or &#x201c;printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d; in the present examples) which is sufficiently long, or has a sufficient number of bytes such that randomly accessing said network identifier is computationally hard. The print system network identifiers may thus serve to identify the appropriate printing system, as will be described further herein. The print system network identifiers are also configured for identifying print parameters for print jobs, as will be described further below. The server <b>104</b> may then store associations between the print system network identifiers, the printing systems, and the printing configuration rules for interfacing with the printing systems.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, at block <b>305</b>, the server <b>104</b> may further provide the print system network identifiers to the client devices <b>112</b>. For example, the print system network identifiers may be provided at a central web page (e.g., at &#x201c;print.com/printer-list&#x201d;) for look-up by the client devices <b>112</b>. Accordingly, when a user operating the client device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> uses a web browser application to access &#x201c;print.com/printer-list&#x201d;, the server <b>104</b> may provide the corresponding web page, listing the printing systems <b>108</b> for selection. In some examples, users may be required to authenticate or log in prior to viewing the list of printing systems <b>108</b> available for selection. The printing systems <b>108</b> may further be associated with a nickname and/or a description to allow the end users to differentiate the printing systems <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>108</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may be associated with the description &#x201c;black and white printer&#x201d; while the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>2</b> may be associated with the description &#x201c;color printer&#x201d;. The listing may further include a status indicators and other printing system status information for each of the printing systems <b>108</b>. For example, if the computing device <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> is offline, the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may be unavailable. Other printing system status information may include, for example, a current queue length for documents queued to be printed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The user may then select a printing system <b>108</b> at the client device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>, which generates a network identifier request. Responsive to the network identifier request, the server <b>104</b> may retrieve and provide the stored print system network identifier of the selected printing systems <b>108</b> and present it on the web page.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other examples, rather than retrieving and providing the stored print system network identifier of the selected printing systems <b>108</b>, responsive to each network identifier request, the server <b>104</b> may generate a new print system network identifier mapped to the printing system for each subsequent network identifier request. Thus, for example, new print system network identifier for the printing system <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may include &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>1</b>/req<b>2</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>1</b>/req<b>3</b>&#x201d; and so on. The new print system network identifiers similarly identify the corresponding printing system <b>108</b> and are configured for identifying print parameters for print jobs. The new print system network identifiers are further configured to bypass authentication at the server <b>104</b>. Thus, the server <b>104</b> may map many print system identifiers to each printing system <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Other criteria for generating new print system network identifiers are also contemplated. For example, the server <b>104</b> may generate new print system network identifiers based on distinct user identifiers, internet protocol (IP) addresses, or other suitable criteria. For example, users may log in or otherwise be authenticated in the system <b>100</b>, and hence the server <b>104</b> may assign a unique print system network identifier to each user identifier. In further examples, rather than retrieving and providing the stored print system network identifier for the selected printing system <b>108</b>, the web page listing the printing systems <b>108</b> may also directly present the print system network identifiers corresponding to the listed printing systems <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>310</b>, the server <b>104</b> receives a print request, for example from the client device <b>112</b>. Specifically, the print request is generated based on the print system network identifier and includes one or more print parameters for a print job. For example, the print system network identifier may correspond to a web page configured to receive the one or more print parameters for the print job. In particular, submission of the print parameters at the web page may act as the print request to the server <b>104</b>. In other examples, the print request may correspond to a print job network identifier which includes the one or more print parameters appended to the print system network identifier.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> an example method <b>400</b> of receiving a print request and a schematic of the method <b>400</b> are depicted. In particular, in the example method <b>400</b>, the print system network identifier corresponds to a web page configured to receive the one or more print parameters for the print job.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At block <b>405</b>, the server <b>104</b> receives a request <b>408</b> to resolve the print system network identifier. In particular, a user of the client device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> may use a web browser application to access the network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d;. Accordingly, the client device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> generates the request <b>408</b> to resolve the URL. According to standard communication protocols, the request <b>408</b> may be sent to the server <b>104</b>, which hosts the network identifier &#x201c;print.com&#x201d;, to be resolved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At block <b>410</b>, the server <b>104</b> resolves the request <b>408</b>, and provides, to the client device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>, a web page <b>412</b> corresponding to the network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d;. The web page <b>412</b> is configured to receive print parameters for the print job. For example, the web page <b>412</b> may be a form or the like, to allow the user to specify the number of copies of the document and other parameters of the print job. To identify the document to be printed, the web page <b>412</b> may accept uploads, or another network identifier (e.g., a URL) indicating the path of the document.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At block <b>415</b>, the server <b>104</b> receives, via a submission request at the web page <b>412</b>, a print request <b>418</b> including the one or more parameters input at the web page <b>412</b> for the print job. For example, once the user has input the print parameters at the web page <b>412</b>, the user may select a &#x201c;submit&#x201d; button on the web page <b>412</b> to initiate the submission request. Thus, the print request <b>418</b> including the one or more parameters is submitted to the server <b>104</b>. In some examples, after successfully receiving the print request <b>418</b>, the server <b>104</b> may return a status indicator <b>420</b> to the client device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, the status indicator <b>420</b> may simply indicate the success or failure of transmission of the print request <b>418</b> to the server <b>104</b>. In other examples, the status indicator <b>420</b> may be dynamic, and may be updated according to the progress of the print job (e.g., the print job is being transmitted to the printer, the printer is printing, the print job is complete).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, another example method <b>500</b> of receiving a print request and a schematic of the method <b>500</b> are depicted. In particular, in the example method <b>500</b>, the print parameters are to be appended to the print system network identifier to define a print job network identifying forming the print request.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>505</b>, the server <b>104</b> receives a request <b>508</b> to resolve a print job network identifier. In particular, the client device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may generate the print job network identifier by taking the print system network identifier and appending print parameters as variables to the print system network identifier. The print parameters may specify, for example, the number of copies of the document (e.g., &#x201c;num=2&#x201d;) and other parameters of the print job. To identify the document to be printed, an embedded network identifier may be included to indicate the path of the document (e.g., &#x201c;doc=docpath&#x201d;). The print system network identifier and the parameters may thus be appended to form the print job network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>/?num=2&#x26;doc=docpath&#x201d;. The client device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may then generate the request <b>508</b> to resolve the URL. According to standard communication protocols, the request <b>508</b> may be sent to the server <b>104</b>, which hosts the network identifier &#x201c;print.com&#x201d;, to be resolved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At block <b>510</b>, the server <b>104</b> resolves the request <b>508</b> and extracts the print system network identifier and print parameters <b>512</b> from the print job network identifier. The request <b>508</b> to resolve the print job network identifier thus acts as the print request for a print job having the print parameters <b>512</b>. In some examples, after successfully resolving the request <b>508</b> and extracting the print parameters <b>512</b> for the print job, the server <b>104</b> may return a status indicator <b>520</b> to the client device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, the status indicator <b>520</b> may indicate the success or failure of the resolution of the request <b>508</b> and the extraction of the print parameters <b>512</b>. In other examples, the status indicator <b>520</b> may be dynamic, and may be updated according to the progress of the print job (e.g., the print job is being transmitted to the printer, the printer is printing, the print job is complete).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, the server <b>104</b> may accommodate both the methods <b>400</b> and <b>500</b> to receive print requests. For example, users operating the mobile computing device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>, or the desktop computer <b>112</b>-<b>3</b> may use the method <b>400</b> as it provides a more user-friendly interface to input print parameters and generate the print request. Thus, a user desiring to print a document locally saved at the client devices <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> or <b>112</b>-<b>3</b> may access the web page corresponding to the print system network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d;, upload the document, and input the print parameters at the web page to generate the print request.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In contrast, the server <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may automatically interface with the server <b>104</b>, and hence it may be programmatically simpler to append print parameters to the print system network identifier to form a print job network identifier to generate the print request. For example, a user may desire to print a packaging label from &#x201c;stamps.com&#x201d;, hosted at the server <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>. Rather than downloading the packaging label from &#x201c;stamps.com&#x201d; and uploading the packaging label to the web page corresponding to &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d;, the user may provide to the server <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> the print system network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>&#x201d;. In some examples, the user may further provide to the server <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> print parameters for the print job. The server <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may then translate the print parameters and the network identifier for the packaging label into suitable variables to be appended to the print system network identifier to form the print job network identifier &#x201c;print.com/printer<b>108</b>-<b>2</b>/?num=2&#x26;doc=docpath&#x201d; for submission to the server <b>104</b> to generate the print request.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, at block <b>315</b>, the server <b>104</b> generates and sends a print instruction to the appropriate printing system <b>108</b>. In particular, the server <b>104</b> generates the print instruction according to the printing configuration rules stored in the memory <b>204</b>. The print instruction initiates the print job according to the print parameters received with the print request at block <b>310</b>. In some examples, during or after the printing system <b>108</b> is executing the print job, the server <b>104</b> may receive a status indicator from the printing system <b>108</b> and may pass the status indication along to the requesting client device <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, prior to generating the print instruction, the server <b>104</b> may perform one or more checks to ensure that print job thresholds have not been exceeded. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an example method <b>600</b> of cloud-based printing including a check of print job thresholds. The method <b>600</b> is similar to the method <b>300</b>, and like blocks are similarly numbered.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In particular, at block <b>605</b>, the server <b>104</b> generates a print system network identifier. At block <b>610</b>, the server <b>104</b> receives a print request from a client device <b>112</b>, for example, by methods <b>400</b> or <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Prior to generating the print instruction, at block <b>612</b>, the server <b>104</b> checks whether a print job threshold has been exceeded. For example, the server <b>104</b> may maintain, in the memory <b>204</b>, a count of print jobs requested by an IP address over a predefined time interval (e.g., number of print jobs requested within the past 10 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, or the like). To reduce misuse of the system, the server <b>104</b> may compare the count of print jobs requested by the IP address to a threshold number of print jobs for the predefined time interval. When the count exceeds the threshold number of print jobs, the determination at block <b>612</b> is affirmative, and the server <b>104</b> proceeds to block <b>620</b>. When the count does not exceed the threshold number of print jobs, the determination at block <b>615</b> is negative and the server <b>104</b> proceeds to block <b>615</b>. In other examples, the server <b>104</b> may alternately or additionally implement other criteria for managing print jobs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At block <b>615</b>, the server <b>104</b> generates and sends the print instruction based on the printing configuration rules and the print parameters.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At block <b>620</b>, the server <b>104</b> disallows the print request and any further print jobs from the IP address. The server <b>104</b> may return a notification to the client device, for example, indicating that the maximum number of print jobs for the predefined time interval has been reached.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the foregoing specification, specific embodiments have been described.
