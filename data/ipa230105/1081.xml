Certain embodiments of the invention provide multiple, needle-free, injection devices mounted on a single wearable patch. For example, a doctor may require that a patient receives an injection of medicine every 3 hours for 3 days. Currently, if the patient is unable to inject themselves, or if the type of injection is not suitable for a patient to self-administer, then a health professional will need to make frequent visits to the patient, or else the patient may need to make frequent visits to a health clinic, or the patient may need to be hospitalized while receiving treatment. Embodiments of this invention permit the required injections to be done automatically, while the patient is wearing the invented device and possibly going about their normal daily activities.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain embodiments, each injection device is actuated by an electric current igniting a pyrotechnic charge within the injection device. In certain embodiments, electronics are employed to control the triggering or firing of each injection device. In certain embodiments, the electronics are capable of triggering or firing each injection device independently. In certain embodiments, the patch is compact and thin enough to be worn by the patient so that the injections can be administered remotely or in a predetermined timed sequence.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain embodiments, the patch is around 5 mm to 10 mm thick. In certain embodiments, the patch is suitable as a wearable device. In certain embodiments where each injection device is about 5 mm to 10 mm in diameter, several injection devices may be placed on the same wearable patch.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a wearable multiple shot injection patch can include a base having a bottom surface and a top surface. The bottom surface is configured for placement against skin of a patient. The patch further includes a first receptacle supported by the base that contains a first medication and a second receptacle supported by the base that contains a second medication. A first pyrotechnic charge is disposed in the base and between the top surface and the first receptacle. A second pyrotechnic charge is disposed in the base and between the top surface and the second receptacle. One or more electronic components are configured to trigger the first pyrotechnic charge and the second pyrotechnic charge. A first nozzle is supported by the base and disposed on an opposite side of the first receptacle from the first pyrotechnic charge. A second nozzle is supported by the base and disposed on an opposite side of the second receptacle from the second pyrotechnic charge.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a wearable multiple shot injection patch can include a base having a bottom surface and a top surface. The bottom surface is configured for placement against skin of a patient. Two or more receptacles are supported by the base and contain a solution including one or more drugs and other ingredients. The two or more receptacles release the solution simultaneously or sequentially by using pyrotechnic charge initiated by electric pulse to penetrate the skin of the patient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, a wearable injection patch can include a base having a bottom surface and a top surface. The bottom surface is configured for placement against skin of a patient. A receptacle is formed by an outer wall and contains a medication. The outer wall is supported by the base. A pyrotechnic charge is disposed in the base and between the top surface and the outer wall of the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, a method for manufacturing a wearable multiple shot injection patch can include providing a first subassembly having a bottom surface and a top surface and comprising a plurality of receptacles disposed between the bottom surface and the top surface. The bottom surface is configured for placement against skin of a patient. Each receptacle of the plurality of receptacles contains a medication. The method continues by providing a second subassembly comprising a plurality of chambers. Each chamber of the plurality of chambers includes a pyrotechnic charge. The method continues by joining the second subassembly to the top surface of the first subassembly so that the plurality of chambers are on an opposite side of the plurality of receptacles from the bottom surface.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, a method for injecting a medication through skin of a patient using a wearable patch having a bottom surface and a top surface can include adhering the bottom surface of the wearable patch to the skin of the patient, the patch comprising a plurality of receptacles and a plurality of chambers aligned with the plurality of receptacles, the plurality of receptacles being disposed between the bottom surface and the top surface with each receptacle of the plurality of receptacles containing the medication, each chamber of the plurality of chambers being disposed between the plurality of receptacles and the top surface and comprising a pyrotechnic charge; and triggering the pyrotechnic charge in at least one chamber of the plurality of chambers to compress at least one receptacle of the plurality of receptacles so as to eject the medication from the at least receptacle and through the skin of the patient.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, a wearable multiple shot injection patch can include a base having a bottom surface and a top surface, the bottom surface being configured for placement against skin of a patient; a first receptacle supported by the base and containing a first medication; a second receptacle supported by the base and containing a second medication; a first pyrotechnic charge disposed in the base and between the top surface and the first receptacle; and a second pyrotechnic charge disposed in the base and between the top surface and the second receptacle.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the technique according to the present disclosure, it is possible to provide a wearable injection patch for performing needle-free injections of medication through the skin of a patient.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a patch that includes a plurality of injection devices distributed across the patch according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of the patch from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrating one or more electronic components for triggering a plurality of pyrotechnic charges for the plurality of injection devices.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective exploded view of the patch from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrating two or more receptacles storing solution aligned below a clamp sheet and above a sheet, a mask layer, and the plurality of pyrotechnic charges.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the patch of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, as viewed along the cut-plane <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, illustrating nozzles of three of the plurality of injection devices covered by a removable release liner prior to the patch being attached to skin of a patient.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> except the release liner has been removed and one of the plurality of pyrotechnic charges has been triggered expelling the solution from its nozzle into the skin of the patient.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective exploded view of a first subassembly of the patch that includes the one or more electronic components, the plurality of pyrotechnic charges, the mask layer, and the sheet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the first subassembly from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, as viewed along the cut-plane <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, illustrating a circuit board that supports one of the plurality of pyrotechnic charges being assembled to a lower surface of the mask layer.
