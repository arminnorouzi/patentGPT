The present invention further relates to an aerosol-generating system comprising an aerosol-generating device and one such aerosol-generating article.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional aerosol-generating articles, such as filter cigarettes, typically comprise a cylindrical rod of tobacco cut filler surrounded by a paper wrapper and a cylindrical filter axially aligned, most often in an abutting end-to-end relationship, with the wrapped tobacco rod. The cylindrical filter typically comprises one or more plugs of a fibrous filtration material, such as cellulose acetate tow, circumscribed by a paper plug wrap. Conventionally, the wrapped tobacco rod and the filter are joined by a band of tipping wrapper, normally formed of an opaque paper material that circumscribes the entire length of the filter and an adjacent portion of the wrapped tobacco rod.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerosol-generating articles in which an aerosol-generating substrate, such as a tobacco-containing substrate, is heated rather than combusted, are also known in the art. Typically in such articles an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from a heat source to a physically separate aerosol-generating substrate or material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By way of example, aerosol-generating articles have been proposed wherein an aerosol is generated by electrical heating of an aerosol-generating substrate. A number of prior art documents disclose aerosol-generating devices for consuming aerosol-generating articles. Such devices include, for example, electrically heated aerosol-generating devices in which an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from one or more electrical heater elements of the aerosol-generating device to the aerosol-generating substrate of a heated aerosol-generating article. As another example, aerosol-generating articles are also known wherein an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from a combustible fuel element or heat source to an aerosol-generating substrate. The combustible fuel element or heat source may be located in contact with, within, around, or downstream of the aerosol-generating substrate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During use of one such aerosol-generating article, volatile compounds are released from the aerosol-generating substrate by heat transfer and are entrained in air drawn through the aerosol-generating article. As the released compounds cool, they condense to form an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, aerosol-generating articles of the types described may include a mouthpiece comprising a filter segment formed of porous filtration material such as cellulose acetate. In some known aerosol-generating articles a hollow tubular segment formed of a filtration material such as cellulose acetate is provided at a location between the aerosol-generating substrate and the mouth end of the article to impart structural strength to the article.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A number of aerosol-generating articles have also been described that comprise a hollow tube segment formed of fibrous filtration material. By way of example, aerosol-generating articles have been disclosed that, in addition to the rod of aerosol-generating substrate, comprise a support element in the form of a hollow acetate tube. In a particular embodiment, one such aerosol-generating article comprises, in linear sequential arrangement, a rod of aerosol-generating substrate, a hollow acetate tube located immediately downstream of the aerosol-generating substrate, an aerosol-cooling element located downstream of the hollow acetate tube, and an outer wrapper circumscribing the rod, the hollow acetate tube and the aerosol-cooling element.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, conventional aerosol-generating articles have been proposed wherein the filter comprises a hollow tube segment formed of fibrous filtration material, preferably in combination and in axial alignment with another non-hollow segment formed of fibrous filtration material. By way of example, filter cigarettes have been disclosed wherein one such hollow tube segment is arranged at the mouth end of the filter cigarette, such that the cavity internally defined by the hollow tube segment is open to the outer environment. Filter cigarettes have also been disclosed wherein one such hollow tube segment is arranged between non-hollow segments formed of fibrous filtration material. The cavity internally defined by the hollow tube segment and delimited at its ends by the two non-hollow segments may contain an aerosol-altering substance, such as a sorbent material, or a frangible flavour capsule, etc.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">After an aerosol-generating article has been consumed and discarded, it may be desirable for any component of the article comprising filtration material to break down as quickly as possible. However, cellulose acetate, and many other commonly used filtration materials are not highly biodegradable. However, alternative dispersible or biodegradable materials are often not able to provide an acceptable filtration efficiency and smoking experience for the consumer. Furthermore, many known dispersible and degradable materials are unsuitable for use in the existing manufacturing processes, and would require too significant a modification of the existing methods and equipment to make their use commercially feasible.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, cellulose acetate has been found to provide a relatively high level of adsorption and trapping of water from the mainstream smoke when used in conventional smoking articles. The mainstream smoke delivered to the consumer therefore has a significantly reduced moisture content and may, under certain conditions, be perceived as undesirably &#x2018;dry&#x2019;. This may have an adverse effect on the overall smoking experience.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, it would be desirable to provide a novel and improved aerosol-generating article that has enhanced biodegradation properties compared to known articles including conventional filtration materials such as cellulose acetate. It would also be desirable to provide a novel and improved aerosol-generating article that provides an acceptable smoking experience to the consumer, in particular, one that is capable of reducing the &#x2018;dry&#x2019; smoke effect that is often found with articles comprising cellulose acetate as the filtration material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It would be desirable to provide one such aerosol-generating article wherein the resistance to draw (RTD) of a filtration material segment can be adjusted so as to achieve an acceptable RTD of the article as a whole. Further, it would be desirable to provide such an aerosol-generating article that can effectively be produced in an automated, high-speed manufacturing process without requiring major modifications of existing equipment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure relates to an aerosol-generating article for producing an inhalable aerosol upon heating. The aerosol-generating article may comprise a rod of aerosol-generating substrate and a hollow tube segment comprising fibrous filtration material. The hollow tube segment may be arranged in longitudinal alignment with the rod. The fibrous filtration material may comprise fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymer or copolymer material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the present disclosure relates to a hollow tube segment for use in an aerosol-generating article. The hollow tube segment may be formed of fibrous filtration material. The fibrous filtration material may comprise fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymer or copolymer material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the present disclosure relates to a system comprising an aerosol-generating device and an aerosol-generating article for use with the aerosol-generating device. The aerosol-generating article may comprise a rod of aerosol-generating substrate and a hollow tube segment comprising fibrous filtration material. In the aerosol-generating device the hollow tube segment may be arranged in longitudinal alignment with the rod. The fibrous filtration material may comprise fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymer or copolymer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, there is provided an aerosol-generating article for producing an inhalable aerosol upon heating, the aerosol-generating article comprising: a rod of aerosol-generating substrate; a hollow tube segment comprising fibrous filtration material, the hollow tube segment arranged in longitudinal alignment with the rod; wherein the fibrous filtration material comprises fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymer or copolymer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;aerosol-generating article&#x201d; is used herein with reference to the invention to describe an article wherein an aerosol-generating substrate is heated to produce and deliver an aerosol to a consumer. As used herein, the term &#x201c;aerosol-generating substrate&#x201d; denotes a substrate capable of releasing volatile compounds upon heating to generate an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A conventional cigarette is lit when a user applies a flame to one end of the cigarette and draws air through the other end. The localised heat provided by the flame and the oxygen in the air drawn through the cigarette causes the end of the cigarette to ignite, and the resulting combustion generates an inhalable smoke. By contrast, in heated aerosol-generating articles, an aerosol is generated by heating a flavour generating substrate, such as, for example, a tobacco-based substrate or a substrate containing an aerosol-former and a flavouring. Known heated aerosol-generating articles include, for example, electrically heated aerosol-generating articles and aerosol-generating articles in which an aerosol is generated by the transfer of heat from a combustible fuel element or heat source to a physically separate aerosol forming material.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the term &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; refers to the direction corresponding to the main longitudinal axis of the aerosol-generating article, which extends between the upstream and downstream ends of the aerosol-generating article. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; describe the relative positions of elements, or portions of elements, of the aerosol-generating article in relation to the direction in which the aerosol is transported through the aerosol-generating article during use.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described briefly above, in contrast with existing aerosol-generating articles, an article in accordance with the present invention comprises a hollow tube segment comprising fibrous filtration material, wherein the fibrous filtration material comprises fibres comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymer or copolymer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, in the hollow tube segment of an aerosol-generating article in accordance with the invention a PHA polymer or copolymer accounts for at least a portion of the fibrous filtration material. This means that the remainder of the fibrous filtration material may comprise a material other than a PHA polymer or copolymer. Further, this means that other components of the hollow tube segment&#x2014;such as, for example, a plug wrapper circumscribing the fibrous filtration material, or an insert, a non-cuttable object, such as a flow restrictor or an additive delivery material, such as a breakable capsule, which may be provided at a location along the hollow tube segment may comprise a material other than a PHA polymer or copolymer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Because fibres containing a PHA polymer or copolymer (in the following, also referred to as &#x201c;PHA fibres&#x201d;) have a lower hydrophilicity compared with fibres of other filtration materials, such as cellulose acetate, of an equivalent weight, in aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the present invention the hollow tube segment has been found to have a significantly lower tendency to absorb water/steam. As a result, in those embodiments when the hollow tube segment is used as a component of a multi-segment filter in a conventional smoking article, the level of water in the mainstream smoke can advantageously be maintained at a higher level. This directly addresses the issue of &#x201c;dry smoke&#x201d; often encountered with conventional smoking articles, and provides an improved smoking experience for the consumer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As PHA fibres have a much higher level of biodegradability compared with fibres of other filtration materials, such as cellulose acetate, articles in accordance with the present invention are more biodegradable as a whole. At the same time, as PHA fibres are obtained by means of a natural, fermentation process, aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the present invention also provide improved sustainability for the production process. Besides, a hollow tube segment has a greater exposed surface area compared with a cylindrical plug, and this may also further favour biodegradation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By adjusting parameters such as the denier per filament, total denier, cross sectional shape, etc. it is possible to adjust the RTD of the filter segment to desirable ranges for any given filter length or filter design.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;denier per filament&#x201d; (dpf) corresponds to the weight in grams of a single fibre or filament having a length of 9000 metres. In the present invention, the value of dpf therefore gives an indication of the thickness of each of the individual PHA fibres within the filter segment. The denier per filament is expressed in units of denier, where 1 denier corresponds to 1 gram per 9000 metres.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The &#x201c;total denier&#x201d; of the filtration material defines the total weight in grams of 9000 metres of the combined fibres forming the filtration material. The total denier for the filter segment therefore corresponds to the denier per filament multiplied by the total number of fibres in the filter segment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the overall weight of the hollow tube segment may be advantageously controlled, and this may also contribute to help with biodegradation of the hollow tube segment and of the aerosol-generating article as a whole.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">PHA properties also lead to good filter hardness, which can be further enhanced by circumscribing the hollow tube segment with a stiff plug wrap.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the present invention comprise a rod of aerosol-generating substrate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rod of aerosol-generating substrate may be produced using randomly oriented shreds, strands, or strips of tobacco material. As an alternative, as has been proposed, for example in international patent application WO-A-2012/164009, the rod of aerosol-generating substrate may be formed from one or more gathered sheets of tobacco material. Alternative rods for aerosol-generating articles have also been proposed that are formed from strands of homogenised tobacco material, which may be formed by casting, rolling, calendering or extruding a mixture comprising particulate tobacco and at least one aerosol former to form a sheet of homogenised tobacco material. Further, a rod of aerosol-generating substrate may be formed from strands of homogenised tobacco material obtained by extruding a mixture comprising particulate tobacco and at least one aerosol former to form continuous lengths of homogenised tobacco material.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rod of aerosol generating substrate preferably has an external diameter that is approximately equal to the external diameter of the aerosol generating article.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, the rod of aerosol generating substrate has an external diameter of at least 5 millimetres. The rod of aerosol generating substrate may have an external diameter of between about 5 millimetres and about 12 millimetres, for example of between about 5 millimetres and about 10 millimetres or of between about 6 millimetres and about 8 millimetres. In a preferred embodiment, the rod of aerosol generating substrate has an external diameter of 7.2 millimetres, to within 10 percent.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The rod of aerosol generating substrate may have a length of between about 5 millimetres and about 100 mm. Preferably, the rod of aerosol generating substrate has a length of at least about 5 millimetres, more preferably at least about 7 millimetres. In addition, or as an alternative, the rod of aerosol generating substrate preferably has a length of less than about 80 millimetres, more preferably less than about 65 millimetres, even more preferably less than about 50 millimetres. In particularly preferred embodiments, the rod of aerosol generating substrate has a length of less than about 35 millimetres, more preferably less than 25 millimetres, even more preferably less than about 20 millimetres. In one embodiment, the rod of aerosol generating substrate may have a length of about 10 millimetres. In a preferred embodiment, the rod of aerosol generating substrate has a length of about 12 millimetres.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the rod of aerosol generating substrate has a substantially uniform cross-section along the length of the rod. Particularly preferably, the rod of aerosol generating substrate has a substantially circular cross-section.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In preferred embodiments, the aerosol-generating substrate comprises one or more gathered sheets of homogenised tobacco material. Preferably the one or more sheets of homogenised tobacco material are textured. As used herein, the term &#x2018;textured sheet&#x2019; denotes a sheet that has been crimped, embossed, debossed, perforated or otherwise deformed. Textured sheets of homogenised tobacco material for use in the invention may comprise a plurality of spaced-apart indentations, protrusions, perforations or a combination thereof. According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the rod of aerosol-generating substrate comprises a gathered crimped sheet of homogenised tobacco material circumscribed by a wrapper.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x2018;crimped sheet&#x2019; is intended to be synonymous with the term &#x2018;creped sheet&#x2019; and denotes a sheet having a plurality of substantially parallel ridges or corrugations. Preferably, the crimped sheet of homogenised tobacco material has a plurality of ridges or corrugations substantially parallel to the cylindrical axis of the rod according to the invention. This advantageously facilitates gathering of the crimped sheet of homogenised tobacco material to form the rod.

By controlling the external surface area of the PHA fibres, the total surface area of the PHA fibres that is exposed to the aerosol as it passes through the hollow tube segment may also be controlled.

By way of example, the filter segment preferably comprises an additive for the reduction of phenols and phenol derivatives. [ . . . ]</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The combination of PHA with an additive such as PEG for the reduction of phenolic compounds from the mainstream smoke has been found to be particularly effective. PHA fibres generally provide a good filtration efficiency for undesirable smoke constituents but are less effective at the removal of phenolic compounds. By incorporating a compound that specifically reduces the level of phenolic compounds in the mainstream smoke, it is possible to further optimise the filtration capabilities of the hollow tube segment of an aerosol-generating article in accordance with the invention, in particular when a hollow tube segment as described above is used as a component of a multi-component filter in a combustible smoking article, such as a filter cigarette. This in turn improves the sensory characteristics of the aerosol delivered to the consumer.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In particularly preferred embodiments, the hollow tube segment further comprises at least about 5 percent by weight of polyethylene glycol, based on the total weight of the filtration material. Preferably, the hollow tube segment comprises no more than 10 percent by weight of polyethylene glycol, based on the total weight of the filtration material.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, it has been found that PHA fibres absorb less water from the mainstream smoke than an equivalent amount of cellulose acetate fibres, due to the lower affinity of the PHA fibres to water. As demonstrated in the examples below, the amount of water absorbed by a PHA filter segment is significantly lower than the amount of water absorbed by a comparative filter segment formed of an equivalent weight of cellulose acetate fibres.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, when exposed to water in liquid form, the hollow tube segment of the aerosol-generating article of the present invention preferably absorbs less than half the amount of water that is absorbed under the same conditions by an equivalent hollow tube segment formed of cellulose acetate fibres.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The reduced absorption of water by the PHA fibres in the hollow tube segment of the present invention, compared to cellulose acetate results in a higher level of water in the mainstream smoke delivered from the aerosol-generating article during use.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, the amount of water in the mainstream smoke collected during the smoking of a combustible smoking article comprising a filter according to the invention with PHA fibres under ISO conditions was at least 10 percent higher and preferably at least 15 percent higher than the amount of water in the mainstream smoke collected during the smoking of an equivalent combustible smoking article having a filter segment of cellulose acetate tow under the same conditions.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Aerosol-generating articles comprising a filter including a PHA hollow tube segment are therefore able to deliver a mainstream smoke having a higher moisture level, which is more sensorially acceptable to the consumer. In particular, the &#x2018;dry smoke&#x2019; effect that may be experienced during smoking of an aerosol-generating article with a conventional cellulose acetate filter can advantageously be reduced.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The fibres comprising a PHA polymer or copolymer of the filter segment may be manufactured by one of several techniques, including melt spinning, gel spinning, and electrospinning. Preferably, the fibres comprising a PHA polymer or copolymer of the filter segment in aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the present invention are manufactured by melt spinning. Melt spinning is often regarded as the most economical process of spinning, since no solvent needs to be recovered or evaporated, as is by contrast the case with solution spinning. Further, the spinning rate with melt spinning is generally fairly high, which is advantageous in terms of overall productivity and manufacturing efficiency.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this process, a viscous melt of polymer or of a polymer blend is extruded through a spinneret containing a number of holes into a chamber, where a blast of cold air or gas is directed onto the surface of filaments emanating from the spinneret. As the air strikes the filaments, the filaments are solidified and collected such as on a take-up wheel. The melt spinning process is advantageously characterised by defined filament cross-section geometries and affords a significant variety of fineness and filament count. By increasing the number of openings in the spinneret, a high spinning capacity can be achieved, which is difficult to match with other spinning processes.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Preferably, in an aerosol-generating article in accordance with the present invention the hollow tube segment does not substantially contribute to an overall RTD of the aerosol-generating article.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thus, in aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the present invention the overall RTD of the article preferably depends essentially on the RTD of the rod and may further depend on the RTD of optional additional components, such as a mouthpiece or a filter segment, as a significant proportion of the overall volume of the hollow tube segment is substantially empty and, as such, the hollow tube segment only marginally contributes to the overall RTD.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In practice, the hollow tube segment may be adapted to generate a RTD in the range of approximately 0 millimetre H<sub>2</sub>O (about 00 Pa) to approximately 20 millimetres H<sub>2</sub>O (about 200 Pa).

Preferably, a length of the hollow tube segment is from about 5 millimetres to about 15 millimetres. More preferably, a length of the hollow tube segment is from about 7 millimetres to about 15 millimetres. Even more preferably, a length of the hollow tube segment is from about 10 millimetres to about 15 millimetres.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Preferably, in aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the present invention the hollow tube segment has an average radial hardness of at least about 80 percent, more preferably at least about 85 percent, even more preferably at least about 90 percent. The hollow tube segment is therefore able to provide a desirable level of hardness to the aerosol-generating article, which is comparable to that provided by a conventional cellulose acetate hollow tube segment.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">If desired, the radial hardness of the hollow tube segment of aerosol-generating articles in accordance with the invention may be further increased by circumscribing the hollow tube segment by a stiff plug wrap, for example, a plug wrap having a basis weight of at least about 80 grams per square metre (gsm), or at least about 100 gsm, or at least about 110 gsm.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As used herein, the term &#x201c;radial hardness&#x201d; refers to resistance to compression in a direction transverse to a longitudinal axis of the hollow tube segment. Radial hardness of an aerosol-generating article around a hollow tube segment may be determined by applying a load across the article at the location of the hollow tube segment, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the article, and measuring the average (mean) depressed diameters of the articles. Radial hardness is given by:</p><p id="p-0105" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi fontstyle="normal">Radial</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>    </mtext>   <mi fontstyle="normal">hardness</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>    </mtext>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mi>%</mi>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <msub>     <mi>D</mi>     <mi>d</mi>    </msub>    <msub>     <mi>D</mi>     <mi>S</mi>    </msub>   </mfrac>   <mo>*</mo>   <mn>100</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>%</mi>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0106" num="0000">where D<sub>S </sub>is the original (undepressed) diameter, and D<sub>d </sub>is the depressed diameter after applying a set load for a set duration.

This test is performed using a known DD60A Densimeter device (manufactured and made commercially available by Heinr Borgwaldt GmbH, Germany), which is fitted with a measuring head for aerosol-generating articles, such as cigarettes, and with an aerosol-generating article receptacle.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">The load is applied using two load-applying cylindrical rods, which extend across the diameter of all of the aerosol-generating articles at once. According to the standard test method for this instrument, the test should be performed such that twenty contact points occur between the aerosol-generating articles and the load applying cylindrical rods. In some cases, the hollow tube segments to be tested may be long enough such that only ten aerosol-generating articles are needed to form twenty contact points, with each smoking article contacting both load applying rods (because they are long enough to extend between the rods). In other cases, if the hollow tube segments are too short to achieve this, then twenty aerosol-generating articles should be used to form the twenty contact points, with each aerosol-generating article contacting only one of the load applying rods, as further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Two further stationary cylindrical rods are located underneath the aerosol-generating articles, to support the aerosol-generating articles and counteract the load applied by each of the load applying cylindrical rods.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">For the standard operating procedure for such an apparatus, an overall load of 2 kg is applied for a duration of 20 seconds. After 20 seconds have elapsed (and with the load still being applied to the smoking articles), the depression in the load applying cylindrical rods is determined, and then used to calculate the hardness from the above equation. The temperature is kept in the region of 22 degrees Centigrade&#xb1;2 degrees. The test described above is referred to as the DD60A Test. The standard way to measure the filter hardness is when the aerosol-generating article have not been consumed.

For each of the PHA filter segment and the CA filter segment, this test is repeated three times and an average value of water absorption was calculated, as shown below in Table 2:</p><p id="p-0152" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Water absorption of the PHA and CA filter</entry></row><row><entry>segments after exposure to water</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>PHA filter segment</entry><entry>CA filter segment</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Water absorption in 300</entry><entry>0.51</entry><entry>1.37</entry></row><row><entry>sec (g)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0153" num="0148">The amount of water absorbed by the PHA filter segment according to the invention during the test was therefore less than 40 percent of the amount of water absorbed by the CA filter segment. This test therefore demonstrates the significantly reduced affinity of water of the PHA filter segment according to the invention compared to the conventional CA filter segment.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0149">In a second test, the water absorption by exposure to moisture of the PHA filter segment according to the invention and the CA filter segment are compared. For each filter segment, the plug wrap is removed and the fibres forming the filter segment are placed in a petri dish and exposed to air at 22 degrees Celsius and 50 percent relative humidity for 70 hours. This is conducted in a vapour sorption analyser (ProUmid SPSx-1&#x3bc;). For each filter segment, the weight of the fibres is measured at the start of the test and the change in weight over time due to the absorption of water vapour by the fibres is measured. For each of the PHA filter segment and the CA filter segment, a value of the percentage difference in mass of the sample (% dm) is calculated, which expresses the increase in the weight of the sample as a percentage of the original weight. The values of % dm for each of the samples at the end of the 70 hour test are shown below in Table 3:</p><p id="p-0155" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Water absorption of the PHA and CA filter</entry></row><row><entry>segments after exposure to moisture</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>PHA filter segment</entry><entry>CA filter segment</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>% Difference in mass after</entry><entry>0.0133</entry><entry>0.6784</entry></row><row><entry>70 hours (% dm)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0156" num="0150">The results demonstrate that the amount of water vapour absorbed by the cellulose acetate fibres during the 70 hour test was more than 50 times greater than the amount of water vapour absorbed by the PHA fibres. The PHA fibres absorbed very little water vapour during the test. This further demonstrates the significantly reduced affinity of water of the PHA filter segment according to the invention compared to the conventional CA filter segment.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0151">In a third test, the absorption of water from the mainstream smoke by a PHA filter segment according to the present invention and a conventional CA filter segment are compared.
