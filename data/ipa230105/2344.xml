In response to extracellular signals, Ras is converted from a GDP-bound (Ras<sup>GDP</sup>) to a GTP-bound (Ras<sup>GTP</sup>) state, as catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), notably the SOS1 protein. Active Ras<sup>GTP </sup>mediates its diverse growth-stimulating functions through its direct interactions with effectors including Raf, PI3K, and Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator. The intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras then hydrolyzes GTP to GDP to terminate Ras signaling. The Ras GTPase activity can be further accelerated by its interactions with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), including the neurofibromin 1 tumor suppressor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Mutant Ras has a reduced GTPase activity, which prolongs its activated conformation, thereby promoting Ras-dependent signaling and cancer cell survival or growth. Mutation in Ras which affects its ability to interact with GAP or to convert GTP back to GDP will result in a prolonged activation of the protein and consequently a prolonged signal to the cell telling it to continue to grow and divide. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive RAS signaling may ultimately lead to cancer. Mutations in any one of the three main isoforms of RAS (H-Ras, N-Ras, or K-Ras) genes are common events in human tumorigenesis. Among the three Ras isoforms (K, N, and H), K-Ras is most frequently mutated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The most common K-Ras mutations are found at residue G12 and G13 in the P-loop and at residue Q61. G12C is a frequent mutation of K-Ras gene (glycine-12 to cysteine). Mutations of Ras in cancer are associated with poor prognosis. Inactivation of oncogenic Ras in mice results in tumor shrinkage. Thus, Ras is widely considered an oncology target of exceptional importance.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">One aspect of the invention includes a compound of Formula (I):</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="30.65mm" wi="54.78mm" file="US20230002345A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">wherein,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">R<sup>1 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of H, C<sub>6-10 </sub>aryl, 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl, and 5- to 10-membered heterocyclyl, wherein each aryl, heteroaryl, and heterocyclyl is optionally substituted with one to four substituents, wherein each substituent is independently selected from the group consisting of C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl, &#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>, NH(CH<sub>3</sub>), &#x2014;N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, halo, C<sub>1-6</sub>haloalkyl, oxo, C<sub>1-6 </sub>hydroxyalkyl, C<sub>3-6 </sub>cycloalkyl, &#x2014;OC(&#x2550;O)CH&#x2550;CH<sub>2</sub>, and hydroxy;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">R<sup>2 </sup>is an electrophilic moiety capable of forming a covalent bond with a cysteine residue at position 12 of a K-Ras G12C mutant protein;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Y<sup>1 </sup>is C(H)(R<sup>6</sup>);

P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., &#x201c;Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds&#x201d;, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (&#x2212;) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (&#x2212;) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms &#x201c;racemic mixture&#x201d; and &#x201c;racemate&#x201d; refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0156">The term &#x201c;tautomer&#x201d; or &#x201c;tautomeric form&#x201d; refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0157">&#x201c;Atropisomers&#x201d; are stereoisomers arising because of hindered rotation around a single bond, where energy differences due to steric strain or other contributors create a barrier to rotation that is high enough to allow for isolation of individual conformers.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0158">Certain compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. A &#x201c;solvate&#x201d; refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the present invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. Certain compounds of the invention can exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. The term &#x201c;hydrate&#x201d; refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0159">A &#x201c;metabolite&#x201d; refers to a product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products can result, for example, from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0160">Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled (e.g., <sup>14</sup>C or <sup>3</sup>H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to a human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0161">The invention described herein also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>33</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>123</sup>I, and <sup>125</sup>I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (H) and carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., <sup>2</sup>H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>11</sup>C and <sup>18</sup>F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0162">The term &#x201c;amino-protecting group&#x201d; as used herein refers to a derivative of the groups commonly employed to block or protect an amino group while reactions are carried out on other functional groups on the compound. Examples of such protecting groups include carbamates, amides, alkyl and aryl groups, and imines, as well as many N-heteroatom derivatives which can be removed to regenerate the desired amine group. Particular amino protecting groups are Pmb (p-methoxybenzyl), Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl), Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) and Cbz (carbobenzyloxy). Further examples of these groups are found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, &#x201c;Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3 ed., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., 1999.

Examples of carboxy protecting groups include, ester groups and heterocyclyl groups. Ester derivatives of the carboxylic acid group may be employed to block or protect the carboxylic acid group while reactions are carried out on other functional groups on the compound. Examples of such ester groups include substituted arylalkyl, including substituted benzyls, such as 4-nitrobenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl, 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzyl, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl, pentamethylbenzyl, 3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl, benzhydryl, 4,4&#x2032;-dimethoxybenzhydryl, 2,2&#x2032;,4,4&#x2032;-tetramethoxybenzhydryl, alkyl or substituted alkyl esters such as methyl, ethyl, t-butyl allyl or t-amyl, triphenylmethyl (trityl), 4-methoxytrityl, 4,4&#x2032;-dimethoxytrityl, 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-trimethoxytrityl, 2-phenylprop-2-yl, thioesters such as t-butyl thioester, silyl esters such as trimethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl esters, phenacyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, beta-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, beta-(di(n-butyl)methylsilyl)ethyl, p-toluenesulfonylethyl, 4-nitrobenzylsulfonylethyl, allyl, cinnamyl, 1-(trimethylsilylmethyl)prop-1-en-3-yl, and like moieties. Another example of carboxy-protecting groups are heterocyclyl groups such as 1,3-oxazolinyl. Further examples of these groups are found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, &#x201c;Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3 ed., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., 1999. The term &#x201c;protected carboxy&#x201d; refers to a carboxy group substituted with one of the above carboxy-protecting groups.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0164">Compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms.

Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>33</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>36</sup>Cl, <sup>123</sup>I, and <sup>125</sup>I, respectively. Isotopically-labeled compounds (e.g., those labeled with <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C) can be useful in compound or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., <sup>3</sup>H) and carbon-14 (i.e., <sup>14</sup>C) isotopes can be useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., <sup>2</sup>H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements). In some embodiments, in compounds of the invention, one or more carbon atoms are replaced by <sup>13</sup>C- or <sup>14</sup>C-enriched carbon. Positron emitting isotopes such as <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>11</sup>C, and <sup>18</sup>F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes or in the Examples herein, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0183">It is specifically contemplated that any limitation discussed with respect to one embodiment of the invention may apply to any other embodiment of the invention.

A proliferation assessment is carried out using 3 G12C-driven (H358, HCC1171 and HCC1792) and 2 non-G12C-driven (PC-9 and A427) lines in ultra-low attachment plates to encourage growth of 3D spheroids. On day 1, 1000 cells per well are seeded into 384-well black clear round bottom ultra-low attachment plates (Corning 3830) in 50 &#x3bc;l of RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine. On the following day, various concentrations of compounds are added, using a dose response titration starting at 20 uM and keeping the final DMSO amount constant at 0.3%. Seven days after addition of compounds, the amount of viable cells are determined by adding 40 &#x3bc;l of CTG 3D reagent (Promega G9683) which lyses the cells and generates a luciferase signal in proportion to the amount of ATP released. Plates are shaken vigorously for 25 minutes. Plates are then incubated for an additional 10 minutes. Plates are then centrifuged briefly prior to reading luminescence on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Luminescence from wells treated with DMSO only is used to determine total proliferation and 1 uM Staurosporine use to determine 100% inhibition.</p><p id="p-1939" num="1767">The features disclosed in the foregoing description, or the following claims, expressed in their specific forms or in terms of a means for performing the disclosed function, or a method or process for attaining the disclosed result, as appropriate, may, separately, or in any combination of such features, be utilized for realizing the invention in diverse forms thereof.</p><p id="p-1940" num="1768">The foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example, for purposes of clarity and understanding.
