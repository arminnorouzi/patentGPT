id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor device includes a base, a first FET that includes at least two channel structure portions laminated, the channel structure portions each including a channel portion having a nanowire structure, a gate insulation film, and a gate electrode, and a second FET that includes a channel forming layer, a gate insulation layer, and a gate electrode. The first FET and the second FET are provided above the base. The channel portions of the first FET are disposed apart from each other in a laminating direction of the channel structure portions. Assuming that each of a distance between the channel portions of the first FET is a distance L<b>1</b> and that a thickness of the gate insulation layer of the second FET is a thickness T<b>2,</b> T<b>2&#x2265;</b>(L<b>1/</b>2) is satisfied.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="89.32mm" wi="158.75mm"

After 14 nm generation, however, a FET having a Fin structure (referred to as a &#x201c;Fin-FET&#x201d; for convenience) or a FET having an FD-SOI (Fully Depleted-Silicon On Insulator) structure (referred to as an &#x201c;FD-SOI-FET&#x201d; for convenience) has been thoroughly adopted. Meanwhile, a thickness of a silicon layer having a close relation with scaling of a gate length, i.e., a thickness of the Fin structure in a Fin-FET, and a thickness of a silicon layer in an FD-SOI-FET are important factors for size reduction of an FET. It is considered that a minimum thickness of the silicon layer is limited to 5 nm.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a technology for eliminating this limitation on the thickness of the silicon layer constituting a channel forming region of a FET, a field effect transistor (referred to as a &#x201c;nanowire-FET&#x201d; for convenience) having a nanowire structure in a channel forming region has been studied (for example, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2015-195405). The nanowire-FET has at least two nanowire structures. In addition, the nanowire-FET thus configured is driven in a range from 0.5 to 0.8 volts, for example.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, a semiconductor device is often required to have not only the nanowire-FET, but also a field effect transistor driven in a range from 1.5 to 3.3 volts (referred to as a &#x201c;second FET&#x201d; for convenience), for example.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="2">[PTL 1]</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2015-195405</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, the nanowire-FET and the second FET are simultaneously formed during manufacture of a typical semiconductor device. In this case, a space between nanowire structures of the nanowire-FET is so small that it is difficult to form a thick gate insulation film on the second FET. Moreover, there has been a strong demand for applying reverse bias to the second FET to control a threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a first object of the present disclosure is to provide a semiconductor device which includes both a nanowire-FET and a second FET having a gate insulation film relatively thick with respect to the nanowire-FET.

Moreover, a gate electrode is provided between the respective gate insulation films. In such manner, a space between the channel portions is filled with the gate insulation film and the gate electrode.

At least one semiconductor layer is formed between the channel forming layer and the insulation material layer in the second field effect transistor. In addition, in this case, adoptable is a configuration where an interlayer insulation layer is formed between the channel forming layer and the semiconductor layer and between the semiconductor layers. In this manner, reverse bias is applicable by applying appropriate potential to the semiconductor layer. Further, in these cases, the semiconductor layer may have a conductivity type opposite to a conductivity type of the channel forming layer. According to a MOSFET having a GAA (Gate-All-Around) structure where an entire outer periphery of a channel forming region is surrounded by a gate electrode, a threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>is normally determined only by a work function of a material constituting the gate electrode. However, the threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>is controllable by applying reverse bias, and thus, a desired threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>optimum for a circuit is allowed to be set. For example, a circuit speed can be raised by lowering the threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>, and a low leak current can be achieved by increasing the threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0108">According to the semiconductor device of the first and second aspects of the present disclosure including the preferred modes and configurations described above (hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#x201c;semiconductor device of the present disclosure&#x201d; in some cases), the following configuration may be adopted. The first field effect transistor is a low withstand voltage field effect transistor, while the second field effect transistor is a high withstand voltage field effect transistor. In addition, in this case, the following configuration may be adopted. Voltage applied to the gate electrode of the first field effect transistor is in a range from 0.5 to 0.8 volts, for example, while voltage applied to the gate electrode of the second field effect transistor is in a range from 1.5 to 3.3 volts, for example. Note here that whether a field effect transistor is suited for a low withstand voltage field effect transistor or for a high withstand voltage field effect transistor is greatly dependent on the sum total of cross-sectional areas of a channel portion and a channel forming layer and on each thickness of a gate insulation film and a gate insulation layer.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0109">Whether the first field effect transistor is of an n-channel type or of a p-channel type is determined by a work function of a material constituting the gate electrode, for example.

The nanowire structure constituting the semiconductor device of the present disclosure is formed such that both ends of a wire structure that is made of Si, SiGe or the like, for example, and that has a diameter ranging from 5 to 10 nm, for example, are supported by source/drain regions constituting the first field effect transistor.
