These devices use a number of wireless transmission standards. The most common are the IEEE 802.11 standards, commonly known as Wi-Fi or wireless LAN (WLAN). Wi-Fi is commonly used to connect devices to the Internet. One area of rapid development with regard to wireless Internet connections is the &#x201c;Internet of Things&#x201d; (IoT). &#x201c;Normal&#x201d; connections to the Internet involve some type of computer, such as a laptop or smart phone. IoT devices use wireless or wired connections to the Internet for various purposes. An IoT appliance may include a Wi-Fi module to allow the manufacturer to monitor operation of the appliance, suggest when maintenance is necessary, update control firmware, automatically order supplies, or diagnose problems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an IoT device such as an appliance, power consumption by the IoT device is not a large concern because the appliance draws power from the home's power system. However, not all IoT devices have access to a wired supply or can be conveniently wired into a power source. For example, motion sensors can be used for security systems and for automatic lighting. An outlet is rarely available at the optimal position for these devices and it is very expensive to provide custom wiring to the device. Therefore, it is desirable to operate these devices using battery power. In addition, it is desirable to have long battery life to minimize the need to replace the batteries in these devices. However, the wireless function must be connected to the network (local or Internet) in order to fully function. Therefore, for these battery powered devices, it is important that the wireless connection consume as little power as possible.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an example aspect, a circuit includes a controller configured to: receive a first decoded beacon frame which includes a first indication of a first data transmission; receive a second decoded beacon frame which includes a second indication of a second data transmission; compare the first and second decoded beacon frames to determine common bytes in the first and second decoded beacon frames; determine an expected time of receiving the common bytes in a third beacon frame; control a device to enter into a low power mode; and control the device to wake up from the low power mode at a time to receive and decode at least a portion of the third beacon frame, in which the time to wake up is based on the expected time to receive the common bytes instead of based on an expected time to receive a preamble at a start of the third beacon frame.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of a basic Wi-Fi configuration.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram of a beacon frame.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a beacon frame diagram illustrating the BET technique.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a histogram of a feature of sample beacon frames.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a histogram of another feature of sample beacon frames.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an aspect method.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an aspect station.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an experimental trace graph.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is another experimental trace graph.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of another aspect station.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Corresponding numerals and symbols in the different figures generally refer to corresponding parts unless otherwise indicated.

However, the teachings of this specification are applicable to various wireless digital transmission formats. The Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineering has promulgated the basic standards for Wi-Fi under IEEE Standard 802.11-2012 (&#x201c;Wi-Fi Standard&#x201d;), which is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein. Additional standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac, are additions to this basic standard.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of a basic Wi-Fi configuration <b>100</b>. Access point (AP) <b>102</b> broadcasts in area <b>106</b>. The stations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are smartphone <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, tablet <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> and laptop <b>104</b>-<b>3</b>. The AP and the stations include a transceiver. The structure of the signals communicated between the stations and the access point is determined by the configuration of the access point. One of the key ways configuration information and other link information can be transmitted from the access point to the stations is a beacon signal. The beacon signal is a specific type of management frame that is transmitted on a periodic basis. Other digital wireless transmission standards use other signals, but nearly all standards have management signals similar to the beacon frames used in Wi-Fi. For network synchronization purposes. One important field in the beacon signal is the Traffic Indication Map (TIM). The TIM includes an indication of available data transmissions for all stations in the coverage area of the access point. In a beacon signal for a particular station, the TIM includes data indicating if the access point has received data from the terrestrial network (i.e. the Internet) for that station.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The need to continually receive the beacon signal is not a problem for stations that have ample power resources. However, if power resources are an issue, continuous reception can place a severe strain on a station's power resources. One technique for lowering power consumption is a sleep mode. This technique is a part of the Wi-Fi specification. In Wi-Fi networks the sleep mode takes advantage of the regular nature of beacon transmission. In most AP installations, the beacon is transmitted at a regular interval (e.g. every 102.4 milli-seconds.) However, the specifics of beacon transmission are provided to the station upon link initiation, so that the station knows precisely when the beacon frame will be transmitted. With a sleep mode, the receiving/decoding circuitry in the station is disabled until just before the beacon frame is transmitted. During link setup, the station can tell the AP that it is using sleep mode. The AP then buffers data traffic designated for the sleeping station until the station is scheduled to wake up and receive a beacon frame. Fields in the beacon frame tell the station that there is waiting buffered data.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The use of sleep modes significantly reduces the power consumed by the station. However, receiving and decoding the beacon frame can also consume a significant amount of power. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram of a beacon frame <b>200</b>. Beacon frame <b>200</b> begins with a physical layer convergence protocol (PLCP) segment <b>202</b>. This segment is a standard configuration of 192 bits and is designed to enable stations to obtain synchronization with the beacon frame. The beacon frame is composed of many segments, but for simplicity only two are shown. The traffic indication map (TIM) <b>204</b> informs the station if there is buffered data to be pulled. The beacon frame ends with a frame check sequence (FCS) <b>206</b> that includes a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The CRC allows for error detection and correction. As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the beacon frame occupies approximately 2 mSec. With standard sleep mode, the station must wake up before the beacon frame arrives and then decode the entire beacon frame. Receiving and decoding the entire beacon frame is a significant use of power resources for the station. If there is no data stored for the station, the power used to receive the beacon signal does not result in any data transfer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">One technique for reducing the power consumed by beacon frame reception is beacon early termination (BET). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a beacon frame diagram illustrating the BET technique. When a station is in sleep mode, it must wake up to receive its scheduled beacon transmission. The TIM frame indicates if there is data queued for stations in the area served by the AP. Therefore, the TIM is the one data segment that the station must receive to determine if there is data buffered for the station. In BET, the station wakes up from low power (sleep) mode in time to receive the beacon frame, but stops receiving and returns to sleep mode after receiving the TIM, if there is no data waiting for it. The TIM is usually one of the earlier segments in the beacon frame. Thus, the BET technique conserves significant power resources.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a histogram of the position of the TIM in a sample of beacon frames. As shown in histogram <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the TIM is usually at the 58<sup>th </sup>or 62<sup>nd </sup>byte of the beacon frame. Histogram <b>400</b> was determined experimentally by analyzing beacon frames transmitted by 198 APs. The beacon frame configuration is consistent on a single AP, so the histogram shows numbers of APs having the TIM at the indicated location. As shown in frame <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, using BET, the wake time for the station is usually reduced from 2 mSec in normal sleep mode to approximately 700 &#x3bc;Sec in BET mode. Because the FCS (<b>206</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is not received, there is a marginal increase in the risk of data corruption, but this risk is not significant. Thus, the wake up time using BET is less than half of the normal sleep mode with a concomitant reduction in power consumed. However, because the BET technique receives and decodes the portion of the beacon frame that is received before the TIM, there is still some power that is wasted in receiving and decoding unnecessary information when the station needs to receive the TIM information.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an aspect of the present application, the wake time is minimized by determining a constant block of bytes that is transmitted prior to the TIM within the beacon frame. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a histogram of another aspect of sample beacon frames. Histogram <b>500</b> uses data from the beacon frames of 198 APs. Histogram <b>500</b> shows that the number of constant bytes (i.e. bytes that are the same in every beacon frame transmitted by that AP) ranges from 21 bytes to 210 bytes. Part of this group of constant bytes or &#x201c;barker&#x201d; is used by the receiving station as a substitute to the traditional PLCP preamble to reduce the overall receiving time required for TIM reception. This method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In an aspect, the barker is selected so that there is at least a predetermined amount of time between the barker and the TIM to allow for proper synchronization of the received data by the station.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an aspect method <b>600</b>, which is performed by a station. The method <b>600</b> may be implemented on an integrated circuit(s) and/or by using discrete components, or by using programmable components such as processors or microcontrollers. In step <b>602</b>, the station initiates contact with an access point. The station then receives at least N beacon frames in step <b>604</b>. For example, N could equal 20. In step <b>606</b>, the N beacon frames are compared to each other to find a series of bytes in every beacon frame that is at least M bytes long and that is prior to the TIM field. This series of bytes is the barker. In an example, M is equal to at least twelve bytes. In step <b>608</b>, it is determined if an appropriate barker is found. If not, the method goes to step <b>610</b> and defaults back to standard sleep mode (or another power saving process, like BET).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">If a suitable barker is found at step <b>608</b>, the method goes to step <b>612</b> and enters low-power mode. Any sleep mode that lowers power consumption during the time the station is not listening for the barker and TIM may be employed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The station knows the schedule for beacon signal transmission from the initial link setup with the AP. In addition, the station knows the timing of the barker within the beacon frame from step <b>606</b>. With the predefined AP configuration and with the station enabling L2 power save mode (which is communicated to the AP), the AP will buffer all multicast and unicast frames until the next delivery TIM (DTIM) beacon, which may be every one, two, or N beacons according to the AP configuration. Therefore, the station waits in sleep mode until a wakeup period of x &#x3bc;Sec before the barker is expected, and then listens for the barker in step <b>614</b>. For example, x may be 150 &#x3bc;Sec. This wake up period is dependent on the sleep mode employed and the circuitry of the station. Any wakeup period that enables the station to be ready to receive the barker may be suitably employed. The station uses the barker rather than the PLCP (<b>202</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to synchronize with the portion of the beacon frame including the barker and the TIM. The incoming beacon frame is compared to the selected barker using, for example, a comparator, until the barker is identified in the incoming beacon frame. The station then receives the TIM and determines if the TIM was correctly received in step <b>618</b>. If so, the process continues to step <b>622</b> to determine if there are buffered frames to be received. The frames are then pulled from the AP in step <b>624</b>. Step <b>626</b> determines if there are more frames to receive. If so, the process loops back to step <b>624</b>. If not, the method returns to step <b>614</b> to wait and to wake for the next scheduled TIM beacon.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Of note, in certain sleep modes under the 802.11 standards, a particular station is not required to listen for the TIM in each beacon frame, but rather in every second or third, etc. frame. That is, after receiving information that the station is using sleep mode, the AP will only send TIM information for that station every second, third, etc. beacon frame. The wakeup performed in step <b>614</b> may then occur only when a beacon frame that is scheduled for this station is broadcast, thus saving additional power.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, if the TIM is not received or received incorrectly at step <b>618</b>, the station determines in step <b>620</b> if this is, for example, the third TIM reception failure. If not, the process returns to step <b>612</b>. If this is the third failure, it is assumed that the current barker is not providing accurate TIM reception. From this point there are two options, which are design choices as indicated by the solid and dashed path lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> leaving state <b>620</b>. In one choice, the station reverts to standard sleep mode or BET mode as in step <b>610</b>. In the other choice, the station may return to step <b>602</b> and try to determine a better barker signal. This design choice is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> by the dashed line. In an additional aspect, an additional step (not shown) determines if no barker is detected x &#x3bc;Sec after wake up, for example, 500 &#x3bc;Sec. If so, the process switches to use the BET mode or can use traditional full reception of the beacon frame. Thus, if the barker is not detected after x &#x3bc;Sec, for example, because a false barker (i.e. incorrect barker that the AP does not use) has been selected, because the AP has delayed the beacon frame transmission, the TIM will still be received.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an aspect station capable of executing method <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The beacon frames are received and decoded by receive and decode unit <b>704</b> via antenna <b>702</b> (see step <b>604</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The beacon frames in digital form are passed to controller <b>710</b>. Controller <b>710</b> analyzes the first N frames to determine a barker (steps <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The controller <b>710</b> then executes the sleep mode and determines the wake time based on the configuration data from the AP, the analysis of the N beacon frames and the position of the barker (steps <b>612</b> and <b>614</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). After waking, controller <b>710</b> then compares the incoming beacon frame to the barker and determines when the barker is detected (step <b>614</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Controller <b>710</b> then receives the portion of the beacon frame including the TIM and determines if the TIM was properly received and determines if there is data queued in the AP waiting to be pulled (steps <b>614</b>, <b>618</b> and <b>620</b>). In alternative aspect, all of the functions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> except for antenna <b>702</b> are include in an integrated circuit. In yet another alternative aspect, an integrated circuit includes RF circuitry for receiving the RF signal from antenna <b>702</b>; while the decode functions of receive and decode unit <b>704</b> and controller <b>710</b> are performed by a processing core on the integrated circuit under the control of software to perform the steps of method <b>600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The power savings of the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is shown experimentally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> &#x26; <b>9</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an experimental trace graph <b>800</b> illustrating the BET technique where trace <b>802</b> shows the beacon frame and trace <b>804</b> shows the consumption of current by the station. Period <b>806</b> is the wake up period required for the station. A corresponding increase in consumption of current by the station is shown during this period in trace <b>804</b>. During period <b>808</b>, the station is receiving and decoding the beacon signal. The station of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> uses the BET method. In this example, the TIM ends approximately 712 &#x3bc;Sec after the beginning of the beacon frame. Thus, the station ends reception at the end of period <b>808</b> and returns to a sleep mode.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In contrast to the trace of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is another trace graph <b>900</b> showing reception of the same beacon frame <b>902</b>, but now using the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The beginning of the barker is approximately 176 &#x3bc;Sec before the end of the TIM. Therefore, after a wakeup period <b>906</b> of 150 &#x3bc;Sec, full reception only occurs during period <b>908</b>, which is less than a quarter of period <b>808</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> &#x26; <b>9</b></figref> demonstrate that using the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the receiver is in wake mode much less than even the BET process, and thus the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is more power efficient than the BET method.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of another aspect station <b>1000</b>. Station <b>1000</b> includes two reception paths, wake reception and decode path <b>1004</b> and barker detect and TIM decode path <b>1006</b>. Controller <b>1010</b> controls the operation of both paths and uses switch <b>1008</b> to select between these paths. Both paths receive signals from the AP via antenna <b>1002</b>. Under normal wake reception, controller <b>1010</b> selects wake reception and decode path <b>1004</b>. However, to execute steps <b>614</b> and <b>618</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) the barker detect and TIM decode path <b>1006</b> is used. Barker detect and TIM decode path <b>1006</b> includes data reception circuitry and pattern matching circuitry to allow for quick and power efficient detection of the barker. Once the barker is detected, barker detect and TIM decode path <b>1006</b> includes circuitry designed for receiving and decoding the TIM. Because this circuitry is designed for one type of data segment, it is designed to perform this specific task using minimal power. The controller <b>1010</b> uses the TIM data to determine if data for the station is queued in the AP. If not, the controller continues to enable barker detect and TIM decode path <b>1006</b> during the wake period for TIM reception. Therefore, even during the wake up periods to receive the TIM within the beacon frame (such as periods <b>906</b> and <b>908</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>)), station <b>1000</b> operates with very high efficiency. If the TIM indicates that data is queued for station <b>1000</b>, the controller <b>1010</b> enables wake reception and decode path <b>1004</b> to allow for normal reception of the data to be transmitted to station <b>1000</b>. In an alternative aspect, all of the functions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> except for antenna <b>1002</b> are include in an integrated circuit. In yet another alternative aspect, an integrated circuit includes separate RF circuitry for receiving the RF signal from antenna <b>1002</b> in the wake reception and decode path <b>1004</b> and the barker detect and TIM decode path <b>1006</b>. The decode functions of barker detect and TIM decode path <b>1006</b> are performed by separate, low power circuitry and the decode functions of wake reception and decode path along with the functions of controller <b>1010</b> are performed by a processing core on the integrated circuit under the control of software to perform the steps of method <b>600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an example aspect, an integrated circuit includes an input coupled to receive a plurality of beacon frames, the beacon frames include an indication of data transmissions available for a device that includes the integrated circuit.
