The horny jaws have characteristics of a stable morphological structure and a corrosion resistance, and store biological information of the cephalopods well. An analysis of the biological information stored in the horny jaws is an important point in a biological research of marine fishery resources. Statistics of morphological parameters, the analysis of stable isotopes, an interpretation of whorls, etc., may be carried out by using the horny jaws, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the research of a marine biological population classification and identification, a fish stock assessment and prediction, a global climate change and a fishery production. Among them, a determination of the morphological parameters of horny jaws is the basis of various related studies on the cephalopods.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, a common method to measure the morphological parameters of the horny jaws is to use a vernier caliper and other measuring tools. The horny jaws have the characteristics of an irregular shape, a small volume and slippery surfaces. The conventional method is low in cost and simple, but researchers are prone to accidental errors due to factors such as a difficult measurement, a wrong operation and a wrong reading, and a data collection speed is slow because of a large number of samples and a heavy workload.
