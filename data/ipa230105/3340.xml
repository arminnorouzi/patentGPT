The lubrication may be obtained via a stationary lubricator, integrated into the individual machine. Alternatively, the lubrication may be obtained via a mobile lubricator, which may service a multiple of machines. For example, a mobile lubricator may be portable or transportable, such that it is easily transported to/from different lubrication targets e.g. by a human.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A lubricator typically comprises a lubricant pump, which produces the pump pressure for dispensing the lubricant. In addition, the lubricator comprises a pump driver, e.g. a motor, and a pump driver controller, e.g. a motor controller. To ensure safe operation, a lubricator typically also comprises means for avoiding overpressures within the pump and/or the components of the pump, e.g. the tubes. For example, the lubricator may comprise a pressure release valve or safety valve. Alternatively, the lubricator may be restricted to operation at a lower capacity pressure and/or lower motor speed, such that the risk of detrimental overpressures are reduced. Further alternatively, the lubricator may comprise a pressure gauge for detecting a predetermined detrimental overpressure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2013/034154 discloses a mobile lubrication unit comprising a pump driven by a motor, a motor controller, and a pressure gauge. The motor controller controls the operation of the motor on the basis of input from the pressure gauge, such that at a predetermined, critical maximum pressure, the motor is stopped by the controller. The predetermined maximum pressure may be provided to the controller via an input panel.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To inspect and ensure sufficient lubrication of a lubrication target, e.g. a bearing, the bearing may be lubricated until a predetermined volume of lubricant/grease has been introduced and fresh grease emerges from the bearing vent, or a certain back pressure is measured. This method is also known as the grease purge and volume (GPV) method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Different lubrication targets typically require different amounts of grease to ensure sufficient lubrication, and the different targets generate different back pressures and back pressure rates. Hence, a first bearing may require and tolerate a high lubricant pressure for efficient lubrication, and correspondingly generate a high back pressure, whereas a second bearing may only tolerate a low lubricant pressure for efficient lubrication. Thus, there may be a risk that the lubrication system can damage the second lubrication target if the lubrication pressure is not properly regulated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To further improve the lubrication safety and efficiency, improved mobile lubricators are needed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a mobile lubrication pump with improved safety and efficiency.

A list of the reference numbers can be found at the end of the detailed description section.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an embodiment of a mobile lubrication pump or dispensing station according to the present disclosure for dispensing a lubricant or grease from a container <b>7</b> to a lubrication site or more specifically a lubrication target <b>8</b>. Examples of a lubrication target include a bearing, a chain, a grease fitting, and a grease nipple. A lubrication target may also be referred to as a lubrication point or lube point. The system comprises a pump <b>1</b> mechanically connected to a motor <b>2</b> for driving the pump, and where the motor operation is regulated by a motor controller <b>3</b>. The system further comprises a pressure monitor <b>4</b> for measuring the pump pressure, and a data processing unit (DPU) <b>5</b> for communicating with the motor controller and for receiving input from the pressure monitor. The DPU is further configured for receiving a user input, e.g. via a user interface <b>6</b>, where the user input is related to the pump capacity and/or the lubrication target.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantages</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0027">To obtain a fast lubrication process, it is advantageous to operate the mobile lubrication pump at maximum capacity, e.g. at maximum pressure. However, to protect the lubrication target and the maintenance of the pump and parts thereof, a lower pressure is typically required.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">Different lubrication targets typically require different amounts of grease to ensure sufficient lubrication. Also, different lubrication targets generate different back pressures and back pressure rates. Hence a first bearing may require and tolerate a high lubricant pressure for efficient lubrication, and correspondingly generate a high back pressure, whereas a second bearing may only tolerate a low lubricant pressure for efficient lubrication.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">When using mobile lubrication pumps, there is a particularly high risk of exposing a lubrication target to inefficient lubrication. For example, to protect the lubrication target and to reduce the risk of exposing the target to an intolerable high pressure, the pump operation is typically set to a safe value, below the maximum pump capacity and below the maximum tolerable lubricant pressure at the specific target. In addition, or alternatively, manual supervision and control is used to reduce the risk of intolerable high pressures, as well as reducing the risk of too low pressures and consequently slow lubrication processes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">Different pumps will have different pump capacity, i.e. different target capacity or optimum capacity, where it operates most efficiently for producing a pump pressure for dispensing a lubricant. Hence, by the term &#x201c;pump capacity&#x201d; is meant the target load for a pump during operation, where it operates most efficiently.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">Furthermore, the pump capacity or target capacity will depend on the back pressure. Hence, at no/low back pressure, the pump capacity/target capacity will be higher than at a high back pressure. The pump capacity may be unambiguously determined by the pump type and/or pump parameters such as the target pump pressure, the target pump speed, and/or the target pump flow rate. The pump parameters are interrelated. Hence a target pump speed may be converted into an equivalent maximum pump pressure. Similarly, a target pump flow rate may be converted into an equivalent maximum pump pressure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">When using mobile lubrication pumps, there is a particularly high risk of using the pump at overload or underload, i.e. respectively operation above the pump capacity/target capacity or below the pump capacity/target capacity. For example, if the lubrication target tolerates high lubricant pressures, the pump may be overloaded due to the high back pressure, or if the lubrication target tolerates low lubricant pressure, the pump may be under loaded to ensure protection of the lubrication target.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">It was found that a more efficient lubrication process may be obtained if the pump operation is regulated based on the measured pump pressure relative to a given pump capacity and/or lubrication target.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the mobile lubrication pump, comprises:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">a motor for driving the pump for producing a pump pressure,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">a pressure monitor for measuring the pump pressure,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">a motor controller for regulating the operation of the motor,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">a data processing unit (DPU) for communicating with the motor controller, and for receiving: 1) input from the pressure monitor, and 2) user input related to: pump capacity and/or lubrication target, and</p><p id="p-0039" num="0000">wherein the data processing unit is configured to determine and communicate a motor speed and/or torque to the motor controller based on the received input 1) and 2).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a further embodiment, the pump capacity is determined by pump type, pump pressure, pump speed, and/or pump flow rate.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Data Processing Unit (DPU)</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Advantageously, the operation of the pump is regulated via a motor controller in communication with a data processing unit (DPU). The DPU is capable of receiving (1) input from a pressure monitor registering the pump pressure, as well as (2) input from a user relating to the pump capacity and/or lubrication target. Based on input (1) and (2), the DPU may determine or calculate a desired target motor speed, which is the motor speed corresponding to the target pump capacity at the measured pressure and/or the corresponding tolerable lubricant pressure at the lubrication target.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hence, the DPU determines a desired target motor speed, which is different from zero. For example, if the measured pressure (1) is higher than the equivalent pump capacity known from (2) at the measured pressure, the calculated target motor speed and/or torque will be reduced. Correspondingly, if the measured pressure (1) is lower than the equivalent pump capacity known from (2) at the measured pressure, the calculated target motor speed and/or torque will be increased. Specifically, this has the advantage that the risk of overloading the pump or parts thereof is avoided. For a conventional pump controller, if the measured pressure is high, the motor speed is not regulated, resulting in risk of overpressure or overload of the pump. However, for the present disclosure, a high measured pressure is instead compensated by regulating the speed such that the back pressure is reduced, which facilitates a more efficient lubrication and pump operation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Advantageously, the DPU is configured for continuously receiving input from the pressure monitor, such that the desired target motor speed may be known at any point of time during operation, thereby enabling the most efficient operation of the pump. Further advantageously, the DPU is configured for minimising the difference between inputs (1) and (2), which is advantageously obtained in a closed feedback loop.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the DPU is configured for continuously receiving input from the pressure monitor. In a further embodiment, the DPU is configured for minimising the difference between inputs 1) and 2). In a further embodiment, the DPU is configured for minimising the difference in a closed feedback loop.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Motor Controller</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Advantageously, the DPU continuously communicates the calculated target motor speed and/or torque to the motor controller, which thereby regulates the motor speed and/or torque to the desired target motor speed. The motor controller may be configured for regulating the operation of the motor continuously, thereby enabling continuous and efficient operation of the pump. Alternatively, or in combination, the motor controller may be configured for regulating the operation of the motor discontinuously, e.g. the motor may be stopped and subsequently restarted at the desired target motor speed after a predetermined amount of time. Preferably, the motor is restarted after a predetermined amount of time, such that equilibration of pump system is obtained before restart.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the motor controller is configured for regulating the operation of the motor continuously. In another embodiment, the motor controller is configured for regulating the operation of the motor discontinuously.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The speed and/or torque of the motor may be regulated by use of different means. For example, the speed of a motor may be regulated by changing the motor rotations per time unit, whereby the motor operation is regulated. For an electric motor, the motor torque is regulated by changing the power supplied to the electric motor, whereby the motor operation is regulated.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the motor controller is configured for regulating the motor speed and/or motor torque.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">To improve the cost efficiency of the mobile pump, the mobile pump advantageously comprises as few parts as possible. Thus, advantageously, the DPU and motor controller are an integrated unit, such as for example a frequency converter.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the DPU and the motor controller are an integrated unit.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Any type of motor and motor controller may be used. However certain combinations of motors and motor controllers may result in a more precise and controlled regulation. Advantageously, the motor is an electric motor, where examples of electric motors include DC and AC motors. For example, the motor is advantageously a brushless DC motor (BLDC) with associated controller and drive, such as a voltage control drive, where motor speed and/or torque are controlled by varying the motor voltage by means of a pulse with modulation (PWM). Alternatively, the motor may be a permanent magnet AC motor (PMAC) with associated controller and drive, such as a frequency control drive, where the motor speed and/or torque are controlled by varying the motor frequency and motor voltage by means of pulse with modulation (PWM).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">User Input</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">To improve user friendliness and user safety, the DPU is advantageously configured for receiving user input via a communication device, such as a wireless device. For example, if the communication device is a mobile phone, the DPU may receive the input wireless by a near field coupling receiver, a Bluetooth receiver, and/or an antenna configured for receiving signals via wireless internet or signal with frequencies as transmitted by mobile phones. Examples of wireless devices include a tablet, a smart phone, a laptop, or a device configured with near field coupling or Bluetooth.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the user input is received via a communication device. In a further embodiment, the communication device is a wireless device, such as a tablet, a smart phone, a laptop, or a device configured with near field coupling or Bluetooth.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">To further improve user friendliness, the safety and reduce the risk of human errors, the user input may be obtained via a tag reader configured for reading a tag associated with the pump capacity and/or the lubrication target, or a scanning device configured for reading a label associated with the pump capacity and/or the lubrication target. The tag/label is advantageously located at or adjacent to the mobile pump and/or lubrication target.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the user input is obtained via a scanning device configured for reading a label associated with the pump capacity and/or lubrication target.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To improve the cost efficiency of the mobile pump, the mobile pump advantageously comprises as few parts as possible. Thus, advantageously the user input is received manually, e.g. via a panel or a potentiometer.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the user input is received manually, such as via a panel or a potentiometer.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Pressure Monitor</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The pump pressure may be monitored with different means. Advantageously, the pressure monitor is placed adjacent to the lubricant dispenser, such that the measured pump pressure is precise and approximately the pressure experienced by the lubricant target. Hence, the pressure monitor may be a pressure sensor or pressure gauge placed in the open circuit between the lubricant container and lubricant dispenser.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Alternatively and to improve the cost efficiency of the mobile pump, the pump pressure may be derived from the pump operation parameters.
