The advantages and features of the inventive concepts and methods of achieving them will be apparent from the following example embodiments that will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted, however, that the inventive concepts are not limited to the following example embodiments, and may be implemented in various forms. Accordingly, the example embodiments are provided only to disclose the inventive concepts and let those skilled in the art know the category of the inventive concepts. In the drawings, example embodiments of the inventive concepts are not limited to the specific examples provided herein and are exaggerated for clarity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing example embodiments only and is not intended to limit the invention. As used herein, the singular terms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it may be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Similarly, it will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, the term &#x201c;directly&#x201d; means that there are no intervening elements. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including&#x201d;, when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, example embodiments in the detailed description will be described with sectional views as ideal example views of the inventive concepts. Accordingly, shapes of the example views may be modified according to manufacturing techniques and/or allowable errors. Therefore, example embodiments of the inventive concepts are not limited to the specific shape illustrated in the example views, but may include other shapes that may be created according to manufacturing processes. Areas exemplified in the drawings have general properties, and are used to illustrate specific shapes of elements. Thus, this should not be construed as limited to the scope of the inventive concepts.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be also understood that although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element in some example embodiments could be termed a second element in other example embodiments without departing from the teachings of the present invention. Example embodiments of aspects of the present inventive concepts explained and illustrated herein include their complementary counterparts. The same reference numerals or the same reference designators denote the same elements throughout the specification.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Moreover, example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations and/or plane illustrations that are idealized example illustrations. Accordingly, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an etching region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As appreciated by the present inventive entity, devices and methods of forming devices according to various example embodiments described herein may be embodied in microelectronic devices such as integrated circuits, wherein a plurality of devices according to various example embodiments described herein are integrated in the same microelectronic device. Accordingly, the cross-sectional view(s) illustrated herein may be replicated in two different directions, which need not be orthogonal, in the microelectronic device. Thus, a plan view of the microelectronic device that embodies devices according to various example embodiments described herein may include a plurality of the devices in an array and/or in a two-dimensional pattern that is based on the functionality of the microelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The devices according to various example embodiments described herein may be interspersed among other devices depending on the functionality of the microelectronic device. Moreover, microelectronic devices according to various example embodiments described herein may be replicated in a third direction that may be orthogonal to the two different directions, to provide three-dimensional integrated circuits.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Accordingly, the cross-sectional view(s) illustrated herein provide support for a plurality of devices according to various example embodiments described herein that extend along two different directions in a plan view and/or in three different directions in a perspective view. For example, when a single active region is illustrated in a cross-sectional view of a device/structure, the device/structure may include a plurality of active regions and transistor structures (or memory cell structures, gate structures, etc., as appropriate to the case) thereon, as would be illustrated by a plan view of the device/structure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Example embodiments disclosed herein may comprise program code including program instructions, software components, software modules, data files, data structures, and/or the like that are implemented by one or more physical hardware devices. Examples of program code include both machine code produced by a compiler and higher level program code that is executed using an interpreter. The hardware devices may include one or more processors. The one or more processors are computer processing devices configured to carry out the program code by performing arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations. Once the program code is loaded into the one or more processors, the one or more processors may be programmed to perform the program code, thereby transforming the one or more processors into special purpose processor(s).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, or in addition to the processors discussed above, the hardware devices may include one or more Central Processing Units (CPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), application-specific-integrated-circuits (ASICs), SoCs, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or the like. In at least some cases, the one or more CPUs, SoCs, DSPs, ASICs and FPGAs, may generally be referred to as processing circuits and/or microprocessors.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The hardware devices may also include one or more storage devices. The one or more storage devices may be tangible or non-transitory computer-readable storage media, such as random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), a permanent mass storage device (such as a disk drive), and/or any other like data storage mechanism capable of storing and recording data. The one or more storage devices may be configured to store program code for one or more operating systems and/or the program code for implementing the example embodiments described herein. The program code may also be loaded from a separate computer readable storage medium into the one or more storage devices and/or the one or more processors using a drive mechanism. Such separate computer readable storage medium may include a USB flash drive, memory stick, Blu-ray/DVD/CD-ROM drive, memory card, and/or other like computer readable storage medium (not shown). The program code may be loaded into the one or more storage devices and/or the one or more processors from a remote data storage device via a network interface, rather than via a computer readable storage medium. Additionally, the program code may be loaded into the one or more storage devices and/or the one or more processors from a remote computing system that is configured to transfer and/or distribute the program code over a network. The remote computing system may transfer and/or distribute the program code via a wired interface, an air interface, and/or any other like tangible or intangible medium. The one or more processors, the one or more storage devices, and/or the program code may be specially designed and constructed for the purposes of the example embodiments, or they may be known devices that are altered and/or modified for the purposes of the example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the example embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventive concepts described herein.

The code identifiers may indicate the relation between the official accounts. In other words, the configuration part <b>211</b> may set relations between official accounts by identifying the code identifiers and analyzing them. In another embodiment, the relation between the official accounts may be set based on analysis and/or comparison for at least one of marketing agreement, state and district, business category, family brand between the sponsors.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the configuration part <b>211</b> may allocate code identifiers, which denote family brands of companies corresponding thereto, respectively to official accounts of brands for companies, which possess two or more brands, to designate the official accounts as belonging to a related account groups corresponding to the family brands. As another example, the configuration part <b>211</b> may allocate inherent code identifiers respectively to official accounts of companies, which are involved in marketing agreements, to designate the official accounts as belonging to a related account group which is predetermined and/or desired in agreement. As still another example, the configuration part <b>211</b> may allocate code identifiers, which denote business categories, respectively to official accounts to designate the official accounts as belonging to a related account group by the business categories. Otherwise, the configuration part <b>211</b> may allocate code identifiers, which denote states (or districts), respectively to official accounts to designate the official accounts as belonging to a related account group by the states (or districts). The code identifiers may even include identifier information of official accounts, and may be even stored in a form capable of matching with identifier information of official accounts.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, the configuration part <b>211</b> may use code identifiers, according to relations between official accounts, to group official accounts of family brands, official accounts of business categories, official accounts of states, and official accounts with marketing agreement. Additionally, a relation between official accounts, which acts as a reference for grouping official accounts, may be designated by combining or extending two or more references in various classes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">At operation <b>320</b>, the management part <b>212</b> may induce friend addition to a related account group based on a relation between official accounts. For example, when a specific official account is added to a friend list, the management part <b>212</b> may propose another official account of a related account group, which includes the specific official account, as a target of proposal for friend addition. As another example, if a specific official account is preliminarily added to a friend list, the management part <b>212</b> may use a push mode to propose another official account of a related account group, which includes the specific official account, as a target of proposal for friend addition.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The management part <b>212</b> may provide additional benefits to a user who adds official accounts, which are proposed as a related account group, to his friends. For example, the management part <b>212</b> may provide a benefit to a user if the user adds official accounts of a related account group to his friends in a number larger than a predetermined and/or desired number. The management part <b>212</b> may provide differential benefits to users in accordance with the number of official accounts which are added to their friends in a related account group.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Additionally, the management part <b>212</b> may record and manage user logs, which refuse to add official accounts of a related account group to friends, by users. A list of official accounts, which have been refused the friend addition, may be specially managed respectively for users. Therefore, the management part <b>212</b> may exclude official accounts, which are refused friend addition by a user, later from targets of proposal for friend addition.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally, the management part <b>212</b> may manage official accounts, based on relations between the official accounts, in the unit of group. For example, the management part <b>212</b> may separately indicate official accounts, which are classified in a related account group, differently from other official accounts by user interface (UI). As another example, if at least a part of official accounts belonging to a related account group are included in a search result while searching the official accounts, the management part <b>212</b> may indicate other official accounts of the related account group along with the search result.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Hereinafter, an example embodiment will be now described in detail to regard family brand official accounts for a related account group as a representative example. Family brand official accounts may be grouped in relation between a parent company and an affiliated company, and between affiliated companies.
