The requirements for position stabilization depend on the spatial resolution to be achieved when imaging the object.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the development of high-resolution methods in fluorescence microscopy, especially STED microscopy, PALM/STORM microscopy and most recently MINFLUX microscopy, the resolving power of optical imaging methods has increased from diffraction-limited resolution (approx. 250 nm) to the range of a few nanometers. However, in order to actually realize the resolving powerof these methods, the relative position between the sample, the optics and the light beams must be kept respectively stable to a few nanometers. Corresponding requirements have so far been known mainly from the fields of electron and atomic force microscopy as well as interferometry.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Significant disturbance factors in imaging using high-resolution light microscopy are, in particular, temperature fluctuations, vibrations transmitted to the imaging system via the building and the floor, air flows caused by ventilation systems, and noise sources.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to minimize the influence of vibrations transmitted through the building, a favorable installation location is therefore usually chosen in this respect, for example in basement rooms, and passively and/or actively damped table systems are used. Temperature fluctuations are reduced to a minimum by using high-quality control and air-conditioning technology, and air currents in the area of the image recording system can also be greatly reduced with suitable air routing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Slow drifts of the sample relative to the microscope objective due to thermal expansion of the microscope components can also be reduced on the instrument side with suitable mechanical designs and by selecting materials with small thermal expansion coefficients.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the minimization of disturbances and the aforementioned design measures are often not sufficient to meet the stability requirements in the range of a few nanometers imposed by the high-resolution methods.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The publication WO 2015/097000 A1 describes a method, now known by the acronym MINFLUX, for the localization of spatially isolated fluorescent molecules, in which each of the individual molecules is illuminated at different positions with an intensity distribution of excitation light comprising an intensity minimum. For each of the illumination positions, the fluorescence emission excited by the excitation light is registered, and the location of the respective molecule is inferred from the course of the intensity of the fluorescence light along the positions of the intensity minimum. Naturally, this location determination is subject to error, but the error of the location determination can be reduced by applying the method iteratively. For this purpose, the illumination positions are adjusted before each iteration step, i.e., they are arranged closer around the assumed location of the molecule. At the same time, the strength of the excitation light is increased so that the intensity gradient increases near the intensity minimum. Alternatively, the measurement duration can be increased, which corresponds to an increase in the strength of the excitation light with respect to the amount of effective light. With the adjusted parameters, the molecule is illuminated successively at each of the adjusted illumination positions and the intensity of the fluorescence emission is registered. From the dependence of the fluorescence signal on the positions of the intensity minimum, the location of the molecule can now be determined with less error than before. These process steps can be repeated until convergence of the location determination or until another termination criterion is reached, for example a predetermined maximum acceptable error. With an achievable localization accuracy of approx. 1 nm, the MINFLUX method represents the most precise commercially available localization method for fluorescent molecules according to the current state of the art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO 2015/097000 A1further discloses that a (high-resolution) image of the distribution of the molecules in the sample can be obtained from the location data of the individual molecules (&#x201c;MINFLUX imaging&#x201d;). This method corresponds to the procedures generally known from STORM and PALM microscopy for generating high-resolution images from a large number of location determinations of individual fluorescent molecules, but in the case of MINFLUX microscopy results in a further increased spatial resolution of the images of 5 nm.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">DE 10 2017 104 736 B3 describes a variant of the MINFLUX method in which the scanning of the isolated fluorescence dye molecules is not performed by illuminating with an intensity distribution of excitation light having a local intensity minimum, but with two essentially complementary intensity distributions of an excitation light and a fluorescence-preventing light. Therein, the intensity distribution of the excitation light comprises a local intensity maximum, while the intensity distribution of the fluorescence-preventing light has a local intensity minimum at the same location. Specifically, the fluorescence-preventing light may be STED light, which prevents excited fluorescence dye molecules from emitting fluorescence photons by triggering stimulated emission in the edge regions of the intensity distribution of the excitation light. In this embodiment of the method, the excitation light and the fluorescence-preventing light are thus superimposed with such intensity distributions as is also done in RESOLFT and STED microscopy. This variant of the MINFLUX method takes advantage of the fact that the intensity of the fluorescence light registered for the respective fluorescence dye molecule depends on its distance from the local intensity minimum of the fluorescence-preventing light, and that its position can be determined with high accuracy from the intensities of the fluorescence light registered for several positions of the intensity minimum of the fluorescence-preventing light. Also with this variant of the MINFLUX method, the local intensity minimum can be positioned at few positions in the sample and the evaluation of the intensities of the registered fluorescence light can be carried out according to the same principles as with MINFLUX microscopy. However, the difference remains that in MINFLUX microscopy the intensity of the fluorescence light from the fluorescent marker increases with increasing distance of its position to the position of the local intensity minimum, whereas in the embodiment of the method in which the further light is fluorescence-preventing light, it decreases with increasing distance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">From STORM and PALM microscopy, the problem is known that the sample to be imaged moves relative to the microscope system during data acquisition, which compromises localization accuracy. In image reconstruction, this leads to motion blur and washed-out looking images. Corresponding to the increased localization accuracy, this problem applies to a greater extent when localizing molecules using the MINFLUX method. Here, acceptable relative movements between the sample and the microscope system are in the range of 1 nm or less.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various approaches to sample stabilization are known from the prior art, in particular for STORM and PALM microscopy, whereby either a readjustment of the sample position during the duration of the data acquisition or a subsequent correction of the image data is proposed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A laser scanning microscope with a temperature sensor is known from DE 199 59 228 A1, in which the focus position is adjusted by a correction value determined from a calibration curve for the respective current temperature. However, this method is limited to the correction of thermal drifts in the axial direction, i.e., the focusing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In EP 1 548 485 A1, a method and a microscope executing this method are proposed in which images of a preferably immobile object are taken at different times, wherein a motion estimator is used to calculate the drift between the image captures, in which the drift detection takes place via the comparison of corresponding blocks (and possibly sub-blocks) of the images.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The drifts determined for the blocks individually can then be calculated into an overall drift. The actual correction can be done either by subsequent processing of the image data or by tracking the beam or sample position during image acquisition.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">R. McGorty, D. Kamiyama, B. Huang, &#x201c;Active microscope stabilization in three dimensions using image correlation&#x201d;, Optical Nanoscopy 2 (1), 3 (2013) discloses a method in which sample drift is compensated for by tracking a piezo-driven sample stage to within 10 nm in the x and y directions and 20 nm in the z direction. The sample drift is determined by cross-correlating transmitted light images of the sample with a reference transmitted light image, whereby the drift in the x- and y directions is determined from the position of the maximum of the cross-correlation and the drift in the z-direction from its amplitude. To acquire the transmitted light images, the sample is transilluminated with infrared light, which does not influence the fluorescence imaging.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">J. Prescher, &#x201c;Assembly and optimization of a super-resolution STORM microscope for nanoscopic imaging of biological structures&#x201d;, PhD thesis, Munich (2016), describes a method for lateral drift correction in PALM/STORM microscopy, for which fluorescent nanoparticles are introduced into the sample as reference objects. To determine the drift of the sample in x- and y-direction, epifluorescence images of these nanoparticles are repeatedly taken during the STORM data acquisition and correlated with a reference epifluorescence image taken at the beginning. From the position of the maximum of the cross-correlation, the drift in x- and y-direction is determined for the respective time point and used for the location correction in the localization of the fluorescent single molecules.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">From C. Geisler et al, &#x201c;Drift estimation for single marker switching based imaging schemes&#x201d;, Optics Express 20, 7274 (2012), a method for drift correction in STORM/PALM microscopy is known that is also based on the correlation of multiple camera (raw) images, but in which the sample drift is determined as a function of time by pairwise correlation of all camera (raw) images, not just by correlation with a single reference image. Without having to make any other assumptions about the cause or nature of the drift, or modifying the data acquisition, accuracy in single-molecule localization can be greatly improved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although some of the methods mentioned can also be applied to short-term, transient disturbances, such as those caused by building vibrations, sound or by air currents, the disclosures mainly focus on the correction of slow drift phenomena.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure is based on the objective of providing a method and an associated laser scanning microscope with which a high localization accuracy can be achieved even if disturbances occurring during data acquisition according to the MINFLUX method cannot be avoided. In particular, short-term/transient disturbances are to be addressed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Solution</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The objective of the present disclosure is attained by a method according to independent claim <b>1</b>, a method according to independent claim <b>7</b> and a laser scanning microscope carrying out one of these methods and having the features of independent claim <b>19</b> or <b>20</b>. Dependent claims <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> to <b>18</b> concern preferred embodiments of the methods.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term laser scanning microscope is understood here in its broad meaning, i.e., in addition to microscopes in which the scanning of the image field is effected by a beam deflection unit, the term laser scanning microscope also covers microscopes in which the scanning of the sample is effected, for example, by moving a sample stage or by moving the objective.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The solution disclosed herein is based on the applicant's realization that, in addition to low-frequency disturbances which can be suppressed or compensated for with methods known from the prior art, high-frequency disturbances often occur in a short-term manner, i.e., are temporary. In this context, short-term means that the disturbances comprise periods of time that are small compared to the duration of an image acquisition according to the MINFLUX method described below; the periods of time may also be small compared to the duration of a localization of an individual fluorescence dye molecule coupled to a structure in a sample. One aspect of the present disclosure is based on the realization that even measured values obtained under the influence of deleterious disturbance may nevertheless contain relevant information for localization and/or for imaging, but in particular also with respect to tracking movements of fluorescence dye molecules coupled to a structure in a sample.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Both methods for determining the locations of individual fluorescence dye molecules coupled to a structure in a sample comprise the method steps known from the prior art i) sequential illumination of an individual, spatially isolated fluorescence dye molecule by an intensity distribution of an excitation light comprising a local intensity minimum or by an intensity distribution of the excitation light and an intensity distribution of a fluorescence-preventing light comprising a local intensity minimum and substantially complementary to the intensity distribution of the excitation light, (ii) detecting the number of fluorescence photons of the fluorescence light and assigning the number of fluorescence photons to the respective scan position at each step of the sequence; iii) determining the location of the fluorescence dye molecule from the set of associated numbers of fluorescent photons and scan positions with an accuracy below a dimension of a diffraction limited volume in a spatial direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first method according to the present disclosure differs from the prior art in that the magnitude of a disturbance is determined during illumination of the sample and in that a weighting factor is assigned to each element of the set of associated numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions, the value of which is determined from the magnitude of the disturbance during the detection of the fluorescence photons at the respective scan position, and that in determining the location of the fluorescence dye molecule the elements of the set of assigned numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions are taken into account according to their weighting factor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second method according to the present disclosure, which is based on the same basic idea as the first, differs from the prior art in that the magnitude of a disturbance is determined during the illumination of the sample and that the illumination of the dye molecule at the sequence of scan positions and the detection of the fluorescence photons is interrupted when the magnitude of the disturbance exceeds a first limit value.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A laser scanning microscope according to the present disclosure comprises at least: (i) a laser light source for providing excitation light; (ii) optionally, a laser light source for providing fluorescence-preventing light; (iii) a phase modulation element in a beam path of the excitation light or in a beam path of the fluorescence-preventing light; (iv) an objective focusing the excitation light into a sample and receiving fluorescence light from the sample; (v) a beam deflection device; and (vi) a detector for fluorescence light received from the sample. It differs from the prior art in that it comprises a measuring device for detecting a disturbance and in that it is adapted to carry out the method according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method according to the present disclosure is a method for the highly accurate determination of locations of individual fluorescence dye molecules coupled to a structure in a sample, which is based on the MINFLUX method known from the prior art but improves it in that disturbances occurring during data acquisition are detected and taken into account in the localization of the fluorescence dye molecules.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To carry out the method according to the present disclosure, an individual, spatially isolated fluorescence dye molecule is illuminated by an intensity distribution of an excitation light comprising a local intensity minimum or by an intensity distribution of the excitation light and an intensity distribution of a fluorescence-preventing light comprising a local intensity minimum and being substantially complementary to the intensity distribution of the excitation light and is excited to emit fluorescence light. The illumination of the fluorescence dye molecule is performed sequentially at a sequence of different scan positions of the local intensity minimum, which are arranged around the location of the fluorescence dye molecule and whose distance from the location of the fluorescence dye molecule is usually in the order of magnitude of the optical diffraction limit or below, i.e., in the range of 250 nm or less.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To determine the scan positions, approximate knowledge of the location of the fluorescence dye molecule is necessary in advance. This information can be obtained, for example, by previously taking a (coarse resolution) confocal image or an epifluorescence image of the sample or the region of interest of the sample taken with a camera. Alternatively, the sample can be scanned with the intensity distribution of the excitation light until the fluorescence light of a fluorescence dye molecule is detected. The current scan position can then be used to determine the sequence of scan positions of the intensity minimum.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Due to practical considerations, the intensity distribution of the excitation light comprising a local intensity minimum or the intensity distribution of the fluorescence-preventing light comprising a local intensity minimum will usually have the same shape at the different scan positions, although this is not mandatory; rather, illumination at the different scan positions can also take place with different shapes of the intensity distribution and, in particular, with different strengths. It is only important that the intensity distribution of the excitation light or the fluorescence-preventing light has a local intensity minimum, wherein the local minimum can be point-shaped, line-shaped or formed as a surface. Such intensity distributions can be generated by phase modulation of the wavefront of the light and are extensively known from the prior art.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At each illumination step of the sequence of scan positions of the local intensity minimum, the fluorescence light emitted by the dye molecule is detected and the number of fluorescence photons is assigned to the respective scan position. Optionally, time stamps can also be added to the pairs of values, which can be used at a later time to assign independently collected measurements of a disturbance, as explained further below. Depending on the emission rate of the fluorescence photons and the number of photons that individual molecules of the fluorescence dye emit on average before they bleach or enter a dark state, it may be useful to repeat the illumination of the dye molecule at the or at a new sequence of scan positions. It is particularly advantageous to update the scan positions on the basis of a first or a previous location determination of the fluorescence dye molecule according to the scheme explained below, and to arrange the scan positions more densely around the location of the dye molecule. Adjusting, in particular increasing, the overall intensity of the intensity distribution exhibiting a local intensity minimum can also improve the accuracy of the location determination. In each case, the sequence of scan positions can be determined completely before the start of illumination at the scan positions, for example to the vertices of a polygon centered around the assumed location of the fluorescence dye molecule (for a two-dimensional location determination) or to the vertices of a polyhedron centered around the assumed location of the fluorescence dye molecule (for a three-dimensional location determination) of the fluorescence dye molecule. Alternatively, the sequence of scan positions can also be adjusted dynamically, i.e., between successive scan positions of the sequence, taking into account the numbers of fluorescence photons detected at the preceding scan positions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the present disclosure, a disturbance is detected during the detection of the fluorescence light at the scan positions. In a preferred embodiment of the method, a weighting factor is assigned to each pair of values of the set of associated numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions, the value of which is determined from the magnitude of the disturbance during the detection of the fluorescence photons at the respective scan position.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therein, the measurement of the disturbance and the determination of the weighting factors can be synchronized with the detection of the fluorescence photons, so that the time or time interval of the disturbance measurement and the corresponding fluorescence detection coincide. Alternatively, the disturbance can be detected continuously, and the value of the disturbance stored at regular intervals. By temporal correlation, a weighting factor can thus be assigned retrospectively to each element of the set of associated numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions of the local intensity minimum. In this case, the disturbance measurement can also be carried out with an independently operating measuring device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">From the set of assigned numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions, the location of the fluorescence dye molecule can be calculated with an accuracy far below the optical diffraction limit. In the simplest case, this is done by forming the sum of the location vectors of the scan positions weighted by the numbers of fluorescence photons. A common, much more accurate method is based on a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), where a parabolic approximation is usually assumed for the intensity distribution near the local intensity minimum. For the state of the art in this respect, reference should be made, by way of example, to F. Balzarotti et al., &#x201c;Nanometer resolution imaging and tracking of fluorescent molecules with minimal photon fluxes&#x201d;, Science 355, 606 (2017) including the corresponding Supplementary Material (the latter available at https://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2016/12/21/science.aak9913.DC1).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For the determination of the location of the fluorescence dye molecule according to the present disclosure, the calculation methods known from the prior art can be used in principle; however, they must be modified in such a way that the value pairs from the assigned numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions are included in the calculation to a different extent, for example multiplicatively, according to their weighting factors. The weighting factors can also assume the value zero in order to disregard the respective value pair from the number of fluorescence photons and the associated scan position in the location determination. Alternatively, other, also nonlinear functional dependencies from the weighting factors can be realized. Values intervals can also be formed for the weighting factor, whereby all pairs of values from the number of fluorescence photons and the associated scan position whose weighting factors lie in the same value interval are included in the location determination with the same weight. This procedure corresponds to a discretization of the weighting factors. In the extreme case, the discretized weighting factors only represent binary values or truth values that indicate whether a disturbance occurred during the detection of the fluorescence photons or whether the disturbance exceeded a limit value.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The weighting factors can also be used to calculate error limits or confidence intervals for the scan positions. By using an error propagation calculation, for example according to ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008: <i>Uncertainty of measurement&#x2014;Part </i>3: <i>Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. </i>ISO, Geneva 2008, ISBN 92-67-10188-9, a (more well-founded) confidence interval for the calculated location of the fluorescence dye molecule can be derived.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further preferred embodiment of the method according to the present disclosure, the illumination of the fluorescence dye molecule and the detection of the fluorescence photons is interrupted when the disturbance detected in parallel exceeds a first limit value. Therein, the measurement can be definitively interrupted or resumed when the value falls below a second limit value. The second limit value can be selected identically to the first limit value; however, it is advantageous to select the second limit value (slightly) smaller than the first limit value so that there is a hysteresis between interruption and resumption of the measurement and no rapid interruption and resumption cycles occur. In order to avoid a freezing of the data recording, a time limit is preferably set after which the measurement is interrupted if the value of the disturbance has not yet fallen below the second limit value (again).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the present disclosure, the location of an individual fluorescence dye molecule can be determined several times in succession, so that the location can be specified as a function of time (&#x201c;tracking&#x201d;). From such data series, trajectories of individual dye molecules in a sample and especially within a biological cell can be created and graphically displayed. With the help of these trajectories, diffusion phenomena and molecular interactions, for example, can be studied with high spatial resolution. The embodiment of the method described at the beginning is particularly suitable for this application, in which weighting factors are assigned to the associated numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions, but data acquisition is continuous. Interrupting the data recording when a threshold value of the disturbance is exceeded is less suitable for tracking applications because there is a risk that the fluorescence molecule moves out of the range of the scan positions during the interruption phases and is located outside the scan positions at a later time (after the disturbance has subsided) so that it can no longer be localized.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method according to the present disclosure can also be used to determine the locations of several different dye molecules. As is known from the prior art for PALM and STORM microscopy, a spatially high-resolution image of the structure labelled with the fluorescence dye in the sample can be generated by displaying the coordinates resulting from the location determination, for example, in the form of a two-dimensional histogram or a similar representation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Insofar as fluorescence dye molecules are spatially separated, i.e., at a distance of more than one diffraction limit, the location determination can also be carried out on several fluorescence dye molecules simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously, provided that means are available for the simultaneous but independent illumination and detection of fluorescence photons of several fluorescence dye molecules. Spatially isolated fluorescence dye molecules can be achieved, for example, by using an appropriately high dilution of the dye when labelling the sample. However, in order to be able to generate a high-resolution image of the structure that is as spatially continuous as possible, it is necessary that the structure is labelled with many fluorescence dye molecules arranged in high density and that the locations of a sufficiently large part of these fluorescence dye molecules are determined. This typically requires the location determination of several thousand fluorescence dye molecules. However, the high labelling density with fluorescence dye molecules means that only a small proportion of the dye molecules may be present in a fluorescent state at any one time in order to be able to meet the requirement that fluorescent molecules be present individually and spatially isolated. In usual embodiments of the method according to the present disclosure, one will therefore resort to photo switchable fluorescence dyes, such as are also known from PALM/STORM microscopy. Photo switchable fluorescence dyes have a fluorescent state in which the dye can be excited with excitation light of suitable wavelength to emit fluorescence, and further have a dark state in which the dye cannot be excited with the excitation light to emit fluorescence. In this case, the dye can be photoactivated at least once, i.e., transferred from the dark state to the fluorescent state. Photoactivation is often light-induced, i.e., by illumination with photoactivation light of suitable wavelength (usually in the blue-violet spectral range) but can also occur spontaneously. Depending on the type of fluorescence dye, photoactivation can also be reversible, i.e., several activation-deactivation switching cycles can be run through, whereby photo-deactivation can also be light-induced or spontaneous. A typical switching mechanism is the (reversible) transition from the fluorescent state to a transient dark state, for example a triplet state. The switching kinetics of these transitions can be adapted to the respective requirements via the solvent composition, by adding redox reagents and/or by controlling the oxygen concentration in the sample.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A laser scanning microscope according to the present disclosure comprises an excitation light source for providing excitation light and optionally a light source for providing fluorescence-preventing light, a phase modulation element in a beam path of the excitation light or the fluorescence-preventing light, an objective which focuses the excitation light and optionally the fluorescence-preventing light into a sample and receives fluorescence light from the sample, a beam deflection device, a detector for fluorescence light received from the sample and a measuring device for detecting a disturbance, wherein the laser scanning microscope is adapted to carry out the method according to the present disclosure. Preferred embodiments of the laser scanning microscope according to the present disclosure can be seen in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Disturbances that often affect single-molecule location determination methods include beside temperature fluctuations in particular vibrations and oscillations transmitted from the building to the microscope, and in many cases air currents caused by ventilation systems. Especially with the highest-resolution methods, sound and even speech are often sources of disturbance. Furthermore, in addition to slow temperature fluctuations, usually caused by inadequate air conditioning technology, faster temperature fluctuations can also occur, for example when doors are opened between rooms of different temperatures. A large number of commercially available sensors are available for the (quantitative) detection of such disturbances. Of particular interest for the method according to the present disclosure and the laser scanning microscope carrying out the method according to the present disclosure are therefore above all vibration sensors, acceleration sensors, optical, capacitive or inductive distance sensors, position sensors, microphones, pressure sensors, flow sensors and temperature sensors. Many of these sensors are commercially available in miniaturized form, with high sensitivity and often even at low cost, and can be integrated directly into a laser scanning microscope according to the present disclosure and read out by the control system of the laser scanning microscope. By integrating the sensor into the laser scanning microscope, it is easy to synchronize the illumination and detection of the fluorescence photons with the measurement of the disturbance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, disturbances can also be detected independently of illuminating the fluorescence dye molecule and detecting the fluorescence photons, for example with a sensor whose measured values are continuously acquired and recorded with a data logger. In this case, it is necessary that both the elements of the set of assigned numbers of fluorescence photons and scan positions on the one hand and the measured values of the disturbance on the other hand are provided with time stamps so that an assignment of both measurements to each other is possible afterwards.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The detection of the disturbance can also be integrated into a beam path of the laser scanning microscope according to the present disclosure. For this purpose, a small part of the excitation light and/or the fluorescence-preventing light can be decoupled from the beam path of the excitation light and/or the fluorescence light and directed onto a light detector. Under the influence of disturbances, not only the position of the focused excitation light and possibly of the focused fluorescence-preventing light in the sample changes, but also the position of the coupled-out part of the excitation light and/or the coupled-out part on the light detector. In order to detect these (slight) changes in position, the light detector can be designed as a position-sensitive detector (PSD) or as a segmented detector, in particular also in the form of a camera. A particularly high sensitivity can be achieved if an interferometer is arranged in front of the light detector, which translates even the slightest disturbances, in particular vibrations or air currents, into easily detectable brightness variations. A further increase in sensitivity can be achieved if the interference pattern is recorded with a spatially resolving detector, especially a camera, and the interference pattern is examined for changes by image processing. In this way, it is also possible to detect disturbances in the beam position that lie far below the wavelength of the light.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Instead of decoupling a small part of the excitation light and/or the fluorescence-preventing light from the beam path, it is alternatively possible to use a separate measuring light beam provided by an auxiliary light source. In this case, it is advantageous to select the wavelength of the auxiliary light so that it lies spectrally outside the excitation and emission range of the fluorescence dye, for example in the infrared spectral range. When using a measuring light beam provided by an auxiliary light source, it must be ensured that it is influenced by the disturbance to be detected in a similar way as the excitation light beam and/or the fluorescence-preventing light beam, but at least allows a significant statement about the magnitude of the disturbance of the excitation light beam and/or the fluorescence-preventing light beam. Optionally, the measuring light beam provided by the auxiliary light source can be coupled into the beam path of the excitation light and/or the fluorescence-preventing light in such a way that the measuring light beam runs along at least a section of the beam path together with the beam of the excitation light and/or the fluorescence-preventing light. However, it is also possible to guide the measuring light beam independently of the excitation light beam and/or the fluorescence-preventing light beam as long as it is influenced by disturbances in a similar way as the excitation light beam and/or the fluorescence-preventing light beam, for example as a result of a mechanical coupling of the beam guiding elements of both beam paths.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an advantageous further development of the present disclosure, two or more sensors positioned at different locations can also be provided in order to more accurately detect spatially varying disturbances such as air currents. The measuring device for detecting the disturbance can also be designed in such a way that several types of disturbance are detected simultaneously, for example vibrations, air flows and noises. For this purpose, the measuring device may comprise a combination of different ones of the mentioned sensors. If several types of disturbance are detected simultaneously, the weighting factor can be calculated from the values of all disturbances or derived from the strongest disturbance in each case. Alternatively, the illumination of the fluorescence molecule can be interrupted as long as the value of one of the disturbances is above a limit value defined for this disturbance.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In further advantageous embodiments of the present disclosure, it may be provided that the measuring device for detecting the disturbance is configured to send a signal indirectly or directly to a display device; on the display device, information about the strength of disturbances may be displayed, it may be displayed whether a measurement has been interrupted or aborted, or whether a measurement has been terminated as scheduled. Such a display device may preferably be placed spatially away from the laser scanning microscope so that actions of the operator performing the experiment, such as talking, do not interfere with the measurement.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a further advantageous embodiment of the present disclosure, the signal of the measuring device for detecting the disturbance can be used to perform a beam position correction during the illumination of the fluorescence dye molecule and the detection of the fluorescence light. For this purpose, a correction value can be calculated in real time from the magnitude of the disturbance, by which the control signal of the beam deflection device according to the present disclosure, in particular of the electro-optical deflectors, is corrected and thus the scan position of the intensity minimum of the excitation light in the sample is kept at its desired position.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantageously, this correction can also be applied without a simultaneous realization of all other features of the present disclosure and in this respect constitutes a separate present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the first or second method, the intensity distribution comprising the local intensity minimum is the same for all scan positions except for a translation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the first method, the magnitude of the disturbance is stored as a function of time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the first method, the weighting factor is assigned the value zero if during the detection of the fluorescence photons the magnitude of the disturbance has reached or exceeded a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the first method, discrete values are assigned to the weighting factors, particularly wherein the discrete values are binary values indicating the presence or absence or exceeding of a limit value of the disturbance.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the second method, the illumination of the fluorescence dye molecule at the sequence of scan positions is continued when the magnitude of the disturbance falls below a second limit value, particularly wherein the second limit value is smaller than the first limit value.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the first or second method, the disturbance is detected with a vibration sensor, an acceleration sensor, an optical, capacitive or inductive distance sensor, a position sensor, a microphone, a pressure sensor, a flow sensor, a temperature sensor or with a combination of different such sensors.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to a further advantageous embodiment of the first or second method, the disturbance is detected by decoupling a small part of the excitation light from a beam path of the excitation light and directing it onto a light detector.

At the beginning of the second scanning step #<b>2</b>, the disturbance signal <b>46</b> continues to be below the first limit value <b>20</b>, whereupon the intensity minimum <b>4</b> of the intensity distribution <b>5</b> is positioned at the second scan position <b>48</b> and the fluorescence photons emitted by the fluorescence dye molecule <b>3</b>, <b>22</b> are detected for the duration of the second illumination interval <b>47</b>. The counting events <b>31</b> are summed and assigned to the second scan position <b>48</b>. The process is continued up to and including the fourth scanning step #<b>4</b>. After the end of scanning step #<b>4</b>, the disturbance signal <b>46</b> is above the first limit value <b>20</b> and the illumination process is temporarily interrupted. The interruption <b>49</b> is maintained until the time <b>50</b> when the disturbance signal <b>46</b> has fallen below the second limit value <b>21</b> again. Only then is the intensity minimum <b>4</b> of the intensity distribution <b>5</b> positioned at the fifth scan position <b>51</b> and the fluorescence photons emitted by the fluorescence dye molecule <b>3</b>,<b>22</b> are detected for the duration of the fifth illumination interval <b>47</b>. The accumulated counting events <b>31</b> are assigned to the fifth scan position <b>51</b>. At the beginning of the subsequent scanning steps, the disturbance signal <b>46</b> is still below the first limit value <b>20</b>, which is why the illumination and detection of the fluorescence light is continued as described. In the course of illuminating the fluorescent molecule <b>3</b>, <b>22</b> at the sixth scan position, the first limit value <b>20</b> of the disturbance is briefly exceeded again, which is why the illumination and detection of the fluorescence photons is briefly interrupted once more. The illumination interval can be extended by the duration of this interruption <b>49</b> to ensure equally long detection intervals.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a possible data format <b>42</b> for storing the data. For each of the scan positions <b>9</b> of the local intensity minimum <b>4</b>, the data set contains an entry in the form of a tuple <b>44</b> comprising the x-coordinate <b>52</b> and the y-coordinate <b>53</b> of the intensity minimum <b>4</b>, the number <b>10</b> of detected fluorescence photons and an identifier <b>43</b> in the form of a Boolean truth value <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Here, TRUE values indicate that the disturbances were below a threshold value during the fluorescence detection of the respective scan position, and FALSE values indicate that the disturbances were above a threshold value during at least one time point <b>50</b> during the fluorescence detection of the respective scan position. A z-coordinate can easily be added to the data format <b>42</b> (not shown) if the coordinates are available in three dimensions. This data format <b>42</b> is particularly suitable if the disturbances are detected with a sensor <b>32</b> whose output only indicates the exceeding of a limit value in digital form, but not the magnitude of the disturbance signal <b>46</b> in quantitative form.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows another possible data format <b>42</b> for storing the data.

Furthermore, each tuple <b>44</b> is assigned a time stamp <b>12</b> that reflects the time of the data recording of the respective tuple <b>44</b>. This data format <b>42</b> is advantageous if the disturbance can be recorded quantitatively in real time, so that the limit value does not have to be determined a priori but can also be determined in the course of a subsequent, separate data evaluation. This also allows a comparative analysis of data with different limit setting. The data format is also suitable for determining the location of the fluorescence dye molecule <b>3</b> taking into account a further disturbance signal <b>46</b> recorded with a sensor <b>32</b> and stored separately, also with a time stamp.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows as an example and schematically the set-up of a laser scanning microscope <b>24</b> for carrying out the method according to the present disclosure with two fluorescence dyes emitting at different emission wavelengths. Two laser light sources <b>54</b> provide excitation light <b>6</b> of different wavelengths <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, which is combined with a beam coupler <b>58</b> to form a common excitation light beam <b>41</b>. The excitation light beam <b>41</b> now passes through a beam deflection device <b>66</b>, here in the form of two electro-optical deflectors (EGDs) <b>59</b> connected in series, for deflecting the excitation light beam <b>41</b> in the horizontal or vertical direction. After passing through the EODs <b>59</b>, the two excitation wavelengths <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> are once again separated by a beam splitter <b>60</b>, and their wave fronts are shaped by two separate phase modulation elements <b>26</b>, here in the form of two liquid crystal modulators <b>61</b> (Spatial Light Modulator, SLM), in such a way that the subsequent focusing by the microscope objective <b>28</b> results in an intensity distribution <b>5</b> of the excitation light <b>6</b> in the sample <b>2</b>, which has a local intensity minimum <b>4</b>. The light beams reflected from the liquid crystal modulators <b>61</b> are coupled into a main beam path <b>63</b> of the laser scanning microscope <b>24</b> by beam couplers <b>62</b>. The beam couplers <b>62</b> are advantageously designed as narrow band reflecting dielectric notch filters <b>64</b> whose reflection range overlaps as little as possible with the emission spectrum of the fluorescence dyes, so that only small portions of the fluorescence light <b>7</b> running in the main beam path <b>63</b> in the opposite direction to the excitation light <b>6</b> are reflected out of the main beam path <b>63</b>. The excitation light <b>6</b> is directed into the rear aperture of the objective <b>28</b> by a scan lens <b>65</b>, a scanner <b>67</b> shown here as an example in a quad configuration for only one scanning direction, and a tube lens <b>68</b>. A further light beam coupled into the main beam path <b>63</b> together with the excitation light for photoactivation of fluorescence dye molecules <b>3</b> into the fluorescent state <b>22</b> is not shown in the figure for simplicity. In the configuration shown, the scanner <b>67</b> serves to provide a comparatively slow coarse positioning of the focused excitation light <b>6</b> on a fluorescence dye molecule <b>3</b> in the fluorescent state <b>22</b> in the sample <b>2</b>, which is possible over a large image field, while the EODs <b>59</b> form a beam deflection device <b>66</b> serving to provide the rapid positioning of the intensity minimum <b>4</b> at several scan positions <b>9</b> arranged closely around the assumed location <b>1</b> of the dye molecule. In this case, the EODs <b>59</b> allow positioning at high speed, but with a positioning range limited to a few micrometers. Alternatively, the beam deflection device <b>66</b> could, for example, also be formed by a fiber bundle with light emission ends of individual fibers, which are positioned in the beam path in such a way that the individual light emission ends are each assigned to different scan positions <b>9</b>, whereby a switching device is additionally provided, which causes individual fibers of the bundle to guide light sequentially in time. Other designs of the beam deflection device <b>66</b> are also possible; the only decisive factor is that the beam deflection device <b>66</b> is configured so that adjacent scan positions <b>9</b> can be sequentially supplied with excitation light. Alternatively, a device integrating the scanner <b>67</b> and the beam deflection device <b>66</b> may be provided; such a device may, for example, be formed with a so-called deformable mirror. In further alternative embodiments, the function of the scanner <b>67</b> could, for example, be performed by a movable sample stage. The fluorescence light <b>7</b> received by the objective <b>28</b> from the sample <b>2</b> propagates along the main beam path <b>63</b> in the opposite direction to the excitation light <b>6</b>, being transmitted by the beam couplers <b>62</b>. The fluorescence light <b>7</b> is focused by a lens <b>69</b> through a confocal pinhole <b>70</b>, collimated by another lens <b>69</b> and split by a dichroic beam splitter <b>71</b> into two wavelength regions comprising the emission range of one and the other fluorescence dye, respectively. The fluorescence light <b>7</b> is separated from scattered light in each case with a band-pass filter <b>72</b> and detected with two detectors <b>30</b>. The optical components of the laser scanning microscope <b>24</b> are connected via a common mechanical carrier <b>73</b>, for example an optical mounting plate <b>74</b>. According to the present disclosure, a measuring device <b>17</b> with a sensor <b>32</b> for a disturbance is coupled to the mechanical carrier <b>73</b>, which is designed here as a vibration sensor <b>75</b> and serves to measure vibrations coupled to the measuring system via the common carrier <b>73</b> or via air movements. The laser scanning microscope <b>24</b> comprises a control unit <b>76</b> with a sequence control for executing the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and functional units for controlling the laser light sources <b>54</b>, the scanner <b>67</b> and the EODs <b>59</b> and for processing the fluorescence light signals detected by the detectors <b>30</b> and storing them in a data memory <b>45</b>, for example in one of the data formats <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The control unit <b>76</b> may include further functions, in particular analysis and visualization functions. The functional units may be integrated or designed as separate units. For carrying out the method according to the present disclosure, the control unit <b>76</b> comprises a signal input <b>77</b> for the disturbance registered by the sensor <b>32</b>. The sequence control is configured in such a way that, each time a fluorescence intensity is measured, it also records the current measured value of the sensor <b>32</b> and stores it together with the number of fluorescence photons detected and the current position of the intensity minimum <b>4</b> of the intensity distribution <b>5</b>. If the sensor <b>32</b> only indicates the exceeding of a limit value in digital form, the sequence control stores an identifier indicating the exceeding of the limit value with the fluorescence intensity. Alternatively, the sequence control is configured to suspend the measurement when a first limit value <b>20</b> of the disturbance signal is exceeded until the disturbance signal is again below the first limit value or a second limit value <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The laser scanning microscope <b>24</b> according to the present disclosure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> corresponds in its construction to the laser scanning microscope <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, but here it is equipped with only one laser light source <b>54</b> for providing excitation light <b>6</b> of a wavelength <b>55</b> and only one detector <b>30</b> for detecting fluorescence light <b>7</b>.
