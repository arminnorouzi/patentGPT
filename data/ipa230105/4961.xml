For example, e-commerce websites hosted by certain merchants may not be as secure as desired due to the technology available to and provided by the merchants. Non-limiting embodiments described herein provide for secure payment transactions that avoid the technical security flaws and associated risks of existing payment systems, such as an MitM attack. Non-limiting embodiments provide for a new protocol and process for rendering a webpage for collecting sensitive information in a manner that avoids the typical flow of data through the primary host server and is also verifiable. Non-limiting embodiments described herein also provide for efficiencies in an electronic payment processing network, such as reduced bandwidth and reduced usage of computational resources resulting from reducing and/or eliminating communications between systems that may be involved in verifying whether a payment transaction is a valid payment transaction or remedying a fraudulent payment transaction (e.g., a payment transaction that was viewed and/or updated by an entity not intended to be involved in the payment transaction).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a system <b>1000</b> for securely transmitting data via a third-party webpage <b>103</b> according to a non-limiting embodiment. A user device <b>104</b> associated with a user is used to access a third-party webpage (e.g., merchant webpage <b>103</b> or other webpage hosted by an untrusted party) through a network environment <b>101</b>, such as the Internet. The user device <b>104</b> executes a browser application that is configured to display the merchant webpage <b>103</b> based on data received from a merchant web server <b>108</b> and payment web server <b>109</b> (or some other trusted server). In operation, configuration data is generated for configuring a plurality of frames (e.g., in-line frames) within a merchant webpage <b>103</b> displayed via the browser application on the user device <b>104</b>. The configuration data may be generated and transmitted by the payment web server <b>109</b>, a payment gateway <b>114</b>, and/or a transaction processing system <b>110</b>. In some non-limiting embodiments, the configuration data is stored in a database <b>115</b> in communication with the payment web server <b>109</b> and is transmitted to merchant web server <b>108</b> from the payment web server <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the merchant webpage <b>103</b> includes webpage data from merchant web server <b>108</b> that is generated based on the configuration data. The configuration data specifies parameters for embedding frames into the merchant webpage <b>103</b>, including network information (e.g., Domain Name Server (DNS) data and/or a network address) associated with each frame, the size of each frame, the location of each frame, and/or the like. The configuration data may also specify a network address of one or more scripts located at one or more network locations. Merchant web server <b>108</b> renders the merchant webpage <b>103</b> on the user device <b>104</b> operated by the user. In some non-limiting embodiments, the network information includes DNS data relating to domains associated with the merchant system or webpage. Using the network information that is provided, it can be ensured that the scripts and frames are only executed and accessed by a trusted merchant domain (e.g., a whitelisted domain corresponding to the merchant web server <b>108</b>).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the merchant webpage <b>103</b> is displayed on the user device <b>104</b> with a plurality of browser frames (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some non-limiting embodiments, each frame may be associated with one or more input fields or selectable options, such as one or more text fields, buttons, checkboxes, drop-down menus, selection menus, and/or the like. The content of each frame of the plurality of frames may be transmitted from a domain that is separate from the merchant web server <b>108</b>. In the depicted example, the content of the frames is provided by the payment web server <b>109</b> which is physically and logically separate from the merchant web server <b>108</b>. For example, each frame may reference an in-line hyperlink for a webpage hosted by the payment web server <b>109</b> that includes one or more input fields or selectable options. In this manner, multiple communication connections may be established between the user device <b>104</b> and the payment web server <b>109</b> via the multiple frames. The merchant webpage <b>103</b> and/or frame content may prompt a user of the user device <b>104</b> to input user information (e.g., account information or other sensitive data) into the one or more input fields and/or selectable options that are presented via the frames. In this manner, sensitive user information may be provided directly to the payment web server <b>109</b> without being accessible by merchant web server <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some non-limiting embodiments, the configuration data may be verified such that an entity is unable to intercept packets and/or spoof the payment web server <b>109</b>. As an example, the configuration data may be digitally signed after being generated (e.g., the configuration data or data derived therefrom, such as a hash, may be encrypted with a private key corresponding to a public key of a long-standing public/private key pair). By cryptographically signing the configuration data, the configuration data may represent the state of the system through the entire process and a verifiable delivery of the state to the payment web server <b>109</b> and/or transaction processing system <b>110</b>. The elements of the configuration data may also be encrypted using any encryption technique. The corresponding public key may be embedded in a script or other data that is provided to the user device <b>104</b> from the payment web server <b>109</b> (e.g., via one or more frames embedded in the merchant webpage <b>103</b>). In this manner, the browser application executing on the user device <b>104</b> is enabled to verify the configuration data. For example, the encrypted value (e.g., derived from the configuration data) may be verified by a client-side script executed by the user device <b>104</b> using the corresponding public key such that the merchant web server <b>108</b> and/or other entities are unable to fake or spoof the configuration data to fraudulently obtain the sensitive user information. In response to determining that the configuration data is not valid (e.g., that it has been corrupted or altered), the payment web server <b>109</b> may then display an alert message via one or more of the frames and/or prevent sensitive user information from being inputted.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some non-limiting embodiments, once user data and/or other information is inputted into the plurality of frames, the data is transmitted to the payment web server <b>109</b>.

In some examples, the data may be aggregated and packaged by the browser application on the user device <b>104</b> before being transmitted. For example, one frame of the plurality of frames may coordinate the collection and aggregation of data from each other frame using one or more scripts. In other non-limiting embodiments, the data may be collected and aggregated from the multiple frames using server-side functionality provided by the payment web server <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some non-limiting embodiments, a temporary key may be generated by the payment web server <b>109</b> for use in the transaction.
