In the drawings, an example of the drive coupling unit <b>201</b> recessed toward the inner space <b>303</b> from the lower housing <b>105</b> is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The drive coupling unit <b>201</b> may be formed in a cylindrical groove shape on the lower housing <b>105</b>, and may include a rotational shaft <b>211</b> rotatably coupled therein and a rotary case <b>213</b> rotatably coupled on the outside thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">That is, the drive coupling unit <b>201</b> may protrude in a cylindrical form toward an upper side of the lower housing <b>105</b> and serve as a standard axis enabling rotation of the rotary case <b>213</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Meanwhile, in the case of the bioreaction agitator <b>10</b>, after an operation such as cell culture is completed, the bioreaction agitator <b>10</b> can be re-used through a number of procedures, for example, complete removal of residues on the inner space <b>303</b> of the housing unit <b>101</b> and performing sterilization again.
