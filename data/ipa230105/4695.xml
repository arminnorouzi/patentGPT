In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the weight (a specification information SP) of each microscope component may be displayed.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, the processor determines the presence or absence of limitations in use in the combination of the simulation targets (step S<b>110</b>). Limitations in use may be, for example, specific conditions under which the microscope component does not perform its original function. This specific condition may be stored in the storage device, for example, as component information of a microscope component (referred to as a use-limiting component) that does not perform its original function. Specifically, it may be stored as a specific setting in a specific combination of the use-limiting component and other microscope components. For example, in a case where a certain autofocus device does not function when a filter block is used in combination with a certain light projecting tube, information regarding these limitations may be stored as component information of the autofocus device. Therefore, the processor may determine the presence or absence of the limitations based on the component information. In addition, the processor may determine the presence or absence of the limitation on the basis of information regarding the limitations managed separately from the component information. For example, information regarding the limitations in use may be stored for each observation method, and when a combination which a specific observation method supports is simulated, the presence or absence of the limitations in use may be determined on the basis of the information regarding the limitation on specification stored for each observation method.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">When determining that there is a limitation in use in step S<b>110</b> (step S <b>110</b>: YES), the processor outputs information indicating the limitation in use in the combination of the plurality of microscope components (step S<b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In step S<b>120</b>, the information output by the processor is transmitted from the server device <b>100</b> to the client device <b>10</b>.

The identification information M may be, for example, a one-dimensional or two-dimensional code represented by a barcode or a QR code (registered trademark). As a result, the combination of the microscope systems of the user can be easily incorporated into the application. The identification information M may be associated with information such as a manufacturing year, a serial number, a purchase date, and a service life of the microscope component (here, the specific individual of the microscope component) stored as master data. Specifically, it is possible to display the service life (including the remaining life) or like of the microscope component actually used by the user by reading the identification information M of the specific microscope component. If the remaining useful life is short, a notification of replacement time or the like may be displayed.

For example, the server device <b>100</b> may generate and output only the compatibility information.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Although not specifically mentioned in the above-described embodiment, it is desirable that the simulation assembly procedure of each component be performed and displayed in the order of actually assembling the microscope. Specifically, restrictions on the actual machine such as combining the frame and the stage first and combining the objective lens last may be reflected in the simulation. As a result, in a case where the user sequentially considers the combination of the components in order, it is possible to perform the simulation with a sense closer to an actual microscope assembly sense. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, after detecting the specifying of the requirement (step S<b>210</b>), the server device <b>100</b> may determine whether the microscope components have been allocated to all the categories (step S<b>220</b>), determine a category to which the microscope component is to be assigned when there is a category for which the assignment has not been completed (step <b>5220</b>: NO), and output category information prompting the allocation of the microscope component to the category to the client device (step S<b>230</b>). The category information output in step <b>5230</b> may be output according to the order of the predetermined categories, specifically, the actual assembly order of the microscope. Since the user assigns the microscope component to each category according to the category information output in a specific order, the server device <b>100</b> can perform simulation reflecting an actual assembly procedure. Furthermore, thereafter, when the server device <b>100</b> detects the assignment of the microscope component, a series of processes (steps S<b>240</b> to S<b>270</b>) such as acquisition of component information, simulation, and output of a result may be performed, and thus simulation may be performed and a result thereof may be displayed each time the microscope component is assigned. The server device <b>100</b> may simulate the assembly of the entire microscope system by repeating the processing as much as the user desires to continue the simulation (step S<b>280</b>: YES).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Although not particularly mentioned in the embodiment described above, the server device <b>100</b> may distinguish the client device <b>10</b> and the user and manage the use history of the application for each of the client device <b>10</b> and the user. The recommendation function may be personalized using the use history. For example, a microscope component frequently selected by the user may be stored, and an upward compatible product or the like of the component may be recommended. In addition to the use history of the user, the recommendation function may be extended using the use history of another user having a similar use history. Accordingly, it is possible to more easily promote the sales to the user.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the above-described embodiment, an example has been described in which the microscope component to be simulated is specified after specifying the requirements to be satisfied by the microscope system, but the user may specify the microscope component without specifying the requirements to be satisfied by the microscope system.

However, the server device <b>100</b> may propose a combination of the microscope components based on only the specified requirements to be satisfied by the microscope system without accepting the designation of the microscope component to be simulated. This combination of microscope components may be selected from the recommended combinations described above. In addition, a combination of a plurality of microscope components may be proposed, and the proposed combination of the microscope components may be narrowed down by the user adding a requirement.

However, the simulation may be performed by designating the microscope component (that is, the type of microscope component) to be simulated and further designating detailed information (that is, the individual of the microscope component) of the microscope component. The detailed information is information for each individual, unlike, for example, specifications common to the microscope components. The detailed information may be, for example, information on the purchase date of the microscope component, or may be information on the years of use or the frequency of use of the microscope component. The detailed information may be managed for each individual by the server device <b>100</b> as part of the master data of the microscope component. Further, the detailed information such as the years of use and the frequency of use may be read out at necessary timing from a sensor attached to the microscope component that is actually used. Further, these pieces of detailed information may be stored in the client device <b>11</b> (the microscope system) including the microscope component. In addition to the simulation described above, the server device <b>100</b> may suggest the user to replace the component by using the detailed information. Furthermore, in addition to the detailed information, for example, the server device <b>100</b> may predict the release date of a new product of the component using the information on the release date of the microscope component stored as the component information and suggest the user to replace the component with the new product.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the above-described embodiment, an example in which the connectivity information and the compatibility information are generated by the simulation processing has been described, but an image captured by the microscope system as the simulation target may be reproduced.

For example, if the price of each component is stored in the master data, the total price of the microscope may be specified and displayed as the requirement. The connectivity information and the compatibility information relating the technical specification of the microscope component are more important in that introduction of the component becomes impossible when the simulation result is negative. In addition to these pieces of information, price information that is not a technical specification of the microscope component is displayed, so that the user can more conveniently consider addition and change of each component.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the above-described embodiment, an example in which the client device <b>10</b> and the server device <b>100</b> are separate devices connected via the network has been described.
