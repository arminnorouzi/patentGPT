Furthermore, the present invention refers to a fluid composition comprising the inventive dry composition as well as to an emulsion comprising the inventive dry composition. The present invention also refers to the use of the inventive compositions for sun protection of plants and parts thereof as well as the use of the inventive emulsion for chemical and physical sun protection in a cosmetic formulation.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known that the sunlight energy and mainly the ultraviolet portion of the sun's spectrum has a damaging effect on living cells, especially on plants and parts thereof as well as on the human skin. In particular, the ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation which ranges from 280 to 320 nm and the ultraviolet A (UV-A) radiation which ranges from &#x3e;320 to 400 nm both cause sunburn to plants and parts thereof. Especially, when the shaded air temperature is above a temperature of ca. 30&#xb0; C., plants and parts thereof and especially fruits can be damaged due to sunburn. The consequence of such a &#x201c;fruit sunburn&#x201d; is a damage of the fruits and a decrease of the total production yield, causing an economic impact, mainly in hot summer seasons.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, the ultraviolet A (UV-A) and ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation have a damaging effect on the human DNA by the formation of free radicals and other reactive species developed through phototoxic reactions in the epidermis and dermis of the skin. As a consequence, the UV-A and UV-B radiation is now considered as a main factor in the development of chronic light-induced alterations such as premature ageing of the skin and development of skin cancer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to protect living cells from sunburn. Especially, to protect at least the part of the plants and parts thereof and especially, the fruits which are exposed to sun light. Also the human skin which is exposed to sun light has to be protected against UV-B as well as UV-A radiation. In the art several attempts have been made to provide such UV protection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One attempt to protect the plants from sunburn is by covering up the living cells from the sunlight by opaque materials such as foils or fabrics. For example, CN203538002 refers to a pomegranate cultivation bag capable of preventing sunburn, wherein one side of the pomegranate cultivation bag is reflective, and the other side is transparent. During a high temperature season, the pomegranate cultivation bag is sleeved over a pomegranate with the reflective side facing the sun to reflect most of sun light in the noon to prevent sunburn of the pomegranate, and partial sun light reflected by a reflective plastic film irradiates on the leaves at the shady side of a fruit tree to increase the photosynthesis of the entire orchard. However, such a procedure is complex, time-consuming and labor-intensive, since every plant or fruit has to be treated individually by hand.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another option to reduce the probability of sunburn is the using of mineral particles, usually clay or calcium carbonate, which form a film on the plants and parts thereof or on the human skin and protect the living cells by reflecting or absorbing the damaging UV radiation. Therefore, these compounds are known as physical sun protecting agents. Such sunscreen compositions for applications to plants are known, for example from US 2012/0052187 A1 that refers to a sunscreen composition comprising Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), Zinc Oxide (ZnO), Silicon Dioxide (SiO2), a surfactant, wetting agent, dispersant (SWD) and water. The composition forms a suspension concentrate that when diluted in water provides a solution that provides uniform coverage using conventional spraying equipment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO 2010/008476 A1 refers to a method for increasing a yield of a crop including controlling plant tissue stress by at least partially coating a plant tissue with a composition comprising an agricultural sunscreen formulation and a second agricultural chemical. The agricultural sunscreen formulation may comprise 40 to 80 wt.-% calcium carbonate, 1 to 5 wt.-% bicarbonate and 15 to 59 wt.-% water.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">US2016037772 A1 refers to a method for treating a plant in order to increase tolerance to abiotic stress in the plant or to reduce a consequence of abiotic stress in the plant. Sunblocks can be added such as kaolin or calcium carbonate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">US2017333301 A1 refers to a water-in-oil emulsion sunscreen cosmetic comprising 6 to 40 mass % of a UV protective agent; an organic-modified clay mineral; an oil-phase-thickening agent, and a silicone-based surfactant having an HLB of less than 8. The UV-protective agent may be particles of metal oxides such as zinc oxide, titanium oxide, iron oxide, cerium oxide, and tungsten oxide.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Inorganic UV filters such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are photostable and give a broad spectrum protection covering UV-A and UV-B by blocking the UV light. So-called mineral-only sunscreen formulations, i.e. sunscreen formulations comprising solely inorganic UV filter materials such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide were long time especially recommended for people with sensitive skin as well as for babies and toddlers. However, the inorganic UV filters are mostly used in the form of nano particles and it is speculated recently that these nano particles might have harmful effects on the nature and the human skin.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The article &#x201c;Encapsulating TiO2 in Lignin-Based Colloidal Spheres for High Sunscreen Performance and weak Photocatalytic Activity&#x201d; YuanYuan Li et al., ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, vol. 7, no. 6, 18 Feb. 2019 refers to nano TiO2 particles that are well trapped in lignin colloidal spheres. However, as already set out above, TiO2 nano particles might have harmful effects on the nature and the human skin. Furthermore, colloidal spheres show different chemical performance than, for example, particles that coated with lignin on the particles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The article &#x201c;Lignin coating to quench photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles for potential skin care applications&#x201d;, M. Morsella at al., RSC Advances, vol. 5, no. 71, 1 Jan. 2015 refers to lignin coating to quench photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles for potential skin care applications. However, as already set out above, TiO2 nano particles might have harmful effects on the nature and the human skin. Furthermore, this document refers to the photocatalytic activity which is different to the UV activity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another option to reduce the probability of sunburn is the using of organic UV filters. Organic UV filters are often transparent or translucent. Such filters provide chemical sun protection by absorbing the UV-A and/or UV-B radiation. Organic UV filters can be classified in synthetically produced UV filters and natural occurring UV filters. Synthetically produced UV filters do not occur in nature but are produced synthetically whereas natural occurring UV filters occur in nature or are produced from natural occurring compounds.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Synthetically produced UV filters such as, for example, octocrylene can be designed such that they perfectly match with the respective system or composition they are blended with. Additionally, such filters can be customized for the individual application. However, synthetic organic UV filters, for example, such as octocrylene are subject to continuously increasing concerns especially because they are suspected to be a possible cause of skin irritations and allergies in sensitive persons and their potentially harmful effect on the environment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, there is a continuous need in the art for adequate formulations or compositions providing sufficient or improved UV-B and/or UV-A protection to living cells especially to plants and parts thereof as well as to the human skin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a composition for providing chemical and physical sun protection. More precisely, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a composition for providing sufficient or improved UV-B and/or UV-A protection to living cells, especially to plants and parts thereof as well as to human skin by different mechanisms, namely by reflecting the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation as well as by absorbing the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation. A further object of the present invention is that the compounds used in these compositions are non-toxic to humans, do not provide a harmful effect on the environment and preferably are approved by the food act to be used on plants and parts thereof, especially on fruits as well as by the FDA for use in cosmetic applications. Another object of the present invention is that the compositions should be easily and quickly produced, cheap and especially easy to handle. It is especially preferred that the compositions stick to the plants and parts thereof as well as to the human skin and don't get washed off easily by rain or sweat.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other objectives of the present invention can be solved by a composition for chemical and physical sun protection as described in the present invention and defined in the claims. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in the corresponding sub-claims.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a dry composition for chemical and physical sun protection is provided, the composition comprising a) at least one calcium carbonate, and b) from 0.1 wt.-% to 100 wt.-%, based on the dry weight of the at least one calcium carbonate of step a) of at least one lignin.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventors surprisingly found out that the foregoing composition provides sufficient or improved chemical and physical sun protection. More precisely, the inventors surprisingly found out that the inventive composition offers two different mechanisms for UV-B and/or UV-A protection to living cells, especially to plants and parts thereof as well as to human skin by different mechanisms, namely by reflecting the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation as well as by absorbing the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation. The combination of the at least one calcium carbonate and the at least one lignin results in a new and improved UV protection mechanism which is unattainable with the bare minerals and especially with bare calcium carbonate. Furthermore, the compounds used in the inventive composition, namely the calcium carbonate and the lignin are non-toxic to humans, do not provide a harmful effect on the environment. Often these compounds are also approved by the food act to be used on plants and parts thereof, especially on fruits as well as by the FDA for use in cosmetic applications. Furthermore, the inventors surprisingly found that the compositions of the present invention can be easily and quickly produced, are cheap and especially easy to handle. Furthermore, when the composition according to the present invention is used for sun protection of plants and parts thereof, another advantage might be that the composition further provides calcium nutrients to the plants due to the calcium carbonate in the composition.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect of the present invention, a fluid composition for chemical and physical sun protection is provided, the fluid composition comprising water and 1 to 100 wt.-% of the dry composition according to the present invention, based on the weight of the water. Furthermore, another advantage might be that the layer of the composition that forms on the plants and parts thereof, when the fluid composition is used on the plants and parts thereof repels also insects.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another aspect of the present invention, an emulsion for chemical and physical sun protection is provided, the emulsion comprising a water in oil or oil in water mixture and 0.1 to 100 wt.-% of the dry composition according to the present invention, based on the weight of the water in oil or oil in water mixture.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another aspect of the present invention the compositions according to the present invention are used for sun protection of plants and parts thereof, where the sun protection includes physical and chemical protection.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to another aspect of the present invention the inventive emulsion is used for chemical and physical sun protection in a cosmetic formulation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0025"

Calcium carbonate is known to exist as three types of crystal polymorphs: calcite, aragonite and vaterite. Calcite, the most common crystal polymorph, is considered to be the most stable crystal form of calcium carbonate. Less common is aragonite, which has a discrete or clustered needle orthorhombic crystal structure. Vaterite is the rarest calcium carbonate polymorph and is generally unstable. Ground calcium carbonate is almost exclusively of the calcitic polymorph, which is said to be trigonal-rhombohedral and represents the most stable form of the calcium carbonate polymorphs. The term &#x201c;source&#x201d; of the calcium carbonate in the meaning of the present application refers to the naturally occurring mineral material from which the calcium carbonate is obtained. The source of the calcium carbonate may comprise further naturally occurring components such as alumino silicate etc.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In general, the grinding of natural ground calcium carbonate may be a dry or wet grinding step and may be carried out with any conventional grinding device, for example, under conditions such that comminution predominantly results from impacts with a secondary body, i.e. in one or more of: a ball mill, a rod mill, a vibrating mill, a roll crusher, a centrifugal impact mill, a vertical bead mill, an attrition mill, a pin mill, a hammer mill, a pulveriser, a shredder, a de-clumper, a knife cutter, or other such equipment known to the skilled man. In case the calcium carbonate-comprising mineral material comprises a wet ground calcium carbonate-comprising mineral material, the grinding step may be performed under conditions such that autogenous grinding takes place and/or by horizontal ball milling, and/or other such processes known to the skilled man. The wet processed ground calcium carbonate-comprising mineral material thus obtained may be washed and dewatered by well-known processes, e.g. by flocculation, filtration or forced evaporation prior to drying. The subsequent step of drying (if necessary) may be carried out in a single step such as spray drying, or in at least two steps. It is also common that such a mineral material undergoes a beneficiation step (such as a flotation, bleaching or magnetic separation step) to remove impurities.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to one embodiment of the present invention the source of natural or ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is selected from marble, chalk, limestone, or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the source of ground calcium carbonate is marble. According to one embodiment of the present invention the GCC is obtained by dry grinding. According to another embodiment of the present invention the GCC is obtained by wet grinding and optionally subsequent drying.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the calcium carbonate comprises one type of ground calcium carbonate. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the calcium carbonate comprises a mixture of two or more types of ground calcium carbonates selected from different sources.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">&#x201c;Precipitated calcium carbonate&#x201d; (PCC) in the meaning of the present invention is a synthesized material, generally obtained by precipitation following reaction of carbon dioxide and lime in an aqueous environment or by precipitation of a calcium and carbonate ion source in water or by precipitation by combining calcium and carbonate ions, for example CaCl2 and Na2CO3, out of solution. Further possible ways of producing PCC are the lime soda process, or the Solvay process in which PCC is a by-product of ammonia production. Precipitated calcium carbonate exists in three primary crystalline forms: calcite, aragonite and vaterite, and there are many different polymorphs (crystal habits) for each of these crystalline forms. Calcite has a trigonal structure with typical crystal habits such as scalenohedral (S-PCC), rhombohedral (R-PCC), hexagonal prismatic, pinacoidal, colloidal (C-PCC), cubic, and prismatic (P-PCC). Aragonite is an orthorhombic structure with typical crystal habits of twinned hexagonal prismatic crystals, as well as a diverse assortment of thin elongated prismatic, curved bladed, steep pyramidal, chisel shaped crystals, branching tree, and coral or worm-like form. Vaterite belongs to the hexagonal crystal system. The obtained PCC slurry can be mechanically dewatered and dried.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the precipitated calcium carbonate is precipitated calcium carbonate, preferably comprising aragonitic, vateritic or calcitic mineralogical crystal forms or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the calcium carbonate comprises one type of precipitated calcium carbonate.

The wet processed ground calcium carbonate thus obtained may be washed and dewatered by well-known processes, e.g. by flocculation, filtration or forced evaporation prior to drying. The subsequent step of drying may be carried out in a single step such as spray drying, or in at least two steps, e.g. by applying a first heating step to the calcium carbonate in order to reduce the associated moisture content to a level which is not greater than 5 wt.-%, based on the total dry weight of the calcium carbonate. The residual total moisture content of the filler can be measured by the Karl Fischer coulometric titration method, desorbing the moisture in an oven at 195&#xb0; C. and passing it continuously into the KF coulometer (Mettler Toledo coulometric KF Titrator C30, combined with Mettler oven DO 0337) using dry N2 at 100 ml/min for 10 min. The residual total moisture content can be determined with a calibration curve and also a blind of 10 min gas flow without a sample can be taken into account. The residual total moisture content may be further reduced by applying a second heating step to the calcium carbonate. In case said drying is carried out by more than one drying steps, the first step may be carried out by heating in a hot current of air, while the second and further drying steps are preferably carried out by an indirect heating in which the atmosphere in the corresponding vessel comprises a surface treatment agent.

More precisely, the inventors surprisingly found out that the inventive compositions offer two different mechanisms for UV-B and/or UV-A protection to living cells, especially to plants and parts thereof as well as to human skin by different mechanisms, namely by reflecting the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation as well as by absorbing the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0186">UV-B and/or UV-A protection can be measured by transmittance and absorbance measurements. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy or ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and Near Infrared spectroscopy (UV-Vis or UV/Vis and NIR) refers to absorption spectroscopy or reflectance spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible and near infrared spectral region. This means it uses light in the visible and adjacent ranges. The absorption or reflectance in this range directly affects the perceived color of the chemicals involved. In this region of the electromagnetic spectrum, atoms and molecules undergo electronic transitions. As used herein, the transmittance and absorbance is measured by a double beam PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere with PMT and InGaAs detectors.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0187">According to one embodiment of the present invention the composition/emulsion of the present invention has an improved UV-B and/or UV-A protection to living cells, for example to plants and parts thereof, especially to fruits, as well as to human skin, compared to an identical composition/emulsion that comprises merely at least one calcium carbonate or at least one lignin.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0188">An &#x201c;identical composition/identical emulsion&#x201d; in the meaning of the present invention refers to a composition/emulsion that consists of the same ingredients in the same amounts than the inventive composition/emulsion with the exception, that the composition does not comprise both of at least one calcium carbonate and at least one lignin, but only calcium carbonate or only lignin. The missing component is replaced by the other component.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0189">According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention the composition/emulsion of the present invention has an improved transmittance and absorbance in the range of 280 nm to 320 nm, compared to an identical composition/emulsion that comprises merely at least one calcium carbonate, or alternatively in the range of &#x3e;320 nm to 400 nm, and most preferably in the range of 280 nm to 400 nm.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0190">Furthermore, the inventors surprisingly found that the compositions/emulsion of the present invention can be easily and quickly produced, are cheap and especially easy to handle. More precisely, the compositions/emulsion of the present invention can be easily produced by mixing and/or emulsifying the components of the inventive composition/emulsion as described above.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0191">Furthermore, in case the at least one lignin is present in the composition/emulsion in the form of a coating on the at least one calcium carbonate the inventors found out that these coated particles offer two different mechanisms for UV-B and/or UV-A protection to living cells, especially to plants and parts thereof as well as to human skin by different mechanisms, namely by reflecting the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation as well as by absorbing the UV-B and/or UV-A radiation. Since calcium carbonate and the lignin are non-toxic to humans and do not provide a harmful effect on the environment also these coated particles are non-toxic to humans and do not provide a harmful effect on the environment. Furthermore, in case the at least one lignin in the coating on the at least one calcium carbonate is a water insoluble lignin, for example kraft lignin, the inventors surprisingly found out that the coating sticks to the calcium carbonate even after redispersing the coated calcium carbonate particles in water. Therefore, the coating layer is preserved even if the particles are dispersed in water. For example, if such a composition is located on plants and parts thereof, the lignin cannot be washed easily away by rain or by irrigation water. If such a composition is incorporated in a cosmetic formulation on water basis, the lignin will not be washed away from the human skin by sweat easily since it sticks to the surface of the calcium carbonate.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Use of the Compositions and the Emulsion</heading><p id="p-0187" num="0192">The inventive compositions and the inventive emulsion are used for sun protection.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0193">More precisely, the inventive compositions comprising the inventive dry composition and the inventive fluid composition as used for sun protection of plants and parts thereof, where the sun protection includes physical and chemical protection.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0194">This can be easily done by applying the inventive composition to plants and parts thereof by any suitable method known to the skilled person, for example, by spraying, painting or dipping.

Furthermore, when the composition according to the present invention is used for sun protection of plants and parts thereof, another advantage might be that the composition further provides calcium nutrients to the plants due to the calcium carbonate in the composition. Furthermore, another advantage might be that the layer of the composition that forms on the plants and parts thereof, when the fluid composition is used on the plants and parts thereof repels also insects.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0197">Furthermore, the present invention refers to the use of an emulsion according to the present invention.
