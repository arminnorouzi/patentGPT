In the ink jet printer described in JP-A-2016-175275, a wiper is referred to as a wiping member, and the wiping member is provided in a wiping unit. The wiping unit moves in a direction along the ink discharging surface of the ink discharging head by obtaining power of a motor and, in a process of this movement, wipes the ink discharging surface of the ink discharging head. A cover is provided on the back side of the ink jet printer, and by opening the cover, the wiping member can be accessed. The wiping member is fixed to the wiping unit by a screw, and by removing the screw, the wiping member can be taken out to the outside of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, as described in JP-A-2016-175275, in some cases, a recording apparatus has an electric member that is exposed when a back cover constituting the housing of the apparatus is opened.

As another example, from the view point of apparatus manufacturing and convertibility, it is preferable to make a unit for each circuit substrate having a different function. However, for electrically coupling units adjacent to each other, a space between the units required for providing an electrically coupling portion such as a connector becomes large, as a result of which the size of the apparatus tends to increase.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is a liquid discharging apparatus including a liquid discharging head that discharges a liquid onto a medium, a wiping mechanism that wipes a liquid discharging surface of the liquid discharging head and has a wiper portion that moves along an axis that is along the liquid discharging surface and wipes the liquid discharging surface, and an electric portion that is a portion related to controlling the liquid discharging apparatus and includes at least one circuit substrate, wherein a first direction along the axis intersects a surface of the circuit substrate, and in the first direction, at least a part of the electric portion overlaps a part of the wiping mechanism.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a medium transportation path in a printer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the medium transportation path in the printer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a back side, which is one side of the printer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a coupling portion cover is opened from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a back cover is removed from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a control unit is opened from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref></p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view around a wiping mechanism in a state in which a high voltage unit is removed from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a coupling unit is removed from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of a power unit and the control unit in a state in which the control unit is opened with respect to the power unit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a positional relation between a recess of the power unit and a coupling connector of the control unit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a configuration inside the control unit.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a positional relation of an electric portion and the wiping mechanism when viewed from above an apparatus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a positional relation of the electric portion, the high voltage unit, and a transportation belt when viewed from back of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of the power unit and the control unit cut along a Y-Z plane.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a front view of a main substrate and a driving substrate according to another embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be schematically described.

The first direction can be said to be a moving direction of the wiper unit. Note that since, in the first direction, at least a part of the electric portion overlaps a part of the wiping mechanism, it can be said that, in the first direction, the position of at least a part of the electric portion and the position of a part of the wiping mechanism are the same. Alternatively, since, in the first direction, at least a part of the electric portion overlaps a part of the wiping mechanism, it can be said that, when viewed in a direction intersecting the first direction, at least a part of the electric portion appears to overlap a part of the wiping mechanism.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second aspect is the liquid discharging apparatus according to the first aspect, in which the wiper portion is configured to move between a home position and a wiping area where the wiper portion wipes the liquid discharging surface, and, when the wiper portion is located at the home position, at least a part of the electric portion overlaps at least a part of the wiper portion in the first direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to this aspect, the effect of the first aspect described above can be obtained from a configuration in which the wiper portion is configured to move between the home position and the wiping area where the wiper portion wipes the liquid discharging surface, and, when the wiper portion is located at the home position, at least a part of the electric portion overlaps at least a part of the wiper portion in the first direction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The third aspect is the liquid discharging apparatus according to the first or the second aspect, in which the first direction is an apparatus depth direction that is a direction from a front side of an apparatus main body to a back side of the apparatus main body. According to this aspect, since the first direction, which is the moving direction of the wiper unit, is the apparatus depth direction, the apparatus dimension in the apparatus depth direction can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fourth aspect is the liquid discharging apparatus according to the third aspect, in which the electric portion is located at the back side in the apparatus depth direction, the at least one circuit substrate comprises a power substrate and a control substrate, the power substrate and the control substrate are provided at an interval in the apparatus depth direction, the power substrate is provided in a power unit that constitutes the electric portion, and the control substrate is provided in a control unit that constitutes the electric portion and is located at an apparatus back side of the apparatus main body with respect to the power unit.

The coupling unit <b>45</b> is provided while being fixed, unlike the wiper portion <b>43</b>. The coupling unit <b>45</b> is provided with a suction needle (not illustrated). When the wiper portion <b>43</b> moves to the home position, the suction needle enters a suction hole (not illustrated) on a side of the wiper portion <b>43</b>. The wiper portion <b>43</b> is provided with a storage portion (not illustrated) that stores ink. The suction needle communicates with a pump (not illustrated).

The ink storage portions <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>C, and <b>10</b>D are provided so as to be attached to or removed from mounting portions <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, <b>11</b>C, and <b>11</b>D, respectively. In addition, a waste liquid storage portion <b>12</b> stores ink as a waste liquid that has been discharged from the line head <b>51</b> toward a flushing cap (not illustrated) for maintenance.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The transportation belt <b>13</b> is provided at a position facing the line head <b>51</b>. The transportation belt <b>13</b> is an endless belt disposed around a pulley <b>14</b> and a pulley <b>15</b> and is rotated as at least one of the pulley <b>14</b> and the pulley <b>15</b> is driven by a motor (not illustrated). The medium is transported at a position facing the line head <b>51</b> while clinging onto a belt surface of the transportation belt <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The transportation belt <b>13</b> is an endless belt formed of a base material made of urethane, rubber, and the like containing a conductive material, and a predetermined tension is given to the transportation belt <b>13</b> by a tensioner (not illustrated). At a position facing the pulley <b>14</b> across the transportation belt <b>13</b>, a charging roller (not illustrated) is provided. The charging roller is in contact with the outer surface of the transportation belt <b>13</b> and is driven and rotated as the transportation belt <b>13</b> rotates. A DC voltage is applied to the charging roller from a high voltage unit <b>90</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), as a result of which the charging roller supplies an electrical charge to a portion in contact with the transportation belt <b>13</b>. For example, the charging roller supplies a positive charge to the transportation belt <b>13</b> so as to charge the outer surface of the transportation belt <b>13</b> to have a positive polarity. Accordingly, the outer surface of the transportation belt <b>13</b> becomes an adherence surface onto which the medium clings.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, the transportation path during recording T<b>1</b> that passes through the position facing the line head <b>51</b> is configured to intersect both the horizontal direction and the vertical direction and transports the medium upward. Accordingly, the V-axis direction, which is the moving direction of the head unit <b>50</b>, also intersects both the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, an inclination angle &#x3b1; in the V-axis direction with respect to the horizontal direction is smaller than 45&#xb0;, and more specifically, approximately 15&#xb0;. With such a configuration, the size of the space required for movement of the head unit <b>50</b> in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction can be balanced, and the size of the apparatus can be suppressed from extremely increasing in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. Note that the present disclosure is not limited to the above-described configuration. The V-axis direction may be parallel to the horizontal direction, or the V-axis direction may be parallel to the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, the present disclosure includes a discharge tray <b>8</b> that is provided in the +Z direction from the head unit <b>50</b> and forms a supporting surface <b>8</b><i>b </i>for supporting the medium discharged from the medium transportation path, and the supporting surface <b>8</b><i>b </i>extends in the V-axis direction, which is the moving direction of the head unit <b>50</b>. As a result, no wasted space is formed in the relationship between the discharge tray <b>8</b> and the moving area of the head unit <b>50</b>, and the size of the apparatus is suppressed from increasing. In addition, since a part of the head unit <b>50</b> overlaps the ink storage portions <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>D in the Z-axis direction, the device dimension in the Z-axis direction can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, the medium on which recording has been performed on a first surface by the line head <b>51</b> is transported further upward by the pair of transportation rollers <b>32</b> located downstream of the transportation belt <b>13</b>. A flap <b>41</b> is provided downstream of the pair of transportation rollers <b>32</b>, and the flap <b>41</b> switches the transportation direction of the medium. When the medium is discharged as is, the flap <b>41</b> switches the transportation path of the medium such that the medium is transported upward toward a pair of transportation rollers <b>35</b>, and the medium is discharged toward the discharge tray <b>8</b> by the pair of transportation rollers <b>35</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">When recoding is performed on a second surface in addition to the first surface of the medium, the transportation direction of the medium is directed toward a branching position K<b>1</b> by the flap <b>41</b>. Next, the medium passes through the branching position K<b>1</b> and enters a switch-back path T<b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, the switch-back path T<b>2</b> is a medium transportation path above the branching position K<b>1</b>. Pairs of transportation rollers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are provided in the switch-back path T<b>2</b>. The medium that has entered the switch-back path T<b>2</b> is transported upward by the pairs of transportation rollers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, and after the lower edge of the medium passes through the branching position K<b>1</b>, the rotation direction of the pairs of transportation rollers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> is switched, as a result of which the medium is transported downward.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A reverse path T<b>3</b> is coupled to the switch-back path T<b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, the reverse path T<b>3</b> is a medium transportation path from the branching position K<b>1</b> to the pair of transportation rollers <b>38</b> through pairs of transportation rollers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>. The medium that has been transported downward from the branching position K<b>1</b> receives a feeding force from the pairs of transportation rollers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, reaches the pair of transportation rollers <b>38</b>, is curved and reversed, and transported to the pair of transportation rollers <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the medium is transported to a position facing the line head <b>51</b> again, the second surface of the medium on the opposite side of the first surface, on which recording has already been performed, faces the line head <b>51</b>. As a result, recording on the second surface of the medium can be performed by the line head <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and the subsequent figures, an electric portion <b>60</b> will be described.

The power unit <b>80</b> is disposed so as to face the control unit <b>70</b> in the Y-axis direction. Here, when attempt was made to electrically couple the power unit <b>80</b> and the control unit <b>70</b>, a space between the units required for providing an electrically coupling portion such as a connector would increase, as a result of which the size of the apparatus would tend to increase in the Y-axis direction.
