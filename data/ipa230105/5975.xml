The solder-resist layer has lower thermal conductivity than a conductor pattern of the camera board. Even if the heat generated in the image sensor is transferred to the dissipator region of the camera board, the amount of heat transferred to the thermal transfer member through the solder-resist layer is limited, and most of the amount of heat transferred to the dissipator region is diffused along a wiring pattern of the dissipator region. Therefore, the imaging device described in PTL 1 has room for improvement in terms of efficiently dissipating heat from the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of the above, and an object thereof is to provide an imaging device capable of efficiently dissipating heat from an imaging element.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above problem, an imaging device according to the present invention includes: an imaging element substrate on which an insulating layer and a conductor layer are stacked and an imaging element is mounted; and a housing which accommodates the imaging element substrate.

Since the exposed region <b>47</b> and the connection portion <b>16</b> are orthogonal to the optical axis direction OA and parallel to each other in the imaging device <b>100</b>, the interval between exposed region <b>47</b> and connection portion <b>16</b> can be kept constant even in such a case where the position adjustment is performed in the up-down direction, the left-right direction, and the rotation direction.
