SCLC usually presents as large, rapidly developing lesions arising from the centrally located tracheobronchial airways and invading the mediastinum. Typically, patients present with a cough or dyspnea, wheezing, and/or chest pain. Weight loss, fatigue and anorexia occur in up to one third of the patients. At the time of diagnosis, two thirds of the patients with SCLC have one or more clinically detectable distant metastases.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Initial (first line) treatment of SCLC can include administration of a platinum-based therapy such as 4-6 treatment cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin, in combination with etoposide or irinotecan. Current subsequent (second line) therapy upon SCLC disease progression (after first line therapy) has been reported to provide overall survival of about 7.7 months (sensitive patients) and 5.4 months (refractory patients) based on (Owonikoko, T K, et al., J Thorac Oncol. 2012 May; 7(5):866-72). One second line therapy is the administration of topotecan (e.g., HYCAMTIN, topotecan hydrochloride injection), reported in certain regimens to provide an overall survival of 7.8 months (9.9 months in sensitive patients, 5.7 months in refractory patients) (Owonikoko, T K, et al., J Thorac Oncol. 2012 May; 7(5):866-72). For example, of second line SCLC treatment with topotecan at 1.5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>administered on days 1-5 once in a three (3)-week treatment cycle provided overall response rates of about 7-24%, progression free survival (PFS) of about 3.1-3.7 months, and overall survival (OS) of 5.0-8.9 months (accompanied by grade 3 or greater neutropenia rates of 28-88% and grade 3 or greater diarrhea of less than about 5%) (PMIDs 16481389, 17135646, 17513814, 9164222, 10080612, 25385727). Another reported SCLC second line therapy is the administration of non-liposomal irinotecan at 300 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>once every three (3) weeks, providing mixed overall response rates of 0-33%, PFS of 1.7-2.8 months, and OS of 4.6-6.9 months (accompanied by grade 3 or greater neutropenia rates of 21-23% and grade 3 or greater diarrhea of less than about 0-13%) (PMID 19100647, 1321891).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Irinotecan is an active agent in the treatment of SCLC (e.g., listed in NCCN and ESMO guidelines) but it is not approved in the US or EU. Furthermore, it failed in a PHASE III registration-directed study in combination with a platinum in first line SCLC (PMID: 16648503). No targeted treatment has been successful to date in significantly improving the outcome of patients. The research of novel treatments for this disease is therefore urgently needed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides methods of treating patients with small cell lung cancer after disease progression following platinum-based therapy, by administering a therapeutically effective amount of liposomal irinotecan. In particular, a liposomal irinotecan such as MM-398 (ONIVYDE), can be administered once every two weeks to patients diagnosed with SCLC after disease progression following platinum-based therapy. In some embodiments, the liposomal irinotecan can be administered to patients diagnosed with SCLC disease progression on or after first-line platinum based chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin), immunotherapy, and/or chemo-radiation including platinum-based chemotherapy for treatment of limited or extensive stage SCLC.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A human patient diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) after disease progression following platinum-based therapy for the SCLC can be treated once every two weeks with an antineoplastic therapy consisting of a single dose of 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of irinotecan (free base) encapsulated in irinotecan liposomes. In another embodiment, a human patient who is known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele and is diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) after disease progression following platinum-based therapy for the SCLC can be treated with an antineoplastic therapy consisting of a single reduced dose (e.g., 50-70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, including 50 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>or 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) of irinotecan (free base) encapsulated in liposomes, administered once every two weeks. In another embodiment, a human patient who has previously experienced a Grade 3+ adverse event while or after receiving liposomal irinotecan after being diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and after disease progression following platinum-based therapy for the SCLC, can be treated with an antineoplastic therapy consisting of a single reduced dose (e.g., 50-70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, including 50 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>or 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) of irinotecan (free base) encapsulated in liposomes, administered once every two weeks.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The liposomal irinotecan can be a pharmaceutically acceptable liposome formulation of irinotecan, comprising irinotecan in a delivery form having a diameter of about 100 nm, such as a liposomal irinotecan (Example 1). Various suitable liposomal irinotecan preparations can be manufactured as disclosed herein (Example 8). Preferably, the liposomal irinotecan is the product MM-398 (ONIVYDE&#xae;) (Example 9). In the present disclosure MM-398 is used interchangeably with MM-398 liposomal irinotecan.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a graph showing the drug sensitivity data to SN-38 from the Sanger database were plotted for SCLC, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic cancer cell lines (Example 2).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are kinetic growth curves of DMS114 and NCI-H1048 SCLC cell lines acquired on an Incucyte instrument over 88 hours at various SN-38 concentrations</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a graph showing the anti-tumor activity of MM-398 in the DMS114 xenograft model of SCLC.

The approved regimen of MM-398 in patients with pancreatic cancer is in combination with 5-FU/LV. However, 5-FU is not an active agent used in the treatment of SCLC. To date, the treatment of patients with SCLC with MM-398 has not been disclosed. Applicants have discovered certain methods and uses of MM-398 monotherapy in patients with SCLC, including the methods and uses disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The discovery of these methods and uses of MM-398 for use in patients with SCLC was based in part on preclinical data and clinical pharmacology analysis described herein. The methods and uses are designed to balance increased efficacy with increased toxicity predicted at higher doses. Preclinical data herein indicate the activity of MM-398 in models of SCLC. Clinical pharmacology analysis supports increased toxicity at increased doses and specifically supports the safety profile of the 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>dose. Finally, preclinical efficacy data at mouse dose levels equivalent to 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>in humans are shown to be superior to topotecan.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A human patient diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) after disease progression following platinum-based therapy for the SCLC can be treated with an antineoplastic therapy consisting of a single dose of a therapeutically effective amount of irinotecan encapsulated in liposomes. The liposomal irinotecan can be a pharmaceutically acceptable liposome formulation of irinotecan, comprising irinotecan in a delivery form having a diameter of about 100 nm, such as an liposomal irinotecan (Example 1), including PEGylated liposomes. Various suitable liposomal irinotecan preparations can be manufactured as disclosed herein (Example 8). Preferably, the liposomal irinotecan is the product MM-398 (ONIVYDE) (Example 9).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>irinotecan refers to the free base, encapsulated in liposomes (dose based on the amount of irinotecan free base) and is equivalent to 100 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of the irinotecan hydrochloride anhydrous salt). Converting a dose based on irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate to a dose based on irinotecan free base is accomplished by multiplying the dose based on irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate with the ratio of the molecular weight of irinotecan free base (586.68 g/mol) and the molecular weight of irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate (677.19 g/mol). This ratio is 0.87 which can be used as a conversion factor. For example, an 80 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>dose based on irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate is equivalent to a 69.60 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>dose based on irinotecan free base (80&#xd7;0.87). In the clinic this is rounded to 70 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>to minimize any potential dosing errors.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Doses of nal-IRI in some studies were calculated based on the equivalent dose of irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate (salt); in this specification, unless specified otherwise, the doses are based on irinotecan as the free base. Accordingly, 50 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as free base is equivalent to 60 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as the hydrochloride trihydrate, 70 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as free base is equivalent to 80 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as the hydrochloride trihydrate, 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as free base is equivalent to 100 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as the hydrochloride trihydrate, and 100 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as free base is equivalent to 120 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>based on irinotecan as the hydrochloride trihydrate, in accordance with Table 1.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Salt</entry><entry>Free base</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>180</entry><entry>150</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>120</entry><entry>100</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>100</entry><entry>90</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>80</entry><entry>70</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>60</entry><entry>50</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>50</entry><entry>45</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>40</entry><entry>35</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The pharmacokinetic parameters of total Irinotecan and total SN-38 following administration of MM-398 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>as a single agent or part of combination chemotherapy are presented in Table 2.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Total Irinotecan and Total SN-38 Pharmacokinetic</entry></row><row><entry>Parameters in Patients with Solid Tumors.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Total Irinotecan</entry><entry>Total SN-38</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Dose</entry><entry>C<sub>max</sub></entry><entry>AUC<sub>0-&#x221e;</sub></entry><entry>t<sub>1/2</sub></entry><entry>C<sub>max</sub></entry><entry>t<sub>1/2</sub></entry></row><row><entry>(mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</entry><entry>[&#x3bc;g/mL]</entry><entry>[h &#xb7; &#x3bc;g/mL]</entry><entry>[h]</entry><entry>[ng/mL]</entry><entry>[h]</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Max (125%)</entry><entry>60.5</entry><entry>2216.5</entry><entry>25.8</entry><entry>8.8</entry><entry>67.8</entry></row><row><entry>90</entry><entry>48.4</entry><entry>1773.2</entry><entry>25.8</entry><entry>7.0</entry><entry>67.8</entry></row><row><entry>Min (80%)</entry><entry>38.7</entry><entry>1418.6</entry><entry>25.8</entry><entry>5.6</entry><entry>67.8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">Over the dose range of 50 to 150 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, the C<sub>max </sub>and AUC of total irinotecan increases with dose. Additionally, the C<sub>max </sub>of total SN-38 increases proportionally with dose; however, the AUC of total SN-38 increases less than proportionally with dose. Higher plasma SN-38 C<sub>max </sub>was associated with increased likelihood of experiencing neutropenia.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">The C<sub>max </sub>of SN-38 increases proportionally with liposomal irinotecan dose but the AUC of SN-38 increases less than proportionally with dose, enabling new methods of dosage adjustment. For example, the value of the parameter associated with adverse effects (C<sub>max</sub>) decreases by a relatively greater extent than the value of the parameter associated with the effectiveness of treatment (AUC). Accordingly, when an adverse effect is seen, a reduction in the dosing of the liposomal irinotecan can be implemented that maximizes the difference between the reduction in C<sub>max </sub>and in AUC. The discovery means that in treatment regimens, a given SN-38 AUC can be achieved with a surprisingly low SN-38 C<sub>max</sub>. Likewise, a given SN-38 C<sub>max </sub>can be achieved with a surprisingly high SN-38 AUC.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">Direct measurement of irinotecan liposome showed that 95% of irinotecan remains liposome encapsulated, and the ratios between total and encapsulated forms did not change with time from 0 to 169.5 hours post-dose.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">In some embodiments, the liposomal irinotecan can be characterized by the parameters in Table 2.

Preclinical experiments have demonstrated that MM-398 greatly increased the availability of SN-38 in the tumor and showed dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy at much lower doses than non-liposomal irinotecan.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0095">The activity of MM-398 as a single agent was investigated in xenograft models of SCLC.

If 2 or more patients receiving irinotecan liposome injection 70 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>every 2 weeks have DLTs then the dose will be declared not tolerable. In all other cases an additional cohort of 6 patients treated with irinotecan liposome injection starting at 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>will be enrolled. The 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>cohort will only be enrolled if the overall experience in the initial 6 patients treated in the 70 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>cohort is judged to be safe enough to reasonably expect that the 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>dose will be tolerable in the assessment of the Part 1 investigators and the Sponsor. Evaluation of DLTs will follow the same guidelines as the first cohort. If 2 or more patients have DLTs at the 90 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>dose then that dose will be considered to exceed the optimal safety and tolerability criteria, and 70 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>will be designated as the dose for Part 1b and Part 1b will initiate administering 70 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of irinotecan liposome injection.

First, lipids are dissolved in heated ethanol. The lipids can include DSPC, cholesterol and MPEG-2000-DSPE combined in a 3:2:0.015 molar ratio. Preferably, the liposomes can encapsulate irinotecan sucrose octasulfate (SOS) encapsulated in a vesicle consisting of DSPC, cholesterol and MPEG-2000-DSPE combined in a 3:2:0.015 molar ratio. The resulting ethanol-lipid solution is dispersed in an aqueous medium containing substituted amine and polyanion under conditions effective to form a properly sized (e.g. 80-120 nm) essentially unilamellar liposome containing the substituted amine (in the ammonium form) and polyanion encapsulated within a vesicle formed from the dissolved lipids. The dispersing can be performed, e.g., by mixing the ethanolic lipid solution with the aqueous solution containing a substituted amine and polyanion at the temperature above the lipid transition temperature, e.g., 60-70&#xb0; C., and extruding the resulting hydrated lipid suspension (multilamellar liposomes) under pressure through one or more track-etched, e.g. polycarbonate, membrane filters with defined pore size, e.g. 50 nm, 80 nm, 100 nm, or 200 nm. The substituted amine can be triethylamine (TEA) and the polyanion can be sucrose octasulfate (SOS) combined in a stoichiometric ratio (e.g., TEA8SOS) at a concentration of about 0.4-0.5N. All or substantially all non-entrapped TEA or SOS is then removed (e.g., by gel-filtration, dialysis or ultrafiltration) prior to contacting the liposome with irinotecan under conditions effective to allow the irinotecan to enter the liposome in exchange with TEA leaving the liposome. The conditions can include one or more conditions selected from the group consisting of: addition of the osmotic agent (e.g., 5% dextrose) to the liposome external medium to balance the osmolality of the entrapped TEA-SOS solution and/or prevent osmotic rupture of the liposomes during the loading, adjustment and/or selection of the pH (e.g. to 6.5) to reduce the drug and/or lipid degradation during the loading step, and increase of the temperature above the transition temperature of the liposome lipids (e.g., to 60-70&#xb0; C.) to accelerate the transmembrane exchange of TEA and irinotecan. The loading of irinotecan by exchange with TEA across the liposome preferably continues until all or substantially all of the TEA is removed from the liposome, thereby exhausting its concentration gradient across the liposome. Preferably, the irinotecan liposome loading process continues until the gram-equivalent ratio of irinotecan to sucrooctasulfate is at least 0.9, at least 0.95, 0.98, 0.99 or 1.0 (or ranges from about 0.9-1.0, 0.95-1.0, 0.98-1.0 or 0.99-1.0). Preferably, the irinotecan liposome loading process continues until the TEA is at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99% or more of the TEA is removed from the liposome interior. The irinotecan can form irinotecan sucrosofate within the liposome, such as irinotecan and sucrose octasulfate in a molar ratio of about 8:1. Next, any remaining extra-liposomal irinotecan and TEA is removed to obtain the irinotecan liposome using, e.g., gel (size exclusion) chromatography, dialysis, ion exchange, or ultrafiltration methods. The liposome external medium is replaced with injectable, pharmacologically acceptable fluid, e.g., buffered isotonic saline. Finally, the liposome composition is sterilized, e.g., by 0.2-micron filtration, dispensed into dose vials, labeled and stored, e.g., upon refrigeration at 2-8&#xb0; C., until use. The liposome external medium can be replaced with pharmacologically acceptable fluid at the same time as the remaining extra-liposomal irinotecan and TEA is removed. The extra-liposomal pH of the composition can be adjusted or otherwise selected to provide a desired storage stability property (e.g., to reduce formation of the lyso-PC within the liposome during storage at 4&#xb0; C. over 180 days), for example by preparing the composition at a pH of about 6.5-8.0, or any suitable pH value there between (including, e.g., 7.0-8.0, and 7.25). Irinotecan liposomes with the extra-liposomal pH values, irinotecan free base concentration (mg/mL) and various concentrations of sucrose octasulfate can be prepared as provided in more detail as described herein.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0318">DSPC, cholesterol (Chol), and PEG-DSPE were weighed out in amounts that corresponded to a 3:2:0.015 molar ratio, respectively (e.g., 1264 mg/412.5 mg/22.44 mg). The lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4/1 v/v), mixed thoroughly, and divided into 4 aliquots (A-D). Each sample was evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator at 60&#xb0; C. Residual chloroform was removed from the lipids by placing under vacuum (180 &#x3bc;torr) at room temperature for 12 h. The dried lipids were dissolved in ethanol at 60&#xb0; C., and pre-warmed TEA8SOS of appropriate concentration was added so that the final alcohol content was 10% (v/v). The lipid concentration was 75 mM. The lipid dispersion was extruded at about 65&#xb0; C. through 2 stacked 0.1 &#x3bc;m polycarbonate membranes (Nucleopore) 10 times using Lipex thermobarrel extruder (Northern Lipids, Canada), to produce liposomes with a typical average diameter of 95-115 nm (determined by quasielastic light scattering). The pH of the extruded liposomes was adjusted with 1 N NaOH to pH 6.5 as necessary. The liposomes were purified by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. First, Dowex&#x2122; IRA 910 resin was treated with 1 N NaOH, followed by 3 washes with deionized water and then followed by 3 washes of 3 N HCl, and then multiple washes with water. The liposomes were passed through the prepared resin, and the conductivity of the eluted fractions was measured by using a flow-cell conductivity meter (Pharmacia, Upsalla, Sweden). The fractions were deemed acceptable for further purification if the conductivity was less than 15 &#x3bc;S/cm. The liposome eluate was then applied to a Sephadex G-75 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with deionized water, and the collected liposome fraction was measured for conductivity (typically less than 1 &#x3bc;S/cm). Cross-membrane isotonicity was achieved by addition of 40% dextrose solution to a final concentration of 5% (w/w) and the buffer (Hepes) added from a stock solution (0.5 M, pH 6.5) to a final concentration of 10 mM.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0319">A stock solution of irinotecan was prepared by dissolving irinotecan.HCl trihydrate powder in deionized water to 15 mg/mL of anhydrous irinotecan-HCl, taking into account water content and levels of impurities obtained from the certificate of analysis of each batch. Drug loading was initiated by adding irinotecan at 500 g/mol liposome phospholipid and heating to 60&#xb1;0.1&#xb0; C. for 30 min in a hot water bath. The solutions were rapidly cooled upon removal from the water bath by immersing in ice cold water. Extraliposomal drug was removed by size exclusion chromatography, using Sephadex G75 columns equilibrated and eluted with Hepes buffered saline (10 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, pH 6.5). The samples were analyzed for irinotecan by HPLC and phosphate by the method of Bartlett (see Phosphate Determination). For storage, the samples were divided into 4 mL aliquots and the pH was adjusted as indicated in the Results using 1 N HCl or 1 N NaOH, sterile filtered under aseptic conditions, and filled into sterile clear glass vials that were sealed under argon with a Teflon&#xae; lined threaded cap and placed in a thermostatically controlled refrigerator at 4&#xb0; C. At defined time points, an aliquot was removed from each sample and tested for appearance, size, drug/lipid ratio, and drug and lipid chemical stability. The liposome size was determined in the diluted samples by dynamic light scattering using Coulter Nano-Sizer at 90 degree angle, and presented as Mean&#xb1;Standard deviation (nm) obtained by the method of cumulants.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 9: ONIVYDE (MM-398) Liposomal Irinotecan</heading><p id="p-0286" num="0320">One preferred example of a storage stable liposomal irinotecan described herein is the product that will be marketed as ONIVYDE (irinotecan liposome injection).
