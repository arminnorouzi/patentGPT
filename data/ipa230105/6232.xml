Of the fuel cells, an SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) is high in power generation efficiency and can use, as a fuel, easily handleable gas such as hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. Thus, the SOFC is more advantageous than other systems and is expected to be used as a cogeneration system that is excellent in energy saving property and environmental property. The SOFC has such a structure in which a solid electrolyte is sandwiched by a fuel electrode and an air electrode. With the electrolyte as a partition wall, fuel gas such as hydrogen is supplied to the fuel electrode side, and air or oxygen gas is supplied. There are some types of SOFCs. Patent Document 1 discloses a silicon-type SOFC that is capable of operating at a low temperature (600&#xb0; C.). This silicon-type SOFC includes a thin electrolyte to compensate for the lowness of conductivity of the electrolyte and has a single crystal silicon substrate with a through-window formed therein. On the through-window, a fuel electrode, the electrolyte, and an air electrode are laminated.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The silicon-type SOFC disclosed in FIG. 6 of Patent Document 1 has an electrolyte layer on a surface of a substrate in which a recessed groove is formed. In addition, in order to enhance the strength of the electrolyte layer and enlarge the recessed groove, at parts other than an opening of the substrate or at a part of the opening of the substrate, an insulating stress relaxation layer is formed at least on one surface thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Document 1: JP-2002-329511-A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electrolyte layer has compressive stress with respect to the Si substrate. A deflection is generated in a film at the opening at room temperature, and stress is liable to be concentrated particularly at a boundary between the Si substrate and the opening. Since the insulating stress relaxation layer in Patent Document 1 is not formed on the whole opening, the influence of thermal expansion received from the substrate at the time of operation needs to be relaxed by the insulating stress relaxation layer disposed at a part of the opening. Therefore, thermal stress is concentrated at a part where the insulating stress relaxation layer is not disposed, and the deflection of the electrolyte layer is enlarged. Consequently, power loss is caused due to, for example, peeling of the electrode off from the electrolyte layer, resulting in a lowering of power generation efficiency. In addition, since a temperature of the opening is further raised due to a power generation reaction, the deflection of the electrolyte layer is further enlarged with a lapse of operation time, and there is a risk that the electrolyte layer may be damaged.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made in view of the abovementioned problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel cell of high reliability in which an electrolyte film is not easily damaged while power generation efficiency of the fuel cell is maintained.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A fuel cell according to the present invention has a stress adjusting layer covering an opening above a support substrate, in which the stress adjusting layer has tensile stress with respect to the support substrate and has a columnar crystal structure in which a grain boundary extends along a direction parallel to a film thickness direction.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantages of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a fuel cell of high reliability in which an electrolyte film is not easily damaged while power generation efficiency of the fuel cell is maintained.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> and the insulating film <b>3</b> have the opening <b>8</b> whose inner portion is removed, and the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is exposed in the opening <b>8</b>. On the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b>, the first electrode <b>5</b> is formed such as to cover the opening <b>8</b>. While the area of the first electrode <b>5</b> is smaller than the area of the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is only required to cover the opening <b>8</b> and may have a smaller area than that of the first electrode <b>5</b>. Though the length of one side of the opening <b>8</b> is not limited to a particular length, it is approximately 50 to 300 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The electrolyte film <b>6</b> is formed on the most part of the first electrode <b>5</b>, and the second electrode <b>7</b> is further formed on the electrolyte film <b>6</b> such as to cover at least the opening <b>8</b>. While the area of the second electrode <b>7</b> is smaller than the area of the electrolyte film <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the second electrode <b>7</b> may have a portion larger than the electrolyte film <b>6</b> insofar as the first electrode <b>5</b> and the second electrode <b>7</b> do not make contact with each other.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In such a laminate film in which only the first electrode <b>5</b>, the electrolyte film <b>6</b>, and the second electrode <b>7</b> are laminated on the opening <b>8</b> and the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is absent as described above, the film thickness of the electrolyte film <b>6</b> having compressive stress with respect to the Si substrate is large, and therefore, a deflection is often generated at room temperature. On the other hand, in the first embodiment in which the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> having tensile stress is laminated, stress in the opening <b>8</b> can be adjusted, and the deflection of the film can be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The crystal structure of the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is a columnar crystal having a grain boundary that is parallel to a direction (longitudinal direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) from an opening surface toward the first electrode <b>5</b>. Thus, even if the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> does not have pores unlike a porous film, fuel gas or air can pass through the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> as long as the film thickness of the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is within a predetermined range, and electric power can be generated without hindering the supply of fuel gas or air.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view of a major part of the fuel cell <b>1</b> in a manufacturing step, which is taken along the line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. First, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> formed of single crystal Si in a Si&#x3c;100&#x3e; crystal orientation is prepared, and the insulating film <b>3</b> is formed thereon. The semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> has a thickness of equal to or more than 400 &#x3bc;m. As the insulating film <b>3</b>, for example, a silicon nitride film having tensile stress is formed in a thickness of approximately 200 nm by a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method. In the case of the CVD method, a silicon nitride film of the same film thickness is also formed on a back surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>. Next, as the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b>, an aluminum nitride film is formed in a thickness of, for example, 50 nm by a sputtering method or the like. Residual stress in the case where the aluminum nitride film is formed at a substrate temperature of 100&#xb0; C. is a tensile stress of approximately 400 MPa. However, when heat treatment at 1,000&#xb0; C. is conducted in nitrogen, for example, the tensile stress is increased to approximately 900 MPa, so that the stress can be adjusted even in a thin film. In some cases, patterning is conducted by use of a photolithography technique, and the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is removed except a portion thereof corresponding to the opening <b>8</b>. Thus, warpage of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> is adjusted, thereby dissolving defects in the case of assembling components into a module.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts the next manufacturing step of the fuel cell <b>1</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a metallic film such as a platinum film (Pt) is formed in a thickness of, for example, 50 nm by a sputtering method, patterning is conducted by use of a photolithography method such as to securely cover at least the opening <b>8</b>, and the first electrode <b>5</b> is formed by a dry etching method using Ar (argon) gas. In this instance, in order to enhance adhesion between the Pt film and the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b>, sputter etching using Ar gas, oxygen plasma, or an ozone treatment is conducted to modify the surface prior to formation of the Pt film. Thus, the adhesion is enhanced. Next, at least on a negative resist pattern by which a part of the first electrode <b>5</b> is covered, for example, a YSZ film (yttrium-containing zirconium oxide film) is formed as the electrolyte film <b>6</b> in a thickness of, for example, 200 nm by a sputtering method. The proportion of yttrium in the electrolyte film <b>6</b> is, for example, equal to or more than 3% but equal to or less than 8%. Next, for example, a Pt film is formed in a thickness of approximately 10 to 50 nm by a sputtering method, patterning is conducted by use of a photolithography method, and the second electrode <b>7</b> is formed by dry etching using Ar gas. Subsequently, a photolithography technique and an insulating film etching technique are applied to the insulating film <b>3</b> formed on the back surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>, to expose the back surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts the next manufacturing step of the fuel cell <b>1</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, by using, as a mask, the insulating film <b>3</b> on the back surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> having undergone patterning, an Si film of the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> is removed by wet etching using a KOH (potassium hydroxide) solution or a TMAH (tetramethylamide) solution or by dry etching using fluorine-containing gas as a main component, to form the opening <b>8</b>. Since the insulating film <b>3</b> has a sufficient etching selection ratio with respect to the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>, it remains as an etching stopper even after the etching is performed on the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>. Next, by hot phosphoric acid wet etching or dry etching, the insulating films <b>3</b> in the opening <b>8</b> and on the back surface are removed, to form the fuel cell <b>1</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In this instance, since the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> has a sufficient etching selection ratio with respect to the insulating film <b>3</b>, it does not have an adverse effect on the first electrode <b>5</b>, the electrolyte film <b>6</b>, and the second electrode <b>7</b> that are formed at the opening <b>8</b>, and a membrane of a favorable laminate film is formed. When wet etching is performed, such a jig that prevents the surface from being submerged is used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional TEM diagram of the fuel cell <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a grain boundary parallel to the longitudinal direction in the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> disposed on the insulating film <b>3</b> which is a lowermost layer.

While the electrolyte film <b>6</b> is also often a columnar crystal, in order to increase the amount of gas to be supplied, it is desirable that a grain diameter in the in-plane direction of the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is smaller than a grain diameter in the in-plane direction of the electrolyte film <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is only required to have tensile stress with respect to the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b> and to be a columnar crystal. For example, the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> may be a compound material including a conductive metal such as a titanium nitride film (TiN), a tungsten nitride film (WN), a molybdenum nitride film (MoN), a hafnium nitride film (HfN), or a tantalum nitride (TaN). While the film stress of titanium nitride may be compressive stress in some cases when the film is formed by sputtering, it has been confirmed that the stress can be made to be tensile stress by performing a heat treatment. When the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> has conductivity, it is preferable that it is the same pattern as the first electrode <b>5</b> in contact therewith or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is sufficient that the first electrode <b>5</b> and the second electrode <b>7</b> each have a film that has a number of grain boundaries (preferably, the grain boundaries are extended to a surface where the electrolyte film <b>6</b> makes contact with a fuel (H<sub>2</sub>) or air (O<sub>2</sub>) supplied to the fuel cell <b>1</b>, and crystal grains are small) and that has a melting point (for example, equal to or more than 900&#xb0; C.) higher than the use temperature. Examples of the film include a silver film (Ag), a nickel film (Ni), a chromium film (Cr), a palladium film (Pd), a ruthenium film (Ru), and a rhodium film (Rh), in addition to a Pt film. A film of a mixture of the abovementioned materials may be adopted. In addition, a mixed film with the electrolyte film may be adopted, and it is sufficient to have conductivity.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The insulating film <b>3</b> is not limited to a single layer of a silicon nitride film and may be a laminate film of a silicon nitride film and a silicon oxide film. It is noted that it is desirable that the insulating film <b>3</b> has tensile stress with respect to the semiconductor substrate <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Permeability of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas through the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> formed as above will be described below. To enhance the power generation efficiency of the fuel cell <b>1</b> using the electrolyte film <b>6</b> of the first embodiment, enhancement of ion conductivity of the electrolyte film <b>6</b> and a reduction in power loss are required. Though the ion conductivity of the electrolyte film <b>6</b> depends on a use environment such as an operation temperature, in order to enhance the ion conductivity of the electrolyte film <b>6</b>, it is necessary, for example, to supply fuel gas efficiently to an interface between the electrode and the electrolyte film <b>6</b> and ionize the fuel gas, to thereby conduct electricity. Therefore, it is required that the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> does not hinder the fuel gas supply. However, to adjust the compressive stress of the electrolyte film <b>6</b> and make it tensile stress, a certain degree of film thickness and denseness are required. It is noted, however, that there is a trade-off relation in which, as the film thickness is greater, the supply amount of the fuel gas is reduced, and power loss becomes larger.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, results of degassing analysis in the case where gas containing hydrogen and oxygen is supplied and where the stress adjusting layer is heated while the film thickness thereof is changed will be described. In the degassing analysis, three types of specimens, that is, a specimen A, a specimen B, and a specimen C, are compared with each other. A silicon oxide film formed on a Si substrate by a low-temperature CVD is used as the specimen A, which is used as a reference. An aluminum nitride film formed in a thickness of 50 nm as a stress adjusting layer on the specimen A is used as the specimen B. An aluminum nitride film formed in a thickness of 100 nm on the specimen A is used as the specimen C. It is noted that the silicon oxide film formed at a low temperature is highly hygroscopic and is apt to release gas such as hydrogen and oxygen when heated.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram depicting the relation between hydrogen gas permeability and a heating temperature of the stress adjusting layer. In this diagram, the axis of ordinates represents ion intensity indicative of the degassing amount, whereas the axis of abscissas represents a heating temperature. In this diagram, comparison of hydrogen gas permeability is made according to the magnitude of ion intensity, with the specimen A as a reference.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The specimen A (solid line) used as a reference has a peak at a heating temperature of 200&#xb0; C., and tends to be lowered in degassing amount even when the temperature is raised after the peak. It is noted that, in the case where a film that is apt to absorb a water component is subjected to degassing analysis similarly, it has been confirmed that the film has such a tendency that the water component in the film is evaporated at approximately 200&#xb0; C. and has a peak of degassing. Next, the specimen B (broken line) in which the stress adjusting layer is 50 nm in thickness shows a peak of degassing at 200&#xb0; C. as in the specimen A, and, though some small peaks are observed at higher temperatures, almost the same tendency as the specimen A is shown. The specimen C (dotted line) in which the stress adjusting layer is 100 nm in thickness rarely shows degassing at 200&#xb0; C., has a peak at approximately 350&#xb0; C., and has a tendency that the degassing amount is again increased at a high temperature of equal to or more than 650&#xb0; C. According to these results, in a thin film in which the film thickness of the stress adjusting layer is equal to or less than 50 nm, similarly to a state in which only the silicon oxide film is used, the stress adjusting layer allows gas to pass therethrough and releases the gas when heated. In the case where the operation is intended to be performed at a temperature of equal to or less than 600&#xb0; C. from the viewpoint of system cost reduction, if the film thickness of the stress adjusting layer is equal to or less than 100 nm, a lowering in power generation efficiency can be restrained.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram depicting the relation between oxygen gas permeability of the stress adjusting layer and a heating temperature. In this diagram, the axis of ordinates represents ion intensity indicative of the degassing amount, whereas the axis of abscissas represents a heating temperature. The specimen A (solid line) used as a reference has a peak of degassing at approximately 200&#xb0; C. as in the hydrogen gas, and there is a tendency that the degassing amount gradually decreases at higher temperatures. The specimen B (broken line) in which the stress adjusting layer is 50 nm in thickness has a peak at approximately 200&#xb0; C., and the degassing amount gradually decreases at higher temperatures as in the specimen A. The specimen C (dotted line) in which the stress adjusting layer is 100 nm in thickness has a peak at approximately 350&#xb0; C., and the degassing amount tends to decrease after the peak but increase again at a temperature of equal to or more than 500&#xb0; C. and keep increasing with temperature. Therefore, even in the case where oxygen is larger in molecular weight than that of hydrogen, the stress adjusting layer that has a thickness of equal to or less than 50 nm has the same tendency as a state in which only a silicon oxide film is used. In addition, the stress adjusting layer that has a thickness of equal to or less than 100 nm can secure oxygen gas permeation at the time of operation at a temperature of equal to or less than 600&#xb0; C., and a lowering in power generation efficiency can be restrained.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, even in the case of either fuel gas or air, when the stress adjusting layer that has a thickness of equal to or less than 100 nm, particularly equal to or less than 50 nm, is provided on the opening <b>8</b> side, gas permeability contributing power generation is not damaged, the influence of thermal stress at the operation temperature can be mitigated, and a membrane structure of a laminate film that maintains a high power generation efficiency and that is excellent in heat resistance can be obtained. However, if the film thickness of the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> is less than 1 nm, it is difficult to uniformly laminate the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b>, and it is impossible to fulfill the role as a stress adjusting layer. Therefore, it is desirable that the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> has a film thickness of equal to or more than 1 nm.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a plan view of a fuel cell <b>1</b> according to a second embodiment of the present invention.

In a manufacturing step, after the insulating film <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is formed, parts of the insulating film <b>3</b> where the second openings <b>9</b> are formed are removed by dry etching or the like using a photolithography method. Thereafter, a silicon oxide film (sacrificing layer) is formed in a thickness of equal to or more than 300 nm by use of, for example, a CVD method, and the silicon oxide film is flattened by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) until the insulating film <b>3</b> is exposed, to thereby eliminate a step between the insulating film <b>3</b> and the silicon oxide film. After the elimination of the step between the insulating film <b>3</b> and the silicon oxide film, a step of forming the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> to a step of removing the Si substrate to form the opening <b>8</b> are similar to the abovementioned steps. Thereafter, the opening <b>8</b> is immersed in a fluorine-containing wet etching liquid to remove the silicon oxide film as the sacrificing layer, thereby obtaining a structure in which the insulating film <b>3</b> and the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> are exposed. Since the insulating film <b>3</b> and the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> have a sufficient fluorine-containing etching selection ratio with respect to the silicon oxide film, no influence is exerted on the first electrode <b>5</b>, the electrolyte film <b>6</b>, and the second electrode <b>7</b> that are formed at the opening <b>8</b>, and a membrane structure of a favorable laminate film is formed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the second embodiment, there is no deflection of the laminate film of the stress adjusting layer <b>4</b> in the second openings <b>9</b> and a power generation region including the first electrode <b>5</b>, the electrolyte film <b>6</b>, and the second electrode <b>7</b>.
