A need remains for a facile method of generating shaped, fiber-based products with adequate physical properties of mold release, flexibility, compressibility, cohesion, and pliability post-shaping.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,476 to Prewett et al. (incorporated in its entirety by reference) discloses demineralized bone particles with a median length:median thickness of 10:1 incorporated into an osteogenic composition. The osteogenic composition maintains its cohesiveness and resists erosion subsequent to being applied to an osseous defect. The composition contains between about 20-80 wt. % of a carrier (e.g., glycerol) and describes producing particles of 10 mm length by 0.5 mm thick which are demineralized, and mixed with particles with glycerol to a putty-like consistency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat.

The sheets comprise at least 60 wt. % bone particles of lengths of 10-100 mm, thicknesses of 0.02-1 mm, and widths of 2-5 mm. Dowd describes a method of production of the sheet using demineralized particles by spreading wet particles on a screen, applying a force (8 psi) while drying in an oven, and then cutting the sheet to size.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat.

The method to make the product comprises providing a coherent mass of bone-derived particles, then mechanically shaping the mass of particles to form a flexible sheet. The bone particles are demineralized, lyophilized, and then mixed with a biocompatible carrier (50% by weight glycerol/water), then the mass is compressively contacted by hand (rolled out) into a sheet of minimal thickness.

The shaped fiber-based product consists of a three-dimensional form of dimensions established by the use of a mold. The properties of the shaped fiber-based product provide improved self-adhesion, flexibility and compressibility over related products in the prior art. The method of manufacturing relies on judicious selection of fiber shapes and sizes, hydration with a water-miscible, low boiling solvent, molding, and drying of the shaped, fiber-based product. In some embodiments, the water-miscible, low boiling solvent may be used in combination with water and/or a water-based solution. Fibers for the product may be cut from bone, foodstuffs, wood, plant-based materials, elastomers, thermoplastics, but are preferably cut from bone. In some embodiments, the fibers may be exposed to drying or lyophilization conditions. In some embodiments, demineralized bone fibers are shaped and sized to specific dimensions to enhance entanglement and subsequent final product self-adhesion, flexibility, and compressibility.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another aspect of the invention is the use of a controlled drying/lyophilization cycle following fiber molding to provide a product with enhanced cohesiveness and flexibility. A further aspect of the method is the use of a water-miscible, low boiling solvent prior the final drying of the fiber-based articles to provide improved fiber entanglement, fiber shaping, final product shape retention, and mold release of the final product. The use of a water-miscible, low boiling solvent further enhances the desired final product properties of self-adhesion, flexibility, and compressibility.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An aspect of the invention is a shaped, bone fiber-based product of specific dimensions.

The rehydrated fiber-based products of the invention compress under a force of between about 10 g-force/square cm to about 4000 g-force/square cm. The rehydrated, shaped fiber-based product may be compressible to about 80% of its original size, to about 60% of its original size, to about 20% of its original size, to about 5% of its original size without loss of structural integrity or fiber cohesion. Upon removal of an external compressing force, the products return to their original shape. The shaped fiber-based product may also rehydrate rapidly within an aqueous fluid over a period of about 15 seconds to about 30 minutes, of about 1 minute to about 25 minutes, or of about 5 minutes to about 20 minutes. In some embodiments, the shaped fiber-based product may also have a high rehydration rate of between about 0.5 mL of liquid/g of product/minute to about 10 mL of liquid/g of product/minute. Suitable aqueous fluids include, but are not limited to, water, saline, buffer, balanced salt solution, blood, bone marrow aspirate, plasma and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The shaped product is not a putty, but rather a sponge-like material may be composed of a single material or a mixture of materials which may be used as scaffolding during bone regrowth. In some embodiments, the shaped product may be composed of solely bone tissue. Furthermore, while the invention may be used to produce a sheet that may later be cut to form a specific shape, the invention allows for the shape to be formed without this additional step of cutting. The base material of the invention is fibers rather than particles, for example bone fibers rather than bone particles. Furthermore, the fiber to void ratio may be determined and maintained because an external force is not required during the formation of the shaped fiber base product of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Utilizing the drying/lyophilization parameters of the invention, the final shape of the product is within about 10% of its projected size based on the mold. Finally, the void to fiber ratio may be controlled to between about 1:99 to about 1:1, with a preferred void to fiber ratio ranging from about 1:19 to about 1:3. In some embodiments, the void to fiber ratio may be between about 1:99 to about 1:11, about 1:75 to about 1:4, between about 1:25 to about 1:5, between about 1:20 to about 1:6, or between about 1:10 to about 1:5.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the method for making the shaped fiber-based product utilizes low boiling solvents to facilitate final drying of the fiber-based material via azeotropic drying. The method for making the shaped fiber-based product also advantageously releases the final product from a mold with minimal if any damage or breakage. Furthermore, because of the advantageous mold release, the shape of the shaped fiber-based product is retained after removal. Thus, the final shape is within about 10% of its projected size based on the mold. Finally, the fiber to void ratio may be controlled to between about 1:99 to about 1:1, with a preferred void to fiber ratio ranging from about 1:19 to about 1:3.

The bone fibers were then demineralized following a modification version of the demineralization steps described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,476, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference. Briefly, the fibers were slurried in about 70 wt. % ethanol (about 30 mL/g of bone) for about one hour at room temperature. The ethanol was decanted off the fibers. Then about 0.6 N HCl was added to the fibers (about 15 mL/g of bone). The acid mixture was stirred for three hours at about room temperature. Following decanting of the acid, the fibers were covered and rinsed three times with water. The water for each rinse was replaced at about five-minute intervals. Following decanting of the final water rinse, the fibers were covered with about 0.1 M sodium phosphate and soaked at about room temperature until the pH of the solution was greater than about 6.8. Following decanting of the sodium phosphate solution, the fibers were rinsed two times with water. The water for each rinse was replaced at about five-minute intervals. The fibers were then split into two groups for comparison.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">One group of the demineralized fibers were slurried in water for about five minutes at about room temperature and then placed directly in a mold and the excess water was allowed to drain from the mold.
