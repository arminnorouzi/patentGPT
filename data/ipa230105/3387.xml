hearth, at least comprising a combustion chamber, gas supply means for supplying combustible gas into the combustion chamber to firebed-simulating means positioned in the combustion chamber, ignition means for igniting the combustible gas in the combustion chamber and a flue-gas discharge duct connected to the combustion chamber for discharging combustion flue gases from the combustion chamber, as well as metering means which are arranged in the combustion chamber for metering a pyrotechnical additive into the flames of the burning combustible gas during operation, wherein the metering means comprise a reservoir for the pyrotechnical additive which reservoir is provided with at least one metering opening.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various types of hearths, in particular decorative hearths, are known, many of these hearths can be used as built-in hearths or as hearth stoves. Such decorative hearths are suitable for burning gas, wood or other natural fuels. A decorative gas hearth according to the above introduction is known from, for example, EP3273163A1. The metering means meter a pyrotechnical additive into the flames of the burning combustible gas during operation, thus creating an additional fire impression, i.e. sparks which also occur with the burning of real wooden logs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although metering means as implemented in the decorative gas hearth of EP3273163A1 provide a very realistic impression of a fire resembling the burning of real wooden logs, the process of metering the pyrotechnical additive into the flames can be further improved, thus guaranteeing an improved control of the metering of pyrotechnical additive added to the flames, both in amount as in time, and thus further improving the gas fire image resembling the burning of actual wooden logs as realistic as possible.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a gas hearth according to the abovementioned preamble with an improved metering of pyrotechnical additive into the flames, thus providing a more realistic impression of a fire resembling the burning of real wooden logs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To this end, the metering means comprise displacement means positioned in the reservoir for displacing the pyrotechnical additive contained in the reservoir towards and through the at least one metering opening. With the implementation of displacement means in the reservoir, which displacement means proactively displace a certain amount of pyrotechnical additive towards and through the metering opening for metering into the flames of the burning combustible gas an improved control, both in amount as in time, can be achieved and thus an improved gas fire image resembling the burning of actual wooden logs as realistic as possible is created.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular the displacement means comprise a rotatable driven screw conveyor. Such rotatable driven screw conveyor provides a reliable supply of pyrotechnical additive towards and through the metering opening for metering into the flames of the burning combustible gas.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an example the metering means comprise at least one supply line which is connected to the metering opening and ends near the firebed-simulating means. To this end, it is possible to install the metering means elsewhere in the gas hearth and not necessarily in the combustion chamber, which is not desirable from an aesthetic and safety point of view.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, the metering means comprise at least one pump which is placed near the at least one metering opening for passing a certain amount of displaced pyrotechnical additive through the supply line in the direction of the firebed-simulating means by means of a pressurized medium.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further example, the metering means comprise control means for actuating the displacement means and the pump. With this embodiment it is possible to proactively control, both in amount as in time, the metering of pyrotechnical additive towards and through the metering opening into the flames of the burning combustible gas thus improving the resemblance of actual wooden logs as realistic as possible.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably the pump is a compressed air pump.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The metering means may be arranged under the firebed-simulating means.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further embodiment, the reservoir is provided with a filling opening which can be closed with a closure, which closure, in the embodiment wherein the metering means have been arranged under the firebed-simulating means, forms part of the firebed-simulating means.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the pyrotechnical additive may consist of granules, for example a pulverulent or granular material, in particular a carbon-containing additive.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to a drawing, in which successively:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic view of an embodiment of a gas hearth provided with metering means for metering a pyrotechnical additive according to the prior art;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic view of another embodiment of a gas hearth provided with metering means for metering a pyrotechnical additive according to the prior art;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> an example of a gas heart having improved metering means;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>a detailed view of an embodiment of metering means;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>a further detailed view of an embodiment of metering means;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>another embodiment of metering means;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>another views of an embodiment of the metering means.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For a better understanding of the invention, the similar components shown in the various figures are denoted by identical reference numerals in the following description of the figures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> diagrammatically shows an embodiment of a gas hearth according to the prior art. In particular, the burner system of a hearth is shown in the way in which it is arranged in the combustion chamber of the gas hearth.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, a decorative hearth is composed of a housing comprising side walls, a bottom wall, a front wall and a rear wall. The front wall is often transparent and can also be rotated away or slid away for maintenance. The front, bottom, rear and side walls enclose a combustion chamber <b>10</b> in which the firebed-simulating means, denoted here, for example, by reference numerals <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d, </i>are accommodated. The firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>are configured to simulate a fire image and all respective components are fitted to a bottom panel which forms part of the bottom wall of the combustion chamber <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hearth <b>1</b> is provided with gas supply means (gas supply line) <b>13</b> which are connected to a main supply line (not shown). The gas supply line <b>13</b> branches off into branch lines <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<b>13</b><i>d, </i>each of which extend into the combustion chamber <b>10</b>, and which, in particular, each end at the location of the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d. </i>A control valve <b>14</b> is incorporated in the gas supply line <b>13</b> which can be controlled by suitable control means (not shown) via the control line <b>15</b> and can be closed off in order to close off the gas supply into the combustion chamber <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>may be configured, for example, as imitation logs, which may, for example, be made of a fireproof ceramic material. Such imitation logs are often also porous, so that the gas supplied via the respective branch line <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<b>13</b><i>d </i>may flow through or leak into the porous imitation logs and can be made to ignite locally on the surface using suitable, gas ignition means (not shown). In this way, a fire image may be simulated which is similar to that of a conventional fire of burning wooden logs.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The combustion flue gases can be discharged from the combustion chamber <b>10</b> via the flue-gas discharge duct <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the primary objective of a decorative hearth is to produce a realistic fire image and is not intended&#x2014;unlike conventional hearths&#x2014;to emit heat to the surroundings, it is desirable for a decorative hearth to produce as realistic a fire image as possible while using a minimal amount of gas.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, a lower gas consumption (i.e. gas supply to the combustion chamber via the gas supply <b>13</b>) also leads to fewer flames, as a result of which the fire image is less realistic. However, the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>aim to enhance the fire image by simulating burning logs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to be able to also produce a realistic fire image with an improved fire impression in the case of reduced gas consumption, metering means <b>20</b> are arranged in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> which, during operation, meter a pyrotechnical additive into the flames of the burning combustible gas. In particular, the metering means are arranged above the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d, </i>as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in such a way that, when metering the pyrotechnical additive being contained in reservoir <b>22</b> via the metering opening <b>22</b><i>b, </i>this additive ends up in the air stream of the rising combustible flue gases and is ignited by the flames when it flutters down in the direction of the firebed created by the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d. </i>Upon ignition, the pyrotechnical additive generates additional fire and light effects, such as sparks, which also occur during burning of natural wooden logs.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another example, such as illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the metering means <b>20</b> are arranged at the bottom of the combustion chamber <b>10</b> and more particularly under the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d. </i>Reservoir <b>22</b> is provided with a metering opening <b>22</b><i>b </i>for supplying a certain amount of pyrotechnical additive from the reservoir <b>22</b> to a supply line <b>27</b>-<b>25</b> which runs from the metering opening <b>22</b><i>b </i>through the combustion chamber and the free end <b>25</b><i>a </i>of which ends at one of the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>c</i>, an example of a gas hearth according to the invention is described. Also in these Figures reference numeral <b>22</b> indicates a reservoir wherein a certain amount of pyrotechnical additive is stored. The reservoir <b>22</b> has to be sufficiently fire-resistant and heat-resistant in order to ensure that the heat which is produced in the combustion chamber during operation does not result in an undesirable and premature spontaneous combustion of the pyrotechnical additive which is held in the reservoir <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The reservoir <b>22</b> is provided with a top side <b>22</b><i>a </i>which is provided with an opening which may be closed off by a closure, in particular a closing lid <b>23</b>. The reservoir <b>22</b> can be filled with a certain amount of pyrotechnical additive via the opening which is provided in the top side <b>22</b><i>a. </i>Furthermore, the reservoir <b>22</b> is provided with a metering opening <b>22</b><i>b </i>for supplying a certain amount of pyrotechnical additive from the reservoir <b>22</b> to a supply line <b>25</b> which runs from the metering opening <b>22</b><i>b </i>through the combustion chamber and the free end <b>25</b><i>a </i>of which ends at one of the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d, </i>in a similar fashion as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The reservoir <b>22</b> is constructed in such a way that it promotes or facilitates the supply of the pyrotechnical additive from the reservoir <b>22</b> in the direction of the metering opening <b>22</b><i>b </i>and the supply line <b>25</b>. In particular, the metering means <b>20</b> are provided with displacement means displacement means <b>30</b>, which are positioned inside the reservoir <b>22</b> for displacing the pyrotechnical additive contained in the reservoir <b>22</b> towards and through the at least one metering opening <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown the two examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>(combined with its detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>the displacement means <b>30</b> comprise a rotatable driven screw conveyor <b>31</b> which is positioned at the bottom of the reservoir <b>22</b> and next to the at least one metering opening <b>22</b><i>b. </i>The displacement means <b>30</b> also comprise a motor means <b>32</b>, in particular a servo-motor for rotating the screw conveyor <b>31</b> inside the reservoir <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">During operation, the reservoir <b>22</b> is filled with pyrotechnical additive, that is poured into the reservoir <b>22</b> via the opening in the top of the reservoir, which opening is closed off by the closing lid <b>23</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>the screw conveyor <b>31</b> is completely submerged by the pyrotechnical additive and subsequent rotation of the screw conveyor <b>31</b> by means of the motor means <b>32</b> causes the pyrotechnical additive to be proactively displaced inside the reservoir <b>22</b> and near the bottom thereof towards the at least one metering opening <b>22</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;-<b>22</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the other example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>and in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>the reservoir <b>22</b> has an interior shaped as a funnel <b>33</b> directing the pyrotechnical additive towards an reservoir outlet <b>33</b>&#x2032;. The screw conveyor <b>31</b> is located near and in the reservoir outlet <b>33</b>&#x2032;. Upon rotation by means of the motor means <b>32</b> the screw conveyor <b>31</b> causes the pyrotechnical additive, which has been collected in the funnel <b>33</b> and the outlet <b>33</b>&#x2032; to be proactively displaced from the reservoir outlet <b>33</b>&#x2032; towards the at least one metering opening <b>22</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;. The displaced pyrotechnical additive will exit the reservoir <b>22</b> via the at least one metering opening <b>22</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; and it will subsequently be received in the line <b>25</b> via a small pipe and the metering opening <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In all embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>4</b><i>c, </i>at the location where the pyrotechnical additive exits the metering opening <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the reservoir <b>22</b> the line <b>25</b> is connected to an air line <b>27</b> which is connected to a pump <b>26</b>. By means of the pump <b>26</b>, the amount of pyrotechnical additive held in the line <b>25</b> by means of a pressurized medium, for example air, can be blown in the direction of the outlet opening <b>25</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the pyrotechnical additive leaves the outlet opening <b>25</b><i>a, </i>which, as has already been mentioned, is positioned at the location of the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d, </i>it will come into contact with the burning gas and thus create additional flame and fire effects, such as sparks.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">To this end, the metering means <b>20</b> also comprise control means <b>28</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) which pass control signals to the displacement means <b>30</b> or the pump <b>26</b>, respectively, via suitable control lines <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b. </i>More specifically, the control means <b>28</b> are configured in such a way that the control means are capable of actuating the motor means <b>32</b> and hence the screw conveyor <b>31</b> in terms of rotational speed and rotation time. By changing the rotational speed and rotation time of the screw conveyor <b>31</b> accordingly, the amount of the pyrotechnical additive exiting the reservoir <b>22</b> and entering the supply line <b>25</b> can be accurately controlled and thus the creation of additional flame and fire effects, such as sparks.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Irregular yet more realistic additional flame and fire effects can be created by actuating the motor means <b>32</b> and the air pump <b>26</b> sequentially. Sequentially means firstly that the displacement means <b>30</b> are actuated by the control means <b>28</b>, resulting in the displacement of certain amount of pyrotechnical additive exiting the reservoir <b>22</b> and entering the supply line <b>25</b>. Subsequently, the displacement means <b>30</b> are inactivated and the air pump <b>26</b> is actuated which blows this metered amount of pyrotechnical material through the supply line <b>25</b> in the direction of the outlet opening <b>25</b><i>a </i>by means of a short air pressure pulse via the air line <b>27</b> and the supply line <b>25</b>. Upon leaving the outlet opening <b>25</b><i>a </i>on account of the air pulse delivered by the pump <b>26</b>, the dispensed pyrotechnical additive will be brought to ignition at the location of the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) by the burning gas and thus produce the additional flame and fire effects.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The air pump <b>26</b> is in each case actuated briefly by the control means <b>28</b> for delivering an air pressure pulse in the air line <b>27</b> in the direction of the displacement means <b>30</b> and the supply line <b>25</b>. To this end, the air pump <b>26</b> takes air from elsewhere and preferably from outside the combustion chamber <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) via the inlet opening <b>27</b><i>a. </i>Thus, the air line <b>27</b> has such a length, as a result of which the air pump <b>26</b> and preferably the inlet opening <b>27</b><i>a </i>are arranged at some distance from and outside the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. This prevents hot combustion flue gases from being introduced into the air line <b>27</b> via the inlet opening <b>27</b><i>a, </i>which could possibly cause the pyrotechnical additive metered into the supply line <b>25</b> to ignite spontaneously. The position of the inlet opening <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the air line <b>27</b> as far as outside the combustion chamber <b>10</b> is thus a safety aspect of the present gas hearth.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this embodiment, a non-return valve has to be incorporated in the inlet line <b>27</b><i>a </i>which extends to the outside of the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion flue gases from escaping from the combustion chamber <b>10</b> via the air line <b>27</b> and the inlet opening <b>27</b><i>a </i>instead of via the flue-gas discharge duct <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment, the inlet opening <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the air line <b>27</b> and the outlet opening <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the outlet line <b>25</b> are both in the combustion chamber <b>10</b>. This results in a closed system, so that combustion flue gases cannot escape from the combustion chamber except via the flue-gas discharge duct <b>11</b>. However, the inlet opening <b>27</b><i>a </i>has to be arranged in the combustion chamber <b>10</b> in such a way, for example at some distance from the firebed-simulating means, so as to prevent an undesired inflow of combustion flue gases.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In yet another embodiment, the air pump is not switched on or off by the control means <b>28</b>, but the air pump is actuated continuously and an air stream is continuously blown in the direction of the supply line <b>25</b> and the outlet line <b>25</b><i>a </i>by the air line <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">By means of suitable control signals which are emitted by the control means <b>28</b> to the displacement means <b>30</b> (motor means <b>32</b> and the screw conveyor <b>31</b>) via the control line <b>29</b><i>a, </i>the rotational speed and time of the screw conveyor <b>31</b> can be controlled depending on a desired fire and flame display in the combustion chamber. The control means <b>28</b> can be programmed in advance with several fire/flame display settings, each setting being composed of a specific rotation speed/time schedule, which schedule provides a certain rotational speed/time behaviour of the screw conveyor <b>31</b> and thus a specific displacement/meter rate of pyrotechnical additive from the reservoir <b>22</b> towards the supply line <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Herewith the supply of the pyrotechnical additive via the outlet opening <b>25</b><i>a </i>to the burning firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>can be made more random and unpredictable. The random unpredictable supply of pyrotechnical additive to the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>also contributes to a more realistic fire image, since this also produces random flame and fire effects, similar to the fire image of a conventional burning log fire.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The time period of the actuation of the screw conveyor <b>31</b> as well as its rotational speed may also be set randomly within a certain range, so that the amount of pyrotechnical additive during each metering from the reservoir <b>22</b> in the supply line <b>25</b> also varies. Consequently, the intensity of the resulting flame and fire effects vary with each dose. This also helps to create an improved simulation of the random and chaotic fire image of a conventional burning log fire.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pyrotechnical additive preferably consists of granules, in particular a pulverulent or granular material. In particular, the pyrotechnical additive is a carbon-containing additive, in which the granules have a grain size of between 0.05 mm-2.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a further embodiment, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>, wherein the metering means <b>20</b> are positioned under the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>of the gas hearth, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the closure <b>23</b> is formed in such a manner that it forms part of the firebed-simulating means. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the closure is denoted by reference numeral <b>230</b> and is formed as an imitation log. In this way, the metering means <b>20</b> can be fitted at a small distance below the level of the firebed-simulating means <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>d </i>in the gas hearth, thus achieving a further reduction in the installation space.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be noted that although the sealing cap <b>230</b> is formed as an imitation log, it does not actively contribute to the play of flames and fire during operation. The sealing cap <b>230</b> will therefore not be porous and will also not be provided with a connection to the gas supply means <b>13</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
