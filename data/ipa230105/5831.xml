An encapsulating material <b>240</b> encapsulates both of the example die.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the example implementation <b>300</b>A, the length (or height) of the metal studs <b>220</b><i>b </i>is greater than the length (or height) of the metal studs <b>220</b><i>a </i>(e.g., greater than by at least 5%, 10%, or 20%), and the thickness of the dielectric layer <b>225</b><i>b </i>is greater than the thickness of the dielectric layer <b>225</b><i>a </i>(e.g., thicker by at least 5%, 10%, or 20%). Thus, the native semiconductor die portion of the second die <b>228</b> (e.g., including the semiconductor material <b>205</b><i>b</i>, bond pads <b>210</b><i>b</i>, and die passivation layer <b>215</b><i>b</i>) is embedded farther into the encapsulating material <b>240</b> from the RD structure <b>250</b> than the first die native semiconductor die portion of the second die <b>228</b> (e.g., including the semiconductor material <b>205</b><i>a</i>, bond pads <b>210</b><i>a</i>, and die passivation layer <b>215</b><i>a</i>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the top surfaces of the first and second semiconductor dies <b>227</b> and <b>228</b> may be at the same height from the RD structure <b>250</b>. In another example implementation, the height of the top surface of the first semiconductor die <b>227</b> above the RD structure <b>250</b> may be within 5% or 10% of the height of the top surface of the second semiconductor die <b>228</b> above the RD structure <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As discussed herein with regard to the example method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, block <b>160</b> may comprise forming grooves in the encapsulating material (e.g., at a top side of the encapsulating material). Such grooves may, for example, be utilized to balance thermal expansion, to add compliance or stiffness (e.g., with a stiffening ring or member), etc.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The grooves may, for example, be positioned outside a footprint of the semiconductor die. For example, the grooves may be positioned laterally between the edges of the semiconductor die and the edges of the singulated electronic device (e.g., centered between such edges, etc.). The width of a groove may, for example, be 25% to 75% of the lateral distance between the lateral edge of the semiconductor die and the lateral edge of the singulated electronic device (e.g., the lateral side of the encapsulating material). The grooves may, for example, comprise a depth (or bottom surface) that extends to or below the top side of the semiconductor die. In an example implementation, the grooves comprise a depth (or bottom surface) that is between the top and bottom sides of the semiconductor die. Though the grooves are shown with a generally square or rectangular cross-section, they may also have sloped side surfaces (e.g., with the grooves wider at the open end than at the closed end), a rounded bottom surface, etc.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Block <b>160</b> may comprise forming the grooves in any of a variety of manners. For example, mold protrusions corresponding to the grooves may be utilized to form the grooves during a molding process used to form the encapsulating material. Also for example, the grooves may be formed after the encapsulating material is formed (e.g., molded, flooded, etc.), for example by mechanically removing encapsulating material to form the grooves, utilizing a laser or other directed energy technology to remove encapsulating material to form the grooves, etc.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">An example implementation <b>400</b>A showing various aspects of block <b>160</b> is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The example implementation <b>400</b>A (or assembly, sub-assembly, package, etc.) shows the example implementation <b>200</b>F with grooves <b>450</b> formed in the top surface of the encapsulating material <b>440</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, the grooves <b>450</b> may comprise a single groove that extends around the lateral perimeter of the semiconductor die. In another example scenario, the grooves <b>450</b> may comprise a series of grooves, one along each side of the semiconductor die, where such grooves <b>450</b> need not be connected to each other. In yet another example scenario, there may be a plurality of grooves off each side of the semiconductor die.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As discussed here, various blocks of the example method <b>100</b> (or portions thereof) may be omitted or added without departing from the scope of this disclosure. In an example implementation, blocks <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> may be omitted, for example resulting in an example in which the metal studs and dielectric layer are not present. An example implementation <b>400</b>B is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.

An example implementation <b>400</b>C showing such filled grooves is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. Relative to the example implementation <b>400</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the example implementation <b>400</b>C has the grooves <b>450</b> filled with a filler material <b>470</b>. In a scenario in which the filler material <b>470</b> has a higher modulus than the encapsulating material <b>440</b>, such filler material <b>470</b> may act as a stiffening ring for the electronic device.
