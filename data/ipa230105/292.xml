Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>11</b></figref>, the present disclosure provides towel dispensers <b>100</b>. The materials, methods, and examples described are illustrative in nature and not intended to be limiting. Accordingly, this disclosure should not be construed as limited to the illustrated embodiments. Other features and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the following detailed description and claims.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Generally, towel dispensers <b>100</b> consistent with the present disclosure include a housing <b>1</b>A having a housing back <b>1</b>B; housing sides <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>; a housing bottom <b>4</b>, and a detachable top cover <b>5</b> including an opening <b>6</b>. The housing <b>1</b>A generally defines a chamber in which towels (not shown) are stored for use. In some embodiments, the housing <b>1</b>A is formed of plastic. For example and without limitation, the plastic for the housing <b>1</b>A can be injection molded, blow molded, extruded, casted, vacuum formed, machined, and 3D printed. In some embodiments, the housing <b>1</b>A is formed of metal.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The detachable top cover <b>5</b> and housing <b>1</b>A are disposed offset from vertical by a predetermined offset angle <b>14</b>. The offset angle <b>14</b> reduces contamination and spread of bacteria and viruses by orienting the detachable top cover <b>5</b> in a way that reduces the risk that a user drips or spreads contaminants to unused towels still inside the towel dispenser. The angled orientation causes any water or contamination that would have dripped onto the unused towels to instead drip onto the surrounding surfaces (e.g., onto the housing back <b>1</b>B) because the offset angle <b>14</b> causes the user's wet or dirty hands to be oriented out of alignment with the opening top periphery <b>6</b>, preventing the unused towels from being wet or dirtied. Water or contaminants that may drip onto the detachable top cover <b>5</b> will drip down away from the unused towels because of the top cover <b>5</b> being oriented at a predetermined offset angle <b>14</b>. For example and without limitation, the housing top cover <b>5</b> is may in some embodiments be offset from vertical by an offset angle <b>14</b> of about 30 to about 60 degrees relative to vertical, such as about 30 degrees to about 35 degrees, about 35 degrees to about 40 degrees, about 40 degrees to about 45 degrees, about 45 degrees to about 50 degrees, about 50 degrees to about 55 degrees, or about 55 degrees to about 60 degrees. In other embodiments the housing top cover <b>5</b> is offset from vertical by a predetermined offset angle <b>14</b> of about 30 to about 60 degrees relative to vertical, such as about 30 degrees, about 31 degrees, about 32 degrees, about 33 degrees, about 34 degrees, about 35 degrees, about 36 degrees, about 37 degrees, about 38 degrees, about 39 degrees, about 40 degrees, about 41 degrees, about 42 degrees, about 43 degrees, about 44 degrees, about 45 degrees, about 46 degrees, about 47 degrees, about 48 degrees, about 49 degrees, about 50 degrees, about 51 degrees, about 52 degrees, about 53 degrees, about 54 degrees, about 55 degrees, about 56 degrees, about 57 degrees, about 58 degrees, about 59 degrees, or about 60 degrees. For example and without limitation, the housing back <b>1</b>B may in some embodiments be offset from vertical by a predetermined offset angle <b>14</b> of about 30 to about 60 degrees relative to vertical, such as about 30 degrees to about 35 degrees, about 35 degrees to about 40 degrees, about 40 degrees to about 45 degrees, about 45 degrees to about 50 degrees, about 50 degrees to about 55 degrees, or about 55 degrees to about 60 degrees. In other embodiments the housing back <b>1</b>B is offset from vertical by a predetermined offset angle <b>14</b> of about 30 to about 60 degrees relative to vertical, such as about 30 degrees, about 31 degrees, about 32 degrees, about 33 degrees, about 34 degrees, about 35 degrees, about 36 degrees, about 37 degrees, about 38 degrees, about 39 degrees, about 40 degrees, about 41 degrees, about 42 degrees, about 43 degrees, about 44 degrees, about 45 degrees, about 46 degrees, about 47 degrees, about 48 degrees, about 49 degrees, about 50 degrees, about 51 degrees, about 52 degrees, about 53 degrees, about 54 degrees, about 55 degrees, about 56 degrees, about 57 degrees, about 58 degrees, about 59 degrees, or about 60 degrees.
