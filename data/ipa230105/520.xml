Accordingly, a cannula may be used to pass instruments into the surgical work site. Furthermore, many arthroscopic procedures require the use of fluid to distend and irrigate the joint being operated upon, so in such instances the cannula must provide a sealed passageway in order to enable instruments to be passed into and out of the cannula while maintaining a fluid seal whether or not an instrument is in the cannula passageway.</p><heading id="h-0003"

Proper cannula placement and in-vivo pressure can vastly improve the surgeon's ability to visualize the proper anatomy. The soft tissue in the subacromial space can hinder visualization by collapsing inward if proper pressure is not held within the joint space. Cannulas with sufficient valve systems can hold pressure within the joint space and allow the surgeon to operate freely without visualization issues.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">An arthroscopic fluid pump may be used to provide fluid distension to increase visibility and instrument navigation in the surgical site. The loss of fluid distention caused by leakage from surgical portals created to pass medical instruments into the surgical site is a problem often associated with the use of fluid distension and conventional cannulas. Excessive loss of fluid distention through these portals may lead to reduced visibility, reduced working space, and require the surgeon to increase fluid pressure output from the arthroscopic pump. Increasing fluid pressure is not desirable as it may increase the risk for patient complications. Rigid surgical cannulas have been used to prevent loss of fluid distention while allowing medical instruments to be passed through the surgical portals as needed. However, rigid cannulas may restrict instrument mobility, working space, and cause unintended damage to the patient.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Proper cannula placement and in-vivo pressure can vastly improve the surgeon's ability to visualize the proper anatomy. The soft tissue in the subacromial space can hinder visualization by collapsing inward if proper pressure is not held within the joint space. Cannulas with sufficient valve systems can hold pressure within the joint space and allow the surgeon to operate freely without visualization issues.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Prior art silicone cannulas are available in several lengths and diameters to account for different anatomies and surgeon preferences. These cannulas are made of a flexible material to protect the anatomy during insertion and removal into the joint space. These cannulas have a distal flange to retract the soft tissue around the insertion area to improve visualization. They may have one or more valves to improve fluid dynamic capability.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The prior art cannulas are often I-shaped, requiring the surgeon to fold the distal or inner flange in half and grasp it with an instrument such as a hemostat (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), insert the combined hemostat and cannula through the skin incision and into the joint space (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), and release and retract the hemostat (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). However, the use of the hemostat may be awkward for insertion and may necessitate a larger skin incision than would be required for the insertion of a cylindrical or T-shaped cannula.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">A cannula with a distal flange having relief slits or notches so the distal flange may transition from a distal flanged I-shaped cannula to a standard T-shaped cylindrical cannula has the advantage of being insertable into a skin incision without the use of a hemostat or other tool. Such a cannula <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The cannula <b>100</b> may include an elongated body <b>110</b> having a longitudinal axis, with a proximal flange <b>120</b> disposed at a first end of the body <b>110</b>, and a distal flange <b>130</b> disposed at a second end of the body <b>110</b>, and an actuator <b>160</b>. The body <b>110</b> defines a lumen <b>111</b> extending along the longitudinal axis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). When inserted into a skin incision, the proximal flange <b>120</b> may sit outside the joint space, on the skin, and serve as the entry point for the necessary devices for the procedure. The distal flange <b>130</b> may sit inside the joint space and retract surrounding soft tissue to improve visualization inside the joint space. The body <b>110</b> is illustrated as a cylinder, with a round cross-section, however it will be understood that the cross-sectional shape of the body <b>110</b> may be another shape, such as, but not limited to, oval, teardrop, stadium, etc.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The proximal flange <b>120</b> may extend radially outward from the first end of the body <b>110</b>, and the distal flange <b>130</b> may extend radially outward from the second end of the body <b>110</b>. The proximal flange <b>120</b> may help prevent over-insertion of the cannula <b>100</b> during the insertion process because the proximal flange <b>120</b> may be thicker than the distal flange <b>130</b>. The thicker proximal flange <b>120</b> may be difficult to fold or bend and pass through the incision and into the body. In an exemplary embodiment only, the thickness of the proximal flange <b>120</b> may be about twice the thickness of the distal flange <b>130</b>. Each of the proximal flange <b>120</b> and distal flange <b>130</b> may be generally circular as illustrated, or oval, teardrop, or stadium in shape, and may have similar or different shapes and diameters.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The body <b>110</b>, proximal flange <b>120</b>, and distal flange <b>130</b> may be a monolithic element, formed as a single piece. In other examples, one or more of the body <b>110</b>, proximal flange <b>120</b>, and distal flange <b>130</b> may be formed from different materials. In one example, the body <b>110</b>, proximal flange <b>120</b>, and distal flange <b>130</b> are formed as a monolithic structure, made of a flexible polymeric material such as silicone or polyurethane.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The distal flange <b>130</b> may have relief elements so that the flange may easily bend back and forth between a first radial configuration in which the distal flange <b>130</b> extends radially outward from the body <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and a second longitudinal configuration in which the distal flange <b>130</b> is bent such that it extends longitudinally from the body <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The distal flange <b>130</b> is biased in the first radial configuration. The actuator <b>160</b> is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in order to illustrate the configuration of the distal flange <b>130</b>, which may be substantially covered by the actuator <b>160</b> in the second configuration. In one example, the relief elements include a plurality of notches <b>132</b> cut into the outer perimeter <b>134</b> of the distal flange <b>130</b>. The notches <b>132</b> may extend radially inward from the outer perimeter <b>134</b> of the distal flange <b>130</b> at spaced apart circumferentially arranged locations. In some instances, the notches <b>132</b> may be triangular cuts with the widest part of the cut at the perimeter <b>134</b> of the distal flange <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In other embodiments, the notches <b>132</b> may be circular, oval, or teardrop in shape, for example. The width and depth of each notch <b>132</b> as well as the number of notches <b>132</b> distributed around the distal flange <b>130</b> may be selected to achieve a flange with sufficient integrity to maintain the first radially extended configuration when not compressed by the actuator, while still allowing the actuator <b>160</b> to move the distal flange <b>130</b> into the second configuration. In some instances, as adjacent sections <b>136</b> of the distal flange <b>130</b> move (e.g., bend, flex or deflect) into the second configuration, the notches <b>132</b> narrow until adjacent sections <b>136</b> are in direct contact with one another, creating a substantially tubular structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The relief elements may also include a plurality of apertures <b>138</b> extending transversely through the distal flange <b>130</b> from a proximal surface <b>131</b> to a distal surface <b>133</b> of the distal flange <b>130</b>. The apertures <b>138</b> may encourage the sections <b>136</b> of the distal flange <b>130</b> to pivot and bend/flex around the apertures <b>138</b> when pushed by the actuator <b>160</b>. The apertures <b>138</b> may be positioned circumferentially near the inner edge of the distal flange <b>130</b>, adjacent the body <b>110</b>. In some examples, each section <b>136</b> includes an aperture <b>138</b> proximate the base of the section <b>136</b>. The apertures <b>138</b> may be curved and may have a length extending along a majority of the inner portion of each section <b>136</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some examples, the distal flange <b>130</b> may have both notches <b>132</b> and apertures <b>138</b>.

The actuator <b>160</b> may include a shaft <b>162</b>, a clamp <b>164</b>, and a head <b>166</b>. The actuator <b>160</b> may be provided with the cannula <b>100</b>, such as included as an indispensable component of the cannula <b>100</b>. The shaft <b>162</b> may extend from the clamp <b>164</b> along a length of the body <b>110</b> of the cannula <b>100</b>, such that the medical personnel can manipulate the actuator <b>160</b> from the proximal end of the cannula <b>100</b> to cause the clamp <b>164</b> to bend or flex the distal flange <b>130</b> during use. For example, the shaft <b>162</b> may extend through a hole <b>122</b> in the proximal flange <b>120</b>, and along the body <b>110</b>. In some examples, the body <b>110</b> may have a longitudinal depression or groove <b>112</b> configured to receive the shaft <b>162</b> therealong. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The proximal end of the shaft <b>162</b> may extend proximally or above the proximal flange <b>120</b>, and may have a head <b>166</b> larger than the shaft <b>162</b> to receive the user's thumb or finger for pushing or otherwise actuating the shaft <b>162</b>. The head <b>166</b> may also include ridges, grooves, or other texture to assist the user in grasping the head <b>166</b> to pull the actuator <b>160</b> proximally and release the distal flange <b>130</b> once the cannula <b>100</b> has been inserted. The distal end of the shaft <b>162</b> is attached or fixed to the clamp <b>164</b>. The clamp <b>164</b> may extend at least partially around the body <b>110</b>. In some examples, the body <b>110</b> is cylindrical and the clamp <b>164</b> may be an annular shaped collar extending partially or completely around the circumference of the body <b>110</b>. The shaft <b>162</b> and clamp <b>164</b> are slidable along the body <b>110</b> from a first position in which the distal flange <b>130</b> is in the first, radially extended configuration, to a second position in which the distal flange <b>130</b> is in the second, radially collapsed configuration. In some instance, the first, radially extended configuration may be an equilibrium position in which the distal flange <b>130</b> is not subjected to an external force, and the second, radially collapsed configuration may be a deflected position in which the distal flange <b>130</b> is subjected to an external force (i.e., a collapsing force applied by the clamp <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">When the cannula <b>100</b> is to be inserted into a skin incision, the actuator <b>160</b> may be actuated to collapse the distal flange <b>130</b> radially inward to facilitate passage of the distal flange <b>130</b> through an incision or other portal gaining access to an interior cavity or anatomical space of a patient. For example, a longitudinal force is applied distally onto the head <b>166</b> of the shaft <b>162</b>, which slides the shaft <b>162</b> and clamp <b>164</b> longitudinally along the body <b>110</b>, bending or deflecting the distal flange <b>130</b> into the second configuration, in which the distal flange <b>130</b> collapses radially inward and distally such that the distal flange <b>130</b> extends longitudinally and parallel to the central axis of the body <b>110</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The head <b>166</b> may prevent the shaft <b>162</b> from sliding through the proximal flange <b>120</b>. When the actuator <b>160</b> is in the second position, the head <b>166</b> may move toward the proximal flange <b>120</b> (e.g., the head <b>166</b> may rest on the proximal flange <b>120</b>) and the clamp <b>164</b> may cover (e.g., extend over, circumferentially surround, etc.) the distal flange <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. With the cannula <b>100</b> in the second configuration, the surgeon may deliver the cannula <b>100</b> into the joint space without the need to clamp the distal flange into a hemostat. When the cannula <b>100</b> is successfully in the joint space, the user will pull proximally on the head <b>166</b> of the actuator <b>160</b>, moving the actuator <b>160</b> back to the first position to release the distal flange <b>130</b> back into its first, radially extended configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In another embodiment, the cannula <b>200</b> may include an actuator <b>260</b> with a plurality of shafts <b>262</b> spaced apart around the body <b>210</b> and connected to the clamp <b>264</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The proximal ends of each shaft <b>262</b> may be connected to a ring <b>266</b>. The ring <b>266</b> may allow the surgeon to easily push all of the shafts <b>262</b> simultaneously, thereby providing a substantially equal longitudinal force on each shaft <b>262</b>. The plurality of shafts <b>262</b> may then provide an equal force around the circumference of the distal flange <b>230</b>, which may be advantageous when the distal flange <b>230</b> is thicker, has a greater diameter, or is stiffer.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The cannula <b>100</b> may include at least one valve configured to prevent or limit the amount of fluid escaping through the lumen <b>111</b> of the cannula and to maintain the hydrostatic pressure inside the joint space.

When the cannula <b>1100</b> is screwed into the skin incision, the distal flange <b>1120</b> may sit inside the joint space and retract surrounding soft tissue to improve visualization inside the joint space.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The distal flange <b>1120</b> may extend radially outward from the distal end of the body <b>1110</b>. The distal flange <b>1120</b> may be generally circular as illustrated, or oval, teardrop, or stadium in shape, and may have similar or different shapes and diameters. The distal flange <b>1120</b> may have relief elements so that the flange <b>1120</b> may easily bend back and forth between a first, biased radial configuration in which the distal flange <b>1120</b> extends radially outward from the body <b>1110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and a second, deflected or folded configuration in which the distal flange <b>1120</b> is bent proximally during insertion through a skin incision. It is noted that in some instances, the flange <b>1120</b> may be deflected or folded distally during insertion through a skin incision, if desired. The distal flange <b>1120</b> is biased in the radial configuration when not subjected to an external force. In one example, the relief elements include a plurality of notches <b>1122</b> cut into the outer perimeter <b>1124</b> of the distal flange <b>1120</b>. The notches <b>1122</b> may be triangular cuts with the widest part of the cut at the perimeter of the distal flange <b>1120</b> and side edges of the notches converging radially inwardly toward the longitudinal axis of the body <b>1110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In other embodiments, the notches <b>1122</b> may be circular, oval, or teardrop in shape.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The cannula <b>1100</b> may be inserted using an obturator, extending through the lumen <b>1111</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. For example, the shaft of the obturator <b>1050</b> may be inserted through the passageway or lumen <b>1111</b> of the cannula <b>1100</b> to provide rigidity when passing the cannula <b>1100</b> through a skin incision. The distal tip of the shaft of the obturator <b>1050</b> may extend beyond the distal flange <b>1120</b> to facilitate insertion through a skin incision.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The cannula <b>1100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref> may include at least one valve <b>1130</b> secured to the body <b>1110</b> by a flexible cap <b>1150</b>. In some instances, the flexible cap <b>1150</b> forms a non-compressive seal with the valve <b>1130</b>. The non-compressive seal is configured to prevent or limit the amount of fluid escaping through the lumen <b>1111</b> of the cannula and to maintain the hydrostatic pressure inside the joint space, both when an instrument is inserted through the lumen <b>1111</b> and when no instrument is present in the lumen <b>1111</b>. The valve <b>1130</b> may be located within an interior of the body <b>1110</b> adjacent the proximal end, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The body <b>1110</b> may have a shoulder <b>1112</b> extending radially outward, with a proximally facing surface creating a seat for a circumferential flange <b>1132</b> on the valve <b>1130</b>. In some examples, the shoulder <b>1112</b> defines an undercut in which the proximally facing surface of the shoulder <b>1112</b> has a downward angle (i.e., is tapered distally in a radially outward direction), and the circumferential flange <b>1132</b> may have a mating distally facing surface having a downward angle (i.e., tapering distally in a radially outward direction).

In some examples, the cap <b>1150</b> may have an elasticity from 100% to 300%, meaning the cap <b>1150</b> is formed from a material that can be extended elastically about 100 to 300 percent or more of its original length. The body <b>1110</b> may be a polymeric material (e.g., silicone) having a durometer of 80 Shore A or less. In other examples, the body <b>1110</b> may have a durometer of 60 Shore A or less. The cap <b>1150</b> may include a central opening <b>1152</b> configured to allow insertion of an instrument therethrough.

Each rib <b>1316</b> is discontinuous (does not extend around the entire circumference of the body <b>1310</b>) and has a plurality of gaps <b>1318</b> between discontinuous segments of each rib <b>1316</b>, and the gaps <b>1318</b> of each rib <b>1316</b> are aligned longitudinally along the body <b>1310</b> at one or more common circumferential locations.

The projections <b>1372</b> abut the ribs <b>1316</b>, preventing the nut <b>1370</b> from moving axially, keeping the body <b>1310</b> in place within the incision. In some examples, the projections <b>1372</b> may be sized to contact both the rib <b>1316</b> above and the rib <b>1316</b> below the projection <b>1372</b>, providing a friction fit between the ribs <b>1316</b> and the projections <b>1372</b> as the nut <b>1370</b> is rotated. This may prevent the nut <b>1370</b> from inadvertently rotating during use until the projections <b>1372</b> are in the gap <b>1318</b> and allowing the nut <b>1370</b> to move axially. The friction fit may be overcome by manually rotating the nut <b>1370</b> once the procedure is complete. The adjustable nut <b>1370</b> allows the cannula to be used with incisions of varying depth, removing the need for having multiple length cannulas on hand. Further, as tissue thickness can change, and oftentimes expands during procedures, due to general swelling and/or extravasation, the nut <b>1370</b> may be rotated to the first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> and slid proximally or distally to accommodate the changing incision depth, and then rotated back to the second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> to secure the cannula. Accordingly, the longitudinal distance between the nut <b>1370</b> and the distal flange <b>1320</b> can be adjusted as desired to accommodate any thickness of tissue constrained therebetween when the cannula is inserted through a skin incision.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref> illustrate two embodiments of nut <b>1470</b>, <b>1370</b> with two or three projections <b>1472</b>, <b>1372</b>, respectively.

Some such valves include duckbill valves, cross-slit valves, and dome valves. The common characteristics between all of these valves are that they are passive, normally closed valves that create a fluid seal when oriented in a specific configuration, as fluid pressure forces the valve closed. In surgical access devices, these valves are used to prevent fluid (gas or liquid) from leaking through surgical portals created via a skin incision. A shortcoming of conventional valves arises when a medical instrument is inserted through the valve, as an opening is created by the surgical instrument disrupting the seal of the valve and permitting fluid to leak past the interface between the surgical instrument and the valve. Due to this leakage, these elastomeric valves are generally combined with a secondary valve that creates a seal around the medical instrument. This two-stage valve design is present in many arthroscopic and laparoscopic trocars and cannulas.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">The duckbill valve <b>2100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, which may be incorporated into a surgical access device, solves the leakage problem and prevents loss of distention fluid while allowing medical instruments to enter the surgical access devices as needed. The valve <b>2100</b> may be made of an elastomeric material such as silicone or polyurethane, and has a geometry that creates a fluid seal both with and without a medical instrument inserted through the valve <b>2100</b>. The geometry includes an arcuate cutout <b>2180</b> sized to accommodate the medical instrument to be inserted through the valve <b>2100</b>. The arcuate cutout <b>2180</b> allows the valve <b>2100</b> to create a fluid seal around the perimeter of a medical instrument passed therethrough, as well as providing a fluid seal without the medical instrument present, removing the need for a two-stage valve system commonly required to achieve a satisfactory seal.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The valve <b>2100</b> may be a duckbill valve including a body member <b>2105</b> having a base <b>2110</b> and first and second opposing walls <b>2120</b>, <b>2130</b> extending from the base <b>2110</b>.

For example the length S of the slit <b>2140</b> is shown to be equal to the length R of the arcuate cutout <b>2180</b> (e.g., equal to the diameter of the arcuate cutout <b>2180</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref>.

In one example, the slit has a length of 0.4 inches. The slit <b>2140</b> may have a width or thickness of 0.03 inches or less, such as between 0.01 inches and 0.03 inches, or between 0.00 inches and 0.03 inches, for example. A slit having a width or thickness of 0.00 inches refers to an embodiment in which a slit is formed, but due to the nature of the elastic properties of the valve <b>2100</b> the walls <b>2120</b>, <b>2130</b> on either side of the slit collapse against one another effectively removing any gap therebetween. Thus while there is a slit, it has a width or thickness of 0.00 inches when the walls <b>2120</b>, <b>2130</b> are in direct contact with one another. Similarly, when no instrument is inserted through the valve <b>2100</b>, fluid exerts radial pressure on the outside of the walls <b>2120</b>, <b>2130</b>, forcing the second ends <b>2124</b>, <b>2134</b> together and closing the slit <b>2140</b> thereby preventing fluid from egressing through the valve <b>2100</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Upon insertion of an instrument through the valve <b>2100</b>, the slit <b>2140</b> expands and the edge of the arcuate cutout <b>2180</b> seals around the perimeter of the instrument, allowing the second ends <b>2124</b>, <b>2134</b> of the walls to pinch closed on either side of the arcuate cutout <b>2180</b> even though the slit <b>2140</b> is longer than the length of the arcuate cutout <b>2180</b>.

Thus, the slit <b>2140</b>, which may have a length greater than the length R of the cutout <b>2180</b>, may extend about 0.1 inches beyond each end of the cutout <b>2180</b> in this example.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref>, the combination tissue stapler <b>330</b> with attached cannula <b>300</b> may be inserted into an incision <b>352</b> through tissue <b>350</b> of the patient directly from the packaging, with the sheath <b>302</b> protecting the surrounding tissue while the shaft <b>334</b> of the tissue stapler <b>330</b> acts as an obturator.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Once the distal end <b>306</b> of the cannular <b>300</b> and the instrument contained therein are in the proper location, for example, in the shoulder joint space, the curved or flared proximal end <b>308</b> may be grasped and pulled proximally from exterior of the patient's body, such as exterior of an incision of the shoulder region. This pulls the sheath <b>302</b> back up the shaft <b>334</b> of the tissue stapler <b>330</b> with the slit <b>304</b> allowing for removal from the shaft <b>334</b> in a sideways or lateral manner, leaving the shaft <b>334</b> of the tissue stapler <b>330</b> within the patients' anatomy through the incision <b>352</b> alone without a cannula, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The proximal end <b>308</b> may have a flared region or petal shape, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>. The flared proximal end <b>308</b> may prevent the cannula <b>300</b> from being inserted into the incision and provide a lip for the user to grasp for withdrawal. In other examples, the distal end <b>306</b> of the cannula <b>300</b> may have a bullnosed recess that partially protects the sharp prongs <b>340</b> of the tissue stapler <b>330</b>. The cannula <b>300</b> may provide the advantage of reducing the surgical steps when compared to the previously used cannula and providing protection from the prongs <b>340</b> of the tissue stapler <b>330</b> during insertion, as well as during packaging and back-table handoffs.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">The above detailed description includes references to the accompanying drawings, which form a part of the detailed description.
