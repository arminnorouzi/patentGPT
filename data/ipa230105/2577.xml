More particularly, the present invention relates to blowing agent compositions containing 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene and 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The class of foams known as low density rigid polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foam has utility in a wide variety of insulation applications including roofing systems, building panels, refrigerators and freezers. A critical factor in the large-scale commercial acceptance of rigid polyurethane foams in the building insulation industry has been their ability to provide a good balance of properties. Rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams are known to provide outstanding thermal insulation, excellent fire properties and superior structural properties at reasonably low densities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The methods of producing polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams are known and consist in general of the reaction of an organic polyisocyanurate (including diisocyanate) and a polyol or mixture of polyols in the presence of a volatile blowing agent, which is caused to vaporize by the heat liberated during the reaction of isocyanate and polyol. This reaction can be enhanced through the use of amine and/or other catalysts as well as surfactants. The catalysts ensure adequate curing of the foam, while the surfactants regulate and control cell size. Flame-retardants are traditionally added to rigid polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foam to reduce its flammability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The foam industry has historically used liquid fluorocarbon blowing agents such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) because of ease of use in processing conditions. Fluorocarbons act not only as blowing agents by virtue of their volatility, but also are encapsulated or entrained in the closed cell structure of the rigid foam and are the major contributor to the low thermal conductivity properties of rigid urethane foams.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The use of a fluorocarbon as the preferred commercial expansion or blowing agent in insulating foam applications is based in part on the resulting k-factor associated with the foam produced. K-factor is defined as the rate of transfer of heat energy by conduction through one square foot of one inch thick homogenous material in one hour where there is a difference of one degree Fahrenheit perpendicularly across the two surfaces of the material. Since the utility of closed-cell polyurethane-type foams is based, in part, upon their thermal insulation properties, it would be advantageous to identify materials that produce lower k-factor foams than those above.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many such blowing agents currently used for thermoset foams (PUR/PIR/Phenolic) also suffer from environmental or performance disadvantages. Concern has increased in recent years about potential damage to the earth's atmosphere and climate, and certain chlorine-based compounds have been identified as particularly problematic in this regard. The use of chlorine-containing compositions (such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and the like) has become generally disfavored because of the ozone-depleting properties associated with many of such compounds. There has thus been an increasing need for new fluorocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon compounds and blends of existing compositions that offer alternatives for foaming applications. Blowing agents with above atmospheric boiling points characteristically have poor low temperature thermal performance. Thus, ideal blowing agents or agent blends should be a LGWP material that has optimal performance over a wide temperature range.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hydrohaloolefins like 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene (1336mzzm) and 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (1233zd) are being independently developed as stand alone agents to meet these requirements. One problem associated with 1336mzzm, however, is that it has an elevated boiling point and contains 6 fluorine atoms in its structure. Thus, by itself, it exhibits several of the foregoing disadvantages, which makes it less valuable and cost prohibitive as an agent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, blowing agents are desirable in the art that exhibit low k-factor values, low global warming potential, low molecular weight, cost effective and optimal performance over a wide temperature range. The present invention addresses each of the foregoing in the embodiments and examples provided herein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention relates to mixtures comprising, consisting essentially of or consisting of 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene (1336mzzm) and 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (1233zd). In certain aspects, the compositions comprise from about 5 to about 70 mole percent 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene and from about 30 to about 95 mole percent 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene. The compositions may also comprise from about 30 to about 70 mole percent 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene and from about 30 to about 70 mole percent 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene. In further embodiments, the compositions comprise from about 40 to about 60 mole percent 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene and from about 40 to about 60 mole percent 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene. In even further embodiments, the compositions comprise about 50 mole percent 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene and about 50 mole percent 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, and in one embodiment, the present invention relates to blowing agent compositions including 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene (1336mzzm); 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (1233zd); and, optionally, at least one adjuvant selected from the group consisting of co-blowing agent(s), polyol(s), surfactant(s), polymer modifier(s), colorant(s), dye(s), solubility enhancer(s), flammability suppressant(s), flame retardants(s), antibacterial agent(s), viscosity reduction modifier(s), filler(s), vapor pressure modifier(s), nucleating agent(s), catalyst(s) and combination of any two or more of these.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene may be provided in any effective amount to achieve the desired effects discussed herein. In one embodiment, such an effective amount is from about 5 to about 70 mole percent. In further embodiments, such an effective amount is from about 30 to about 70 mole percent; from about 40 to about 60 mole percent; or about 50 mole percent.

As noted above, the use of 1336mzzm does not meet all the ideal requirements of a blowing agent, most notably because of its boiling point, high molecular weight, and prohibitive cost of production. The present invention has surprising and unexpectedly found that the addition of 1233zd, particularly the trans isomer, as a co-blowing agent reduces the blowing agent cost but more importantly provides unexpected substantial improvement to the thermal performance of foams prepared with the blend.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein the term &#x201c;1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene&#x201d; or &#x201c;1336mzzm&#x201d; generally refers to either or both the the cis- or trans-form. The terms &#x201c;cis HFO-1336mzzm&#x201d; and &#x201c;trans HFO-1336mzzm&#x201d; are used herein to describe the cis- and trans-forms of 1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene, respectively. The terms &#x201c;1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobutene&#x201d; or &#x201c;1336mzzm&#x201d; therefore include within its scope cisHFO-1336mzzm, transHFO-1336mzzm, and all combinations and mixtures of these. In preferred embodiments, 1336mzzm refers to the cis isomer. The present invention, however, is not limited thereto and may include only trans-1336mzzm or mixtures of the cis and trans isomers. In further embodiments, the 1336mzzm may include from about 50 weight percent to about 100 weight percent of the cis isomer and from about 0 weight percent to about 50 weight percent of the trans isomer; from about 75% weight percent to about 100 weight percent of the cis isomer and from about 0 weight percent and 25 weight percent of the trans isomer; or from about 90 weight percent to about 100 weight percent of the cis isomer and from about 0 weight percent to about 10 weight percent of the trans isomer. Such ranges for the composition of 1336mzzm are not necessarily limiting to the instant invention and may be also be provided in any effective amount to achieve the advantages provided herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein the term &#x201c;1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene&#x201d; or &#x201c;1233zd&#x201d; generally refers to either or both the cis- or trans-form. The terms &#x201c;cis HCFO-1233zd&#x201d; and &#x201c;trans HCFO-1233zd&#x201d; are used herein to describe the cis- and trans-forms of 1,1,1-trifluo,3-chlororopropene, respectively. The terms &#x201c;1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene&#x201d; or &#x201c;1233zd&#x201d; therefore include within its scope cisHCFO-1233zd, transHCFO-1233zd, and all combinations and mixtures of these. In preferred embodiments, 1233zd refers to the trans isomer. The present invention, however, is not limited thereto and may include only cis-1233zd or mixtures of the cis and trans isomers. In further embodiments, the 1233zd may include from about 50 weight percent to about 100 weight percent of the trans isomer and from about 0 weight percent to about 50 weight percent of the cis isomer; from about 75 weight percent to about 100 weight percent of the trans isomer and from about 0 weight percent to about 25 weight percent of the cis isomer; or from about 90 weight percent to about 100 weight percent of the trans isomer and from about 0 weight percent to about 10 weight percent of the cis isomer.

Moreover, the compositions of the present invention can be azeotropic, azeotrope-like or non-azeotropic. In certain embodiments, the compositions comprise from about 5 to about 70 mole percent 1336mzzm and from about 30 to about 95 mole percent 1233zd.

Alternative co-blowing agents may also be provided.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, such co-blowing agents may include one or more hydrocarbons or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), particularly C4-C6 hydrocarbons or C1-C4 HFCs, that are known in the art. Examples of such HFC co-blowing agents include, but are not limited to, one or a combination of difluoromethane (HFC-32), fluoroethane (HFC-161), difluoroethane (HFC-152), trifluoroethane (HFC-143), tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134), pentafluoroethane (HFC-125), pentafluoropropane (HFC-245), hexafluoropropane (HFC-236), heptafluoropropane (HFC-227ea), pentafluorobutane (HFC-365), hexafluorobutane (HFC-356) and all isomers of all such HFC's. With respect to hydrocarbons, the present blowing agent compositions also may include in certain preferred embodiments, for example, iso, normal and/or cyclopentane for thermoset foams and butane or isobutane for thermoplastic foams. Other materials, such as water, CO<sub>2</sub>, CFCs (such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12)), hydrochlorocarbons (HCCs such as dichloroethylene (preferably trans-dichloroethylene), ethyl chloride and chloropropane), HCFCs, C1-C5 alcohols (such as, for example, ethanol and/or propanol and/or butanol), C1-C4 aldehydes, C1-C4 ketones, C1-C4 ethers (including ethers (such as dimethyl ether and diethyl ether), diethers (such as dimethoxy methane and diethoxy methane)), and methyl formate, organic acids (such as but not limited to formic acid), including combinations of any of these may be included, although such components not necessarily preferred in many embodiments due to negative environmental impact. The relative amount of any of the above noted additional co-blowing agents, as well as any additional components which may be included in present compositions, can vary widely within the general broad scope of the present invention according to the particular application for the composition, and all such relative amounts are considered to be within the scope hereof.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">One aspect of the present invention provides foamable compositions. As is known to those skilled in the art, foamable compositions generally include one or more components capable of forming foam. As used herein, the term &#x201c;foam forming agent&#x201d; is used to refer to a component, or a combination on components, which are capable of forming a foam structure, preferably a generally cellular foam structure. The foamable compositions of the present invention include such component(s) and a blowing agent blend, e.g. a blend including at least 1336mzzm and 1233zd.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Foams and foamable compositions of the instant invention relate generally to all foams, (including but not limited to closed cell foam, open cell foam, rigid foam, flexible foam, integeral skin and the like), prepared from a foam formulation containing a blowing agent composition of the invention. Applicants have found that one advantage of the foams is the ability to achieve exceptional thermal performance under low temperature conditions, as evidence from the k-factor data provided herein. Although it is contemplated that the present foams may be used in a wide variety of applications, in certain preferred embodiments the present invention comprises appliance foams in accordance with the present invention, including refrigerator foams, freezer foams, refrigerator/freezer foams, panel foams, and other cold or cryogenic manufacturing applications.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain embodiments, the one or more components capable of forming foam comprise a thermosetting composition capable of forming foam and/or foamable compositions. Examples of thermosetting compositions include polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foam compositions, and also phenolic foam compositions. This reaction and foaming process may be enhanced through the use of various additives such as catalysts and surfactant materials that serve to control and adjust cell size and to stabilize the foam structure during formation. Furthermore, is contemplated that any one or more of the additional components described above with respect to the blowing agent compositions of the present invention could be incorporated into the foamable composition of the present invention. In such thermosetting foam embodiments, one or more of the present compositions are included as or part of a blowing agent in a foamable composition, or as a part of a two or more part foamable composition, which preferably includes one or more of the components capable of reacting and/or foaming under the proper conditions to form a foam or cellular structure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With respect to the preparation of rigid or flexible polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams using the foregoing as the blowing agent, any of the methods well known in the art can be employed. See Saunders and Frisch, Volumes I and II Polyurethanes Chemistry and Technology (1962). In general, polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams are prepared by combining an isocyanate, a polyol or mixture of polyols, a blowing agent or mixture of blowing agents, and other materials such as catalysts, surfactants, and optionally, flame retardants, colorants, or other additives.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is convenient, though not exclusive, in many applications to provide the components for polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams in pre-blended foam formulations. Most typically, the foam formulation is pre-blended into two components. The isocyanate or polyisocyanate composition comprises the first component, commonly referred to as the &#x201c;A&#x201d; component. The polyol or polyol mixture, surfactant, catalysts, blowing agents, flame retardant, and other isocyanate reactive components comprise the second component, commonly referred to as the &#x201c;B&#x201d; component. While the surfactant, catalyst(s) and blowing agent composition are usually placed on the polyol side, they may be placed on either side, or partly on one side and partly on the other side. Accordingly, polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams are readily prepared by bringing together the A and B side components either by hand mix, for small preparations, or preferably machine mix techniques to form blocks, slabs, laminates, pour-in-place panels and other items, spray applied foams, froths, and the like. Optionally, other ingredients such as fire retardant, colorants, auxiliary blowing agents, water, and even other polyols can be added as a third stream to the mix head or reaction site. Most conveniently, however, they are all incorporated into one B component.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Any organic polyisocyanate can be employed in polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foam synthesis inclusive of aliphatic and aromatic polyisocyanates. Preferred, as a class is the aromatic polyisocyanates. Preferred polyisocyanates for rigid polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foam synthesis are the polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates, particularly the mixtures containing from about 30 to about 85 percent by weight of methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) with the remainder of the mixture comprising the polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates of functionality higher than 2. Preferred polyisocyanates for flexible polyurethane foam synthesis are toluene diisocyanates including, without limitation, 2,4-toluene diisocyanate, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Typical polyols used in the manufacture of rigid polyurethane foams include, but are not limited to, aromatic amino-based polyether polyols such as those based on mixtures of 2,4- and 2,6-toluenediamine condensed with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide. These polyols find utility in pour-in-place molded foams. Another example is aromatic alkylamino-based polyether polyols such as those based on ethoxylated and/or propoxylated aminoethylated nonylphenol derivatives. These polyols generally find utility in spray applied polyurethane foams, though such use is not considered limiting to the invention and may be adapted as otherwise understood in the art or provided herein. Another example is sucrose-based polyols such as those based on sucrose derivatives and/or mixtures of sucrose and glycerine derivatives condensed with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide. These polyols generally find utility in pour-in-place molded foams, again such use is not considered limiting to the invention and may be adapted as otherwise understood in the art or provided herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Typical polyols used in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foams include, but are not limited to, those based on glycerol, ethylene glycol, trimethylolpropane, ethylene diamine, pentaerythritol, and the like condensed with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, and the like. These are generally referred to as &#x201c;polyether polyols&#x201d;. Another example is the graft copolymer polyols, which include, but are not limited to, conventional polyether polyols with vinyl polymer grafted to the polyether polyol chain. Yet another example is polyurea modified polyols which consist of conventional polyether polyols with polyurea particles dispersed in the polyol.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Examples of polyols used in polyurethane modified polyisocyanurate foams include, but are not limited to, aromatic polyester polyols such as those based on complex mixtures of phthalate-type or terephthalate-type esters formed from polyols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or propylene glycol. These polyols are used in rigid laminated boardstock, and may be blended with other types of polyols such as sucrose-based polyols, and used in polyurethane foam applications.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Catalysts used in the manufacture of polyurethane foams are typically tertiary amines including, but not limited to, N-alkylmorpholines, N-alkylalkanolamines, N,N-dialkylcyclohexylamines, and alkylamines where the alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the like and isomeric forms thereof, as well as heterocyclic amines. Typical, but not limiting, examples are triethylenediamine, tetramnethylethylenediamine, bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether, triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, triamylamine, pyridine, quinoline, dimethylpiperazine, piperazine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, N-ethylmorpholine, 2-methylpiperazine, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, tetramethylpropanediamine, methyltriethylenediamine, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, non-amine polyurethane catalysts are used. Typical of such catalysts are organometallic compounds of lead, tin, titanium, antimony, cobalt, aluminum, mercury, zinc, nickel, copper, manganese, zirconium, bismuth, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary catalysts include, without limitation, lead 2-ethylhexoate, lead benzoate, ferric chloride, antimony trichloride, and antimony glycolate. A preferred organo-tin class includes the stannous salts of carboxylic acids such as stannous octoate, stannous 2-ethylhexoate, stannous laurate, and the like, as well as dialkyl tin salts of carboxylic acids such as dibutyl tin diacetate, dibutyl tin dilaurate, dioctyl tin diacetate, and the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the preparation of polyisocyanurate foams, trimerization catalysts are used for the purpose of converting the blends in conjunction with excess A component to polyisocyanurate-polyurethane foams. The trimerization catalysts employed can be any catalyst known to one skilled in the art including, but not limited to, glycine salts and tertiary amine trimerization catalysts, alkali metal carboxylic acid salts, and mixtures thereof. Preferred species within the classes are potassium acetate, potassium octoate, and N-(2-hydroxy-5-nonylphenol)methyl-N-methylglycinate.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Dispersing agents, cell stabilizers, and surfactants may be incorporated into the blowing agent mixture. Surfactants, better known as silicone oils, are added to serve as cell stabilizers. Some representative materials are sold under the names of DC-193, B-8404, and L-5340 which are, generally, polysiloxane polyoxyalkylene block co-polymers such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,834,748, 2,917,480, and 2,846,458.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Other optional additives for the blowing agent mixture may include flame retardants such as tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tris (2-chloropropyl) phosphate, tris (2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate, tris (1,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate, diammonium phosphate, various halogenated aromatic compounds, antimony oxide, aluminum trihydrate, polyvinyl chloride, and the like. Other optional ingredients may include from 0 to about 3 percent water, which chemically reacts with the isocyanate to produce carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide acts as an auxiliary-blowing agent.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Generally speaking, the amount of the blowing agent composition present in the blended mixture is dictated by the desired foam densities of the final polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams products. The polyurethane foams produced can vary in density from about 0.5 pound per cubic foot to about 40 pounds per cubic foot, preferably from about 1.0 to about 20.0 pounds per cubic foot, and most preferably from about 1.5 to about 6.0 pounds per cubic foot for rigid polyurethane foams and from about 1.0 to about 4.0 pounds per cubic foot for flexible foams. The density obtained is a function of how much of the blowing agent, or blowing agent mixture, is present in the A and/or B components, or that is added at the time the foam is prepared.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment, the mixtures and compositions of this invention may be used as propellants in sprayable compositions, either alone or in combination with known propellants. The sprayable composition comprises, consists essentially of, and consists of a material to be sprayed and a propellant comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of a mixture or composition of the invention. Inert ingredients, solvents, and other materials may also be present in the sprayable mixture. Preferably, the sprayable composition is an aerosol. Suitable materials to be sprayed include, without limitation, cosmetic materials such as deodorants, perfumes, hair sprays, cleansers, and polishing agents as well as medicinal materials such as anti-asthma and anti-halitosis medications and metered dose inhalers (MDIs).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The compositions of the invention may also be used in a method of dissolving a contaminant or removing a contaminant from the surface of a substrate that comprises, consists essentially of, and consists of the step of contacting the substrate with the compositions of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The foams in accordance with the present invention, in certain preferred embodiments, provide one or more exceptional features, characteristics and/or properties, including: thermal insulation efficiency (particularly for thermoset foams), dimensional stability, compressive strength, aging of thermal insulation properties, all in addition to the low ozone depletion potential and low global warming potential associated with many of the preferred blowing agents of the present invention. In certain highly preferred embodiments, the present invention provides thermoset foam, including such foam formed into foam articles, which exhibit improved thermal conductivity relative to foams made using the same blowing agent (or a commonly used blowing agent HFC-245fa) in the same amount but without the blowing agent composition of the present invention.

This is attributed to the condensation of the blowing agent in the foam matrix at temperatures below the boiling point of the blowing agent. It is unanticipated that the 30/70 mole % 1336mzzm/1233zd(E) and 70/30 mole % 1336mzzm/1233zd(E)blend does not show the same curve shape since this is not an azeotropic composition. In addition the thermal conductivity of foams prepared with these blends are significantly improved over those made with 1233zd(E). Not only are they improved, the improvement is nonlinear in relationship to the amount of 1336mzzm added to the blowing agent blend. It is particularly interesting that the improvement at the low mean temperatures is significant and not 1233zd(E) concentration dependant. In addition, it is notable that the foam prepared from the blends age slower than the 1233zd(E) and the 1336mzzm foams.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 5</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Foam Thermal Conductivity</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>1233zd(E)/</entry><entry>1233zd(E)/</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>1336mzzm</entry><entry>1336mzzm</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>70/30 </entry><entry>30/70 </entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>1233zd(E)</entry><entry>mole %</entry><entry>mole %</entry><entry>1336mzzm</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>10-24-1</entry><entry>10-24-3</entry><entry>10-24-2</entry><entry>10-23-2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Initial</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;40&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1357</entry><entry>0.1328</entry><entry>0.1320</entry><entry>0.1356</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;75&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1540</entry><entry>0.1485</entry><entry>0.1459</entry><entry>0.1432</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>110&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1744</entry><entry>0.1667</entry><entry>0.1643</entry><entry>0.1612</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;8 Day</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;40&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1415</entry><entry>0.1360</entry><entry>0.1367</entry><entry>0.1397</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;75&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1595</entry><entry>0.1527</entry><entry>0.1506</entry><entry>0.1472</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>110&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1798</entry><entry>0.1719</entry><entry>0.1711</entry><entry>0.1672</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>14 Day</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;40&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1431</entry><entry>0.1371</entry><entry>0.1380</entry><entry>0.1421</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;75&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1626</entry><entry>0.1558</entry><entry>0.1505</entry><entry>0.1479</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>110&#xb0; F.</entry><entry>0.1838</entry><entry>0.1772</entry><entry>0.1697</entry><entry>0.1667</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
