Meantime, in order to support a sufficient data transmission rate within a limited bandwidth, strict performance requirements are needed for radio frequency systems. A radio frequency filter is an important part of the radio frequency system, which can filter out the interference and noise outside the communication spectrum to meet requirements of the signal-to-noise ratio of the radio frequency system and communication protocols. Taking a mobile phone as an example, since each frequency band needs a corresponding filter, dozens of filters may need to be s configured in the mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Normally, the film bulk acoustic resonator includes two film electrodes, and a piezoelectric film layer is arranged between two film electrodes. The working principle of the film bulk acoustic resonator is described as the following. The piezoelectric film layer is configured to generate vibration under an alternating electric field; the vibration excites the bulk acoustic wave propagating along the thickness direction of the piezoelectric film layer; and such acoustic wave may be reflected back from the interface between the air and each of two film electrodes, and then be reflected back and forth inside the film layer to form an oscillation. When the acoustic wave propagates in the piezoelectric film layer having exactly an odd multiple of half wavelength, a standing wave oscillation is formed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, current cavity-type film bulk acoustic resonators fabricated have problems such as lateral wave loss, insufficient structural strength, the quality factor (Q) which cannot be further improved, low yield and the like, so that these resonators cannot meet the needs of high-performance radio frequency systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure provides a film bulk acoustic resonator.

It should be understood that spatial relation terms may be intended to include different orientations of the device in use and operation in addition to the orientation shown in the drawings.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the film bulk acoustic resonator may include a carrier substrate <b>100</b>; a support layer <b>102</b> bonded on the carrier substrate <b>100</b>, where the support layer <b>102</b> encloses a first cavity <b>110</b><i>a</i>, and the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>exposes the carrier substrate <b>100</b>; a piezoelectric stacked structure covering the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a</i>, where the piezoelectric stacked structure includes a first electrode <b>103</b>, a piezoelectric layer <b>104</b> and a second electrode <b>105</b> stacked sequentially from bottom to top; and protrusions <b>40</b> disposed at the boundary of the effective resonance region, where the protrusions <b>40</b> are disposed on the upper surface or the lower surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure; or a part of the protrusions <b>40</b> is disposed on the upper surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure, and another part of the protrusions <b>40</b> is disposed on the lower surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the protrusions <b>40</b> may all be located on the lower surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure, and all be located on the side where the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>is located. The region surrounded by the protrusions <b>40</b> may be an effective resonance region, and the outside of the protrusions <b>40</b> may be an ineffective resonance region. The first electrode <b>103</b>, the piezoelectric layer <b>104</b> and the second electrode <b>105</b> in the effective resonance region may be overlapped with each other along the direction perpendicular to the carrier substrate <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, the protrusions <b>40</b> may all be located on the upper surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure, away from the side where the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>is located. The protrusions <b>40</b> may also be partially disposed on the upper surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure, and partially disposed on the lower surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the projections of the protrusions <b>40</b> on the carrier substrate <b>100</b> may form a closed ring shape, such as a closed irregular polygon, circle or ellipse. The protrusions <b>40</b> may make acoustic impedance mismatch between the effective resonance region enclosed by the protrusions and the region where the protrusions <b>40</b> are located, which may effectively prevent lateral acoustic wave leakage and improve the quality factor of the resonator. In other embodiments, the projections of the protrusions <b>40</b> on the carrier substrate <b>100</b> may not be a completely closed shape. It should be understood that when the projections of the protrusions <b>40</b> on the carrier substrate <b>100</b> is a closed shape, it is more beneficial for preventing lateral acoustic wave leakage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The material of the protrusion <b>40</b> may be a conductive material or a dielectric material.

In one embodiment, the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a ring-shape closed cavity, and the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be formed by etching the support layer <b>102</b> through an etching process, which may not limit the technology of the present disclosure. It should be noted that the support layer <b>102</b> may be combined with the carrier substrate <b>100</b> by a bonding manner, and the bonding manner may include covalent bonding, adhesive bonding or fusion bonding.

It does not mean that the piezoelectric layer <b>104</b> may completely cover the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>to form a sealed cavity. Obviously, the piezoelectric layer <b>104</b> may completely cover the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>to form a sealed cavity. Without etching the piezoelectric layer, the piezoelectric stacked structure may be guaranteed to have a certain thickness, so that the resonator has a certain structural strength, thereby improving the yield of fabricated resonator.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, an etch stop layer may be further disposed between the support layer <b>102</b> and the first electrode <b>103</b>; and the material of the etch stop layer may include, but may not be limited to, silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) and silicon oxynitride (SiON). On the one hand, the etch stop layer may be used to increase the structural stability of final fabricated film bulk acoustic resonator; on the other hand, the etch stop layer may have a lower etching rate than the support layer <b>102</b>, which may prevent over-etching during the process of etching the support layer <b>102</b> to form the first cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>and protect the surface of the first electrode <b>103</b> under the etch stop layer from be damaged, thereby improving device performance and reliability.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the surface of the piezoelectric stacked structure may further include a first trench <b>130</b><i>a </i>and a second trench <b>130</b><i>b</i>.
