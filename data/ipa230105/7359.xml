For instance, information boxes, such as sports scores and schedule information, scrolling stocks and financial tickers, calendar information, and/or scrolling news information may be obscured by overlays of network logos, closed captions, or notification displayed on presented content. In some cases, content delivery platforms may cause interfaces to render an overlay that obscures important displayed information or activity. In some cases, content may be produced or distributed by one source and delivered by another platform, potentially causing miscommunication of where on a screen important information may be displayed. Screen real estate is still finite, and overlap can cause the quality of a viewing experience to diminish and displayed information to be lost.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Overlays such as network logos, sports scores, news banners, application identifiers, credits, closed captions, subtitles, advertisements, notifications, and/or supplemental content to be rendered and displayed on the client's side may be placement-agnostic, e.g., positioned without attention to what may be covered by the overlay while displayed on video content. A network logo might overlay and block a sports score displayed in a corner of the screen. For instance, a streaming platform may transmit a soccer game to a client application that overlays a platform logo that covers the game clock or the away team's score. A news stream may inadvertently overlay closed captions over a breaking-news banner. A mobile application may provide a routine notification that blocks key moments of a scrolling stock ticker. The app may suppress an important alert when a notification overlay setting is turned off. A favorite actor or band member may be covered by closed captions. An advertisement may block a penalty kick or golf swing. There exists a need to determine where on-screen zones comprising information, instruments, or activity are located and to relocate overlays that may obfuscate information boxes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Content delivery systems and interactive program interfaces should not distract or distract from the viewing experience. For instance, TV/video platforms and streaming applications should not obscure key on-screen information, thereby limiting content presentation experience. Presentation issues may diminish content enjoyment, and vital information may be obscured.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some content, e.g., video, may include on-screen information in the form of an information box. An information box (or &#x201c;info box&#x201d;) may be found in forms such as sports scores and schedule information (e.g., &#x201c;sports box&#x201d;), a scrolling stock or financial ticker, schedule or calendar information, a scrolling news ticker, scrolling descriptions/information, advertisements and sponsors, time and temperature, and other relevant on-screen graphics and text. On-screen information is typically delivered with or as part of the delivered content, but an information box may be added at several points in the production, transmission, and/or broadcast processes, e.g., as a designed overlay over the content. An instrument zone may be a zone on a screen where a key instrument of the content is tracked. For instance, a key instrument might be a ball, bat, base, goal, golf club, favorite or key player, important character, actor, prop, portion of a set, speaker, or important device or person important to the content. An activity zone, for example, may be an area of the screen where an action occurs, such as pitching, shooting, striking of a ball, speaking, running, or otherwise performing. In some embodiments, an instrument zone and an active zone may be determined as and/or defined by a location, e.g., like an information box, for segments of content, which may change (or even disappear).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Info boxes, instrument zones, and/or activity zones in a content item may be obscured by overlays added during content presentation processes. An overlay, for example, may be graphics or text intended to overlay the content and be presented along with the content. An overlay image may be, for instance, a network identifier, channel logo, platform/app icon, captions, subtitles, sponsor logo, notification, or other graphics or text. Overlays may be rendered to overlay content during or after delivery to a client device. Overlays may be positioned anywhere on a screen. Overlays may be placed in a default screen location, come with instructions on where to be positioned on a screen by an interface on a client device, or a screen position may be conveyed separately. For instance, an overlay may be associated with instructions or metadata comprising a screen position such as screen coordinates or a desired screen region. A screen may be considered a two-dimensional coordinate plane, measured in pixels, with the origin at the center. Overlays are typically agnostic of what will be covered when rendered at a client device and, thus, overlaying content can lead to issues of missed information or activity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some cases, a network logo may be required to be displayed as an overlay when streaming a particular program produced or distributed by that network. For instance, an online streaming platform may aggregate television programs from various studios and producers and may be required to identify which network the program is associated with by displaying a logo as an overlay to the program. For instance, Hulu may be required to display an NBC logo in a corner when the show &#x201c;Saturday Night Live&#x201d; is presented. In some cases, the NBC logo may be required to be the logo of the local NBC affiliate associated with the viewer's location. This logo is an overlay, and it may generally not obscure any information. However, if the program were to be an NFL football game or an Olympic event, there may be a score or other sports information box in a corner. With some networks and platforms, an overlay logo or watermark may be in the same corner as the score information and may potentially obscure it.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With some international sports, for instance, a regional television distributor may receive a live feed of the game score box with the score and game clock and add some commentary and post-production graphics. In some cases, a localized streaming service may add a logo or graphic without seeing where the score and game clock are located. An automatically placed logo overlay may cover the game score. Likewise, some sports highlight clips are generated autonomously or semi-autonomously and logos and/or graphics are occasionally placed without observing where on the screen the score and game clock were placed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Viewers have grown accustomed to having a score box over the past few decades of televised sports. Overlay overlap may obscure identification of the teams, the time or period in which a highlight occurs, and generally the score of the game at a given point in time. Viewers may be asking if the free kick scored the go-ahead goal in the soccer match or if the three-pointer created a lead or a tie in the basketball game. Not knowing the count for balls and strikes for baseball makes the game very confusing and frustrating for a viewer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Likewise, with news programs and 24-hour news networks, there are constantly scrolling tickers of information such as headlines, world news, stock prices, financial news, weather, sports scores and transactions, calendar items, and schedules that may be very valuable to viewers. News is no longer just on TV or cable as even local affiliates have 24-7 news networks streaming these days. Some news networks are accessible via third-party applications. If a news program or a news network streamed through a third-party application, for instance, includes a logo overlay, watermark, or an advertisement, there will be some screen overlap and information will be missed by a viewer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Notifications appearing on every device from televisions to smartphones can behave like obtrusive overlays that cover valuable information. For instance, an incoming text message may cover information such as a stock ticker on a streamed finance show. A upcoming program reminder may pop up and cover a scrolled sports score a viewer was waiting to see. Then, if a user turns off a notification setting, the app may suppress a home security alert, putting people in danger. There exists a need to determine where information boxes are on screen and to relocate overlays that may obscure information boxes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As discussed herein are systems and methods of relocating an overlay to avoid overlapping information displayed in video content. As an overlay is rendered and positioned, there can be a check to make sure the overlay does not overlap an information box such as a sports score, stock ticker, news banner, or other information. If an overlap is determined, the overlay can be moved and rendered in a different position. A different overlay position may be determined in many ways, but typically may be moved to an opposite corner, side, or horizontal position.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One approach may involve manual recognition of information or activity and movement of an overlay such as a logo or notification. This is not feasible for thousands of networks, individual video streams, and, sometimes, dozens of third-party applications offering access to the same feed and applying their own logo, watermark, or graphics to the stream. As streaming becomes more autonomous, errant overlays will become more of a problem.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Some embodiments may utilize an overlay engine to perform one or more parts of the systems and methods of determining info box location and relocating overlays, e.g., as part of a content delivery platform or interactive content guidance application, stored and executed by one or more of the processors and memory of a device and/or server such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. For instance, an overlay engine may run on a server of a content delivery platform like a streaming service. An overlay engine may run on a component of a television, set-top box, computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device able to access a content delivery network.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An overlay engine generally may identify screen positions of an information box and an overlay, determine if there is overlap, and relocate an overlay so there is no overlap of the information box. For instance, if a network logo overlay has instructions to be placed on top of or too near a score box in the bottom-right corner, an overlay engine will identify the score box, determine the overlap, and relocate the overlay to a different corner (e.g., the bottom-left corner). By way of another non-limiting example, if a closed caption overlay has instructions to be placed on top of or too near a stock ticker at the bottom of a news program, an overlay engine will identify the stock ticker, determine the overlap, and relocate the closed caption overlay to a different horizontal level (e.g., the top of the screen). In some embodiments, an overlay engine may determine coordinates of good or bad locations to place an overlay as read from a streaming video manifest file defined by content producers or distributors. An overlay engine may render different versions of text and/or graphics of an overlay such as a scoreboard, score ticker, leaderboard, news banner, and/or stock ticker based on the size and resolution of a client device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, an overlay engine may interpret priority levels and modify overlay location based on priority. For instance, a notification that is urgent, like a home security alert, may be permitted to overlay an information box like a sports score or news ticker. On the other hand, a notification with a reminder that a TV program will begin on another channel in, e.g., 15 minutes is not as urgent as a home security message. In some embodiments, priority levels may be, e.g., &#x201c;high,&#x201d; &#x201c;medium,&#x201d; or &#x201c;low.&#x201d; In some embodiments, priority levels may be on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. An overlay engine may allow certain notifications and pop-up overlays to cover information based on a comparison of priority or a threshold of urgency. Some embodiments may position overlays differently, e.g., forcing overlap, based on an associated high-priority level.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Described herein are systems or methods of providing content comprising receiving a content item, the content item comprising a video image, and determining a first screen position of an information box (e.g., a score box) in the video image. Determining may be performed with image analysis and/or a machine learning model. The system receives an overlay image (e.g., a channel logo) with a second screen position and determines if the second screen position (e.g., for the logo) overlaps the first screen position (e.g., for the score). In response to determining the second screen position (e.g., of the logo) overlaps the first screen position (e.g., the score), the system modifies the second screen position (e.g., for the logo). Then the system generates for display the overlay image on the video in the modified screen position. Some embodiments include information boxes describing sports information, financial information, calendar information, news information, or other text or graphics. Some embodiments include overlay images comprising a network identifier, a producer identifier, closed caption text, subtitle text, scoreboards, sports tickers, a notification, supplemental content, or other text or graphics.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The systems or methods may also determine the first screen position by accessing screen coordinates stored in metadata or a manifest associated with the content item. For instance, a manifest file may identify locations, e.g., coordinates, of positions to move (or not move) an overlay, as well as different sizes or versions of the overlay. Some embodiments may determine the first screen position by identifying, e.g., shapes, stationary text, and/or scrolling text with visual analytics.

Content like video, animation, music, audiobooks, ebooks, playlists, podcasts, images, slideshows, games, text, and other media may be consumed by users at any time, as well as nearly in any place. Abilities of devices to provide content to a content consumer are often enhanced with the utilization of advanced hardware with increased memory and fast processors in devices. Devices&#x2014;e.g., computers, telephones, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, microphones (e.g., with a virtual assistant), activity trackers, e-readers, voice-controlled devices, servers, televisions, digital content systems, video game consoles, and other internet-enabled appliances&#x2014;can provide and deliver content almost instantly.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Interactive content guidance applications may take various forms, such as interactive television program guides, electronic program guides and/or user interfaces, which may allow users to navigate among and locate many types of content including conventional television programming (provided via broadcast, cable, fiber optics, satellite, internet (IPTV), or other means) and recorded programs (e.g., DVRs) as well as pay-per-view programs, on-demand programs (e.g., video-on-demand systems), internet content (e.g., streaming media, downloadable content, webcasts, shared social media content, etc.), music, audiobooks, websites, animations, podcasts, (video) blogs, ebooks, and/or other types of media and content.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The interactive guidance provided may be for content available through a television, or through one or more devices, or bring together content available both through a television and through internet-connected devices using interactive guidance. The content guidance applications may be provided as online applications (e.g., provided on a website), or as stand-alone applications or clients on handheld computers, mobile telephones, or other mobile devices. Various devices and platforms that may implement content guidance applications are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Media devices, content delivery systems, and interactive content guidance applications may utilize input from various sources including remote controls, keyboards, microphones, video and motion capture, touchscreens, and others. For instance, a remote control may use a Bluetooth connection to a television or set-top box to transmit signals to move a cursor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative user interface relocating a network logo overlay, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Scenario <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a user interface, interface <b>110</b>, of an interactive content guidance application presenting content <b>102</b>. Scenario <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also illustrates a user interface using overlay relocation as interface <b>111</b>. In scenario <b>100</b>, interface <b>110</b> and interface <b>111</b> are each presented on a screen of device <b>101</b>. By way of a non-limiting example, scenario <b>100</b> may depict determining and modifying a screen position of an overlay for relocation on a screen. For instance, interface <b>110</b> may present an information box that may be covered by a network logo. In interface <b>111</b>, however, the network logo is relocated and the information box is not obscured by the logo.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Exemplary processes such as determining a screen position of an information box, determining screen overlap, and relocating an overlay are described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-D</figref> and may be carried out by an overlay engine, e.g., as part of a content delivery platform or interactive content guidance application, stored and executed by one or more of the processors and memory of a device and/or server such as device <b>101</b> and devices depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Interface <b>110</b> depicts providing content <b>102</b> for consumption via interface <b>110</b> on device <b>101</b>. For instance, content <b>102</b> may be a soccer game between Philadelphia and New York City that a viewer is watching on device <b>101</b>. Device <b>101</b> may be, for instance, a television, set-top box, computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device able to access a content delivery network that provides interface <b>110</b> and content <b>102</b>. Interface <b>110</b> may be a part of a content delivery platform or interactive content guidance application, stored and executed by one or more of the processors and memory of a device and/or server such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. Content <b>102</b> may be delivered via a content delivery system using one or more of cable, fiber, satellite, antenna, streaming over IP, wireless, or other content delivery methods. Content <b>102</b> may be captured live for live broadcast and/or streaming.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Interface <b>110</b>, for example, displays an information box in the form of score box <b>104</b> in the lower-right corner of the screen. A score box may also be known as a score bar, score bug, score table, game score, and other names that describe a digital on-screen graphic depicting game information. Score box <b>104</b> may include, e.g., a game score &#x201c;PHL 3, NYC 2&#x201d;), game time (&#x201c;11:03&#x201d;), game period (&#x201c;2nd Half&#x201d;), and more. An information box such as score box <b>104</b> is typically included as part of and delivered with content <b>102</b>, such as in scenario <b>100</b>, but a score box may be added at several points in the production, transmission, and/or broadcast processes as a designed overlay over the content. Score box <b>104</b> is an exemplary information box that appears on screen and other on-screen graphics and information like news banners, stock scrollers, advertisements, open and closed captions, subtitle text, and other on-screen text and information&#x2014;each of which may be treated like score box <b>104</b> in interfaces <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>. Information boxes are considered important on-screen information that should not needlessly be covered with an additional overlay.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In interface <b>110</b> of scenario <b>100</b>, logo <b>106</b> is blocking score box <b>104</b>. For instance, logo <b>106</b> may be a network identifier, channel logo, platform/app icon, sponsor logo, or other graphic intended to overlay content <b>102</b> and be visible as the content is provided via interface <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, logo <b>106</b> may be a logo of a local affiliate of a national broadcast network and the logo must be shown due to licensing restrictions between the broadcast network and, e.g., a streaming platform depicting logo <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, content <b>102</b> may be transmitted globally via satellite and internet, e.g., as part of an international competition, and logo <b>106</b> may identify a regional carrier of content <b>102</b> rather than the original broadcaster, studios, producers, or network. In some cases, logo <b>106</b> may indicate a corporate sponsor for a portion of a game. In some embodiments, logo <b>106</b> may include additional information about the game, such as a player receiving a penalty, and may need to be localized and added as an overlay on (or closer to) the consumer end. In scenario <b>100</b>, logo <b>106</b> is an additional overlay and score box <b>104</b> is part of content <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, logo <b>106</b> and score box <b>104</b> may both be overlays to content <b>102</b>, but score box <b>104</b> may be more valuable to a viewer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, interface <b>110</b> must determine the location of score box <b>104</b>. In some cases, metadata associated with content <b>102</b> will identify a region or screen coordinates where score box <b>104</b> appears. For instance, content <b>102</b> may have a streaming manifest with XML, code identifying the coordinates of the box around score box <b>104</b> for the entirety of content <b>102</b>. In some cases, metadata associated with the content may be accessed or transmitted and interpreted to find the screen location of the information box. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of an exemplary process for determining a screen position of an information box in a video image.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, determination of the location of score box <b>104</b> may require visual processing and analysis. For instance, score box <b>104</b> may be identified using feature analysis and identifying the box shape. In some embodiments, score box <b>104</b> may be identified by stationary text and using optical character recognition (OCR). In some cases, score box <b>104</b> may be identified by comparing a plurality of frames and determining what shapes and/or text do not change from frame to frame. In some embodiments, identifying that part of a frame includes an information box (e.g., score box <b>104</b>) can be applied to a full image to determine a zone, subsection, and/or coordinates of the image that contain an information box. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of an exemplary process for determining a screen position of an information box in a video image.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, a machine learning algorithm may be applied to a neural network to generate a predictive model able to identify information boxes like score box <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref> describes a process to train a model to label and/or categorize video images including information boxes. In some embodiments, a combination of a neural network and image analysis may be used to determine coordinates of an info box. For instance, a neural network may be used to identify if a subsection of a frame includes an info box, and image analysis tools can match the subsection to a region of the frame and determine the coordinates.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Logo <b>106</b>, in interface <b>110</b> of scenario <b>100</b>, is in the lower-right portion of the screen and is blocking score box <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also identifies three other exemplary portions of the screen, where logo <b>106</b> could be overlayed, such as zone <b>112</b> (top-left), zone <b>114</b> (top-right), and zone <b>116</b> (bottom-left). Each of the zones are identified with a dashed-line box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> but those zones are typically invisible when presented via interface <b>110</b>. Each of zones <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> offer alternatives for logo <b>106</b> that would not obscure score box <b>104</b>. Locations of zones <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> are in the screen corners in order to minimize concealment of content <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, there may be more zones for relocating logo <b>106</b>, such as dividing the screen into nine (9) roughly equal rectangles.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In interface <b>111</b> of scenario <b>100</b>, logo <b>106</b> is not blocking score box <b>104</b>.

Closed captions may be considered, for instance, a text version of the audio portions of a television program, movie, or multimedia presentation. Closed captioning is generally intended to aid hearing-impaired people, but maybe useful for a variety of situations where full audio is not available and/or appropriate. Closed caption <b>206</b> is an example of closed captions that are easy to see and read because of the black background and white text. Closed caption <b>206</b> is an example of an overlay generated by the user interface application, e.g., interfaces <b>210</b> and <b>211</b>.

An instrument zone may be a zone on a screen where a key instrument of the content is tracked. For instance, a key instrument might be a ball, bat, base, goal, golf club, favorite or key player, important character, actor, speaker, or important device or person important to the content. An activity zone, for example, may be an area of the screen where an action occurs, such as pitching, shooting, striking of a ball, speaking, running, or otherwise performing. In some embodiments, an instrument zone and an active zone may be defined by a manifest for portions or segments of content and may change (or disappear). Zones may be set by coordinates defining a shape such as a rectangle, e.g., with the top-left coordinates and bottom-right coordinates identified in the manifest. In some embodiments, zones may be set by a coordinate defining the center of a circular shape identified in the manifest, e.g., with a radius in the manifest or set as a default by an interface. For example, in manifest file <b>405</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, zone <b>115</b> is identified as an instrument zone with instrumentcoords=&#x201c;instrumentcoords&#x201d; and zone <b>113</b> is identified as activezone=&#x201c;activezonecoords&#x201d; where score overlay <b>404</b> should not be rendered.

In some embodiments, the overlay engine determines the location of, for instance, a score box or a stock ticker. In some cases, metadata associated with the received content will identify a region or screen coordinates where the info box appears. For example, a content item may have a streaming manifest with XML code identifying the coordinates of the box around the score box for the content item. In some cases, metadata associated with a content item may be accessed or transmitted and interpreted to find the screen location of the information box. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for determining a screen position of an information box in a video image.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, at step <b>514</b>, determination of the location of an info box may require visual processing and analysis. For instance, an info box may be identified using feature analysis and identifying the box shape. In some embodiments, an info box may be identified by stationary text and using OCR. In some cases, an info box may be identified by comparing a plurality of frames and determining what shapes and/or text do not change from frame to frame. In some embodiments, identifying that part of a frame includes an information box (e.g., a score box or a stock ticker) can be applied to a full image to determine a zone, subsection, and/or coordinates of the image that contain an information box. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of an exemplary process for determining a screen position of an information box in a video image.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, at step <b>514</b>, a machine learning algorithm may be applied to a neural network to generate a predictive model able to identify information boxes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref> describes a process to train a model to label and/or categorize video images including information boxes.

An overlay image may be graphics or text intended to overlay the received content and be presented while the content is provided. An overlay image may be a network identifier, channel logo, platform/app icon, captions, subtitles, sponsor logo, notification, or other graphics or text. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, logo <b>106</b> is an overlay; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, closed caption <b>206</b> is an overlay; and, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, notifications <b>206</b> and <b>326</b> are overlays.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Overlays may come with instructions on where to be positioned on a screen. For instance, an overlay may include a screen position such as screen coordinates or a selected screen region. In some embodiments, an overlay screen position may be conveyed separately or have a default position. A screen position could be as simple as selecting one of the four corners of the screen. A screen position could require selection of one of several equal-shaped regions of a screen. Overlay screen positions are typically agnostic of what will be covered when overlaying content.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">At step <b>520</b>, the overlay engine determines if the overlay's screen position overlaps the info box's screen position. For instance, the overlay engine determines if the second screen position overlaps the first screen position. The overlay engine may have the coordinates or screen region delivered with the overlay (in step <b>516</b>). In some embodiments, the overlay engine may compare regions or coordinates of each of the second screen position (overlay) and the first screen position (info box). Determining if the overlay screen position overlaps with the info box screen position may be accomplished in several ways. Process <b>570</b>, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, is a method for determining if there is screen overlap. In some embodiments, e.g., where overlay coordinates are not readily available, to determine if the info box is obscured by the overlay, the overlay engine may compare a video frame without the overlay to the video frame with the overlay to see if the info box is visible. Such instances may use some image analysis steps described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C</figref> and/or a neural network described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">At step <b>522</b>, if the overlay engine determines the second screen position does not overlap the first screen position, the overlay engine generates, for display, the second information box in the second screen position as planned. If the overlay does not overlap the info box, then the overlay engine renders the overlay over the content without modification.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">At step <b>524</b>, if the overlay engine determines the second screen position does overlap (e.g., a portion of) the first screen position, the overlay engine modifies the second screen position to a position that does not overlap. In some embodiments, modifying screen position may comprise translating, flipping, shrinking, enlarging, or otherwise moving the overlay position on the screen. In some embodiments, modifying screen position may comprise changing the coordinates of the center of the overlay to flip (invert) the second screen position to an opposite screen position, e.g., vertically or horizontally (or both). For instance, if a coordinate system is applied to a screen with the origin at the exact center of the screen, flipping coordinates of, e.g., the center of an overlay from right side to left side (or vice-versa) would be inverting the x-coordinate. Likewise, flipping an overlay from the screen bottom to the top (or vice-versa) would be inverting the y-coordinate. Flipping an overlay to an opposite corner, e.g., translating the overlay from the bottom-left of the screen to the top-right, would require inverting each of the y-coordinate and the x-coordinate.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, modifying placement of an overlay may involve zones of a screen. For instance, a screen may be divided into nine roughly equal, rectangular zones. Each zone may be ranked by preference for overlay screen position and, when the zone overlaps an on-screen info box, modification can include advancing to the next zone. For example, if zones 1-9 are labeled left to right and top to bottom, in a 3-by-3 rectangle, when an overlap is determined in zone <b>9</b> (bottom-right), an overlay may be moved to zone <b>7</b> (bottom-left corner) or zone <b>1</b> (top-left corner) or zone <b>3</b> (top-right corner) based on preferred ranking. In some embodiments, such as scenario <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there may only be four zones, such as a zone for each of the four corners.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, there may be three horizontal zones. For instance, where tickers and/or subtitles may be used, zoning by horizontal rectangles, e.g., top, middle, and bottom, may be beneficial. When overlap occurs in the bottom zone, an overlay may be moved to the top zone, and vice versa. Scenario <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a situation with top and bottom zones. In some embodiments, the overlay engine may use five (ranked) horizontal zones.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">At step <b>526</b>, the overlay engine generates, for display, the overlay in the modified second screen position. The overlay engine renders the overlay over the content at the modified screen position so the overlay does not cover the info box identified at the first screen position. For example, interface <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts logo <b>106</b> in the bottom-left corner instead of the bottom-right corner where score box <b>104</b> resides.

For instance, an interactive guidance application may receive a soccer game with a score box, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. By way of another non-limiting example, a device may receive a market news show with a stock ticker, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. An information box may be on-screen text or graphics with information relevant to the content depicted. An information box may be seen, for example, in the form of sports score information, such as score box <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or a news ticker, such as stock ticker <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> or sports ticker <b>304</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, or other on-screen information. An info box conveys valuable and/or relevant information on screen and is not meant to be covered with an additional overlay. In some embodiments, an info box may be included as part of the content. In some embodiments, an info box may be separate but associated with the content.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">At step <b>554</b>, the overlay engine accesses associated metadata or manifest for content item. Content typically includes metadata. In some cases, metadata associated with the content may be accessed or transmitted and interpreted to find the screen location of the information box. In some embodiments, metadata associated with the received content may identify a region or screen coordinates where an info box appears on screen. In compatible systems, metadata can be programmed to identify where on-screen information may reside by, e.g., zone or coordinates. Streaming content may use a manifest file that may describe available stream segments and respective bit rates. A manifest may act as a playlist for downloading and playing smaller video segments. A manifest may also include other information about the video and could be programmed to include screen position of an info box. For instance, the received content may include a streaming manifest with XML code identifying the coordinates of a box appearing around an info box for the entire duration of content. In some cases, the info box may change position and the metadata or manifest will reflect the change. Manifest file <b>405</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> includes coordinates of zones that should or should not have overlays. Manifest file <b>405</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> includes coordinates of instrument zones and/or activity zones that should not have overlays.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">At step <b>556</b>, the overlay engine analyzes associated metadata or manifest for info box position data. In some embodiments, the overlay engine reads the metadata associated with the received content to identify a region (or screen coordinates) where an info box appears on screen. In some embodiments, the overlay engine may parse the XML code of the streaming manifest to identify a screen position (e.g., coordinates) of an info box (or instrument zone or activity zone). Manifest file <b>405</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> includes coordinates of zone <b>116</b> that could have an overlay (e.g., available) and zone <b>118</b> that should not have an overlay (e.g., info box).

For instance, the overlay engine may produce coordinates or a region of the screen as the &#x201c;first screen position&#x201d; describing the location of the info box. In some embodiments, the overlay engine may produce a zone position of the info box. For example, if zones 1-9 are labeled left to right and top to bottom, in a 3-by-3 rectangle, identifying a zone for the info box may be simpler for relocating an overlay. In some embodiments, the overlay engine may receive a region or zone for the info box, such as bottom-right of the screen, and have to translate the region into coordinates. The screen may be considered a two-dimensional coordinate plane with the origin at the very center. In some embodiments, the overlay engine may produce coordinates of the center of the info box, so that overlays are moved to opposite sides or corners.

In some embodiments, portions a video frame may be provided to a trained neural network for labeling, and the coordinates and/or dimensions of the subsection, labeled as including an info box, may be returned. Portions a video frame may be provided to a trained neural network as, e.g., image features. In some embodiments, labels returned by a trained neural network may include an area of the screen where the info box is located, such as coordinates or regions. A trained neural network may return a section numbered <b>1</b> through <b>9</b> or equal portions of a screen, e.g., numbered left to right, top to bottom where an info box is found. A trained neural network may return a labeled corner section, such as top-left or bottom right, where an info box is found. A trained neural network may return a labeled horizontal ticker section such as top or bottom (or even center).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Scenario <b>599</b> depicts training video image data <b>1510</b> along with data labels <b>1512</b>. Training data for info box identification may be collected by manually labeling training video images with info boxes like sports scores, stock tickers, scrolling news banners, etc. Video image data without an info box, e.g., from a control group, may also be captured and used. In some circumstances, an analyst may mark incoming video data with an info box or non-info box label, e.g., in near real time, to create the training data set. From the video image data collected, at least two groups of data may be created: training video image data <b>1510</b> and test data <b>1524</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In scenario <b>599</b>, training video image data <b>1510</b> is pre-processed using feature extraction to form training image features <b>1516</b>. Pre-processing of training data is used to obtain proper data for training. In some embodiments, pre-processing may involve, for example, scaling, translating, rotating, converting, normalizing, changing of bases, and/or translating coordinate systems in video image data. In some embodiments, pre-processing may involve filtering video image data, e.g., to eliminate video image noise.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">After pre-processing, training image features <b>1516</b> are fed into Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) <b>1520</b> to generate an initial machine learning model, e.g., info box predictive model <b>1540</b>. In some embodiments, MLA <b>1520</b> uses numbers between 0 and 1 to determine whether the provided data, e.g., training image features <b>1516</b>, includes an info box or not. The more data that is provided, the more accurate MLA <b>1520</b> will be in creating a model, e.g., info box predictive model <b>1540</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Once MLA <b>1520</b> creates info box predictive model <b>1540</b>, test data may be fed into the model to verify the system and test how accurately model <b>1540</b> behaves. In some embodiments, test data <b>1524</b> is pre-processed to become an image feature <b>1536</b> and passed to info box predictive model <b>1540</b> for a prediction. Info box predictive model <b>1540</b> identifies whether the input test data includes an info box or not. In some embodiments, each iteration of test data <b>1524</b> is classified and reviewed for accuracy. For example, if expected label <b>1550</b> is not correct, false result <b>1552</b> may be fed as learning data back into MLA <b>1520</b>. If, after test data <b>1524</b> is classified and reviewed, model <b>1540</b> does not perform as expected (e.g., an error rate below 5%) then additional training data may be provided until the model meets the expected criteria. In some embodiments, a reinforcement learning method may be incorporated with test data to reward or punish MLA <b>1520</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Once info box predictive model <b>1540</b> works as expected, new real-time data may be fed to the model, and determinations of whether the data includes an info box may be predicted with confidence. For instance, in scenario <b>599</b>, new video image data <b>1530</b> may be pre-processed as an image feature <b>1536</b> and passed to info box predictive model <b>1540</b> for a prediction. Info box predictive model <b>1540</b> may evaluate image feature <b>1536</b> and present a label of info box or no info box for the data. If new video image data can be verified outside the system, model <b>1540</b> may be further updated with feedback and reinforcement for further accuracy.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of an illustrative device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.
