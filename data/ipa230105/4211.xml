Such systems exploit a radio frequency electromagnetic field emitted by a device (terminal or reader) to communicate with another device (transponder or card).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">In recent systems, the same device can operate in card mode or in reader mode (for example in the case of near field communication between two cell phones). It is then common for devices to be battery powered and their functions and circuits to be put on standby so as not to consume power between periods of use. The devices must then be &#x201c;woken up&#x201d; when they are within range of each other.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">The case of the two electronic devices <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is assumed, where, for example, the device <b>1</b> is a terminal, or reader, and device <b>2</b> is a transponder, but all that will be described applies more generally to any system in which a transponder picks up an electromagnetic field radiated by a reader, or terminal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">According to the applications, for a communication, one of the devices operates in a so-called reader mode while the other operates in a so-called card mode, or the two devices communicate in a peer-to-peer (P2P) mode. Each device includes various electronic circuits <b>11</b> (NFC) and <b>12</b> (NFC), or NFC modules <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, for generating a radio frequency signal transmitted by an antenna of an oscillating/resonant circuit. The radio frequency field generated by one of the devices <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> is picked up by the other device <b>2</b> or <b>1</b> that is within range and also includes an antenna. In some applications, when a device is not communicating, it is switched to standby to reduce power consumption. This is particularly the case for battery-powered devices. When the first device <b>1</b> emits an electromagnetic field to initiate a communication with the second device <b>2</b>, this field is picked up by this second device <b>2</b> as soon as it is in range. This field is detected by the circuits <b>12</b> of the second device <b>2</b> which, if they are on standby, are reactivated. This results in a variation of the load constituted by the circuits of the second device <b>2</b> on the resonant circuit generating the field of the first device. In practice, the corresponding variation in phase or amplitude of the emitted field is detected by the first device <b>1</b>, which then initiates an NFC communication protocol with the second device <b>2</b>. On the first device <b>1</b> side, it is detected in practice if the amplitude of the voltage at the terminals of the resonant circuit <b>12</b> drops below a threshold or if the voltage at the terminals of the resonant circuit has a phase shift greater than a threshold. Once the first device <b>1</b> has detected the presence of the second device <b>2</b> in its field, it initiates a communication establishment procedure, implementing transmissions of requests by the first device <b>1</b> and responses by the second device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">During a near field communication, the devices <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are positioned within range of each other. More specifically, the device <b>2</b> is positioned within range of the device <b>1</b> so that it can detect the electromagnetic field of device <b>1</b>. As an example, the device <b>2</b> is positioned at a distance generally less than 10 cm from the terminal <b>1</b>. According to another example, the device <b>2</b> is in mechanical contact with the terminal <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">The device <b>1</b> is a terminal that can be, for example, fixed or mobile. It is the device <b>1</b> that is in charge of initiating the communication. As an example, the terminal <b>1</b> is a payment terminal or a cell phone.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">The device <b>2</b> is a generally mobile transponder. According to a preferred embodiment, the transponder <b>2</b> is a microcircuit card (or smart card), for example a bank card or a transport card. Alternatively, the transponder <b>2</b> could be a cell phone or a connected object. The device <b>2</b> comprises various electronic circuits adapted to implement various commands sent by the device <b>1</b>, such as authentication circuits, cryptography circuits, etc. In particular, these different circuits consume more or less power during the execution of a command sent by the device <b>1</b>. The device <b>2</b> may comprise several different power supply modes in which some circuits are powered while others are not, these different power supply modes are described in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram representing, very schematically and in block form, an example of the architecture of one embodiment of an electronic device <b>30</b> of the type of device <b>1</b> or device <b>2</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

The device <b>30</b> may further comprise, according to one example, a non-volatile memory, and a read-only memory. Each memory is adapted to store different types of data. The registers are, more particularly, adapted to store specific data such as status data of the device <b>30</b>. By status data is meant here data that informs about the status of the device <b>30</b>, or those circuits and components.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">The electronic device <b>30</b> further comprises power supply circuits <b>33</b> (ALIM). The circuits <b>33</b> control the power supply of the different circuits and components of the device <b>30</b>. The circuits <b>33</b> comprise, for example, a battery, the means for recharging the battery, voltage matching circuits, such as voltage regulators, etc. The embodiments of one of the power supply circuits are described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">The electronic device <b>30</b> further comprises circuits <b>34</b> (NFC) adapted to implement a near field communication, or near field communication module <b>34</b>, or NFC module <b>34</b>. The NFC module <b>34</b> comprises, for example, oscillating/resonant circuits, data transmitting and receiving circuits, data converting circuits, etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The electronic device <b>30</b> further comprises circuits <b>35</b> (FCT) adapted to implement different functions of the device <b>30</b>. The circuits <b>35</b> are diverse, and may comprise measurement circuits, data analysis circuits, sensors, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">The electronic device <b>30</b> further comprises input and output (I/O) circuits <b>36</b> for the device <b>30</b>. The circuits <b>36</b> comprise connectors allowing the device <b>30</b> to transmit and receive data, display devices, etc.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">As previously stated, the circuits <b>33</b> are adapted to control the power supply, in voltage and in current, of the various circuits and components of the device <b>30</b>. According to one embodiment, the circuits <b>33</b> comprise at least one circuit particularly adapted to control the different power supply modes of the different circuits and components of the device <b>30</b>. Indeed, all or part of the circuits and components of the device <b>30</b> may have several different power supply modes, such as, for example, a full power supply mode and a low power supply mode.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">These different power modes may be implemented automatically when the device <b>30</b> is in a certain configuration, or in a certain operating mode. The device <b>30</b> comprises at least two operating modes. The device <b>30</b> may be in the on state or the off state. When the device <b>30</b> is in the on state, all of its circuits and components can be used, and can be powered by the power supply circuits <b>33</b>. When the device <b>30</b> is in the off state, all of its circuits and components are intended to be powered down, but some, such as the NFC module <b>34</b>, are powered up, for example with less power to reduce power consumption. The operating mode of the device <b>30</b> may be selected by a user of the device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">Furthermore, the different power modes of certain circuits and components of the device <b>30</b> may influence the power modes, or powering, of other circuits and components of the device <b>30</b>. In particular, and according to one embodiment, the NFC module <b>34</b> presents multiple power modes that affect the power mode, and power supply, of circuits and components of the device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">The NFC module <b>34</b> comprises at least three power modes: an active power mode, a standby power mode, and an inactive power mode. When the NFC module <b>34</b> is in the active power mode, in other words, the NFC module <b>34</b> is active, the NFC module <b>34</b> is available for use at any time. All circuits and components within the NFC module <b>34</b> are likely to be powered, and it is in this mode that the NFC module <b>34</b> is likely to consume the most power. When the NFC module <b>34</b> is in the standby power mode, i.e., the NFC module is on standby, the NFC module <b>34</b> is expected to be able to provide a service comprising fewer functions, and thus only a portion of the circuits included in the NFC module <b>34</b> are likely to be powered. In this mode, the NFC module <b>34</b> generally consumes less power than in the active power mode. When the NFC module <b>34</b> is in the inactive power mode, or hibernation mode, i.e., when the NFC module <b>34</b> is inactive, only a minimal portion of the circuits in the NFC module <b>34</b> are likely to be powered. It is in this power mode that the NFC module <b>34</b> consumes the least amount of power.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">In addition, like the device <b>30</b>, the NFC module <b>34</b> presents multiple operating modes, and can be in the on state or the off state. The operating mode of the NFC module <b>34</b> may be selected, for example manually, by a user of the device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">The different power modes of the NFC module <b>34</b> may be set in different configurations of use of the device <b>30</b>. The active mode of the NFC module <b>34</b> can be implemented when the NFC module <b>34</b> is turned on, regardless of whether the device <b>30</b> is in the on state or the off state. The standby mode of the NFC module <b>34</b> may be implemented when the device <b>30</b> is in the on state, and that the NFC module <b>34</b> is in the on state.
