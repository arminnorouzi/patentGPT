A VR scenario typically involves presentation of digital or virtual image information without transparency to actual real-world visual input. An AR scenario typically involves presentation of digital or virtual image information as an augmentation to visualization of the real world around the user (i.e., transparency to real-world visual input). Accordingly, AR scenarios involve presentation of digital or virtual image information with transparency to the real-world visual input.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">MR systems typically employ wearable display devices (e.g., head-worn displays, helmet-mounted displays, or smart glasses) that are at least loosely coupled to a user's head. MR systems typically generate and display color data, which increases the realism of MR scenarios. Various optical systems generate images, including color images, at various depths for displaying MR (VR and AR) scenarios.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to various scenarios, the user may change the position of their head or simply their eyes (i.e., their gaze). Changes in viewer's head and/or pupil position present challenges to spatial light modulating display technology and introduces artefacts, such as color breakup, on the displayed images.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Described herein are techniques and technologies to improve image quality of spatial light modulating displays subject to user moving their eyes, thereby modifying their direction of gaze (e.g. line of sight).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As an example, if a user wearing a head-worn display device views a virtual object and moves their eyes to look at a different direction (e.g. follows the virtual object when the virtual object moves, or chooses to look at a different object), the virtual object can be rendered based on the user's field of view as determined by the position of their pupils. A change in a user's pupil position requires adjusting how color fields of an image frame will be displayed on the spatial light modulating displays.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments may shift one or more of the color fields of a rendered image frame based on the eye tracking data associated with the position of the user's pupils. One or more processors coupled to the MR device may obtain a first image frame having a set of color fields, wherein the first image frame corresponds to a first view perspective associated with a first position of the pupils of the viewer. The processor(s) may then determine a second position of the pupils of the viewer based on, for example, data receive from an eye tracking device coupled to the MR device. The processor(s) may then generate, based on the first image frame, a second image frame corresponding to a second view perspective associated with the second position of the pupils of the viewer. For example, the processor(s) may shift one or more color fields of the set of color fields by a shift value based on the second position of the pupils of the viewer. The processor(s) may then transmit the second image frame to a near-eye display device of the MR device to be displayed on the near-eye display device. All six color fields of the second image frame are displayed on the a same spot relative to the second position of the pupils of the viewer. According to various embodiments, a first color field of the set of color fields of the first image frame may be shifted at a first shift value and a second color field may be shifted at a second shift value. The first value and the second value are determined based on the first and second positions of the pupils of the viewer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some embodiments provide a method for transforming an image frame based on a position of pupils of a viewer. The method may include obtaining, by a computing device, a first image frame having a set of color fields. The first image frame corresponds to a first view perspective associated with a first position of the pupils of the viewer. The method may also include determining, by the computing device, a second position of the pupils of the viewer. The computing device may generate, based on the first image frame, a second image frame corresponding to a second view perspective associated with the second position of the pupils of the viewer. The generating may include shifting one or more color fields of the set of color fields by a shift value based on the second position of the pupils of the viewer. The method may also include transmitting, by the computing device, the second image frame to a near-eye display device to be displayed on the near-eye display device. All six color fields of the second image frame are displayed on the a same spot relative to the second position of the pupils of the viewer. In some embodiments, the first view perspective is also associated with a first head position of the viewer, the method further comprising: estimating, by the computing device, a second head position of the viewer. An intermediary warped image frame may be generated from the first image frame using the second head position of the viewer. The second image frame is generated using the intermediary warped image frame.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the method may also include receiving, by the computing device from an eye tracking device, data associated with the position of the pupils of the viewer, wherein the second position of the pupils is determined based on the data received from the eye tracking device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the method may also include calculating an eye velocity as a function of the first position of the pupils, the second position of the pupils and a time elapsed for the pupils of the viewer to get from the first position to the second position. The eye velocity is calculated with respect to the near-eye display device. The method may also include calculating, by the computing device, the shift value based on the eye velocity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various embodiments provide a system including one or more processors for performing the method for transforming an image frame based on a position of pupils of a viewer, as described above.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments provide a non-transitory computer-readable medium having stored thereon a sequence of instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, causes the processors to execute the method for transforming an image frame based on a position of pupils of a viewer, as described above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additional and other objects, features, and advantages of the disclosure are described in the detail description, figures and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The drawings illustrate the design and utility of various embodiments of the present disclosure.

Where certain elements of the present disclosure may be partially or fully implemented using known components (or methods or processes), only those portions of such known components (or methods or processes) that are necessary for an understanding of the present disclosure will be described, and the detailed descriptions of other portions of such known components (or methods or processes) will be omitted so as not to obscure the disclosure.

However, it is to be understood that the embodiments also lends themselves to applications in other types of display systems (including other types of mixed reality systems), and therefore the embodiments are not to be limited to only the illustrative system disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Mixed reality (MR) scenarios often include presentation of virtual content (e.g., color images and sound) corresponding to virtual objects in relationship to real-world objects. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a user <b>100</b> of an MR device <b>102</b> including a headset (e.g. wearable component) sees a real-world, physical object <b>104</b>. According to various embodiments, a virtual object <b>114</b> may be rendered on a near-eye display device of the MR device <b>102</b> with respect to the real-world object <b>104</b>. For example, the real-world object <b>104</b> may be in the form of a table, and a virtual fairy (as an exemplary virtual object <b>114</b>) may be rendered on the display device as being placed on the table. The MR device <b>102</b> must also account for the user's gaze (e.g. line of sight) used to generate/render the real-world object <b>104</b> as well as the virtual object <b>114</b>.

In some embodiments, the eye velocity is calculated with respect to the headset (e.g. with respect to the pixels of the display device of the headset). The computing device may then calculate the shift value based on the eye velocity. In some embodiments, all six color fields of the first image frame may be shifted by the same shift value. In other embodiments, a first color field may be shifted by a first shift value and a second color field may be shifted by a second shift value.

The user looks at the virtual object, and fixes their gaze on the virtual object while the user turns their head/neck to face the virtual object. While the user rotates their head, the virtual object remains stationary, and the user's gaze is fixed on the virtual object.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a series of drawings (drawings <b>1</b>-<b>9</b>) illustrating the clockwise head movement with respect to the virtual object, along with the color fields displayed on the display device at an exemplary rate of 60 fps. No visual correction (e.g. head pose based warp or eye tracking based correction) is applied in the drawings shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As the headset <b>200</b> as well as the display device <b>202</b> moves clockwise with respect to the user's pupils, the user's line of sight <b>208</b> remains fixed on the virtual object <b>206</b>. At the third drawing, the first color field <b>400</b> is formed on a predetermined location (e.g. pixel) on the display device <b>202</b>. When the user continues to move their head without shifting their gaze, the second (e.g. green) color field <b>402</b>, the third (e.g. blue) color field <b>404</b>, the fourth (e.g. red) color field <b>406</b>, the fifth (e.g. green) color field <b>408</b> and the sixth (e.g. blue) color field <b>410</b> are displayed on the display device as shown in drawings <b>4</b>-<b>8</b>, respectively. As shown in these drawings, the color fields <b>402</b> through <b>410</b> form outside the line of sight of the user. Rather, the color fields <b>402</b> through <b>410</b> are formed on a normal to the display device <b>202</b> as opposed to the line of sight of the user <b>208</b>. As a result, the color fields <b>402</b> through <b>410</b> are mapped to the same place on the display device, and the image displayed on the display device <b>202</b> exhibits color breakup. The final drawing (i.e. drawing <b>9</b>) illustrates the final rendering of the color fields <b>412</b> on the display device as perceived by the user. As shown there is too much blur and color breakup on the displayed color fields <b>412</b> illustrated in drawing <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A conventional fix to the problem may warp the image frame based on the estimated head pose of the user. The MR system can detect and/or predict (e.g., using inertial measurement units) the head pose. The MR system can then warp or transform the rendered virtual content from the source frame of reference into warped virtual content in the output frame of reference.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The head pose based solution to the first scenario is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The MR system may know the head pose at the first drawing, and then extrapolate the head pose to estimate where the head will be at different points in time (as illustrated in subsequent drawings <b>2</b>-<b>8</b>). The different points in time may correspond to points in time where a color field <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>510</b> will be displayed on the display device, as illustrated in drawings <b>3</b>-<b>8</b>, respectively. Once the head pose is extrapolated, the system may then shift one or more color fields (e.g., red, green, blue) so that they color fields <b>500</b> through <b>510</b> line up on the display device. The head pose based warp is able to place the color fields <b>500</b> through <b>510</b> on the line of sight of the user (e.g. all color fields appear on the line of sight <b>208</b> of the user illustrated with the normal line to the pupil), thereby eliminates the color breakup. However, the drawing <b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates that while the head pose based warp provides an image <b>512</b> of the virtual object without the color breakup, the virtual object may still appear blurry on the display device due to the rate at which the display is updated. In the exemplary scenarios discussed herein, the display is assumed to be updating at 360 Hz. Thus, the image can be changed every 2.8 ms, which would result in the image having 2.8 ms worth of blur, even though the colors do line up. If the display is configured to update much faster, such as at 100,000 Hz (e.g. in case of a micro-LED display, a digital light processing (DLP) display, or a ferroelectric liquid crystal display), the resulting image would only have 0.01 ms worth of blur which would be imperceptible.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a series of drawings (e.g. drawings <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>) the eye tracking based solution to the first scenario according to various embodiments. The position of the pupils of the user may be tracked using a high-sample-rate, robust, high-accuracy eye tracking device coupled to the MR system. The eye tracking device may determine the position of the user's pupils at different points in time where a color field will be displayed on the display device. Accordingly, the eye tracking based solution &#x201c;locks&#x201d; or &#x201c;sticks&#x201d; the color fields to user's pupils or retinae instead of making them stick to the real world (as is done in conventional warping techniques and/or systems). The system may then calculate an eye velocity (e.g. velocity of the user's pupils with respect to the headset or display device worn by the user) in x and y pixels to shift the color fields relative to the rendered frame. For example, if the user's gaze is moving at 10 pixels per millisecond, and the time offset between the color fields is 3 milliseconds, then the rendered color fields will be shifted by 30 pixels each. As a result, instead of the color fields lining up in the same place on the display, one or more of the color fields are shifted on the display causing them to line up in the same place on the user's retinae.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, without any correction, all six color fields may be mapped to some exemplary pixel coordinates (e.g. 10,20) on the display device. Based on the eye tracking, the system may consider two subsequent positions of the user's eye. For example, the user's eye may be moving to the left at 10 pixels per time unit, where one time unit is the difference in when different color fields are displayed on the display device. If the color fields are to be mapped to the pixel coordinates (10,20), the centroid of the six color fields should be mapped to (10,20). Thus, each color field may have to be displaced by a shift value so the first color field may be mapped to (35,20), the second color field may be mapped to (25,20), the third color field may be mapped to (15,20), the fourth color field may be mapped to (5,20), the fifth color field may be mapped to (&#x2212;5,20) and the sixth color field may be mapped to (&#x2212;15,20). Accordingly, each color field will be shifted (e.g. displaced) at exactly the right spacing to correspond to the eye velocity. The centroid of the color fields is at (10,20), while each of the color fields are shifted by a shift value determined based on the eye velocity (or the position of the user's pupils at different points in time). For example, the red color field shifted to the right of the (10,20) coordinates and ends up falling right in line with where the user is looking. The next color fields (e.g. green color field, the blue color field, and the repeating pattern) are shifted on the display instead of being in the same place as the red color field, causing the color fields to line up on the same place on the user's retina.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As illustrated in the series of drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the color fields <b>610</b> all appear on the line of sight of the user, illustrating the color fields <b>610</b> line up on the same place on the user's retina. Therefore, the color breakup is eliminated. The shifting of the color fields on the rendered image frame <b>612</b> works well with the spatial light modulating displays because the entire rendered frame is not displayed at once, rather it is displayed at six different times. Embodiments shift the color fields <b>610</b> by a shift value (measured in pixels) which is calculated as the product of the eye velocity (measured in pixels per millisecond) and the time (measured in milliseconds) each color field will be displayed on the display device.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to various embodiments, the eye velocity may be calculated as a function of the first position of the user's pupils, the second position of the user's pupils and a time elapsed for the pupils of the user to get from the first position to the second position. The eye velocity is calculated with respect to the headset. It may be desirable to calculate the eye velocity as late as possible for increased accuracy. For example, the eye velocity may be calculated right before the first color field is shifted by the shift value, leaving just enough time for the system to calculate the shift value using the eye velocity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the same eye velocity may be used to calculate the shift value for all six color fields. Yet in other embodiments, a first eye velocity may be calculated for a first color field, and a second eye velocity may be calculated for a second color field. In some embodiments, different eye velocities may be calculated to determine a different shift value for each one of the six color fields. For MR devices that render at 60 Hz, the eye tracking based shifting may be performed at 360 Hz.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the eye velocity may be zero. For example, the user may not change their gaze, and merely change their focus (e.g. looking from a faraway object to a closer object, where both objects are on the same line of sight). In such embodiments, the rendered image may still be warped or shifted however since the eye velocity would be zero, the shift value will be calculated as zero (e.g. no shift applied to the rendered image or the color fields).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Exemplary Scenario Two</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the second exemplary VR scenario, a virtual object (e.g. a virtual gnome) appears on a real world object (e.g. a desk) in front of the user.

That is, the head pose based warp lowers the quality of the displayed image by inserting blur and/or color breakup, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The MR system may know the head pose at the first drawing, and then extrapolate the head pose to estimate where the head will be at different points in time (as illustrated in subsequent drawings). The different points in time may correspond to points in time where a color field will be displayed on the display device, as illustrated in drawings <b>3</b>-<b>8</b>. Once the head pose is extrapolated, the system may then shift one or more color fields (e.g., red, green, blue) so that they color fields line up on the display device. The head pose based warp aims to place the color fields on the line of sight of the user, however does not account for the movement of the virtual object. Thus, the head pose based warp tries to lock the virtual object to the world and introduces blur and color breakup to the rendered image <b>1212</b>, as illustrated in the last drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. In fact, the color breakup introduced by the head pose based warp is worse than the previously illustrated artefacts because the colors do not even blend together.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates the eye tracking based solution to the fourth scenario according to various embodiments. Since the system calculates the eye velocity with respect to the headset, when the headset and the pupils are moving at the same time, the eye velocity is zero. Thus, the eye-velocity based shift value is zero. As illustrated in the drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the color fields <b>1310</b> all appear on the line of sight of the user, illustrating the color fields <b>1310</b> line up on the same place on the user's retina. Therefore, the color breakup and blur are both eliminated on the displayed image <b>1312</b>. Thus, the result is the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, even when the eye tracking based solution is applied by default.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Exemplary Scenario Five</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the fifth exemplary VR scenario, a virtual object (e.g. a virtual robot) is in the center of the user's field of view. However, the user is not looking at the virtual object. Instead, the user may be comparing two other virtual objects or areas next to the virtual object. For example, the user may be looking at an area <b>216</b> placed to the right of the virtual object and the area <b>226</b> placed to the left of the virtual object. That is, the user may be darting their eyes back and forth between the two areas, and across the virtual object. This eye movement may be referred as &#x201c;saccading&#x201d;. This scenario is similar to the third exemplary VR scenario, except for the eyes moving at a faster velocity.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a series of drawings illustrating the saccading eye movement, along with the color fields rendered on the display device using a head pose based warp to the rendered image. As the headset <b>200</b> as well as the display device <b>202</b> remains static, the user moves their eyes from moves left-to-right with respect to the areas <b>216</b> and <b>226</b>, the user's line of sight <b>208</b> moves between the two areas. At the third drawing, the first color field <b>1400</b> is formed on a predetermined location (e.g. pixel) on the display device <b>202</b>. When the user continues to move their eyes, the second (e.g. green) color field <b>1402</b>, the third (e.g. blue) color field <b>1404</b>, the fourth (e.g. red) color field <b>1406</b>, the fifth (e.g. green) color field <b>1408</b> and the sixth (e.g. blue) color field <b>1410</b> are displayed on the display device as shown in drawings <b>4</b>-<b>8</b>, respectively. As shown in the last drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the displayed image <b>1412</b> exhibits color breakup. Since the user's head is not moving, conventional head pose based warping will not be able to correct the artefact on the displayed image <b>1412</b> (e.g. the head pose is the same, thus the warp applied based on head pose will be zero warp). In addition, the motion vector based warp (which could improve scenario three) may not be applied here since there are no real objects and no virtual objects that the user's eye is following.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates the eye tracking based solution to the fifth scenario according to various embodiments. The position of the pupils of the user may be tracked using a high-sample-rate, robust, high-accuracy eye tracking device coupled to the MR system. The eye tracking device may determine the position of the user's pupils at different points in time where a color field will be displayed on the display device. Accordingly, the eye tracking based solution &#x201c;locks&#x201d; or &#x201c;sticks&#x201d; the color fields to user's pupils or retinae instead of making them stick to the real world (as is done in conventional warping techniques and/or systems). The system may then calculate an eye velocity (e.g. velocity of the user's pupils with respect to the headset or display device worn by the user) in x and y pixels to shift the color fields relative to the rendered frame. As a result, instead of the color fields lining up in the same place on the display, one or more of the color fields are shifted on the display causing them to line up in the same place on the user's retinae. As illustrated in the drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the color fields <b>1510</b> all appear on the line of sight of the user, illustrating the color fields <b>1510</b> line up on the same place on the user's retina. Therefore, the color breakup is eliminated on the displayed image <b>1512</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The displayed image <b>1512</b> shown in the drawing <b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> may include blur that may be attributable to display persistence during a color field. As the user darts their eyes around, instead of seeing different colors, the user sees some strobing. In some embodiments, artificial blur may be added to the rendered image in addition to the color field shift to correct for the strobing artefact.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the eye tracking based shifting may be applicable to the two independent-monocles displays. Each eye's tracking may be used to warp the corresponding display. In some embodiments, eye tracking for one eye may be used for both eyes (e.g. when the device loses tracking in one eye).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to various embodiments, the image frame may be rendered using head pose predicted to centroid of the 6 color fields. A single late-frame time warp may be performed to fix the rendering. Subsequently, an eye tracking based shift may be applied to the warped rendered image to shift one or more of the six color fields by a shift value (it may be the same shift value for all color fields, or a different shift value for one or more of the six color fields). The color field shift based on the eye tracking may be applied on the headset portion of the MR device.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">System Architecture Overview</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative computing system <b>1600</b> (e.g. an MR device), according to some embodiments.
