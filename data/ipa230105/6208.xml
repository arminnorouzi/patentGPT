For example, lithium-ion batteries are required to provide higher energy density, safety, and cycling performance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries, the prior art adopts an anode skeleton to provide sufficient space for lithium deposition so as to reduce volume change of the anode during charging and discharging. Specifically, when a battery is being charged, lithium metal goes off the cathode and deposits at the anode plate, and lithium can be stored in pores of the carbon skeleton, thereby maintaining a stable volume of the anode plate. When the battery is being discharged, lithium metal goes off the anode and intercalates to a cathode material, and as the carbon skeleton is able to maintain its shape, the volume of the anode plate does not decrease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, for existing anode plates based on an anode skeleton, lithium metal tends to deposit on the surface of the anode skeleton rather than inside the anode skeleton. This affects performance of the anode skeleton, which in turn results in great change of the volume of the anode plate during cycling, affecting performance of the anode plate. As a result, the performance of the lithium-ion battery is affected.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application is intended to provide an anode plate, and a battery and electronic apparatus using such electrode plate, so as to control a lithium deposition direction and ensure even and controllable deposition of lithium metal.

All other technical solutions obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of this application without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of this application.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For existing anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, for example, graphite, lithium ions intercalate into a graphite layer structure during charging. Similar to a skeleton structure, the graphite layer provides storage space for lithium. However, such a skeleton structure is not present in lithium-ion batteries with a pure lithium metal electrode. In this case, volume of an anode plate will change dramatically during charging and discharging. Generally, thickness of the anode plate changes by 8-200 &#x3bc;m, degrading the cycling performance of the batteries. Furthermore, during charging, lithium deposits on a surface of a current collector of the anode plate. Due to uneven current density and uneven concentration of lithium ions in electrolyte, deposition speeds will be excessively high at certain sites during the deposition process. This portion of lithium grows out of the lithium metal in a synapse-like form, and continues growing and even branches, eventually forming sharp lithium dendrites. The presence of lithium dendrites will significantly reduce the density of deposition, thereby reducing energy density of the battery. For example, in some lithium-ion batteries, the actual deposition density of lithium metal is approximately 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is far less than 0.534 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the true density of lithium metal. Due to the sparse deposition of lithium metal, the energy density of the battery will be reduced by more than 100 Wh/L. Furthermore, the lithium dendrites may pierce the separator to cause short circuit, resulting in battery failure and affecting battery safety.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In view of this, this application provides an anode plate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the anode plate includes a porous anode skeleton <b>1</b>, a lithiophilic substance <b>2</b> whose concentration presents gradient distribution inside the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b>, and a current collector <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> may be a membrane structure, and pores in the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> may be micropores or pores in other shapes. In addition, the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> has adequate strength. For example, the strength of the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> is not less than 15 MPa, so as to maintain a stable morphology and internal space. During charging, the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> can provide a stable space for lithium metal to deposit in a large quantity of pores of the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b>. During discharging, while lithium at the anode is constantly decreasing, the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> can still provide a stable structure and internal space, so that the anode will not shrink violently. Furthermore, the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> has good ionic and electronic conductivity for providing electricity conducting channels. In addition, the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> has a high specific surface area. Therefore, the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> can effectively disperse current during charging and discharging to reduce the current density, and create a more uniform electric field, thereby improving the evenness of lithium deposition and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this application, because the concentration of the lithiophilic substance can be in gradient distribution inside the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b>, lithium metal can be induced to accumulate gradually from the current collector side to the separator side during the lithium deposition process. Therefore, the lithium metal is prevented from preferentially depositing on the surface of the anode skeleton but deposits inside the anode skeleton instead.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, during preparation of the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b>, one side of carbon paper is sealed by an insulating tape, and the other side is not sealed, so the lithiophilic substance in the electrolyte preferentially deposits at a side away from the insulating tape. Therefore, the lithiophilic substance cannot be replenished in a timely manner to the electrolyte on the side close to the insulating tape. As a result, a concentration gradient is formed inside the skeleton, implementing gradient distribution of lithiophilic substance concentration in the skeleton. The gradient distribution of lithiophilic substance concentration inside the porous anode skeleton allows directional deposition of lithium metal. To be specific, more nucleation sites are provided on a side with higher Ag concentration to adsorb more lithium ions, while on the side with lower Ag concentration, lithium ions can also be absorbed, but due to less nucleation sites provided, only enough space is reserved for entry of excess lithium metal from the side with higher Ag concentration. Macroscopically, this is manifested by lithium metal expanding from the side with higher Ag concentration to the side with lower Ag concentration, thereby implementing directional deposition of lithium metal.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this application, as the concentration of the lithiophilic substance presents gradient distribution inside the porous anode skeleton, the lithium deposition direction can be controlled for even, controllable lithium deposition, which relieves lithium metal batteries from volume swelling during cycling. Furthermore, with lithium metal depositing inside the anode skeleton, the growth of lithium dendrites can be inhibited, thereby improving the safety performance and cycling performance of the battery.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To further illustrate the performance improvement brought by the lithiophilic substance in this application, the following description uses the lithiophilic substance Ag (silver) as an example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) cross-sectional view of Ag element distribution inside a porous anode skeleton. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that Ag presents gradient distribution inside the porous anode skeleton. Specifically, the lower part is the side away from the insulating tape, where the Ag concentration is higher, whereas the upper part is the side close to the insulating tape, where the concentration is lower.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">An alloying reaction takes place spontaneously between Ag and lithium metal, which can provide sites required for lithium nucleation. As such, the lithium deposition sites can be effectively controlled so that lithium preferentially deposits in the pores of the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> during cycling rather than on the surface of the electrode plate. This is because the skeleton can function properly only when the lithium deposition sites are effectively controlled. If lithium deposits on the surface of the electrode plate, the volume of the electrode plate will still change dramatically during cycling and the current density will not decrease. Thus, the Ag plating can not only modify the porous anode skeleton into a lithiophilic conductive skeleton, but also reduce overpotential of metallic lithium deposits, improving the cycling stability and inhibiting the growth of dendrites.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of lithium deposition sites corresponding to different Ag electroplating methods. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for a porous anode skeleton not electroplated with Ag, lithium metal deposits completely on the surface, and the surface shows the bright white luster of lithium metal. When a common Ag electroplating method, namely uniform Ag electroplating method, is used, gradient distribution is not formed in terms of Ag concentration in the anode skeleton, in which case some improvement is made but bright white lithium metal deposits are still visible on the surface of the electrode plate. When gradient Ag electroplating method is used, almost no traces of lithium metal deposition is found on the surface of the electrode plate, which means that lithium metal has gone to the inside of the porous anode skeleton.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment of this application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, concentration of the lithiophilic substance <b>2</b> gradually decreases in a direction from the current collector <b>3</b> to a surface of the porous anode skeleton <b>1</b>, and therefore gradient distribution is formed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment of this application, the foregoing porous anode skeleton <b>1</b> may be obtained by using this method: carbon fiber is impregnated with resin and then carbonized at a high temperature and carbon paper is obtained as resin decomposes to produce gas during the carbonizing process to generate a porous structure, where the carbon paper is used as the porous anode skeleton.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this application, the material of the current collector <b>3</b> is not particularly limited, which may be a material well known to those skilled in the art, for example, at least one of copper, nickel, titanium, molybdenum, iron, zinc and their alloys, or a conductive inorganic material, for example, carbon or graphene.

Especially in the case of Example 1, volume swelling measured was 0 and the number of cycles was significantly increased.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">Although the lithiophilic substances used in Examples 3 and 4 were different from that used in Example 1, in Examples 3 and 4, the numbers of cycles were significantly increased and volume swelling was significantly reduced in comparison with Comparative Examples 1 to 7. This shows that when the lithiophilic substance presents gradient distribution inside the porous anode skeleton, the cycling performance of the battery can be improved and the volume swelling arising from battery cycling can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">Compared with Comparative Examples 1 to 7, in Example 5, the number of cycles was significantly increased and volume swelling was significantly reduced. This shows that the anode plate obtained by using the PVD method on an oxide can also improve the cycling performance of the battery and reduce the volume swelling arising from battery cycling.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">In Comparative Example 1, a common silver electroplating method was used, so gradient distribution of lithiophilic substance was not formed. As a result, battery performance was not improved.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">In Comparative Example 2, the anode plate did not contain a current collector or lithium metal, so the anode plate had low performance. As a result, battery performance was not improved.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0150">In Comparative Example 3, the anode plate did not contain carbon paper or lithium metal, so the anode plate did not provide a porous structure for deposition of lithiophilic substance. As a result, battery performance was not improved.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">In Comparative Example 4, the anode plate did not contain carbon paper, so the anode plate did not provide a porous structure for lithiophilic substance deposition. As a result, battery performance was not improved.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">In Comparative Example 5, the current density of electroplating was the same as that in Example 1 but the common silver electroplating method was used, so gradient distribution of lithiophilic substance was not formed. As a result, the number of cycles was not increased and volume swelling performance was not improved.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">In Comparative Example 6, a common silver electroplating method was used and the current density of electroplating was low, so gradient distribution of lithiophilic substance was not formed. As a result, the number of cycles was not increased and volume swelling performance was not improved.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">In Comparative Example 7, a gradient silver electroplating method was used, but the current density of electroplating was further reduced. When a low current density is used for electroplating, particles of the lithiophilic substance are so large that the lithiophilic substance tends to deposit on the surface of the porous anode skeleton rather than goes inside the skeleton. Therefore, gradient distribution of lithiophilic substance was not formed. As a result, the number of cycles was reduced and volume swelling was increased.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">In Comparative Example 8, because a high current density was used, the plating was scorched so that it was impossible to prepare an anode plate. This shows that current density needs to be controlled during electroplating to avoid scorch of the plating.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">The foregoing descriptions are merely preferable embodiments of this application, but are not intended to limit this application.
