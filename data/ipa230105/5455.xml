Clarinets, oboes, and English horns are examples of wind instruments.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Supporting the weight of the wind instrument by hand, e.g. by musician's thumb, is burdensome and may cause physical issues and trouble over time. Pain and physical conditions may be caused for musicians over time when the weight of the instrument is on the thumb. Such continued strain is problematic particularly for younger musicians, and may lead to reduced playing time or incorrect playing positions. Breathing and blowing may suffer from inappropriate playing position or undue strain. Neck supports have been developed, but they can reduce the weight only to some extent. Wind instrument supports leaning against floor or chair have also been developed. However, there is a need for improvements in supporting wind instruments, which cause minimal effects or limitations when playing the instrument.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to some aspects, there is provided the subject-matter of the independent claims.

This is achieved by an elastic or flexible portion in the support, in some embodiments a spring structure, enabling the user to change the orientation of the wind instrument in relation to a rigid portion of the support, which may be against a chair, floor, further support portion, or musician's leg, for example. For example, the musician may move in various ways, e.g. lean forward, backwards, or sidewards, perform back and forth movement, perform circular movement, etc. The flexibility level is adjustable according to the musician's personal preference. The wind instrument support apparatus may be designed for, and adapted to be attached to, at least one of a clarinet, an oboe, an English horn, a saxophone, a recorder/fipple flute, or an electronic wind instrument (EWI), for example.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wind instrument support apparatus <b>1</b>. The apparatus <b>1</b> comprises an attachment element <b>20</b> to attach the apparatus to a wind instrument, a spring structure <b>10</b> attached to or comprised by the attachment element, and an elongated support portion or bar <b>30</b>. The spring structure <b>10</b> comprises at least one spring attached to the attachment element <b>20</b> directly or via an intermediate element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The support bar <b>30</b> is substantially rigid and partially insertable into the spring structure <b>10</b>. The apparatus <b>1</b> comprises a fastening mechanism to selectively fasten the support bar <b>30</b> in relation to the spring structure <b>10</b>, to selectively adapt the flexibility of the attachment element <b>20</b> in relation to the support bar <b>30</b> according to the musician's preference. In other words, the musician may, by adjusting the position of the bar in relation to the spring structure, configure or adapt the flexibility of the support apparatus <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The spring structure may comprise or be connected to a sleeve <b>12</b> via which the bar <b>30</b> may be moved into the spring structure. The spring of the spring structure <b>10</b> is mounted on the sleeve <b>12</b>. The sleeve may provide support for fastening the bar in relation to the spring structure. In the present example embodiment, the fastening mechanism comprises a clamping screw <b>11</b> arranged in the sleeve <b>12</b>. The musician may set and secure upper portion of the flexibility of the support apparatus <b>1</b> by fastening the bar <b>30</b> at a desired position in relation to the spring structure <b>10</b> by engaging the clamping screw onto the bar.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrate examples of different flexibility levels of the support, apparatus <b>1</b>, achieved by different positions of the bar <b>30</b> in relation to the spring structure <b>10</b> and the attachment element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>the bar <b>30</b> does not prevent movement of the spring structure <b>10</b>, the spring may bend throughout its complete open area, to provide lateral or horizontal direction movement of the attachment element and the connected instrument (when in playing position) in relation to the bar <b>30</b>. This represents full flexibility setting of the support apparatus <b>1</b>, i.e. the support apparatus allows the greatest range of movement (of the attachment element in relation to the bar) when in this setting. The example indicates direction A, which may illustrate a direction of the musician leaning forward or backward when in the playing position and using the wind instrument attached into the element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates middle position of the bar <b>30</b> with respect to the spring structure <b>10</b>, and medium flexibility position. In such a position, in accordance with the laws of physics, the spring structure cannot flex throughout its whole length. Rather, only the portion of the spring structure which is between the end of bar <b>30</b> and attachment element <b>20</b> may flex. Therefore, in such a position the spring will bend less in both the lateral and transverse directions, as the flexure of the spring is limited by the bar <b>30</b>. It is understood that the end of the bar <b>30</b> may be freely positioned anywhere within the spring structure, which allows for precise setting of the desired flexibility. In other words, the bar <b>30</b> may be adjusted in a continuous manner by positioning the end of the bar at any position within the spring structure <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present wind instrument support apparatus <b>1</b> facilitates in a beneficial manner that the instrument can better and genuinely move with upper body movement of the musician. The apparatus provides improved freedom of movement without or with reduced restraint or weight. This enables to substantially reduce limiting effect and feeling of the support to the musician in comparison to a conventional support, while still reducing burden on the musician's musculature and facilitating relaxed playing. Hence, improved ergonomics are provided, which reduces the risk of injury due to e.g. long-term repetitive strain.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The attachment element <b>20</b> may comprise a channel <b>23</b>, illustrated by broken line, for receiving the support bar through the spring structure to suppress the flexibility of the attachment element in relation to the support bar. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>the bar <b>30</b> is inserted into the channel <b>23</b> of the attachment element <b>20</b>. In this position the spring does not bend and the bar in the channel prevents relative movement between the element <b>20</b> and the bar. The musician may select this position when no (lateral) flexibility of the support is desired. However, in such a position the support apparatus <b>1</b> still has flexibility in the vertical direction, illustrated by arrow B, providing softer support for the instrument.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The at least one spring of the spring structure <b>10</b> may be of metal, e.g. steel, or another appropriate material of thickness facilitating to achieve desired flexibility, and capable of maintaining its properties during use of the apparatus <b>1</b> supporting the weight of the instrument and continued bending of the instrument in relation to the bar <b>30</b>. Some examples of spring types are coiled springs, helical springs, cantilever springs, volute springs, and cushion-type springs. Leaf springs may be elliptic, semi-elliptic, parabolic or other types of leaf spring. For example, a coiled spring of steel wire having diameter between 1-3 mm, such as 2 mm, may be applied. The spring may be attached to the attachment element <b>20</b> and/or the sleeve <b>12</b> by adhesive bonding, soldering, welding, or another suitable joining method.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bar <b>30</b>, sleeve <b>12</b>, and/or the clamping screw <b>11</b> may be of steel or plastic, for example. The bar may have diameter between 0.5-1.0 cm, such as 0.6, 0.7, or 0.8 mm, for example. The spring structure <b>10</b> may have length (B direction) in the range of 25-75 mm, in some further embodiments between 60-75 mm, such as 70 mm, for example. Outside diameter of the spring structure <b>10</b> may be between 12-25 mm, in some embodiments between 15-21 mm, such as 18 mm, for example. The number of coils may be between 5-10, such as 7, for example. The B direction length of the sleeve <b>12</b> may be e.g. in the range of 0.5-3 cm. For example, when in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, the bar <b>30</b> may be around 1 cm inside the sleeve. It will be appreciated that dimensioning of the spring structure, e.g. the steel wire diameter, may be selected based on type and weight of the instrument for which the support is optimized (e.g. an oboe may weight around 0.7-0.8 kg, whereas some saxophones may weight around 1.5 kg.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It will be understood that different lengths of the apparatus and the bar <b>30</b> can be used to provide instrument stands adapted for players of different heights or having different playing styles. In some embodiments, the length of apparatus <b>1</b> is adjustable, by the length of the bar being adjustable, or by having a further leg portion with adjustable length. A telescopic leg portion or sliding shafts with a twist locking mechanism for selecting a desired length can be utilized.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another side view of the apparatus <b>1</b>, indicating also movement direction C, facilitated by the spring structure <b>10</b> for the attachment element <b>20</b> in relation to the bar <b>30</b>. This direction may illustrate a direction of the musician leaning sideward back and forth when in the playing position and using the wind instrument attached into the element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The apparatus <b>1</b> may further comprise a flexible tube at or within the elastic portion. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, such flexible tube <b>40</b> may be positioned inside the spring structure <b>10</b>, and the support bar <b>30</b> is movable inside the flexible tube. The tube may thus prevent the bar <b>30</b> to directly touch the spring structure, which may cause resonance vibration and/or sound which may be detrimental for the quality of the music being produced by the instrument. The tube may be of plastic, rubber, or another suitable material.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the attachment element <b>20</b> comprises a slot <b>21</b> for receiving a fastener of the instrument, such as a neck support mounting ring of the instrument. A clamping device, and a switch or a push element <b>22</b> is arranged to releasably engage the fastener inside the slot <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The attachment element <b>20</b> can be considered as penguin-shape, but it will be appreciated that various other shapes may be applied. The attachment element may be made of plastic, and the clamping device may comprise steel, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates a top view from above the attachment element <b>20</b>, in a closed position of the clamping device, in which the instrument may be locked into the support apparatus <b>10</b>. A spring may maintain a locking pin <b>24</b>, in the present example of U- or J-shape, in a locking slot <b>25</b> and occupying the slot <b>21</b> when no pushing force is applied to the push element <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates the clamping device in its open position. Thus, when the musician pushes the push element <b>22</b>, the pin <b>24</b> is removed from the locking slot <b>25</b> and further from the slot <b>21</b>, thereby opening the slot <b>21</b> to receive or release the fastener of the instrument. Hence, attachment and detachment is very easy, simply by pushing the button <b>22</b>. However, it will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrated some example options and that various other attachment mechanisms may be applied in the attachment element close to the spring structure <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The apparatus <b>1</b> may further comprise a fastener to fasten a neck strap or other type of further support (not shown). The fastener may be attached to the sleeve <b>12</b> and may comprise a ring, for example. A neck support may be preferred by some musicians, to provide further stability and touch for controlling the instrument. Such further fastener does not affect functioning of the upper spring structure as such.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The apparatus <b>1</b> and the bar <b>30</b> thereof may further comprise or be connected to a further support unit. The further support unit may form other end of the complete wind instrument support structure and be held against chair or musician leg(s) during a playing position. Various structures are available for the further support unit and for engaging the bar <b>30</b> to the further support unit. In an example embodiment, the further support unit comprises a hollow portion into which the other end of the bar <b>30</b> is inserted, and a fastening mechanism, e.g. a thumb wheel, to engage the bar to the support unit at desired position. The overall desired height position of the instrument may be thus adjusted by the further support, and the spring structure <b>10</b> next to the attachment element <b>20</b> and close to the instrument provides the flexibility and freedom of movement for musician at upper portion of the entire support structure. An end portion of rubber of other non-slip, high friction material may be included to enable non-slipping support.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another example embodiment, the further support unit comprises a (male/female) threaded portion at one end and the bar <b>30</b> comprises a (female/male) threaded portion in a hollow portion at the end of the bar <b>30</b>, which allows the further support unit to be inserted into the end of the bar <b>30</b> and fastened therein by tightening the further support unit to the bar <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The apparatus may further comprise a further elastic portion, or suspension element, to provide flexibility in vertical direction (illustrated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>) during playing of the attached instrument. The suspension element may be arranged in the bar <b>30</b> or connected to the bar. In an example embodiment, the suspension element is arranged in the further support unit. For example, the unit may comprise a spring into which the bar <b>30</b> may be inserted and fastened. Similar fastening mechanism may be applied as at the other end for adjusting the relation to the spring structure <b>20</b>, including a sleeve and a clamping screw, for example.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a still further example, the spring structure <b>10</b> may comprise a conical spring, and/or a spring with coils having at least two different distances between coils distances, i.e. differing coil density.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is to be understood that the embodiments of the invention disclosed are not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but are extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts.
