relates to a battery module and a battery pack including the same, and more specifically, to a battery module having improved cooling performance and a battery pack including the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As technology development and demands for mobile devices increase, the demand for batteries as energy sources is rapidly increasing. In particular, a secondary battery has attracted considerable attention as an energy source for power-driven devices, such as an electric bicycle, an electric vehicle, and a hybrid electric vehicle, as well as an energy source for mobile devices, such as a mobile phone, a digital camera, a laptop computer and a wearable device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Small-sized mobile devices use one or several battery cells for each device, whereas middle- or large-sized devices such as vehicles require high power and large capacity. Therefore, a middle or large-sized battery module in which a large number of battery cells are electrically connected is used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Preferably, the middle or large-sized battery module is manufactured so as to have as small a size and weight as possible. For this reason, a prismatic battery, a pouch-shaped battery or the like, which can be stacked with high integration and has a small weight relative to capacity, is usually used as a battery cell of the middle or large-sized battery module. Meanwhile, in order to protect the battery cell stack from external impact, heat or vibration, the battery module may include a housing in which a front surface and rear surface are opened to house the battery cell stack in an internal space.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a conventional battery module. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a state in which the components constituting the battery module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are combined.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the conventional battery module <b>10</b> includes a battery cell stack <b>12</b> in which a plurality of battery cells <b>11</b> are stacked in one direction, a housing <b>20</b> for the battery cell stack <b>12</b>, an end plate <b>15</b> for covering the front and rear surfaces of the battery cell stack, and busbar frames <b>13</b> formed between the end plate <b>15</b> and the front and rear surfaces of the battery cell stack <b>12</b>. The housing <b>20</b> includes a lower frame <b>30</b> for covering the lower and both side surfaces of the battery cell stack <b>12</b>, and an upper plate <b>40</b> for covering the upper surface of the battery cell stack <b>12</b>. The battery module <b>10</b> can cool heat generated in the battery cell stack <b>12</b> because a thermally conductive resin layer <b>31</b> is coated onto the bottom surface of the lower frame <b>30</b> that covers the lower portion of the battery cell stack <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">At this time, the thermally conductive resin layer <b>31</b> can perform the role of fixing the battery cell stack <b>12</b> inside the battery module while transferring heat generated in the battery cell stack <b>12</b> to the outside of the battery module <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the cutting line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the conventional battery module <b>10</b> has a structure that cools the lower portion of the battery cell stack <b>12</b>, which is a structure in which the heat generated from the battery cell <b>11</b> flows in a first cooling direction D<b>1</b> toward the lower portion. However, since the thermally conductive resin layer <b>31</b> is formed only at a position corresponding to the lower portion of the battery cell stack <b>12</b>, the portion of the battery cell <b>11</b>, which is close to the thermally conductive resin layer <b>31</b>, has a low temperature, but the portion of the battery cell <b>11</b>, which is far from the thermally conductive resin layer, has a high temperature, thereby causing a temperature difference inside the battery cell <b>11</b>. In particular, the temperature rises in the direction toward the upper portion and both end portions of the battery cell <b>11</b>, and the temperature decreases in the direction toward the lower portion and the central portion of the battery cell <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, as a positive electrode and a negative electrode are located at both end portions of the battery cell <b>11</b>, the both end portions generate a relatively large amount of heat compared to the central portion during the charging/discharging process of the battery module <b>10</b>. However, the thermally conductive resin layer <b>31</b> located at the lower portion of the battery cell <b>11</b> does not sufficiently and quickly cool heat generated at both end portions of the battery cell <b>11</b> since only the heat transferred from both end portions of the battery cell <b>11</b> to the bottom portion is cooled. In particular, considering that the temperature of the battery cell <b>11</b> is one of the factors limiting the output of the battery, a local temperature rise occurring in the battery cell <b>11</b> is highly likely to limit the output of the battery at an early stage and thus, there is a need to improve the above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE

Thereby, the battery module <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment can evenly inject the second thermally conductive resin layer <b>160</b> in a direction corresponding to the first direction, as compared with a structure that is injected and formed by one injection hole.
