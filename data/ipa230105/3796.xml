electrical circuit. Electrical switching devices all consist of sets of contacts that open and close when the device is activated. Switching devices are operated in a variety of ways, from the simplest of which are manual switches such as the domestic light switch to more complex switches used in industrial applications. In such cases, switching devices can be operated using an electromagnetic coil as inductor element with magnetic sensing elements to activate the switch.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples of such applications include, but are not limited to, commercial aviation, space flight, military applications and industrial processes, where reliability of the state of the switching device is demanded to ensure continued performance of equipment in the event of a partial failure. Such stringent requirements are demanded because of the potential consequences of failure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is therefore a need for a switching device having high reliability of the state of the switching device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This summary is provided to introduce concepts related to the present inventive subject matter.

Furthermore, any examples described herein are intended to aid in understanding the principles of the invention, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.

The switching device SD further comprises a printed circuit board PCB secured to the housing, a first magnetic sensing element MSE<b>1</b> and a second magnetic sensing element MSE<b>2</b> linked to the printed circuit board PCB.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The moveable element ME is slidably mounted in the housing and adapted to move relative to the housing between a resting position and an engaged position. To that end, the housing HS comprises a slot in which the moveable element is slidably guided.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The printed circuit board PCB is secured to the housing and comprises an upper face on which are mounted upfront the first magnetic sensing element MSE<b>1</b> and the second magnetic sensing element MSE<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The printed circuit board PCB further comprises a microcontroller MCU able to communicate to an interface of a host computing unit that can take action based on feedback provided by the microcontroller MCU.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is assumed that the first magnetic sensing element MSE<b>1</b> is well aligned with the first magnet C<b>1</b> and that the second magnetic sensing element MSE<b>2</b> is well aligned with the second magnet C<b>2</b>. With this architecture, the first magnetic sensing element MSE<b>1</b> and the second magnetic sensing element MSE<b>2</b> can be excited respectively by the first magnet C<b>1</b> and the second magnet C<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the switching device is operated, by a human for example, the header is pressed towards direction P, i.e. towards the printed circuit board, the first magnet C<b>1</b> and the second magnet C<b>2</b> get closer respectively to the first magnetic sensing element MSE<b>1</b> and the second magnetic sensing element MSE<b>2</b> which by magnetism principles, increases the magnetic flux through the magnetic sensing elements and changes the status of the switching device if a threshold is reached. This implies that the status of the switching device relates to the magnitude of the magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the switching device is part of a button like a push button or a selector. In all cases, an action of an operator on the button (a push or a rotation of the button) will lead to a translation of the header and the magnets towards the magnetic sensing elements.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is illustrated the principle of operation of the switching device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first magnet C<b>1</b> and the second magnet C<b>2</b> produce respectively a first magnetic field F<sub>1 </sub>and a second magnetic field F<sub>2 </sub>that interact respectively with the first sensing element MSE<b>1</b> and the second magnetic sensing element MSE<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first magnetic sensor and the second magnetic sensor modify their respective output signals S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>in agreement with a first magnetic field F<sub>1 </sub>and a second magnetic field F<sub>2 </sub>that have been sensed. These output signals are read by the microcontroller MCU and treated to determine the state of the switching device or whether there is a faulty condition.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The switching device implements opposite magnetic poles between the two redundant input channels of the switching device, i.e. the first magnet C<b>1</b> and the second magnet C<b>2</b>. Regarding the direction P, the first magnet C<b>1</b> presents a south magnetic pole &#x201c;S&#x201d; above a north magnetic pole &#x201c;N&#x201d;, whereas the second magnet C<b>2</b> presents a north magnetic pole &#x201c;N&#x201d; above a south magnetic pole &#x201c;S&#x201d;. This opposite configuration allows the switching device being robust against external perturbations since external magnetic perturbation would mostly affect both magnetic sensors with the same polarity.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, due to the opposed pole configuration, there is a consistent and repeatable pattern to determine whether the state of the switching device has been changed or not, which cannot be obtained by an external perturbation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Due to the architecture of the switching device, in one embodiment it is assumed that the first magnetic field F<sub>1 </sub>generated by the first magnet C<b>1</b> is reversed and equal in magnitude with respect to the second magnetic field F<sub>2 </sub>generated by the second magnet C<b>2</b>. It can be the case especially if the first magnet C<b>1</b> and the second magnet C<b>2</b> have the same properties. It follows that in normal condition of operation, i.e. without magnetic perturbation, the first output signal S<sub>1 </sub>and the second output signal S<sub>2 </sub>should have similar properties as the first magnetic field F<sub>1 </sub>and the second magnetic field F<sub>2</sub>: depending on the chosen coordinate system, the first output signal S<sub>1 </sub>should be reversed and equal in magnitude with respect to the second output signal S<sub>2</sub>. Thus it is assumed that the sum of the first output signal and the second output signal is substantially equal to zero.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another embodiment, the first magnetic field F<sub>1 </sub>generated by the first magnet C<b>1</b> is reversed but not equal in magnitude with respect to the second magnetic field F<sub>2 </sub>generated by the second magnet C<b>2</b>. It can be the case especially if the first magnet C<b>1</b> and the second magnet C<b>2</b> do not have the same properties. It follows that in normal condition of operation, the first output signal S<sub>1 </sub>and the second output signal S<sub>2</sub>. should have similar properties as the first magnetic field F<sub>1 </sub>and the second magnetic field F<sub>2</sub>: depending on the chosen coordinate system, the first output signal S<sub>1 </sub>should be reversed in magnitude with respect to the second output signal S<sub>2</sub>. Thus it is assumed that the sum of the first output signal and the second output signal is substantially equal to a predefined value derived from the difference between the magnitude of the first magnetic field and the magnitude of the second magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The output signal may be under different types and the behavior of the output signal with respect to the corresponding magnetic field may depend on the type of the output signal. It is considered that the output signal of a magnetic sensing element must be omni-polar, implying that the magnetic sensing element can detect and differentiate north from south poles.
