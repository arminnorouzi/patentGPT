In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present application. However, it is apparent to the person skilled in the art that the present application may be practiced without some of these specific details. The following description of the embodiments is merely to provide a better understanding of the present application by illustrating examples of the present application. In the accompanying drawings and the following description, at least some well-known structures and techniques are not shown in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present application; and the dimensions of some structures may be exaggerated for clarity. Further, the features, structures, or characteristics described below may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be noted that, in the present application, relational terms such as first and second are only used to distinguish one entity or operation from another entity or operation, and do not necessarily require or imply any actual relationship between these entities or operations or any sequence among them. Moreover, the terms &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;include&#x201d; or any other variations thereof are intended to encompass a non-exclusive inclusion such that a process, method, article or device that includes a list of elements includes not only these listed elements, but also includes other elements not explicitly listed or elements inherent to the process, method, article or device. Without further limitations, an element defined by the phrase &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; does not preclude the presence of additional identical elements in the process, method, article, or device that includes said element.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Taking the end effector carrying an electric oscillating saw for assisting osteotomy as an example, the process of a saw blade of the electric oscillating saw entering a standby position from any current position and entering an osteotomy position from the standby position, is called as position moving. After the mechanical arm moves until the saw blade is brought into the osteotomy position, the freedom of movement of the mechanical arm is limited in the osteotomy plane, so that the saw blade can only move in the locked plane; then the electric oscillating saw is powered on, and the doctor pushes the mechanical arm to control the saw blade in contact with the affected bone. After completing the osteotomy at one position, the saw blade of the electric oscillating saw moves to the next osteotomy position and the osteotomy is continued. During the above process, the monitor can display in real time the relative position between the digital three-dimensional models of the saw blade and the affected bone, as well as other prompt information for reference by professional physicians. The above operations are all completed by the professional physicians to ensure the control over the osteotomy. The professional physicians need to pay great attention when performing osteotomies to avoid cutting into soft tissue. For doctors who are not familiar with the operation or who have just completed the osteotomy for one time with high attention, they may need to think hard to think of the next operation to be performed on the mechanical arm, resulting in an unsmooth operation process and increased operation time.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present application provides a motion control method for a mechanical arm, which can optimize the operation process. A terminal end of the mechanical arm is adapted to carry an effector, the effector may be an electric driving device and can carry a tool such as a drill or a saw. The motion control method includes steps of: receiving a first control command from a first input device by a graphical user interface, wherein the first control command is configured to control the mechanical arm to move according to a first movement mode; receiving a second control command from a first input device or a second input device by the graphical user interface, wherein the second control command is configured to control the mechanical arm to enter a second movement mode; and inputting a third control command through the second input device, wherein the third control command is configured to control the effector to perform a predetermined movement, and the first input device and the second input device are separated from each other or are provided to be separable from each other.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the above control method, the first input device and the second input device may be arranged within control ranges of different operators as required. For example, the first operator controls the first input device for input, and the second operator controls the second input device for input. This allows different characters to make different inputs, so as to control the mechanical arm to perform different actions at different stages, and each character can only focus on the input required by itself, without the need to be familiar with the input operations of the whole process, thereby providing a possibility to improve the fluency of the process. Moreover, the existing graphical user interface can be used to provide an input interface, and the operator can refer to the text and graphic prompts of the graphical user interface during the input process, thereby facilitating the accurate input.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a surgical operation using a mechanical arm, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref> show flowcharts of a motion control method for a mechanical arm provided by embodiments of the present application, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram of a graphical user interface provided by the embodiments of the present application.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The motion control method for a mechanical arm provided by the embodiments of the present application can be applied to a mechanical arm of a surgical system, and for the convenience of description, the embodiments of the present application take a total knee arthroplasty surgery as an example for description.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the patient is lying on an operating table P, a terminal end of a mechanical arm AM is equipped with an end effector E, and a distal end of the end effector E is equipped with an oscillating saw K, which can perform cutting operations. The terminal end of the mechanical arm AM is located near the patient's affected part. A control computer A is arranged at a position further away from the operating table P, and the control computer A includes an image display device I and input devices such as a keyboard and mouse, for displaying required information and providing a graphical user interface. The first operator may stand at a position beside the operating table P, and also beside the mechanical arm AM to directly touch and operate the mechanical arm. An input device (not shown in the figure) can be arranged near the position where the first operator stands, and the input device can be a second input device <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which may be a mechanical foot operating device, and may include a main button <b>23</b>, an upper left button <b>21</b> and an upper right key <b>22</b>. The second input device <b>20</b> is communicably connected with the control computer A via a cable. A second operator can be beside the control computer A and operate the control computer A in combination with the graphical user interface displayed by the display device I.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The total knee arthroplasty surgery generally requires six osteotomies at different positions on the knee joint, and before each osteotomy, the oscillating saw K needs to be coincident with a planned osteotomy plane. In some alignment methods, the mechanical arm is manually dragged to make the oscillating saw K coincide with the planned osteotomy plane. Specifically, the surgical system can obtain in real time a relative positional relationship between the oscillating saw K and the planned osteotomy plane and can visualize the relative positional relationship between the two (for example, display it in a digital three-dimensional model). The mechanical arm is manually dragged to move, and an orientation of the mechanical arm is adjusted with reference to the relative positional relationship displayed on the display device. After the display device shows that the alignment is realized, the mechanical arm is manually locked at the current position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the control method for a mechanical arm provided by the present application, the mechanical arm receives the first control command input through the first input device and moves according to the first movement mode, that is, the mechanical arm automatically moves from an initial position to an osteotomy position by means of its own power and navigation of the system navigation. After arriving at the osteotomy position, the mechanical arm receives the second control command from the second input device and enters a second movement mode, that is, a moving range of the terminal end of the mechanical arm is limited within one plane, the movement manner of the mechanical arm merely includes translation within this plane and rotation around a normal line of this plane, and the mechanical arm can be moved according to the above-mentioned movement manner when driven by an external force (such as the operator's push and pull).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, the first input device may be a mouse or a keyboard, which may be arranged beside the control computer A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and operated by the first operator. The first operator may be a physician assistant, a nurse, or an equipment controller. The first control command can be input to the control computer through a human-computer interaction interface, and then be sent to the mechanical arm by the control computer. More specifically, the control computer is an upper computer, the mechanical arm is directly controlled by an industrial computer as a lower computer, the first control command is sent by the upper computer to the lower computer, and the lower computer controls the mechanical arm to move. The graphical user interface may include a first control interface set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and the first control interface set includes: a first interface V<b>1</b> and a second interface V<b>2</b>. The first interface V<b>1</b> and the second interface V<b>2</b> are virtual buttons, and a cursor controlled by the mouse can click or hold down the virtual buttons to input commands, and predetermined control commands correspond to the operations of clicking or holding down. For example, the command corresponding to the operation &#x201c;hold down the first interface V<b>1</b>&#x201d; is the first control command, the movement corresponding to this command is that the terminal end of the mechanical arm AM moves according to a predetermined path, and on this basis, the operation &#x201c;release the first interface V<b>1</b>&#x201d; corresponds to a fourth control command of &#x201c;stop moving&#x201d;; or, the movement corresponding to the control command which corresponds to the operation &#x201c;click the first interface V<b>1</b>&#x201d; is that the terminal end of the mechanical arm AM moves according to a predetermined path, and on this basis, the control command corresponding to the operation &#x201c;click the second interface V<b>2</b>&#x201d; can control the mechanical arm to stop the current movement.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second input device may be a mechanical foot operating device, and the mechanical foot operating device includes a mechanical button. The second input device may be arranged beside the operating table P, to facilitate the person who controls the mechanical arm AM to operator with the foot thereof. When the mechanical arm AM reaches the osteotomy position, it receives the second control command input through the second input device, and enters the second movement mode. The person who operates the second input device to perform the input operation may be the person who directly pushes the mechanical arm AM, such as the chief surgeon. The specific operation may be to click a button on the mechanical foot operating device by foot, such as the upper left key <b>21</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In some optional embodiments, the graphical user interface receives the control command input through the first input device and controls the mechanical arm to enter the second movement mode. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the mechanical arm AM is made to move according to the first movement mode by holding down the first interface V<b>1</b> with the cursor manipulated by the mouse; after the mechanical arm AM is in place, the second interface V<b>2</b> is clicked by manipulating the cursor with the mouse, and the control computer receives the control command corresponding to this operation and controls the mechanical arm AM to enter the second movement mode.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the operator holds on the mechanical arm AM, the mechanical arm receives the third control command input through the second input device, and the effector E starts to perform a predetermined action, wherein the predetermined action is that the oscillating saw K starts to oscillate according to a predetermined frequency and amplitude. The person who operates the second input device to input the third control command may be the person who directly pushes the mechanical arm AM, such as the chief surgeon. The specific operation can be stepping on a button of the mechanical foot operating device, such as the main key <b>23</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. When the main key <b>23</b> is released, the control computer A can detect an electrical signal of this operation and send the control command corresponding to the signal to the mechanical arm AM, so as to control the effector E to stop the above-mentioned predetermined action. In some optional embodiments, the first control interface set is temporary, that is, it only appears when predetermined conditions are satisfied. For example, the first control interface appears only when the control computer receives a pre-control command. The pre-control command can also be received by the graphical user interface; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the graphical user interface includes a third interface V<b>0</b>, a first pre-control command is input by clicking the third interface V<b>0</b> with the mouse cursor, and a new control interface is generated in the graphical user interface, for example, optional buttons of &#x201c;assistant physician operation&#x201d; and &#x201c;professional physician operation&#x201d;. Then, a second pre-control command can be input by clicking the button of &#x201c;assistant physician operation&#x201d; through the mouse cursor, to call up the first interface V<b>1</b> and the second interface V<b>2</b>. In some other optional embodiments, the pre-control command may further be a signal that the execution of the third control command ends. In some other optional embodiments, when the mechanical arm executes the first control command, the end effector is configured to be unable to execute the third control command, so as to prevent the end effector from being turned on when the mechanical arm moves and causing danger.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The navigation system L includes a mechanical arm tracker arranged on the mechanical arm, a patient tracker arranged on the patient's body and a localizer. The patient tracer can indicate the orientation information of the planned osteotomy plane, the mechanical arm tracer can indicate the orientation information of the oscillating saw K, and the localizer can obtain the above-mentioned orientation information and transmit it to the control computer. The control computer controls the mechanical arm to move toward the osteotomy plane according to the predetermined path, and continuously compares the relative orientation relationship between the mechanical arm and the osteotomy plane during the movement of the mechanical arm until they coincide. The tracer includes at least three light sources with predetermined relative positions, and the light sources can be active light sources (such as light-emitting diodes) or passive light sources (such as infrared reflective balls). The localizer can be a binocular camera, which can receive a light signal of the tracer and locate spatial orientation information of the tracer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a motion control system for mechanical arm provided by embodiments of the present application, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a second input device provided by embodiments of the present application.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The motion control system for a mechanical arm is configured to control a movement of the mechanical arm, and a terminal end of the mechanical arm is adapted to carry an effector.
