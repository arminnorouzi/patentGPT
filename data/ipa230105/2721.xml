These disulfide bonds are important for protein stability and function. Conventional bacterial hosts for protein production have a reductive cytosol and thus are unable to form disulfide bonds in proteins expressed in the cytosol. As a result, currently many proteins cannot readily be expressed in bacterial cytosol and are instead expressed in eukaryotic or periplasmic expression systems. Although attempts to promote disulfide bond formation in bacterial cytosol have been made by introducing mutations into the bacterial host genome to disrupt reductive pathways, these efforts have yielded limited success. Thus, cytosolic production of disulfide-bonded proteins in bacteria remains a challenge.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.

Such oxidative cytoplasm is essential for maintaining the three-dimensional structure and stability of proteins having disulfide bonds. The invention provides a production system based on <i>E. coli </i>to produce a protein such as an antibody light chain (LC) with high yield.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Previously, a mutant <i>E. coli </i>strain (&#x201c;Shuffle&#x201d;) was generated. Lobstein et al., Microbial Cell Factories 2012, 11:56. This mutant strain lacks the thioredoxin reductase activity (TRXB) and glutathione reductase activity (GOR). The Shuffle also overexpresses a DsbC without its signal sequence and a variant of the ahpC gene (ahpC*) encoding an enzyme that lacks perioxireductase activity but has glutathione reductase activity. Shuffle was reported to show ability to produce correctly folded disulfide bonded proteins.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As compared to Shuffle, the <i>E. coli </i>strain disclosed herein have been further engineered so that it further lacks the thioredoxin 1 activity (TrxA). Thus, in some embodiments, the <i>E. coli </i>strain comprises null mutations in trxA, trxB, and gor. Consequently, the strain lacks the thioredoxin reductase activity (TrxB), thioredoxin 1 activity (TrxA), and glutathione reductase activity (GOR).

Glutathione is synthesized by the action of two enzymes: glutamate-cysteine ligase (gshA) and glutathione synthetase (gshB). Glutamate-cysteine ligase catalyzes the reaction between glutamic acid and cysteine to form &#x3b3;-glutamyl cysteine, which is subsequently conjugated to glycine by glutathione synthetase to form GSH.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A nucleic acid is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to another nucleic acid when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence.

This enzymatic complex (or system) scavenges oxygen and its derivatives. AhpC has been demonstrated to act as specific alkyl hydroperoxide-scavenging enzyme for protection against oxygen radical damage, though elimination of reactive nitrogen intermediates also has been demonstrated to occur.

In preferred embodiments, the mutated AphC protein retains the cysteine residue at position 165 as compared to the wild type AphC protein. These mutants can channel electrons into the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway, rather than the thioredoxin pathway.

These features of the disulfide-bonded proteins make them excellent therapeutic agents or targets for the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">In prokaryotic cells, disulfide bonds are formed when DsbA protein donates its disulfide bond to a newly synthesized polypeptide that comprises a disulfide bond in its native structure. The integral membrane protein DsbB generates disulfide bonds within itself, which are then transferred to DsbA. DsbC is a protein that catalyzes disulfide bond isomerization. In wild type <i>E. coli </i>strain, DsbC is exported to the periplasm and is thus unsuitable for production of cytoplasmic, disulfide-containing proteins. As disclosed herein, in some embodiments, the modified <i>E. coli </i>strain expresses a cytosolic prokaryotic disulfide isomerase, e.g., DsbC. This cytosolic DsbC protein is expressed without its signal sequence; as a result this DsbC protein remains in the cytoplasm to promote disulfide assembly of proteins of interest. In some eukaryotic cells, the major disulfide pathway is composed of the membrane-associated flavoprotein EroI and the soluble thioredoxin-like protein PDI. EroI, using a flavin cofactor to mediate the reoxidation of its cysteine pair by oxygen, generates disulfide bonds within itself, and then transfers the bonds to PDI.

A PCR amplicon was generated comprising an antibiotic resistance gene flanked by two FRT sites and homology extensions, (H1 and H2), which are homologous to the two ends of the gene to be knocked out. After transforming cells with this PCR product, the gene to be knocked out is then replaced by the antibiotic resistance gene through Red-mediated recombination in these flanking homology regions. After selection, the resistance gene can be eliminated using a helper plasmid expressing the FLP recombinase, which acts on the directly repeated FRT (FLP recognition target) sites flanking the resistance gene. The Red and FLP helper plasmid can be simply cured by growth at 37&#xb0; C. because they are temperature-sensitive replicons.

Promoters can be a medium strength promoter, weak strength promoter and strong promoter. The strength of a promoter can be measured as the amount of transcription of a gene product initiated at that promoter, relative to a suitable control. For constitutive promoters directing expression of a gene product in an expression construct, a suitable control could use the same expression construct, except that the &#x2018;wild-type&#x2019; version of the promoter, or a promoter from a &#x2018;housekeeping&#x2019; gene, is used in place of the promoter to be tested.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">In some embodiments, the promoter strength is determined by measuring the amount of transcripts from the promoter as compared to a control promoter.

The total RNA of the host cells and controls can be extracted and measured by absorbance at 260 nm. cDNA can then be synthesized from the equal amount of total RNA from the test host cells and the control host cells. RT-PCR can be performed to amplify the cDNA corresponding to the transcript produced from the promoter. An exemplary method is described in De Mey et al.

This is useful for maintaining an oxidative cytoplasm in the bacteria and establishing an alternative reduction pathway to ensure survival, vigor (growth rate). In one embodiment, the ahpC* gene is controlled by a Pc0 promoter, a medium strength promoter. Both the PL59 promoter (a weak promoter) and a WT gshA promoter (an intermediate strength promoter) can be used to direct the expression of gshA gene. In some embodiments, a strong promoter T7 is used to drive the expression of the protein of interest to ensure maximal yield. In some embodiments, the <i>E coli </i>strain expresses a recombinant T7 polymerase under the control of the paraBAD promoter, which allows tight regulation and control of the protein of interest, e.g., through the addition or absence of arabinose.

It is understood by one of skill in the art that sometimes knocking out a gene does not require completely abolishing its activity, thus for purpose of this disclosure, lacking an activity means the mutein loses 85-100% of the activity of the control protein, e.g., the wild type protein. The various muteins generated can be tested to confirm that they lack the activity of the wild type protein.

In one illustrative example; a standard assay mixture contains 0.1M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.13 mM bovine insulin in the absence or in the presence of the recombinant protein, and the reaction was initiated upon the addition of 1 mM dithiothreitol.

The soluble protein fraction that contain the LC is measured. A suitable <i>E. coli </i>strain will be able to express in a soluble form of at least 1 mg/100 mL of the LC. Methods for preparing a bacterial lysate and measuring the amount of protein expression (e.g., the expression of LC) in the lysate are well known. In some embodiments, the <i>E. coli </i>cells can be treated with a lysis agent to produce a lysate. Cytoplasmic proteins can be released by treating the lysate with enzymes, such as benzonase and egg white lysozyme. The insoluble protein fraction can be separated from the soluble fraction by e.g., centrifugation. The soluble protein fraction (containing the LC) can be collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of LC protein in the soluble protein fraction can then be quantified by e.g., densitometry.

Datsenko and Barry L. Wanner Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2000 Jun. 6; 97(12): 6640-6645. These methods allow exchange to occur at a specific site, as in the integration of the genes of interest that are to be knocked in and the excision of genes to be knocked out from it. Site specific recombination involves specific, inverted repeat sequences, e.g., the Cre-LoxP systems. For insertions, the integration cassette, was composed of the gene, e.g., DsbC (NP_417369), to be inserted adjacent to a selectable marker that is flanked by loxP sites. After the entire cassette was knocked onto the chromosome, the selectable marker gene was subsequently eliminated by transient exposure to Cre recombinase that was effected by electroporation by a plasmid encoding Cre recombinase, while leaving the gene of interest integrated in the genome. For knock outs, the deletion cassette, was composed of a selectable marker that is flanked by loxP sites. After the cassette was knocked onto the chromosome, the selectable marker gene was subsequently eliminated by transient exposure to Cre recombinase that was effected by electroporation by a plasmid encoding Cre recombinase.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 2. Production of Snuggle Strain</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0099">The background for all strains with oxidative cytoplasm is S97. This strain has all the mutations present in strain KGK10 (Knapp K G, Goerke A R and Swartz J, Biotechnol Bioeng. 2007 Jul. 1; 97(4):901-8) with ompT sensitive RF1 developed to facilitate NNAA incorporation in cell free protein synthesis systems, (Yin et al, Sci Rep. 2017 Jun. 8; 7(1):3026). In addition, this strain has a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase that has been chromosomally integrated under the control of the ParaBAD promoter for tightly controlled expression of proteins from the strong T7 promoter. Viability of all strains produced as described below were checked using a plate assay essentially as described in Ritz et al, Science, 2001, with the following modifications. Cells were plated directly on rich media plates after chromosomal modifications.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0100">Five additional mutations were introduced into the S97 strain. These mutations were responsible for the production of an alternative reductive pathway for small molecules which is required for viability in the absence of thioredoxin reductase or glutathione reductase. First, an ahpC variant was introduced by knocking in a mutant variant of ahpC gene, ahpC* into the Frt recombinase scar left in the tnaA locus from deletion of that gene. This gene was tested under the control of a weak promoter PL57 or a medium strength promoter Pc0. As shown in Table 2, as compared to the wild type ahpC gene, which encodes a wild type protein containing two phenylalanines at residues 36 and 37, the ahpC* encodes a mutein comprising three phenylalanines at this location. The ahpC* mutein loses peroxyreductase activity (as exhibited by the wild type ahpC protein), but gains glutathione reductase activity. ahpC&#x394;, has only one phenylalanine at this location and does not encode a functional peroxyreductase. The ahpC&#x394; mutant has been reported to restore growth to the mutant B strains of <i>E. coli </i>lacking trxB and gor, (&#x201c;B strain&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0101">Second, a gshA gene, which was previously deleted from a precursor strain of <i>E. coli</i>, was knocked into the trxB of the mutant strain generated above under the weak promoter PL59 or an intermediate strength WT gshA promoter. Viable combinations were obtained with either promoter. This had the simultaneous effect of completing the new AhpC*-glutathione reduction pathway, and eliminating the thioredoxin-mediated pathway. We anticipated that the expression levels for these proteins would be important for establishing a viable alternative reduction pathway.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0102">Viable combinations were achieved with gshA knock-ins with either PL59 or WT gshA promoter. However, only cells harboring ahpC* with the Pc0 promoter (as described in www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1134079) were viable, indicating that higher levels of this protein are crucial, while a wider concentration range of GshA is sufficient for growth. This strain produced above contained three different mutations, ahpC* and gshA knock-ins and trxB knockout, which is sufficient for producing an oxidative cytoplasm capable of disulfide formation.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0103">Third, a leaderless DsbC gene was knocked into the chromosome with a strong MTL promoter. The leaderless DsbC protein lacks a secretion signal peptide and functions as a disulfide isomerase in the cytoplasm, which promotes native disulfide assembly of cytoplasmic proteins. Thus, the strain so produced, with these three mutations, i.e., trxB knock out, DsbC knock-in and an ahpC* mutation, referred to as the &#x201c;Shuffle,&#x201d; was capable of LC folding assembly.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0104">The mutations required to produce Shuffle <i>E. coli</i>, although reported to have produce high titers of disulfide bonded mammalian proteins in other reports, did not lead to high level LC production here. A fourth mutation was thus introduced to solve the problem, by knocking out the thioredoxin 1 (TrxA). This mutation resulted in the desired LC strain capable of expressing all LC at high levels. Strains that lack any one of these modifications were not able to produce as much of the LCs. This new strain (&#x201c;419&#x201d; as shown in Table 2), having the all five mutations, named &#x201c;Snuggle&#x201d;, produced yields higher than previous &#x201c;Shuffle&#x201d; strains for production of disulfide bonded proteins. This result is particularly surprising given that the primary reductase for TrxA, TrxB, has already been deleted, and so TrxA should not have been functional as a cytoplasmic reductase.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0105">Disulfide bond formation and reduction is a dynamic process influenced by both pro-oxidative proteins and small molecules such as DsbA and O<sub>2 </sub>and pro-reductive proteins and small molecules such as cysteine and thioredoxin. Because of this, it is difficult to say how much activity of a given protein is required to produce a given phenotype. That being said, drastically lower LC production potential were observed for LCs that are difficult to produce when TrxB, TrxA, were present or when DsbC was not present. Such striking differences indicate that even a little trxA or trxB activity would likely be sufficient to disrupt the redox environment of the cytosol and LC folding to some extent. It is expected that for trxA or trxB, a protein expression or activity level &#x3e;25% of endogenous levels would cause deleterious effects. For 1DsbC, cytoplasmic concentration required for LC folding is less clear because Snuggle and Shuffle use different promoters for cytosolic DsbC production. Because this functions as a chaperone and disulfide isomerase it still probably requires overexpression of this protein, at levels at least 25% of that present in Snuggle.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0106">Seven <i>E. coli </i>strains, generated as described in Example 2, were confirmed to have the phenotypes listed in the Table 1, below:</p><p id="p-0113" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Strain phenotypes</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Shuffle</entry><entry>347</entry><entry>410</entry><entry>413</entry><entry>414</entry><entry>417</entry><entry>419</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>trxB delta</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>+</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(ahpC*,</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>gshA<sup>+</sup>)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>trxA delta</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>+</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>+</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Cyt.

For these samples, the commercially available Shuffle strain give reasonable production of soluble protein.

Surprisingly, the Sutro strain mutant (S417) with a genotype analogous to Shuffle including cytosolic DsbC and oxidative cytoplasm failed to express this LC at reasonable titers.

Mutant AHPC that Restore Growth in &#x394;GOR/TRXB Strains</heading><p id="p-0117" num="0110">The wild type AhpC protein is a peroxyreductase, containing two phenylalanines at residues 36 and 37. See the last row in Table 2. The mutation that restores growth in K12 based strains, AhpC* is shown at the third row in Table 2. The AhpC* mutant strain contained an additional phenylalanine residue inserted in between the two phenylalanines at residues 36 and 37. The ahpC mutant that is reported to restore growth to B strains, AhpC &#x394;, is shown in the middle. The ahpC mutant strain has only one phenylalanine as shown in Table 2; for convenience, residue 37 is shown as deleted but in principle the deletion could be assigned to either residue 36 or 37. During the production of the Snuggle strain, either mutant was introduced onto the chromosome of <i>E. coli </i>K12 derived cells with deletions in gor and trxB. Only the AhpC* mutant restored viability in these cells, which is believed to be because this strain has a K12 lineage.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="11"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="11" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="11" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="11" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>amino</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>acid #</entry><entry>34</entry><entry>35</entry><entry>36</entry><entry/><entry>37</entry><entry>38</entry><entry>39</entry><entry>40</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="11" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Strain</entry><entry>AhpC </entry><entry>ammo</entry><entry>Ser</entry><entry>Val</entry><entry>Phe</entry><entry/><entry>Phe</entry><entry>Phe</entry><entry>Tyr</entry><entry>Pro</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>mutant</entry><entry>acid</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>K12 &#x394;gor/trxB</entry><entry>ahpC*</entry><entry/><entry>AGC</entry><entry>GTC</entry><entry>TTC</entry><entry>TTC</entry><entry>TTC</entry><entry>TTC</entry><entry>TAC</entry><entry>CCG</entry></row><row><entry>BL21 &#x394;gor/trxB</entry><entry>ahpC&#x394;</entry><entry/><entry>AGC</entry><entry>GTC</entry><entry>TTC</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>TTC</entry><entry>TAC</entry><entry>CCG</entry></row><row><entry>WT B and K12</entry><entry>WT</entry><entry/><entry>AGC</entry><entry>GTC</entry><entry>TTC</entry><entry/><entry>TTC</entry><entry>TTC</entry><entry>TAC</entry><entry>CCG</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="11" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0119" num="0111">The AhpC mutant was analyzed to determine whether it had glutathione reductase activity based on its ability to convert oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into reduced glutathione (GSH).
