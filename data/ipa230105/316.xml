Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The Invention is in the field of ultrasound imaging add-on equipment for endoscopes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Endoscopic ultrasound has undergone a rapid pace of development, now being used for the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of medical problems. As an endoscope can reach a location in the intestinal tract, closer than any skin surface, there is an opportunity to image from a closer location, and to obtain a tissue sample, using a biopsy needle and implement a variety of treatments. But due to an expense of greater than $<b>300</b>,<b>000</b> for a complete system, endoscopic ultrasound systems are generally restricted to major hospitals. Endoscopes, however, are used in physicians' offices, most outpatient surgery centers and virtually all hospitals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One type of endoscope is an upper endoscope, used to image and take tissue specimens from the upper GI tract. In this type of endoscope, if a needle is used to collect a specimen, it is typically advanced straight out of an endoscope lumen in a distal direction. Other types of endoscopes are bronchoscopes for viewing air passageways in the lungs and colonoscopes for viewing the colon. Yet another type of endoscope is a duodenoscope, designed to be introduced into the duodenum (the upper part of the small intestines), and typically used to perform endoscope retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in which the ducts of the pancreas and liver are imaged. Duodenoscopes are also used to gather tissue biopsies from sites in the duodenum, including the bile ducts. Duodenoscopes typically have a tip that houses a light, a video camera, and an instrument guide that can be tilted by an operator to control the angle at which the instrument (needle or other type of instrument) advances. Although the video camera and light can produce imagery that may help the endoscopist visualize potential targets directly, ultrasound imagery, when available, provides a different, dramatically expanded view of the regional anatomy. An ultrasound add-on for endoscopes has been described, but its capabilities are limited in that the viewing angle of the imaging head cannot be adjusted, and it does not provide for tissue sampling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem faced by practitioners in the field of endoscopy is the thorough disinfection of the endoscope, between uses. As many endoscopes, in particular duodenoscopes, have some mechanical complexity, introducing a sterilizing material into the small spaces defined by these mechanisms, creates a huge challenge. Recently, an endoscope mechanism, having an instrument angle adjustment mechanism that is removable and disposable has been introduced, addressing many of these issues.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first separate aspect, the present invention may take the form of an ultrasonic endoscope assembly, having an endoscope defining one or more lumens, and a needle that can be pushed forward out of a lumen, to collect a biopsy specimen. An ultrasound sub-assembly is attached to the endoscope and includes a communications cable, including a set of signal pathways, and having a distal end and an ultrasound imaging head connected to the distal end of the cable. Also, included is an imaging head movement sub-assembly, including a conduit that is releasably connected to the endoscope. The conduit contains a tension member that is releasably connected to the imaging head. Accordingly, the imaging head movement sub-assembly can be released from the endoscope and the imaging head, to be processed separately, after use.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a second separate aspect, the present invention may take the form of an endoscope add-on assembly adapted to be attached to a target endoscope. The assembly includes an ultrasound imaging sub-assembly, including a communications cable connected to an ultrasound imaging head and an imaging head movement sub-assembly, including a conduit, holding a tension member that is attached to the ultrasound imaging head. Further included are connective elements, adapted to permit the endoscope add-on assembly to be attached to the target endoscope.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Finally, the imaging head movement sub-assembly is detachable from the ultrasound imaging sub-assembly, thereby permitting the imaging head movement subassembly to be processed separately from the ultrasound imaging sub-assembly, after use.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Exemplary embodiments are illustrated in referenced drawings.

Assembly <b>14</b> also includes an ultrasound imaging (also referred to as &#x201c;transducer&#x201d;) head <b>20</b> that is electrically connected to a multiple signal pathway cable <b>22</b> by way of a flex circuit <b>50</b> (which is also a form of a signal pathway cable), that includes a set of parallel electrical leads, which may be traces. Cable <b>22</b>, which has a multiplicity of signal pathways extending therethrough terminates in a connector <b>24</b>, adapted to connect to an imaging station. Elements <b>16</b>, which may be rubber bands, or some other form of elastic bands or clips, help to retain cable <b>22</b>, to the side of endoscope <b>12</b>. A tension member <b>30</b>, such as a wire (which may also have some compressive strength) is attached to a fixation point <b>32</b> on ultrasound imaging head <b>20</b> and extends through a lumen <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to emerge outside of a port <b>36</b> on the proximal end of endoscope <b>12</b>, to be manipulated. In embodiments, tension member <b>30</b>, does not extend through lumen <b>34</b>, but extends along the side of endoscope <b>12</b>, and in some embodiments is retained by elements <b>16</b>, which are modified from the simple shapes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to include eyelets, to create a guide path for tension member <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, tension member <b>30</b> is connected to controls on the proximal end of endoscope <b>12</b>, to facilitate manipulation. In embodiments, these controls may take the form of a spool, that can be easily let out, or drawn in. Endoscope <b>12</b> also is equipped with intrinsic controls for deflecting the tip of the insertion tube, to facilitate introduction to a site of interest.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an alternative embodiment, tension member <b>30</b> is replaced by a tension member extending along the exterior of the endoscope, to a fixation point on the end of the endoscope. A physician may exert traction or pulsion on tension member <b>30</b> in any one of a variety of ways, to cause ultrasound imaging head <b>20</b> to bend forward or back toward retaining element <b>18</b>, as permitted by a resiliently flexible neck <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In one method a rotatable element is used to draw in tension member <b>30</b> or push it out.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In preferred embodiment endoscope <b>12</b> includes an element at its distal end to guide the alignment of the retaining element <b>18</b>. For example, endoscope <b>12</b> many include a groove at its distal end, into which a key element on retaining element <b>18</b> engages. In another embodiment, an orientation guide includes a peg that fits into the lumen <b>34</b> and is used to guide the correct orientation of retaining element <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, assembly <b>14</b> is made for intended disposal, after a single use, and is used in this manner. In another embodiment, assembly <b>14</b> is constructed so as to be prepared and/or cleaned appropriately for reuse, after use, and then reused. Although until recently generally disinfection procedures were deemed adequate, the detection of instances of the spread of infection through endoscope has given rise to the use of high-end disinfection techniques for endoscopes. These disinfection techniques make use of chemicals to kill any pathogens left on the scope after use. Other disinfection or sterilization techniques may be used, including processing using of UV light and/or a gas, such as ozone. In the context of this application, the term &#x201c;cleaning&#x201d; encompasses all disinfection and sterilization techniques. Generally, the materials used in endoscopes are such that autoclaving an endoscope, or an attachment thereto is not feasible.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, a flex circuit <b>50</b>, which passes through the flexible neck <b>38</b>, electrically connects imaging head <b>20</b> to cable <b>22</b>. Flex circuit <b>50</b> has an electrical lead for each transducer element in an ultrasound element array <b>52</b>, resident in the ultrasound imaging head <b>20</b>, to drive ultrasound element array <b>52</b> and relay signals from it. Array <b>52</b> is covered with a protective coating <b>53</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). In an alternative preferred embodiment, flex circuit <b>50</b> extends from imaging head <b>20</b> to (or through) connector <b>24</b>, may define a plurality of coax cables and may directly contact the elements of the ultrasound array <b>52</b>. In another alternative embodiment, cable <b>22</b> comprises a set of coax cable bound together with an adherent and protective substance, such as a polymer, and extends from connector <b>24</b> to imaging head <b>20</b>. In yet another embodiment, a fiber optic cable is used in place of cable <b>22</b>, with light to electric convertors at its distal end. In any one of these arrangements elements <b>22</b> and <b>50</b> could be termed separately or in combination as a multiple signal pathway cable.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a preferred embodiment, a biopsy needle <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>), which forms the sharpened, distal portion of a long, flexible, hollow-core wire, is provided. This wire is sheathed in a flexible conduit (not shown), thin enough to extend through the lumen <b>34</b> and protecting endoscope <b>12</b> from being damaged by needle <b>60</b>. Once the conduit reaches the distal end of endoscope <b>12</b>, it may be pushed out to extend from lumen <b>34</b>, and provide further guidance for needle <b>60</b>, which is pushed out of the conduit at a point distal to the end of endoscope <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the conduit may be pushed roughly to the end of lumen <b>34</b>, with the needle <b>60</b> pushed out of the conduit at that point. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in an alternative preferred embodiment tension member <b>30</b> extends through a channel <b>33</b> in retaining element <b>18</b> to reach fixation point <b>32</b>. This figure also shows a needle <b>60</b> that has been pushed through a lumen of the endoscope <b>12</b> and is emerging from the distal end of the lumen. An aperture <b>40</b> is defined in neck <b>38</b>, corresponding to an aperture in flex circuit <b>50</b>, aligned with aperture <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an embodiment that is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, but instead with tension member <b>30</b> extending through a pair of eyelets <b>35</b>, supported on the retaining element <b>18</b>. As well as showing a slightly different embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> also shows imaging head <b>20</b> retracted and needle <b>60</b> extending through aperture <b>40</b>, as it would be in order to take a biopsy. Notably, in this position the needle would be within the field of view of ultrasound array <b>52</b>. In embodiments, tension member <b>30</b> can pull head <b>20</b> into an obtuse angle, relative to the distal end of the endoscope <b>12</b>. Generally, aperture <b>40</b> is in the shape of a long oval, so that the needle <b>60</b> can pass through it over a long range of degree of bending of neck <b>38</b>. In another preferred embodiment, the flexible conduit is extended distally from lumen <b>34</b> into a v-shaped indentation (not shown) on surface of flexible neck <b>38</b>, aligning the conduit so that the needle <b>60</b> is aligned to pass through aperture <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To use imaging assembly <b>10</b>, ultrasound assembly <b>14</b> is attached to endoscope <b>12</b> by means of retaining element <b>18</b>. In an alternative embodiment, rubber bands or clips <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) retain cable <b>22</b> to the side of endoscope <b>12</b>. Imaging head <b>20</b> is then delivered to an area of interest, by means of standard endoscope introduction techniques. Imaging head <b>20</b> may then be moved to gain imagery of the area of interest by dedicated controls which control the ultrasound imaging head <b>20</b> deflection. If there appears to be a finding to be sampled, needle <b>60</b> may be introduced through an endoscope lumen and through aperture <b>40</b> and used to take a biopsy, inject a drug, or otherwise effect a medical procedure. Finally, needle <b>60</b> is retracted through the lumen of endoscope <b>12</b> and the endoscope is retrieved from the patient's body. In other embodiments, needle <b>60</b> is not included and an assembly that is similar to imaging assembly <b>10</b> but without needle <b>60</b> and related elements, is used for imaging alone, or for introduction of some other device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>13</b></figref> show an alternative embodiment <b>70</b> of the assembly <b>10</b>, with the further innovation of a disposable head-movement sub-assembly <b>72</b>, which includes a head clip <b>74</b>, a movement cable <b>76</b>, a cable clip <b>78</b> and a conduit <b>80</b>, holding the major portion of movement cable <b>76</b>. A clip-hold <b>84</b> is defined on the back of imaging head <b>20</b>&#x2032;. Further, the cable clip <b>78</b> holds imaging head and other portions of the ultrasound assembly <b>14</b>&#x2032;, including communicative cable <b>22</b>&#x2032;, to the endoscope <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>12</b></figref> show engagement of head clip <b>74</b> to clip-hold <b>84</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows head clip <b>74</b> distal to and being pulled back onto clip-hold <b>84</b>, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> showing head clip <b>74</b> engaged to clip-hold <b>84</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> showing different sectional views of head clip <b>74</b> and clip-hold <b>84</b> engaged together.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another difference between assembly <b>70</b> and assembly <b>10</b> is the optional presence of a needle guide <b>90</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows two additional variant needle guides <b>90</b>&#x2032; and <b>90</b>&#x2033;. In assembly <b>10</b> it is possible that a needle <b>60</b> pushed out of a lumen of endoscope <b>12</b> could miss the aperture <b>40</b> in neck <b>38</b> and be blocked by neck <b>38</b> from further advancement. This might happen if a user attempted to push needle <b>60</b> into use when the neck <b>38</b> was not sufficiently pulled back, to bring aperture <b>40</b> into the correct position to let needle <b>60</b> pass through. The result could be damage caused to imaging head <b>20</b>&#x2032;, cause by needle <b>60</b>. A needle guide <b>90</b> engages with aperture <b>40</b>, so that needle <b>60</b> will be guided to aperture <b>40</b> with certainty, or will be blocked by guide <b>90</b>, when head <b>20</b>&#x2032; is not positioned correctly to align aperture <b>40</b> with the path of needle <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a needle guide <b>90</b> in use as head <b>20</b>&#x2032; is pulled fully back, to a forward-looking position as needle <b>60</b> is advanced through aperture <b>40</b>, with the assistance of guide <b>90</b>. It is a further advantage of assembly <b>70</b> (and assembly <b>10</b>) that the head <b>20</b>&#x2032; can be moved to a forward-looking position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, which is helpful to surgeons for some types of procedures. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>, in a variant <b>70</b>&#x2032; to assembly <b>70</b>, a needle guide <b>92</b> is provided in the form of a wire that needle <b>60</b> advances over. When not in use, needle guide <b>92</b> is retained in a needle-guide notch <b>94</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, a duodenoscope assembly <b>110</b> includes a duodenoscope <b>111</b> having a single-use instrument guidance head <b>112</b> (shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>), having an instrument guide <b>114</b> extending outwardly at an angle between a first lateral direction L and the distal direction P. Guidance head <b>112</b> can change the direction of guide <b>114</b>, in response to varying user input via a tension member and an instrument variable guide member (not shown). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, a cable/head sub-assembly <b>120</b> includes an ultrasound imaging head <b>122</b>, a scope clip <b>124</b>, a multiple signal pathway cable <b>126</b>, delivering signals to imaging head <b>122</b> and relaying signals from imaging head <b>122</b>. The signal pathways of cable <b>126</b> may be electrical conductors, and more specifically may each be a coax cable or a trace on a flex circuit. Other forms of signal pathways are possible. Imaging head <b>122</b> is shown having a signal emission surface facing the first lateral direction L, and a clip-hold <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>) is present on head <b>122</b> on a side displaced from said signal emission surface in a second lateral direction, opposed to said first lateral direction L. An imaging head movement sub-assembly <b>140</b> includes a head clip <b>142</b>, shaped to engage to clip-hold <b>128</b>, a movement cable <b>144</b> a cable clip <b>146</b> and a conduit <b>148</b>, holding the major portion of movement cable <b>144</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> when cable <b>144</b> is pulled it pulls back imaging head <b>122</b> as indicated by the dotted line. In some embodiments sub-assembly <b>140</b> further includes an actuator (not shown) at the proximal end, to permit an operator to draw in cable <b>144</b>, thereby pulling on imaging head <b>122</b> or let out cable <b>144</b>, either pushing on imaging head <b>122</b> or permitting the resiliency of the material of cable <b>126</b> to place head <b>122</b> into a position more aligned with the longitudinal dimension of the duodenoscope <b>111</b>, at its distal end. The actuator of cable <b>144</b> may take the form of a wheel, a lever or any other arrangement convenient to the user.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Because disinfection techniques typically require the application of chemicals in liquid form, thin crevices, into which liquid might not easily flow are generally undesirable. Accordingly, clip-hold <b>128</b> is designed so as not to define thin crevices with the imaging head <b>122</b>. In alternative preferred embodiments, clip-hold <b>128</b> may have a shape that is similar to a knob, to further avoid defining any narrow crevices.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As noted in the background, the disinfection of devices such as assembly <b>110</b> is a matter of great concern, as there have been cases of the spread of strains of bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, by way of duodenoscope reuse. One area which may prove particularly difficult to sterilize is conduit <b>148</b>, as movement cable <b>144</b> will tend to introduce body fluids into conduit <b>148</b> as cable <b>144</b> is pulled back into conduit <b>148</b>, as imaging head <b>122</b> is moved back. To address this issue head movement sub-assembly is releasable and removable from the remainder of assembly <b>110</b> and is made to be inexpensive enough to use a single time and then be disposed. This eliminates the possibility of infection being spread from patient to patient by way of sub-assembly <b>140</b>. Cable/head sub-assembly <b>120</b> does not have a similar structure that would provide a hard-to-reach place that would make disinfection difficult and will tend to be more expensive as it must contain a multiplicity of fine wires or other forms of signal pathways. Accordingly, cable/head sub-assembly <b>120</b> is designed to be cleaned and reused.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Before performing an endoscopic (duodenoscopic) procedure the endoscopist would obtain an unused head movement sub-assembly <b>140</b> and attach it to the remainder of assembly <b>110</b>. After use, the user detaches and disposes sub-assembly <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, movement cable <b>144</b> may be pulled back to cause head <b>122</b> to face in a more distal facing direction. Pushing cable <b>144</b> forward causes head <b>122</b> to adopt a lateral viewing angle as shown, in one embodiment due to resilience of neck <b>150</b>, but in another due to stiffness and compressive strength in cable <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref>, in an alternative preferred embodiment of a duodenoscope assembly <b>210</b>, a holder <b>224</b> encompasses together both the duodenoscope <b>211</b>, the cable/head sub-assembly <b>220</b> and the imaging head movement sub-assembly <b>240</b>. A clip <b>225</b> also helps to hold the elements together.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an additional set of embodiments and methods of use, any one of assembly <b>14</b> (combined with tension member <b>30</b>), and assembly <b>70</b> and the combination of assemblies <b>120</b> and <b>140</b>, can be made so that the resultant assembly <b>14</b>/<b>30</b>, <b>70</b> or <b>120</b>/<b>140</b> (henceforth collective designated as assembly <b>14</b>&#x2032;) is produced and sold with a recommended method of use to dispose the entire assembly after a single use. This may greatly simplify health facility operations. In a preferred embodiment, the ultrasound array <b>52</b> (or the array in imaging head <b>20</b>&#x2032; or <b>122</b>) is a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT), which is generally less expensive than a piezoelectric transducer. Because cleansing an ultrasound assembly <b>14</b>&#x2032; can be so cumbersome and expensive, and because of the great value of the surgeries being performed, even an assembly <b>14</b>&#x2032; selling for upwards of $<b>2</b>,<b>000</b> in <b>2019</b>, could be more economical to dispose of, than to be cleansed and reused. In one embodiment of an assembly <b>14</b>&#x2032;, the number of array elements is reduced, from for example <b>256</b>, to for example <b>128</b>, or even to <b>64</b>, to reduce the cost of the array, and the signal pathways leading to and from the array.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">While a number of exemplary aspects and embodiments have been discussed above, those possessed of skill in the art will recognize certain modifications, permutations, additions and sub-combinations thereof.
