No. 62/482,008 filed on Apr. 5, 2017 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Cold slurries used in medical applications typically comprise a partially frozen saline solution. Cold slurries are used in surgical applications to induce therapeutic hypothermia and slow organ and tissue metabolic rates thereby protecting a patient's organs during a surgical procedure. Cold slurries can also be injected into a patient for selective or non-selective cryotherapy and/or cryolipolysis.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Approaches to preparing and delivering a cold slurry to fat tissue through a cannula or needle are disclosed in International Application No. PCT/US2015/047292; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0190744; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/416,484, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. A cold slurry has high fluidity making to possible to inject the cold slurry through a small cannula or needle. Once the cold slurry is delivered, heat transfers from the target tissue to the cold slurry. This lowers the temperature of the target tissue, so that cryolipolysis can occur.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because the cold slurry is highly fluid, it tends to spread out from where it is delivered to surrounding tissue. A three cubic centimeter volume of cold slurry can cover an area that is about the size of a saucer plate. Heat from the surrounding tissues is also transferred to the cold slurry. Additionally, blood flowing into the treatment area can warm the cold slurry. As more heat is transferred to the cold slurry, the ability for the cold slurry to lower the tissue temperature of the target tissue decreases. Consequently, more cold slurry may be needed for an effective treatment. Another challenge to delivering a cold slurry is protecting tissue surrounding the target tissue from the cooling effects of the cold slurry.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides methods and devices for controlling a cold slurry that is delivered to a target tissue and for limiting heat transferring from surrounding tissue to the target tissue. In particular, a balloon structure is deployed at or near a point of delivery to act as a physical and/or thermal barrier. In some instances, the balloon can act as a pressure device obstructing the flow of blood into a treatment area, which can melt the cold slurry.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A balloon structure for use in the invention can take various forms and shapes, and can have chambers that can be opened or closed to control the shape of the balloon. In some examples, balloons are nested within each other and filled with various fluids or gasses of varying temperatures. For example, in one embodiment, a first inner balloon is filled with a cool mix of water and glycerol, and a second inner balloon, which encloses the first inner balloon, is filled with a coolant gas/fluid (e.g., liquid nitrogen) to freeze or chill the cool mix in the first inner balloon. There can even be a third balloon, which encloses the second inner balloon. The third balloon is filled with a thermal insulator, such as air, to protect surrounding tissue from the cold temperatures of the first and second inner balloons. The multiple balloons can be filled at the same time or at separate times.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A deployment device can be used to deploy the balloon. The device can have one or more working channels to control the function of the balloon or a collection of balloons. For example, the device has an application cannula for deploying multiple balloons one within the other, or one next to each other. In some examples, multiple balloons can be put to use with a set of deployment devices.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the invention includes methods of controlling tissue temperature. Preferred methods include delivering a cold slurry to a target tissue located underneath a subject's skin. The target tissue is cooled to a lower tissue temperature as heat is transferred from the target tissue to the cold slurry. Methods further include limiting heat transfer from the surrounding tissue to the target tissue, which in turn slows down rising tissue temperature. Heat transfer can be limited using, for example, a balloon filled with a thermal insulator, such as a fluid, gas or air. The fluid/gas filled balloon acts as a barrier (or block) between the cold slurry and the surrounding tissue. The fluid/gas filled balloon can also act as a pressure device that exerts pressure against the surrounding tissue. The pressure exerted can constrict a blood vessel in the surrounding tissue and limit warm blood from flowing into the treatment area.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the invention is a device for carrying out the above approach. Preferred devices include a first cannula for delivering a cold slurry to a target tissue underneath a patient's skin, thereby cooling the target tissue. The first cannula includes a first open distal end and a first proximal end in fluid communication with a source of cold slurry. Devices further include a second cannula having a second open distal end and a second proximal end in fluid communication with a source of a thermal insulator. Devices further include a balloon disposed around the second open distal end of the second cannula. The balloon is positioned at or near tissue surrounding the target tissue. The balloon has a volume that is filled with the thermal insulator that has been delivered through second cannula. The filled balloon limits heat from transferring from the surrounding tissue to the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The balloon can have a first chamber facing the target tissue and a second chamber facing the surrounding tissue. The first chamber is in fluid communication with the first open distal end and is filled with cold slurry delivered through the first cannula. The second chamber is in fluid communication with the second open distal end and is filled with the thermal insulator delivered through the second cannula. This configuration cools the target tissue while projecting the surrounding tissue.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some devices have two balloons. A first balloon is disposed around the first open distal end of the first cannula and positioned at or near the target tissue. The first balloon has a volume for receiving the cold slurry delivered through the first cannula. A second balloon is disposed around the second open distal end of the second cannula. The second has a volume filled with the thermal insulator. The first balloon contains the cold slurry within its volume while the second balloon, positioned at or near tissue surrounding the target tissue, limits heat from transferring from the surrounding tissue to the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another aspect of the invention is a containment device that is applied over a patient's skin to limit/control the spread of cold slurry and/or its cooling effect from outside the patient's body. The containment device has an opening that defines a containment zone within which the cold slurry and/or its cooling effect is confined. The opening is surrounded by a pressure surface for applying pressure around the containment zone. Preferred devices include a pressure surface that is a hollow inside and that can expand when filled with a fluid or gas, such as air. Force is exerted by pumping air/fluid into the pressure surface causing it to expand and press against the patient's skin. The target tissue experiences little or no pressure because of the opening. The surrounding tissue, on the other hand, experiences positive pressure. This positive pressure limits the spread of cold slurry and/or its cooling effect from the target tissue to the surrounding tissue. Additionally, the pressure exerted by the containment device can constrict blood vessels in the surrounding tissue and limit warm blood from flowing into the treatment area.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some containment devices can have a pressure surface that is divided into segments, for example, concentric rings. The segments can be filled, individually, such that the pressure exerted by each segment is different. For example, a first segment closest to the opening is filled so that the pressure exerted against the patient's skin is greater than the pressure exerted by a second segment. The difference in pressure applied by the containment device can help control the migration of cold slurry. Additional, the different pressures exerted by the containment device segments can facilitate tissue contouring.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still yet another aspect of the invention is a warm fluid removal device for removing melted cold slurry from the treatment area. Preferred devices have a distal end that is positioned a distance away for the target tissue and within the surrounding tissue. The devices further include a proximal end that is coupled to a vacuum pump that provides the suction to remove the warm fluid from the treatment area. The vacuum pump is operatively coupled to a controller for operating the vacuum pump. The controller can operate the vacuum pump continuously or intermittently. The controller can also monitor the temperature of the target tissue using a temperature probe and operate the warm fluid removal device in response to the rising tissue temperature.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Example warm fluid removal devices can be U-shaped and surround the target tissue when in use. These devices have a plurality of holes defined along their length through which warm fluid is removed from the treatment area. The warm fluid removal devices can also include an open distal end to further enhance removing warm fluid from the treatment area. These devices can further have a non-operating mode and an operating mode. In the non-operating mode, the warm fluid removal device is substantial linear in shape. In the non-operating mode, the warm fluid removal device can be readily inserted through the patient's skin, advanced to the tissue surrounding the target tissue, and removed from the patient when the cold slurry treatment is done. In the operating mode, the warm fluid removal device is U-shaped with the open end facing the target tissue. The warm fluid removal device can be mechanically actuated between the non-operating mode and operating mode with a tension wire, for example. In another example, the warm fluid removal device is made for a shape memory alloy, such as nitinol.

A cold slurry <b>110</b> is then delivered. Heat from the target tissue <b>105</b> is transferred to the cold slurry <b>110</b>, which in turn lowers the temperature of the target tissue <b>105</b>. After delivery, an area affected by the cold slurry <b>110</b> expands to a size larger than the initial delivery site (shown in the figure as arrows radiating outwardly from the delivered cold slurry <b>110</b> and dashed circles of increasing size).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> further shows an approach for controlling the cooling effect of the cold slurry <b>110</b>. A deployment device <b>115</b> having an application cannula <b>120</b> is inserted through the patient's skin. At the distal end of the application cannula <b>120</b>, there is a controlling end <b>125</b>. The deployment device <b>115</b> is advanced until the controlling end <b>125</b> is at a location between the target tissue <b>105</b> and an adjacent (surrounding) tissue <b>135</b>. The controlling end <b>125</b> includes a balloon <b>130</b>. While the balloon <b>130</b> is shown having a linear shape, it can have any shape, such as a ring that encircles the target tissue <b>105</b>. The balloon <b>130</b> is filled with air to create a barrier between the adjacent tissue <b>135</b> and the spreading cold slurry <b>110</b>. The balloon <b>130</b> limits heat transferring from the adjacent tissue <b>135</b> to the cold slurry <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The approach provides several benefits. By acting as a temperature barrier, the balloon <b>130</b> can slow down the melting process, thereby prolonging the usefulness of the cold slurry <b>110</b>. The balloon <b>130</b> can further help keep the target tissue <b>105</b> cold and thus, increase the effectiveness of the cold slurry treatment. By acting as a temperature barrier, the balloon <b>130</b> also protects the adjacent tissue <b>135</b> from being adversely affected or damaged by the cold. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the balloon <b>130</b> placed between the cold slurry <b>110</b> and a nerve <b>140</b>. The balloon <b>130</b> limits the cooling effect of the cold slurry <b>110</b> on the nerve <b>140</b>. Beneficially, this lowers the possibility of damaging the nerve <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows another application of the balloon <b>130</b>. The balloon <b>130</b> filled with air or fluid is placed next to a blood vessel <b>150</b>. The balloon <b>130</b> exerts pressure on the blood vessel <b>150</b> causing it to constrict and limit blood flow <b>155</b>, as shown. By reducing the amount of warm blood flowing into a treatment area, the balloon <b>130</b> can slow down the melting process, thereby prolonging the usefulness of cold slurry. The balloon <b>130</b> can further help keep a target tissue cold and thus, increase the effectiveness of the cold slurry treatment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example cold slurry delivery device <b>200</b>. The device <b>200</b> includes an application cannula <b>205</b> that is open at its distal end and defines an outlet <b>210</b>. A controlling end <b>215</b> includes an outer balloon <b>220</b> disposed around the outlet <b>210</b>. The application cannula <b>205</b> is in fluid communication with the interior volume of the outer balloon <b>220</b>. The application cannula <b>205</b> includes a fluid delivery cannula <b>225</b>. The application cannula <b>205</b> and the fluid delivery cannula <b>225</b> share a common longitudinal axis and can be said to be coaxial aligned.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fluid delivery cannula <b>225</b> is open at its distal end defining a fluid outlet <b>230</b>. The controlling end <b>215</b> further includes an inner balloon <b>235</b> disposed around the fluid outlet <b>230</b>. The fluid delivery cannula <b>225</b> is in fluid communication with an interior volume of the inner balloon <b>235</b>, which is labeled <b>240</b> in the figure. The inner balloon <b>235</b> is located inside the outer balloon <b>220</b>. As shown, the inner balloon <b>235</b> occupies a portion of the interior volume of the outer balloon <b>220</b> leaving a space or gap <b>245</b> between an outer wall of the inner balloon <b>235</b> (which is labeled <b>250</b> in the figure) and an inner wall of the outer balloon <b>220</b> (which is labeled <b>255</b> in the figure).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To use the cold slurry delivery device <b>200</b>, the application cannula <b>205</b> is inserted through the patient's skin and the controlling end <b>215</b> is advanced to a location at or near a target tissue in much the same manner as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this example, the outer balloon <b>220</b> and the inner balloon <b>235</b> are inserted into the patient's body in their uninflated state. The outer balloon <b>220</b> is filled with air that is supplied through the application cannula <b>205</b>. The inner balloon <b>235</b> is filled with a cold slurry <b>260</b> that is supplied through the fluid delivery cannula <b>225</b>. The air filling the gap <b>645</b> between the inner balloon <b>235</b> and the outer balloon <b>220</b> acts an insulator and protects the surrounding tissue from damage. The inner balloon <b>235</b> can also be filled with a fluid, gel, inorganic aerogel, foam or other thermal insulator.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows another example of the cold slurry delivery device <b>200</b> for delivering a cold slurry. This example is similar to the one described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> with the addition of a fluid return cannula <b>265</b>. The fluid return cannula <b>265</b> is housed within the application cannula <b>205</b> together with the fluid delivery cannula <b>225</b>, as shown. The fluid return cannula <b>265</b> removes cold slurry from the inner balloon <b>235</b> that is no longer at the desired temperature. Replenishing the &#x201c;old&#x201d; cold slurry with &#x201c;fresh&#x201d; cold slurry in this manner can accommodate for the eventually melting of cold slurry. This approach is particular useful for a treatment that requires a long period of cooling.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example balloon <b>300</b> for delivering cold slurry. The balloon <b>300</b> has a first chamber <b>305</b> and a second chamber <b>310</b>, as shown. The first chamber <b>305</b> is filled a cold slurry (or other cooling fluid) and faces a target tissue <b>315</b>. The second chamber <b>310</b> is filled with air (or other gas) and faces an adjacent tissue <b>320</b>, which is near the target tissue <b>315</b>. This configuration allows the balloon <b>300</b> to cool the target tissue <b>315</b> while protecting the adjacent tissue <b>320</b> from the cooling effect of the cold slurry.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Examples of the balloon can have any shape in addition to the linear and spherical examples described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the balloon <b>130</b> having a length (L) greater than its width (W) and having a concave shape. The point of concavity is defined by a point along an axis offset and parallel to a longitudinal axis <b>165</b>. As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a balloon <b>350</b> with several projecting arms or balusters <b>355</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Other examples of the balloon can have a number of chambers that can be opened or closed to control the shape of the balloon. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a balloon <b>400</b> with four compartments <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<b>405</b><i>d </i>(generally <b>405</b>). The compartments <b>405</b> can be filled with various fluids or gasses of varying temperatures. The balloon <b>400</b> has a length (L) greater than its width (W).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> for measuring the temperature of the cold slurry. The cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> can be a standalone device or incorporated with the cold slurry delivery device <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref>) or the deployment device <b>115</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). As shown, for example, the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> extends from an application cannula <b>505</b> (e.g., the cannula of the cold slurry delivery device <b>100</b>). The cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> can move between an extended position, which is shown in the figure, and a retracted position. In the retracted position, the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> is shielded within the application cannula <b>505</b>. This helps with inserting the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> through the patient's skin and advancing the monitor <b>500</b> to a location at or near the cold slurry.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the example shown, the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> includes at a temperature sensor <b>510</b> at its distal tip. Without limiting the principles of the invention, the temperature sensor <b>510</b> can be a forward infrared (FIR) sensor. As shown, the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> can be moved to intermediate positions between the retracted and extended positions. These intermediate positions together with the extended position correspond to different locations within the cold slurry, which are labelled in figure &#x201c;A&#x201d; through &#x201c;E&#x201d;. By moving the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> to the intermediate positions and the extended position, a temperature gradient (or &#x201c;temperature thru depth&#x201d;) of the cold slurry can be determined. The temperature gradient, in turn can, can be used to assess, for example, the capacity (capability) for the cold slurry to cool the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows another example of the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b> having multiple sensors <b>515</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>(generally <b>515</b>) spaced along the length of the monitor <b>500</b>. Each of the sensors <b>515</b> measures a different location within the cold slurry. For example, sensor <b>515</b><i>c </i>measures the temperature of the cold slurry at the location labelled &#x201c;C&#x201d; in FIG. <b>9</b>. In this way, a temperature gradient of the cold slurry can be determined without having to move the cold slurry temperature monitor <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> shows the cold slurry delivery device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> delivering a cold slurry to the target tissue <b>105</b> underneath the patient's skin (which is shown in phantom line). A containment device <b>600</b> is applied over the patient's skin to control the spread of the cold slurry and/or its cooling effect from outside the patient's body. The containment device <b>600</b> has an opening <b>605</b> that defines a containment zone <b>610</b> within which the cold slurry and/or its cooling effect is substantially confined. The opening <b>605</b> is surrounded by a pressure surface <b>615</b> for applying pressure around the containment zone <b>610</b>. As shown, the containment device <b>600</b> is applied with the opening <b>605</b> placed over the target tissue <b>105</b> and the pressure surface <b>615</b> over the surrounding tissue <b>135</b> (which is shown in phantom line).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a convenient example of the containment device <b>600</b>, the pressure surface <b>615</b> is a hollow inside and can expand when filled a fluid or gas, such as air. Force is exerted by pumping air/fluid into the pressure surface <b>615</b> causing it to expand and press against the patient's skin. The target tissue <b>105</b> experiences little or no pressure because of the opening <b>605</b>. The surrounding tissue <b>135</b>, on the other hand, experiences positive pressure. This positive pressure limits the spread of cold slurry and/or its cooling effect from the target tissue <b>105</b> to the surrounding tissue <b>135</b>. Additionally, the pressure exerted can constrict blood vessels in the surrounding tissue <b>135</b> and limit warm blood from flowing into the treatment area.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The exerted pressure can be reduced or removed by pumping air/fluid out of the pressure surface <b>615</b> causing it to deflate. In a convenient example, the pumping of air/fluid into and out of the pressure surface <b>615</b> is done automatically. For example, air/fluid is pumped into the pressure surface <b>615</b>, such that the containment device <b>600</b> applies pressure at or near the start of a cold slurry treatment. After a pre-determined amount of time, the air/fluid is pumped out of the pressure surface <b>615</b> relieving pressure from the containment device <b>600</b> at or near the end of the cold slurry treatment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, the pressure surface can be divided into segments <b>620</b> (shown as a first segment <b>620</b><i>a </i>and a second segment <b>620</b><i>b</i>). The segments <b>620</b> can be, for example, concentric rings. The segments <b>620</b> can be filled, individually, such that the pressure exerted pressure by each segment is different. For example, the first segment <b>620</b><i>a </i>closest to the opening <b>605</b> is filled so that the pressure exerted against the patient's skin is greater that the pressure exerted by the second segment <b>620</b><i>b</i>. The difference in pressure applied by the containment device <b>600</b> can help control the migration of cold slurry. Additional, the different pressures can facilitate tissue contouring.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another example of the containment device, the pressure surface is solid. When a force is exerted against the containment device, the target tissue experiences little or no pressure because of the opening. The surrounding tissue, on the other hand, experiences positive pressure. This positive pressure limits the spread of cold slurry and/or its cooling effect from the target tissue to the surrounding tissue. Additionally, the pressure exerted can constrict blood vessels in the surrounding tissue and limit warm blood from flowing into the treatment area.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The solid pressure surface can be divided into segments, for example, concentric rings. The segments can be added or removed to make the size of the opening and, in turn, the containment zone bigger or smaller. The segments can also be added or removed to make the size of the pressure surface bigger or smaller and thus change the area over which pressure is applied.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the examples shown, the containment device <b>600</b> has a circular shape with the opening <b>605</b> centrally located and the pressure surface <b>615</b> concentric with the opening <b>605</b>. Further, the pressure surface <b>615</b> is a substantially planer surface, as shown. The containment device <b>600</b> can be of any shape suitable for applying pressure to a part of the patient's body. For example, the containment device <b>600</b> can be rectangular, triangular or other regular shape. The containment device <b>600</b> can also have an irregular shape that is adapted to conform to a part of the patient's body being treated. For the example, the containment device <b>600</b> can be concaved to saddle, for example, the patient's stomach. The concavity of the containment device <b>600</b> is defined in the context of the device in use.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown, the opening <b>605</b> and pressure surface <b>615</b> are axially aligned, i.e., sharing a common axis. In other examples, the axis of the opening <b>605</b> and axis of the pressure surface <b>615</b> are offset a distance. This non-axial example of the containment device <b>600</b> can be useful in applications where it is desirable to bias the containment of cold slurry more or less to one side of the target tissue <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The containment device <b>600</b> can be made out plastic, polymer, rubber or other material suitable for applying pressure to a part of the patient's body. The containment device can be used manually, for example, a clinician presses (e.g., by way of a handle on the containment device) the device <b>600</b> against the patient's skin. Use of the containment device <b>600</b> can also be facilitated with straps or clamps for wrapping the containment device <b>600</b> around a part of the patient's body.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> shows the cold slurry delivery device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> delivering a cold slurry to the target tissue <b>105</b> underneath the patient's skin. Heat from the target tissue <b>105</b> is transferred to the cold slurry <b>110</b>, which in turn lowers the temperature of the target tissue <b>105</b> to a first temperature T<b>1</b>. After delivery, the cold slurry <b>110</b> spreads out and affects an area larger than the initial delivery site (shown in the figure as arrows radiating outwardly from the delivered cold slurry <b>110</b> and dashed circles of increasing size). As the cold slurry <b>110</b> spreads out, it melts and lowers the temperature of the surrounding tissue <b>135</b> to a second temperature T<b>2</b>, which is warmer than the first temperature T<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A warm fluid removal device <b>700</b> removes the resulting warm fluid from the treatment area. The warm fluid removal device <b>700</b> has a distal end <b>705</b> that is positioned a distance away for the target tissue <b>105</b> and within the surrounding tissue <b>135</b>. The warm fluid removal device <b>700</b> further includes a proximal end <b>710</b> that is coupled to a vacuum pump <b>715</b>. The vacuum pump <b>715</b> provides the suction to remove the warm fluid from the treatment area.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The vacuum pump <b>715</b> is operatively coupled to a controller <b>720</b> for operating the vacuum pump <b>715</b>.

The controller <b>720</b> can operate the vacuum pump <b>715</b> intermittently such that warm fluid is drawn off at pre-determined intervals.

When the temperature of the target tissue <b>105</b> rises above the first temperature T<b>1</b>, the controller <b>720</b> responds by operating the vacuum pump <b>715</b> and removing the warm fluid from the treatment area.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> shows another example warm fluid removal device <b>750</b> for removing warm fluid from a treatment area. Generally, the warm fluid removal device <b>750</b> has a hoop-like shape.

The warm fluid removal device <b>700</b> can be mechanically actuated between the non-operating mode and operating mode with a tension wire, for example.

This configuration is particular useful for cooling tissue for an extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a convenient example, any one of the devices described above can be deployed using a guide. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> show an example of the guide <b>800</b> to use with the deployment device <b>115</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The guide <b>800</b> includes a working channel <b>805</b> for housing the application cannula <b>120</b> and the balloon <b>130</b>. The working channel <b>800</b> is inserted through the patient's skin and advanced towards the treatment area. At the treatment area, the deployment device <b>115</b> is pushed out of the working channel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>. The balloon <b>130</b> is then be inflated with a fluid or a gas, such as air, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>, and used to control the cold slurry and/or its cooling effects, as described above. When the treatment is done, the balloon <b>130</b> is deflated and pulled back into the working channel <b>805</b>. The guide <b>800</b> is then withdrawn from the patient's body. The guide <b>800</b> can have one or more working channels to control the function of the balloon or a collection of balloons.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In various embodiments, fenestrated needles or cannulas are provided with one or more mini or micro balloons that, when filled with a therapeutic cold fluid or slurry, drastically increase surface area through which the cannula can transfer heat from surrounding tissue. The balloons may be modeled after intestinal villi for example and may be deployed from a single needle or cannula as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref> or through an array of needles or cannulas. The expansion and retraction of the balloons can be dependent on a differential in wall pressure when slurry or cold solution flows through the cannula or needle.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">An exemplary fenestrated needle or cannula is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref>. The fenestrated cannula <b>1401</b> may be constructed of a relatively rigid or inflexible material compared to the balloon <b>1407</b> material. Balloons <b>1407</b> formed of a relatively flexible or expansible material are present in a series of openings <b>1403</b> in the rigid cannula <b>1401</b>. The cannula <b>1401</b> may have a solid tip to allow pressure to build within a lumen <b>1405</b> of the cannula as slurry or fluid is added. As fluid or slurry is added and pressure within the lumen <b>1405</b> builds, the relatively flexible balloons <b>1407</b> expand outwardly through the openings <b>1403</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. The resulting expanded balloons, filled with cold slurry, drastically increase the surface area for thermal interaction with surrounding tissue. Once fluid or slurry flow ceases, the expanded balloons <b>1407</b> retract back within the openings <b>1403</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, allowing for ease of insertion and removal of the cannula.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The micro or mini balloons of fenestrated cannulas may be a variety of different shapes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The left column of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates the shape of various openings in fenestrated cannula embodiments of the invention and the right column shows a corresponding balloon shape one a balloon is expanded through an opening of the shape shown in the left column. For example, a rigid material such as that of the cannula itself may be used to divide the opening as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. By dividing the opening in two or in quarters, a balloon expanding therethrough will form two or four separate expanded members. In certain embodiments, the flexibility of the balloon material within an opening may be varied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> to cause the expanded balloon to take on different shapes. For example, concentric rings of varying flexibility may result in an oblong expanded balloon which may be advantageous for certain treatments.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-20" num="01-20"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>20</b>.
