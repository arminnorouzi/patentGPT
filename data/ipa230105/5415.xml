Accordingly, because the display apparatus does not require components, such as a backlight unit, a liquid crystal layer, etc., unlike a liquid crystal display (LCD), the display apparatus may implement a thin thickness, have a simple structure, and allow various design modifications.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, the display apparatus according to an embodiment of the disclosure may adopt, as a light emitting device positioned in each pixel, an inorganic light emitting device such as an inorganic light emitting diode. The inorganic light emitting device may have a fast response speed compared with an organic light emitting device such as an organic light emitting diode (OLED), and implement high brightness with low power.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, the display apparatus may have high durability without requiring an encapsulation process, unlike the organic light emitting device requiring an encapsulation process and having low durability because of its vulnerability to exposure to water and oxygen.

As such, by adopting LEDs of a micro unit, a pixel size may be reduced and high resolution may be implemented within the same screen size.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Also, by manufacturing LED chips having a size of a micro unit, a problem that bending results in breaking due to characteristics of inorganic materials may be overcome. That is, because micro LED chips are not broken upon being transferred onto a flexible substrate even though the substrate is bent, a flexible display apparatus may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A display apparatus adapting micro LEDs may be applied to various fields by using its micro pixel size and its thin thickness. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, by tiling a plurality of display modules <b>10</b> to which a plurality of micro LEDs are transferred and fixing the display modules <b>10</b> to a housing <b>20</b>, a large size screen may be implemented, and a display apparatus <b>1</b> having such a large size screen may be used in a signage, an electronic board, etc.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Also, the display apparatus <b>1</b> may be implemented as a foldable display apparatus or a rollable display apparatus, based on characteristics that it is capable of being implemented as a flexible type.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A three-dimensional coordinate system of XYZ axes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may be based on the display apparatus <b>1</b>, wherein a plane on which a screen of the display apparatus <b>1</b> is positioned may be a XZ plane and an output direction of images or a light-emitting direction of inorganic light emitting devices may be a +Y direction.
