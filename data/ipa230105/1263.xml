application claims priority to Italian Patent Application No. 102021000017516, filed on Jul. 2, 2021, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a gymnastic machine, in particular an apparatus for cardiovascular training for the stationary simulation of walking and running, also known as an elliptical machine or trainer or cross-trainer.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">More in detail, the disclosure relates to a foldable elliptical machine, designed and manufactured in particular to be used by the users at home, but which can be used in any type of context for which a compact gymnastic apparatus that occupies little space is required when not in use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the following the description will be directed to an elliptical gymnastic machine for domestic use, but it is clear that it should not be considered limited to this specific use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is well known, there are currently on the market gymnastic equipment with similar training functions, therefore useful for simulating running, walking, and climbing stairs with a reduced impact on the joints.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Usually said machines comprise a longitudinally extending ground support base, a vertical bearing structure, capable of supporting the levers that can be operated with the user's hands, and platforms to house the user's feet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use configuration of the machine is also called open configuration, while the configuration with a minimum footprint of the machine is also called closed configuration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Among said known gymnastic equipment, there are also foldable machines, which therefore reduce the overall sizes of the machine itself when not in use.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, there are machines of the above type provided with hinges, which allow the vertical support to rotate to approach the support base, thus reducing its overall height when not in use.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, a disadvantage of said machines is that they have a considerable longitudinal footprint on the ground, thus reducing the domestic space that can be used for other purposes, even in the closed configuration.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other machines, the transition from the open configuration to the closed configuration and vice versa is a very expensive operation in terms of energy and force to be exerted by a user.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, to pass from the open configuration to the closed configuration and vice versa, said machines do not have sufficient safety measures for the user, exposing him/her to the risk of potential injuries due to the considerable weight of the machine itself.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In light of the above, it is, therefore, an object of some embodiments of the present invention to provide a gymnastic machine of the above type, having reduced longitudinal overall dimensions in the closed configuration.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of some embodiments of the invention is to provide a gymnastic machine equipped with safety devices that protect the user in the transition from the open configuration to the closed configuration, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further object of some embodiments of the present invention is to provide a machine that allows a transition from the open configuration to the closed one and vice versa, which is not tiring.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is, therefore, specific object of some embodiments of the present invention is a foldable gymnastic machine comprising a supporting structure to rest said gymnastic machine on a resting surface, comprising a front portion, comprising in turn a resistance member, and a rear portion, an exercise device, through which a user performs a gymnastic exercise, coupled to said supporting structure and to said resistance member, capable of resisting during the execution of a gymnastic exercise, said exercise device comprising a second pair of levers for the feet, in turn comprising a first and a second lever, each provided with a first end, coupled to said supporting structure, and a free second end, capable of fitting said user's feet during the execution of the gymnastic exercise, said gymnastic machine being characterized in that said first and second lever of said second pair of levers for the feet are capable of passing from an open position, in which the user can perform the gymnastic exercise, to a closed position, when the gymnastic machine is not in use.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further according to some embodiments of the invention, said rear portion is capable of passing from an open position, when it is placed in contact with said resting surface and positioned along a horizontal direction, to a closed position when it is placed close to said front portion, substantially placed along a vertical direction, orthogonal to said horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still according to some embodiments of the invention, said rear portion is capable of getting into a safety position while passing from said open position to said closed position, before permanently getting into the open position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably according to some embodiments of the invention, said rear portion comprises a safety lock, capable of locking said rear portion in said open position and in said safety position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to some embodiments of the invention, said safety lock comprises an activation group and a locking group, linked to said activation group, capable of locking said rear portion in said open position and of unlocking said rear portion to pass from said open position to said closed position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to some embodiments of the invention, said activation group comprises an activation member, capable of being activated by the user to pass from a closing position, in which said rear portion is locked in the open position, to a safety position, in which said rear portion is in the safety position, to an opening position, in which said rear portion is in the closed position, a jointed arm, connected to said activation member, capable of transferring the movement from said activation member to said locking group, in the several positions assumed by said activation member.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still according to some embodiments of the invention, said locking group comprises a locking member, and a movable wall, connected to said jointed arm, and capable of passing from a disengagement position, when said activation member is in said opening position, to an engagement position, when said activation member is in said closing position, with said locking member, following the movement caused by said jointed arm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably according to some embodiments of the invention, said first and second lever comprises a lock/unlock mechanism capable of allowing the passing of said first and second lever for the feet from the open position to the closed position and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to some embodiments of the invention, said lock/unlock mechanism comprises a handle, capable of being used by the user to pass from a resting position, to a working position, wherein said lock/unlock mechanism is activated, a transmission element, connected to said handle and operated by the handle itself, a pin connected to said transmission element and movable in an integral way with it, and an abutment element, capable of receiving said pin in the closed position of said first and second lever for the feet.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further according to some embodiments of the invention, said gymnastic machine comprises a first pair of levers for the hands, capable of supporting the upper limbs of a user, coupled to said second pair of levers for the feet.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still according to some embodiments of the invention, the passage of said rear portion from said open position to said closed position is capable of causing the passage of said second pair of levers for the feet from said open position to said closed position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Finally, according to some embodiments of the invention, said second pair of levers for the feet is coupled to said resistance member via a first and a second cable, in such a way that during the execution of a gymnastic exercise, each lever of said second pair of levers is capable of following an elliptical trajectory.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
