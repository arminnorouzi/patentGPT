Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Aspects of the disclosure relate generally to wireless communications.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks), a third-generation (3G) high speed data, Internet-capable wireless service and a fourth-generation (4G) service (e.g., Long Term Evolution (LTE) or WiMax). There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including cellular and personal communications service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular analog advanced mobile phone system (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on code division multiple access (CDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), etc.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A fifth generation (5G) wireless standard, referred to as New Radio (NR), calls for higher data transfer speeds, greater numbers of connections, and better coverage, among other improvements. The 5G standard, according to the Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance, is designed to provide data rates of several tens of megabits per second to each of tens of thousands of users, with 1 gigabit per second to tens of workers on an office floor. Several hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections should be supported in order to support large sensor deployments. Consequently, the spectral efficiency of 5G mobile communications should be significantly enhanced compared to the current 4G standard. Furthermore, signaling efficiencies should be enhanced and latency should be substantially reduced compared to current standards.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary relating to one or more aspects disclosed herein. Thus, the following summary should not be considered an extensive overview relating to all contemplated aspects, nor should the following summary be considered to identify key or critical elements relating to all contemplated aspects or to delineate the scope associated with any particular aspect. Accordingly, the following summary has the sole purpose to present certain concepts relating to one or more aspects relating to the mechanisms disclosed herein in a simplified form to precede the detailed description presented below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, there has been a growing concern over the power consumed by cellular networks (e.g., by RAN components such as gNB and/or core network components) due to environmental factors such as carbon emissions. In addition, the power consumption of cellular networks may very expensive as well. As a result, network energy efficiency is an important design criterion for cellular network deployments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Power consumption of base stations (or gNBs) is a particular contributor to cellular network power consumption. A high power consumption component of such base stations is the power amplifier (PA), which generally accepts an input signal at a certain input power, applies a gain to the input signal to produce a power-amplified version of the input signal, and then transmits the power-amplified signal via transmit antenna(s). As cellular networks adopt higher carrier frequencies, the power consumption of the PA components is expected to increase (e.g., both because of more antenna elements and proportionally poorer PA efficiency at those higher frequencies).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Downlink transmission requirements (e.g., as error vector magnitude (EVM) requirement, adjacent carrier leakage ratio (ACLR) requirement and/or mask requirement) place constraint(s) on the gNB PAs input power (e.g., minimal backoff) and, as a result, on the power efficiency of the gNB PAs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In current cellular network deployments, the various downlink transmission requirements (e.g., EVM, ACLR and/or mask requirements) are pre-defined (or fixed) irrespective of factors such as network conditions, UE capability (e.g., low-tier vs. premium UE), vendor-specific frequencies, and so on. Hence, such pre-defined downlink transmission requirements generally are set to relatively conservative levels so as to facilitate good performance despite these operational disparities.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of the disclosure are directed to downlink transmission requirement(s) that are determined based at least in part on a downlink compensation capability of UE(s). Such aspects may provide various technical advantages, such as a more flexible (or dynamic) allocation of downlink transmission requirement(s) (e.g., EVM, ACLR and/or mask requirements) which may facilitate a reduction to overall network power consumption (e.g., in some cases this may involve an increase in instantaneous transmission power, although the net or aggregate amount of power used to transmit a given amount of data is lowered, e.g., with a higher data rate transmission).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an aspect, a method of operating a base station includes receiving one or more signals indicative of a downlink compensation capability of at least one user equipment (UE); determining a set of downlink transmission requirements based on the downlink compensation capability of the at least one UE; and transmitting data to the at least one UE in accordance with the set of downlink transmission requirements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some aspects, the at least one UE comprises an in-band UE in communication with the base station over an in-band frequency range, and the downlink compensation capability comprises a non-linear compensation capability of the in-band UE.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some aspects, the set of downlink transmission requirements comprises an error vector magnitude (EVM) requirement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some aspects, the one or more signals comprise a capability indication from the in-band UE.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some aspects, the one or more signals comprise UE feedback associated with one or more compressed or non-linearly distorted downlink reference signals.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some aspects, the one or more compressed and non-linearly distorted downlink reference signals correspond to one or more channel state information (CSI) reference signals.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some aspects, the one or more compressed and non-linearly distorted signals comprise a plurality of compressed and non-linearly distorted signals that are associated with different degrees of compression.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some aspects, the non-linear compensation capability of the in-band UE corresponds to a highest degree of compression from the different degrees of compression that the in-band UE is capable of tolerating.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some aspects, the set of downlink transmission requirements defines at least one constraint associated with input power to a power amplifier (PA), PA gain, or both, at the base station, and the at least one constraint sets a different amount of input power to the PA, a higher PA gain, or both, relative to a default set of downlink transmission requirements.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some aspects, the at least one UE comprises a set of user equipments (UEs) that are frequency-division multiplexed (FDM'd) in a slot of an out-of-band (OOB) frequency range, wherein the one or more signals comprise signal quality feedback associated with one or more downlink signals transmitted by the base station to the set of UEs during the slot, and wherein an amount of the data transmitted to the set of UEs in another slot of the OOB frequency range is based in part upon the signal quality feedback.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some aspects, the signal quality feedback comprises a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurement or a reference signal received quality (RSRQ) measurement.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some aspects, the set of downlink transmission requirements comprises an adjacent carrier leakage ratio (ACLR) requirement, a mask requirement, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some aspects, the set of downlink transmission requirements is set to a default set of downlink transmission requirements if the OOB compensation capability of the respective UE is below a threshold, and the set of downlink transmission requirements is set to a dynamic set of downlink transmission requirements different than the default set of downlink requirements if the OOB compensation capability of the respective UE is not below the threshold.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some aspects, the set of downlink transmission requirements defines at least one constraint associated with input power to a power amplifier (PA), PA gain, or both, at the base station, and the at least one constraint sets a different a different amount of input power to the PA a higher PA gain, or both, relative to the default set of downlink transmission requirements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some aspects, the set of downlink transmission requirements is set to a default set of downlink transmission requirements irrespective of the OOB compensation capability of the respective UE if the respective UE is operating at a frequency range within a threshold to an edge of an in-band frequency range.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some aspects, the set of downlink transmission requirements is further based on one or more inter-cell interference parameters.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an aspect, a method of operating a user equipment (UE) includes transmitting, to a base station, a capability indication of a downlink compensation capability of the UE;

In addition, for each of the aspects described herein, the corresponding form of any such aspects may be described herein as, for example, &#x201c;logic configured to&#x201d; perform the described action.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;user equipment&#x201d; (UE) and &#x201c;base station&#x201d; are not intended to be specific or otherwise limited to any particular radio access technology (RAT), unless otherwise noted. In general, a UE may be any wireless communication device (e.g., a mobile phone, router, tablet computer, laptop computer, consumer asset locating device, wearable (e.g., smartwatch, glasses, augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) headset, etc.), vehicle (e.g., automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, etc.), Internet of Things (IoT) device, etc.) used by a user to communicate over a wireless communications network. A UE may be mobile or may (e.g., at certain times) be stationary, and may communicate with a radio access network (RAN). As used herein, the term &#x201c;UE&#x201d; may be referred to interchangeably as an &#x201c;access terminal&#x201d; or &#x201c;AT,&#x201d; a &#x201c;client device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;wireless device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;subscriber device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;subscriber terminal,&#x201d; a &#x201c;subscriber station,&#x201d; a &#x201c;user terminal&#x201d; or &#x201c;UT,&#x201d; a &#x201c;mobile device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;mobile terminal,&#x201d; a &#x201c;mobile station,&#x201d; or variations thereof. Generally, UEs can communicate with a core network via a RAN, and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet and with other UEs. Of course, other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and/or the Internet are also possible for the UEs, such as over wired access networks, wireless local area network (WLAN) networks (e.g., based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 specification, etc.) and so on.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A base station may operate according to one of several RATs in communication with UEs depending on the network in which it is deployed, and may be alternatively referred to as an access point (AP), a network node, a NodeB, an evolved NodeB (eNB), a next generation eNB (ng-eNB), a New Radio (NR) Node B (also referred to as a gNB or gNodeB), etc. A base station may be used primarily to support wireless access by UEs, including supporting data, voice, and/or signaling connections for the supported UEs. In some systems a base station may provide purely edge node signaling functions while in other systems it may provide additional control and/or network management functions. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to a base station is called an uplink (UL) channel (e.g., a reverse traffic channel, a reverse control channel, an access channel, etc.). A communication link through which the base station can send signals to UEs is called a downlink (DL) or forward link channel (e.g., a paging channel, a control channel, a broadcast channel, a forward traffic channel, etc.). As used herein the term traffic channel (TCH) can refer to either an uplink/reverse or downlink/forward traffic channel.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; may refer to a single physical transmission-reception point (TRP) or to multiple physical TRPs that may or may not be co-located. For example, where the term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; refers to a single physical TRP, the physical TRP may be an antenna of the base station corresponding to a cell (or several cell sectors) of the base station. Where the term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; refers to multiple co-located physical TRPs, the physical TRPs may be an array of antennas (e.g., as in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system or where the base station employs beamforming) of the base station. Where the term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; refers to multiple non-co-located physical TRPs, the physical TRPs may be a distributed antenna system (DAS) (a network of spatially separated antennas connected to a common source via a transport medium) or a remote radio head (RRH) (a remote base station connected to a serving base station). Alternatively, the non-co-located physical TRPs may be the serving base station receiving the measurement report from the UE and a neighbor base station whose reference radio frequency (RF) signals the UE is measuring. Because a TRP is the point from which a base station transmits and receives wireless signals, as used herein, references to transmission from or reception at a base station are to be understood as referring to a particular TRP of the base station.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some implementations that support positioning of UEs, a base station may not support wireless access by UEs (e.g., may not support data, voice, and/or signaling connections for UEs), but may instead transmit reference signals to UEs to be measured by the UEs, and/or may receive and measure signals transmitted by the UEs. Such a base station may be referred to as a positioning beacon (e.g., when transmitting signals to UEs) and/or as a location measurement unit (e.g., when receiving and measuring signals from UEs).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">An &#x201c;RF signal&#x201d; comprises an electromagnetic wave of a given frequency that transports information through the space between a transmitter and a receiver. As used herein, a transmitter may transmit a single &#x201c;RF signal&#x201d; or multiple &#x201c;RF signals&#x201d; to a receiver. However, the receiver may receive multiple &#x201c;RF signals&#x201d; corresponding to each transmitted RF signal due to the propagation characteristics of RF signals through multipath channels. The same transmitted RF signal on different paths between the transmitter and receiver may be referred to as a &#x201c;multipath&#x201d; RF signal. As used herein, an RF signal may also be referred to as a &#x201c;wireless signal&#x201d; or simply a &#x201c;signal&#x201d; where it is clear from the context that the term &#x201c;signal&#x201d; refers to a wireless signal or an RF signal.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example wireless communications system <b>100</b>, according to aspects of the disclosure. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> (which may also be referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN)) may include various base stations <b>102</b> (labeled &#x201c;BS&#x201d;) and various UEs <b>104</b>. The base stations <b>102</b> may include macro cell base stations (high power cellular base stations) and/or small cell base stations (low power cellular base stations). In an aspect, the macro cell base stations may include eNBs and/or ng-eNBs where the wireless communications system <b>100</b> corresponds to an LTE network, or gNBs where the wireless communications system <b>100</b> corresponds to a NR network, or a combination of both, and the small cell base stations may include femtocells, picocells, microcells, etc.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The base stations <b>102</b> may collectively form a RAN and interface with a core network <b>170</b> (e.g., an evolved packet core (EPC) or a 5G core (5GC)) through backhaul links <b>122</b>, and through the core network <b>170</b> to one or more location servers <b>172</b> (e.g., a location management function (LMF) or a secure user plane location (SUPL) location platform (SLP)). The location server(s) <b>172</b> may be part of core network <b>170</b> or may be external to core network <b>170</b>. In addition to other functions, the base stations <b>102</b> may perform functions that relate to one or more of transferring user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, RAN sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, and delivery of warning messages. The base stations <b>102</b> may communicate with each other directly or indirectly (e.g., through the EPC/5GC) over backhaul links <b>134</b>, which may be wired or wireless.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The base stations <b>102</b> may wirelessly communicate with the UEs <b>104</b>. Each of the base stations <b>102</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In an aspect, one or more cells may be supported by a base station <b>102</b> in each geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. A &#x201c;cell&#x201d; is a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station (e.g., over some frequency resource, referred to as a carrier frequency, component carrier, carrier, band, or the like), and may be associated with an identifier (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCI), an enhanced cell identifier (ECI), a virtual cell identifier (VCI), a cell global identifier (CGI), etc.) for distinguishing cells operating via the same or a different carrier frequency. In some cases, different cells may be configured according to different protocol types (e.g., machine-type communication (MTC), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), or others) that may provide access for different types of UEs. Because a cell is supported by a specific base station, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to either or both of the logical communication entity and the base station that supports it, depending on the context. In addition, because a TRP is typically the physical transmission point of a cell, the terms &#x201c;cell&#x201d; and &#x201c;TRP&#x201d; may be used interchangeably. In some cases, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may also refer to a geographic coverage area of a base station (e.g., a sector), insofar as a carrier frequency can be detected and used for communication within some portion of geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">While neighboring macro cell base station <b>102</b> geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may partially overlap (e.g., in a handover region), some of the geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be substantially overlapped by a larger geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. For example, a small cell base station <b>102</b>&#x2032; (labeled &#x201c;SC&#x201d; for &#x201c;small cell&#x201d;) may have a geographic coverage area <b>110</b>&#x2032; that substantially overlaps with the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of one or more macro cell base stations <b>102</b>. A network that includes both small cell and macro cell base stations may be known as a heterogeneous network. A heterogeneous network may also include home eNBs (HeNBs), which may provide service to a restricted group known as a closed subscriber group (CSG).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The communication links <b>120</b> between the base stations <b>102</b> and the UEs <b>104</b> may include uplink (also referred to as reverse link) transmissions from a UE <b>104</b> to a base station <b>102</b> and/or downlink (DL) (also referred to as forward link) transmissions from a base station <b>102</b> to a UE <b>104</b>. The communication links <b>120</b> may use MIMO antenna technology, including spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and/or transmit diversity. The communication links <b>120</b> may be through one or more carrier frequencies. Allocation of carriers may be asymmetric with respect to downlink and uplink (e.g., more or less carriers may be allocated for downlink than for uplink).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may further include a wireless local area network (WLAN) access point (AP) <b>150</b> in communication with WLAN stations (STAs) <b>152</b> via communication links <b>154</b> in an unlicensed frequency spectrum (e.g., 5 GHz). When communicating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the WLAN STAs <b>152</b> and/or the WLAN AP <b>150</b> may perform a clear channel assessment (CCA) or listen before talk (LBT) procedure prior to communicating in order to determine whether the channel is available.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The small cell base station <b>102</b>&#x2032; may operate in a licensed and/or an unlicensed frequency spectrum. When operating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the small cell base station <b>102</b>&#x2032; may employ LTE or NR technology and use the same 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum as used by the WLAN AP <b>150</b>. The small cell base station <b>102</b>&#x2032;, employing LTE/5G in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, may boost coverage to and/or increase capacity of the access network.

Extremely high frequency (EHF) is part of the RF in the electromagnetic spectrum. EHF has a range of 30 GHz to 300 GHz and a wavelength between 1 millimeter and 10 millimeters. Radio waves in this band may be referred to as a millimeter wave. Near mmW may extend down to a frequency of 3 GHz with a wavelength of 100 millimeters. The super high frequency (SHF) band extends between 3 GHz and 30 GHz, also referred to as centimeter wave. Communications using the mmW/near mmW radio frequency band have high path loss and a relatively short range. The mmW base station <b>180</b> and the UE <b>182</b> may utilize beamforming (transmit and/or receive) over a mmW communication link <b>184</b> to compensate for the extremely high path loss and short range. Further, it will be appreciated that in alternative configurations, one or more base stations <b>102</b> may also transmit using mmW or near mmW and beamforming. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the foregoing illustrations are merely examples and should not be construed to limit the various aspects disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Transmit beamforming is a technique for focusing an RF signal in a specific direction. Traditionally, when a network node (e.g., a base station) broadcasts an RF signal, it broadcasts the signal in all directions (omni-directionally). With transmit beamforming, the network node determines where a given target device (e.g., a UE) is located (relative to the transmitting network node) and projects a stronger downlink RF signal in that specific direction, thereby providing a faster (in terms of data rate) and stronger RF signal for the receiving device(s). To change the directionality of the RF signal when transmitting, a network node can control the phase and relative amplitude of the RF signal at each of the one or more transmitters that are broadcasting the RF signal. For example, a network node may use an array of antennas (referred to as a &#x201c;phased array&#x201d; or an &#x201c;antenna array&#x201d;) that creates a beam of RF waves that can be &#x201c;steered&#x201d; to point in different directions, without actually moving the antennas. Specifically, the RF current from the transmitter is fed to the individual antennas with the correct phase relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction, while cancelling to suppress radiation in undesired directions.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Transmit beams may be quasi-co-located, meaning that they appear to the receiver (e.g., a UE) as having the same parameters, regardless of whether or not the transmitting antennas of the network node themselves are physically co-located. In NR, there are four types of quasi-co-location (QCL) relations. Specifically, a QCL relation of a given type means that certain parameters about a second reference RF signal on a second beam can be derived from information about a source reference RF signal on a source beam. Thus, if the source reference RF signal is QCL Type A, the receiver can use the source reference RF signal to estimate the Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, and delay spread of a second reference RF signal transmitted on the same channel. If the source reference RF signal is QCL Type B, the receiver can use the source reference RF signal to estimate the Doppler shift and Doppler spread of a second reference RF signal transmitted on the same channel. If the source reference RF signal is QCL Type C, the receiver can use the source reference RF signal to estimate the Doppler shift and average delay of a second reference RF signal transmitted on the same channel. If the source reference RF signal is QCL Type D, the receiver can use the source reference RF signal to estimate the spatial receive parameter of a second reference RF signal transmitted on the same channel.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In receive beamforming, the receiver uses a receive beam to amplify RF signals detected on a given channel. For example, the receiver can increase the gain setting and/or adjust the phase setting of an array of antennas in a particular direction to amplify (e.g., to increase the gain level of) the RF signals received from that direction. Thus, when a receiver is said to beamform in a certain direction, it means the beam gain in that direction is high relative to the beam gain along other directions, or the beam gain in that direction is the highest compared to the beam gain in that direction of all other receive beams available to the receiver. This results in a stronger received signal strength (e.g., reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), etc.) of the RF signals received from that direction.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Transmit and receive beams may be spatially related. A spatial relation means that parameters for a second beam (e.g., a transmit or receive beam) for a second reference signal can be derived from information about a first beam (e.g., a receive beam or a transmit beam) for a first reference signal. For example, a UE may use a particular receive beam to receive a reference downlink reference signal (e.g., synchronization signal block (SSB)) from a base station. The UE can then form a transmit beam for sending an uplink reference signal (e.g., sounding reference signal (SRS)) to that base station based on the parameters of the receive beam.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Note that a &#x201c;downlink&#x201d; beam may be either a transmit beam or a receive beam, depending on the entity forming it. For example, if a base station is forming the downlink beam to transmit a reference signal to a UE, the downlink beam is a transmit beam. If the UE is forming the downlink beam, however, it is a receive beam to receive the downlink reference signal. Similarly, an &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; beam may be either a transmit beam or a receive beam, depending on the entity forming it. For example, if a base station is forming the uplink beam, it is an uplink receive beam, and if a UE is forming the uplink beam, it is an uplink transmit beam.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In 5G, the frequency spectrum in which wireless nodes (e.g., base stations <b>102</b>/<b>180</b>, UEs <b>104</b>/<b>182</b>) operate is divided into multiple frequency ranges, FR1 (from 450 to 6000 MHz), FR2 (from 24250 to 52600 MHz), FR3 (above 52600 MHz), and FR4 (between FR1 and FR2). mmW frequency bands generally include the FR2, FR3, and FR4 frequency ranges. As such, the terms &#x201c;mmW&#x201d; and &#x201c;FR2&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR3&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR4&#x201d; may generally be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In a multi-carrier system, such as 5G, one of the carrier frequencies is referred to as the &#x201c;primary carrier&#x201d; or &#x201c;anchor carrier&#x201d; or &#x201c;primary serving cell&#x201d; or &#x201c;PCell,&#x201d; and the remaining carrier frequencies are referred to as &#x201c;secondary carriers&#x201d; or &#x201c;secondary serving cells&#x201d; or &#x201c;SCells.&#x201d; In carrier aggregation, the anchor carrier is the carrier operating on the primary frequency (e.g., FR1) utilized by a UE <b>104</b>/<b>182</b> and the cell in which the UE <b>104</b>/<b>182</b> either performs the initial radio resource control (RRC) connection establishment procedure or initiates the RRC connection re-establishment procedure. The primary carrier carries all common and UE-specific control channels, and may be a carrier in a licensed frequency (however, this is not always the case). A secondary carrier is a carrier operating on a second frequency (e.g., FR2) that may be configured once the RRC connection is established between the UE <b>104</b> and the anchor carrier and that may be used to provide additional radio resources. In some cases, the secondary carrier may be a carrier in an unlicensed frequency. The secondary carrier may contain only necessary signaling information and signals, for example, those that are UE-specific may not be present in the secondary carrier, since both primary uplink and downlink carriers are typically UE-specific. This means that different UEs <b>104</b>/<b>182</b> in a cell may have different downlink primary carriers. The same is true for the uplink primary carriers. The network is able to change the primary carrier of any UE <b>104</b>/<b>182</b> at any time. This is done, for example, to balance the load on different carriers. Because a &#x201c;serving cell&#x201d; (whether a PCell or an SCell) corresponds to a carrier frequency/component carrier over which some base station is communicating, the term &#x201c;cell,&#x201d; &#x201c;serving cell,&#x201d; &#x201c;component carrier,&#x201d; &#x201c;carrier frequency,&#x201d; and the like can be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">For example, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one of the frequencies utilized by the macro cell base stations <b>102</b> may be an anchor carrier (or &#x201c;PCell&#x201d;) and other frequencies utilized by the macro cell base stations <b>102</b> and/or the mmW base station <b>180</b> may be secondary carriers (&#x201c;SCells&#x201d;). The simultaneous transmission and/or reception of multiple carriers enables the UE <b>104</b>/<b>182</b> to significantly increase its data transmission and/or reception rates. For example, two 20 MHz aggregated carriers in a multi-carrier system would theoretically lead to a two-fold increase in data rate (i.e., 40 MHz), compared to that attained by a single 20 MHz carrier.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may further include a UE <b>164</b> that may communicate with a macro cell base station <b>102</b> over a communication link <b>120</b> and/or the mmW base station <b>180</b> over a mmW communication link <b>184</b>. For example, the macro cell base station <b>102</b> may support a PCell and one or more SCells for the UE <b>164</b> and the mmW base station <b>180</b> may support one or more SCells for the UE <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, any of the illustrated UEs (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as a single UE <b>104</b> for simplicity) may receive signals <b>124</b> from one or more Earth orbiting space vehicles (SVs) <b>112</b> (e.g., satellites). In an aspect, the SVs <b>112</b> may be part of a satellite positioning system that a UE <b>104</b> can use as an independent source of location information. A satellite positioning system typically includes a system of transmitters (e.g., SVs <b>112</b>) positioned to enable receivers (e.g., UEs <b>104</b>) to determine their location on or above the Earth based, at least in part, on positioning signals (e.g., signals <b>124</b>) received from the transmitters. Such a transmitter typically transmits a signal marked with a repeating pseudo-random noise (PN) code of a set number of chips. While typically located in SVs <b>112</b>, transmitters may sometimes be located on ground-based control stations, base stations <b>102</b>, and/or other UEs <b>104</b>. A UE <b>104</b> may include one or more dedicated receivers specifically designed to receive signals <b>124</b> for deriving geo location information from the SVs <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In a satellite positioning system, the use of signals <b>124</b> can be augmented by various satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) that may be associated with or otherwise enabled for use with one or more global and/or regional navigation satellite systems. For example an SBAS may include an augmentation system(s) that provides integrity information, differential corrections, etc., such as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) Aided Geo Augmented Navigation or GPS and Geo Augmented Navigation system (GAGAN), and/or the like.

In an NTN, an SV <b>112</b> is connected to an earth station (also referred to as a ground station, NTN gateway, or gateway), which in turn is connected to an element in a 5G network, such as a modified base station <b>102</b> (without a terrestrial antenna) or a network node in a 5GC. This element would in turn provide access to other elements in the 5G network and ultimately to entities external to the 5G network, such as Internet web servers and other user devices. In that way, a UE <b>104</b> may receive communication signals (e.g., signals <b>124</b>) from an SV <b>112</b> instead of, or in addition to, communication signals from a terrestrial base station <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may further include one or more UEs, such as UE <b>190</b>, that connects indirectly to one or more communication networks via one or more device-to-device (D2D) peer-to-peer (P2P) links (referred to as &#x201c;sidelinks&#x201d;).

Unlike LTE, however, NR has an option to use OFDM on the uplink as well. OFDM and SC-FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as tones, bins, etc. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM. The spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and the total number of subcarriers (K) may be dependent on the system bandwidth. For example, the spacing of the subcarriers may be 15 kilohertz (kHz) and the minimum resource allocation (resource block) may be 12 subcarriers (or 180 kHz).

For example, a subband may cover 1.08 MHz (i.e., 6 resource blocks), and there may be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 subbands for system bandwidth of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 MHz, respectively.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">LTE supports a single numerology (subcarrier spacing (SCS), symbol length, etc.).

The resource grid is further divided into multiple resource elements (REs). An RE may correspond to one symbol length in the time domain and one subcarrier in the frequency domain. In the numerology of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for a normal cyclic prefix, an RB may contain 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain and seven consecutive symbols in the time domain, for a total of 84 REs. For an extended cyclic prefix, an RB may contain 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain and six consecutive symbols in the time domain, for a total of 72 REs. The number of bits carried by each RE depends on the modulation scheme.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Some of the REs may carry reference (pilot) signals (RS). The reference signals may include positioning reference signals (PRS), tracking reference signals (TRS), phase tracking reference signals (PTRS), cell-specific reference signals (CRS), channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS), demodulation reference signals (DMRS), primary synchronization signals (PSS), secondary synchronization signals (SSS), synchronization signal blocks (SSBs), sounding reference signals (SRS), etc., depending on whether the illustrated frame structure is used for uplink or downlink communication. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates example locations of REs carrying a reference signal (labeled &#x201c;R&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram <b>500</b> illustrating various downlink channels within an example downlink slot.

In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a numerology of 15 kHz is used. Thus, in the time domain, the illustrated slot is one millisecond (ms) in length, divided into 14 symbols.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In NR, the channel bandwidth, or system bandwidth, is divided into multiple bandwidth parts (BWPs). A BWP is a contiguous set of RBs selected from a contiguous subset of the common RBs for a given numerology on a given carrier. Generally, a maximum of four BWPs can be specified in the downlink and uplink. That is, a UE can be configured with up to four BWPs on the downlink, and up to four BWPs on the uplink. Only one BWP (uplink or downlink) may be active at a given time, meaning the UE may only receive or transmit over one BWP at a time. On the downlink, the bandwidth of each BWP should be equal to or greater than the bandwidth of the SSB, but it may or may not contain the SSB.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a primary synchronization signal (PSS) is used by a UE to determine subframe/symbol timing and a physical layer identity. A secondary synchronization signal (SSS) is used by a UE to determine a physical layer cell identity group number and radio frame timing. Based on the physical layer identity and the physical layer cell identity group number, the UE can determine a PCI. Based on the PCI, the UE can determine the locations of the aforementioned DL-RS. The physical broadcast channel (PBCH), which carries a master information block (MIB), may be logically grouped with the PSS and SSS to form an SSB (also referred to as an SS/PBCH). The MIB provides a number of RBs in the downlink system bandwidth and a system frame number (SFN). The physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) carries user data, broadcast system information not transmitted through the PBCH, such as system information blocks (SIBs), and paging messages.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) carries downlink control information (DCI) within one or more control channel elements (CCEs), each CCE including one or more RE group (REG) bundles (which may span multiple symbols in the time domain), each REG bundle including one or more REGs, each REG corresponding to 12 resource elements (one resource block) in the frequency domain and one OFDM symbol in the time domain. The set of physical resources used to carry the PDCCH/DCI is referred to in NR as the control resource set (CORESET). In NR, a PDCCH is confined to a single CORESET and is transmitted with its own DMRS. This enables UE-specific beamforming for the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is one CORESET per BWP, and the CORESET spans three symbols (although it may be only one or two symbols) in the time domain. Unlike LTE control channels, which occupy the entire system bandwidth, in NR, PDCCH channels are localized to a specific region in the frequency domain (i.e., a CORESET). Thus, the frequency component of the PDCCH shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is illustrated as less than a single BWP in the frequency domain. Note that although the illustrated CORESET is contiguous in the frequency domain, it need not be. In addition, the CORESET may span less than three symbols in the time domain.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The DCI within the PDCCH carries information about uplink resource allocation (persistent and non-persistent) and descriptions about downlink data transmitted to the UE, referred to as uplink and downlink grants, respectively. More specifically, the DCI indicates the resources scheduled for the downlink data channel (e.g., PDSCH) and the uplink data channel (e.g., physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH)). Multiple (e.g., up to eight) DCIs can be configured in the PDCCH, and these DCIs can have one of multiple formats. For example, there are different DCI formats for uplink scheduling, for downlink scheduling, for uplink transmit power control (TPC), etc. A PDCCH may be transported by 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 CCEs in order to accommodate different DCI payload sizes or coding rates.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">UEs may be classified as low-tier UEs (e.g., wearables, such as smart watches, glasses, rings, etc.) and premium UEs (e.g., smartphones, tablet computers, laptop computers, etc.). Low-tier UEs may alternatively be referred to as reduced-capability NR UEs, reduced-capability UEs, NR light UEs, light UEs, NR super light UEs, or super light UEs. Premium UEs may alternatively be referred to as full-capability UEs or simply UEs. Low-tier UEs generally have lower baseband processing capability, fewer antennas (e.g., one receiver antenna as baseline in FR1 or FR2, two receiver antennas optionally), lower operational bandwidth capabilities (e.g., 20 MHz for FR1 with no supplemental uplink or carrier aggregation, or 50 or 100 MHz for FR2), only half duplex frequency division duplex (HD-FDD) capability, smaller HARQ buffer, reduced physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) monitoring, restricted modulation (e.g., 64 QAM for downlink and 16 QAM for uplink), relaxed processing timeline requirements, and/or lower uplink transmission power compared to premium UEs. Different UE tiers can be differentiated by UE category and/or by UE capability. For example, certain types of UEs may be assigned a classification (e.g., by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), the applicable wireless communications standards, or the like) of &#x201c;low-tier&#x201d; and other types of UEs may be assigned a classification of &#x201c;premium.&#x201d; Certain tiers of UEs may also report their type (e.g., &#x201c;low-tier&#x201d; or &#x201c;premium&#x201d;) to the network. Additionally, certain resources and/or channels may be dedicated to certain types of UEs.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">As will be appreciated, the accuracy of low-tier UE positioning may be limited. For example, a low-tier UE may operate on a reduced bandwidth, such as 5 to 20 MHz for wearable devices and &#x201c;relaxed&#x201d; IoT devices (i.e., IoT devices with relaxed, or lower, capability parameters, such as lower throughput, relaxed delay requirements, lower energy consumption, etc.), which results in lower positioning accuracy. As another example, a low-tier UE's receive processing capability may be limited due to its lower cost RF/baseband. As such, the reliability of measurements and positioning computations would be reduced. In addition, such a low-tier UE may not be able to receive multiple PRS from multiple TRPs, further reducing positioning accuracy. As yet another example, the transmit power of a low-tier UE may be reduced, meaning there would be a lower quality of uplink measurements for low-tier UE positioning.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Premium UEs generally have a larger form factor and are costlier than low-tier UEs, and have more features and capabilities than low-tier UEs. For example, with respect to positioning, a premium UE may operate on the full PRS bandwidth, such as 100 MHz, and measure PRS from more TRPs than low-tier UEs, both of which result in higher positioning accuracy. As another example, a premium UE's receive processing capability may be higher (e.g., faster) due to its higher-capability RF/baseband. In addition, the transmit power of a premium UE may be higher than that of a low-tier UE. As such, the reliability of measurements and positioning computations would be increased.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">In recent years, there has been a growing concern over the power consumed by cellular networks (e.g., by RAN components such as gNB and/or core network components) due to environmental factors such as carbon emissions. In addition, the power consumption of cellular networks may very expensive as well. As a result, network energy efficiency is an important design criterion for cellular network deployments.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Power consumption of base stations (or gNBs) is a particular contributor to cellular network power consumption. A high power consumption component of such base stations is the power amplifier (PA), which generally accepts an input signal at a certain input power, applies a gain to the input signal to produce a power-amplified version of the input signal, and then transmits the power-amplified signal via transmit antenna(s).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">At the same time, 5G uses signals with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). PAPRs are usually expressed in dB, and represent the power level of the highest instantaneous power compared to the average power level. Power backoff in an amplifier is a power level below the saturation point (e.g., associated with a non-linear region of operation) at which the amplifier will continue to operate in the linear region even if there is a slight increase in the input power level. Usually, power amplifiers operate close to the saturation point as that is where efficiency is maximum. The use of high PAPRs leads to large power backoff required at the PA inputs and relatively poor power efficiency. As cellular networks adopt higher carrier frequencies, the power consumption of the PA components is expected to increase (e.g., both because of more antenna elements and proportionally poorer PA efficiency at those higher frequencies).</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Current gNB transmitter emission requirements (or more generally, downlink transmission requirements) include:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0183">Error vector magnitude (EVM) Requirement: EVM is a requirement for the quality of the in-band transmission, and represents a difference (in dB or %) between the error of the Tx signal and a reference error threshold.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0184">Adjacent carrier leakage ratio (ACLR) Requirement: ACLR is the relative power of the in-band transmission to the power in the neighboring out-of-band (OOB) frequencies.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0185">Mask Requirement: The mask requirement is an absolute power emission requirement in the OOB frequencies.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0184" num="0186">These downlink transmission requirements place constraint(s) on the gNB PAs input power (e.g., minimal backoff) and, as a result, on the power efficiency of the gNB PAs.

Hence, increasing the EVM requirement functions to relax the transmission requirement (e.g., the transmission signal is permitted to arrive at the UE at lower quality, which certain UEs such as premium UEs may be capable of tolerating), which in turn may allow the transmission signal to reduce power (e.g., either by reducing lower transmission power level directly, or alternatively increasing the data rate of the transmission signal to increase the energy efficiency of the data transfer).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in some designs, the one or more signals include a capability indication from the in-band UE. However, in other designs, the one or more signals may include UE feedback associated with one or more compressed or non-linearly distorted downlink reference signals. For example, BS <b>304</b> may transmit one or more compressed and non-linearly distorted downlink reference signals to test the non-linear compensation capability of a particular UE. The UE will attempt to decode the one or more compressed or non-linearly distorted downlink reference signals, and provide feedback to BS <b>304</b> (e.g., SNR, ACK(s) or NACK(s), etc.). From this feedback, BS <b>304</b> may infer the non-linear compensation capability of the UE. In a specific example, the one or more compressed and non-linearly distorted downlink reference signals may correspond to one or more channel state information (CSI) reference signals (e.g., minimal EVM is dynamically determined as a results of the CSI-RS UE responses). In some designs, the one or more compressed and non-linearly distorted signals may include a plurality of compressed and non-linearly distorted signals that are associated with different degrees of compression. In this case, the UE may be classified more precisely in terms of its respective non-linear compensation capability based on the highest level of compression at which the reference signal is received at the UE above some quality threshold (e.g., the non-linear compensation capability of the in-band UE may correspond to a highest degree of compression from the different degrees of compression that the in-band UE is capable of tolerating).</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in some designs, the set of downlink transmission requirements defines at least one constraint associated with input power to a power amplifier (PA), PA gain, or both, at the base station, and the at least one constraint sets a different amount of input power to the PA, a higher PA gain, or both, relative to a default set of downlink transmission requirements (e.g., the default set of downlink transmission requirements depicted in Tables 1-3 above, or some other default set of downlink transmission requirements). In some designs, the input power to the PA can be increased to facilitate a higher data rate transmission to the UE (e.g., more instantaneous power is used, but less overall power consumption or joules per bit is used for the overall transport of the downlink data). In other designs, the input power to the PA (e.g., in terms of the power supply voltage) can be decreased to reduce instantaneous power consumption at the UE (e.g., if same data rate can be supported at lower power consumption level due to a lower power supply voltage, then the input power to the PA can be lowered to save power). In other designs, higher PA gain can be implemented (e.g., this increases non-linear distortion as noted above, the gNB can use higher PA gain for particular UEs known to have a high capability to tolerate non-linear distortion).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in some designs, the at least one UE may include a set of UEs that are FDM'd in a slot of a frequency range. In an example, the one or more signals include signal quality feedback associated with one or more downlink signals transmitted by the base station to the set of UEs during the slot (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurement or a reference signal received quality (RSRQ) measurement). The base station may then use the signal quality feedback to make decisions, such as a joint decision for sum throughput in the cell and/or a joint decision for multiple cells (e.g., to control inter-cell interference as a result of FDM'd transmissions on the frequency range). In some designs, in case of OOB compensation capability (e.g., a capability of a respective UE to tolerate interference from OOB emissions of FDM'd UEs), the set of downlink transmission requirements may include an ACLR requirement, a mask requirement, or both. In some designs, for each UE in the set of UEs, the set of downlink transmission requirements is set to a default set of downlink transmission requirements (e.g., as in Tables 1-3) if the OOB compensation capability of the respective UE is below a threshold (e.g., for low-tier UEs or UEs in poor channel condition environment, etc.), and the set of downlink transmission requirements is set to a dynamic set of downlink transmission requirements different than the default set of downlink requirements if the OOB compensation capability of the respective UE is not below the threshold (e.g., for premium UEs or UEs in good channel condition environment, etc.).</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in case of OOB compensation capability, in some designs, the set of downlink transmission requirements may define at least one constraint associated with input power to a PA, PA gain, or both, at the base station, and the at least one constraint may set a different a different amount of input power to the PA a higher PA gain, or both, relative to the default set of downlink transmission requirements</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in case of OOB compensation capability, in some designs, the set of downlink transmission requirements may be set to a default set of downlink transmission requirements (e.g., Tables 1-3) irrespective of the OOB compensation capability of the respective UE if the respective UE is operating at a frequency range within a threshold to an edge of an in-band frequency range (e.g., to prevent leakage to licensed vendor-specific frequencies). For example, the OOB relaxation may not be permitted for UEs at the edge of the vendor allocated frequency to prevent leakage to other vendor frequencies&#x2014;e.g., relaxation can be only used within vendor frequencies (e.g., which may still be significant, e.g., in FR2 in many cases, allocated frequencies could span 1.2-1.4 GHz while BW in ACLR tests is measured is 100/200/400 MHz within that band).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in case of operation with FDM'd UEs, in a specific example, the respective FDM'd UEs may report, based on gNB request, their SNR and/or RSRQ (e.g., of signal(s) in a particular FDM'd slot). Based on the SNR and/or RSRQ, gNB can evaluate what interference level (e.g., which may be substantially attributable to OOB emissions from FDM'd transmissions of other UEs) can be tolerated by a respective UE. In some designs, gNB can use this measurement data (e.g., SNR and/or RSRQ) to understand SNR associated with the respective UE with no OOB interference, with OOB interference or both. gNB can then make joint decision for all FDM'd UEs to maximize the sum throughput in the cell. In some designs, the set of downlink transmission requirements is further based on one or more inter-cell interference parameters. For example, gNBs can make joint decision for multiple cells considering inter-cell interference as a result of FDM'd transmissions on the frequency range. In some designs, gNB may control the tradeoff between EVM and OOB emissions (e.g., an amount of energy on the frequency range due to the FDM'd transmissions) by utilizing digital pre-distortion (DPD) function that is configured to emphasize either in-band or OOB emissions or any mixture thereof (e.g., depending upon priorities of the network operator). DPD functions are used to increase linearity and/or compensate for non-linearity in PAs by applying inverse distortion at the input signal of the PA to cancel the distortion generated by the PA (e.g., generally, the use of DPD functions requires knowledge of the PA characteristics to accurately apply the inverse distortion). In some designs, if gNB understands that a certain UE is highly tolerant to FDM'd transmissions (e.g., capable of maintaining a performance level above a performance threshold in an environment where an interference level due to FDM'd transmissions associated with other UE(s) is above an interference threshold), gNB may compress the signal of neighboring UEs to increase their respective OOB emissions (e.g., which may allow gNB to increase the data rate to the neighboring UEs, etc.).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a conceptual data flow diagram <b>800</b> illustrating the data flow between different means/components in exemplary apparatuses <b>802</b> and <b>880</b> in accordance with an aspect of the disclosure.
