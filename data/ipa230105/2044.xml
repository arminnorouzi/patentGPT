id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a drone with adaptable wing structure and to a corresponding launcher.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Application WO 2018/024567 discloses a drone with adaptable wing structure, comprising two wings connected to a rotor, the wing structure being able to be adapted between a rapid-flight configuration in which the rotor is immobile relative to the fuselage and a rotary-wing flight configuration in which the rotor is rotationally driven relative to the fuselage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a need to improve this type of drone still further, and notably to improve the maneuverability thereof when flying in the rotary-wing flight configuration.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention seeks to meet this need, according to a first of its aspects.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, one subject matter of the invention is a drone comprising a front section, a wing structure borne by a rotor situated behind the front section, and a propeller at the rear, the wing structure comprising two wings rotating with the rotor, the wing structure being able to adapt between a flight configuration in which the rotor is stationary relative to the front section and the propulsion is provided by the propeller, and a rotary-wing flight configuration in which the rotor is rotationally driven relative to the front section, the rotor being connected to the front section with the possibility of orienting its axis of rotation relative to said front section so as to be able to steer the drone in the rotary-wing configuration by altering said orientation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thanks to the possibility of orienting the rotor in advancing flight in the rotary-wing configuration, the drone can be steered horizontally without the need to provide a complex cyclic-pitch control at the connection between the wings and the rotor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the drone comprising a stator bearing the rotor, the stator may be connected by at least one actuator to the front section, the actuator being designed to modify the orientation of the stator relative to the front section when actuated. As a preference, the drone comprises several actuators connecting the front section to the stator and, when actuated, making it possible to modify the orientation of the stator relative to the front section about at least two axes. As a greater preference, the drone comprises three actuators connecting the front section to the stator, these being positioned 120&#xb0; apart about the longitudinal axis of the stator. These actuators are preferably linear actuators and are preferably each connected to the stator by a swivel joint.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Like a helicopter, the drone according to the invention may have a collective pitch control and a cyclic pitch control. The collective pitch control can be provided by actuators situated in the wings. The cyclic pitch control is achieved by inclining the stator. Thus, as a preference, the wings can pivot relative to the rotor in order to change incidence, thereby making it possible to change the collective pitch in the rotary-wing configuration.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a preference, the drone comprises a swivel-joint connection between the front section and the stator. Such a connection advantageously is able to react some of the mechanical load between the front section and the stator. A deflector advantageously covers this joint, so as to maintain continuity of the fuselage at the transition between the front section and the stator, in spite of the changes in orientation of the latter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The drone comprises a motor for driving the rotation of the propeller. This motor is preferably housed in the front section, a drivetrain connecting the motor to the propeller, this drivetrain comprising a universal joint allowing drive to be transmitted from the motor to the propeller despite the changes in orientation of the axis of rotation of the rotor relative to the front section. As a preference, the drone is arranged in such a way that the movements orienting the axis of rotation of the rotor are effected about a center of rotation on which the universal joint is centered.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a preference, the propeller and the rotor are moved by one and the same motor. The rotor may be driven via an epicyclic reduction gearbox.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The drone may comprise a rear section bearing the propeller, the rotor rotating between the front and rear sections.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a preference, each wing is connected to the rotor by a mast comprising a joint allowing the wing to be folded against the fuselage during a phase of launch of the drone, when the latter is contained inside a launcher.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a further preference, the drone comprises a mechanism allowing the hinge to be immobilized once the wing has deployed. This blocking mechanism may comprise a locking ring which in the locked position covers the hinge and thus immobilizes the mast in a configuration in which it is coaxial with the ring. An actuator housed in the wing may generate a relative movement between the mast and the locking ring to bring the latter into its blocking configuration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The variation in incidence of the wing relative to the rotor can be obtained by a mechanism which converts a rotational movement of an actuator into an axial movement of the mast. The latter may comprise a first stud near to the actuator and a second stud near to the rotor. The two studs move together under the action of the actuator. The latter drives the rotation of a drive ring that has an axial slot in which the first stud is engaged. The first stud is also engaged in a helical slot of a tubular part fixed with the wing, secured to the locking ring. Thus, a rotation of the drive ring is accompanied by an axial movement of the mast relative to the locking ring and to the fixed tubular part. The second stud is engaged in a slot formed on a tubular part which is fixed on the rotor and which rotates therewith. This slot comprises a first portion which is linear and extends radially, and a second portion which is helical. When the mast moves axially, under the effect of the rotation of the actuator, the second stud moves along the linear first portion and then along the second portion. The first portion serves to lock the wing in the fixed-wing forward-flight configuration. The second portion allows modification of the incidence of the wing in the rotary-wing configuration, so as to vary the collective pitch.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another aspect of the invention, independently of or in combination with the foregoing, has as its subject matter a launcher that can be used to launch a drone as defined above, comprising a cap able to house the drone, and four vectored-thrust boosters for orienting the launcher.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As a preference, the drone has folding wings that can be folded against the fuselage when the drone is contained inside the launcher.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As a preference, the cap comprises two articulated sections which are kept closed by the aerodynamic thrust when the launcher is moving at high speed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As a preference, the drone comprises folding wings which can be folded against the fuselage when the drone is contained inside the cap.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As a preference, each booster comprises a deflector comprising a body able to pivot about a first axis of rotation, this body enclosing an element that is able to pivot about a second axis perpendicular to the first. The body may notably be formed of two units which are assembled around a toric section constituting said element.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As a preference, a system of redundant actuators provides control of the pivoting of the deflector about these two axes of rotation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief

the invention and depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> comprises two wings <b>10</b> which are able to move relative to the fuselage <b>2</b> between a fixed-wing configuration corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and a rotary-wing configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The drone <b>1</b> comprises, at the rear, a propeller <b>3</b> depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and, at the front, canard foreplanes <b>3</b>. The rear section <b>5</b> of the drone <b>1</b> may bear ailerons and/or rudders <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the fixed-wing configuration, the wings <b>10</b> are fixed relative to the fuselage, with a forward-swept configuration, allowing the drone to move like an airplane, in rapid flight. The forward-swept configuration offers a combination of advantages including energy efficiency associated with its low drag, optimized lift and payload, better maneuverability and greater tolerance to stalling at very low speed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the example illustrated, the fuselage of the drone has a central bay, of prismatic cross section, which contributes to its lift.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the rotary-wing configuration, the wings <b>10</b> rotate with a rotor relative to the front section <b>4</b> of the drone, with opposite incidences. In this configuration, the wings <b>10</b> act like helicopter blades. The propeller <b>3</b> can then rotate in the opposite direction from the wings <b>10</b>, in order to provide counter torque.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the drone is moving in advancing flight in the rotary-wing configuration, the dorsal ridge of the prismatic cross section of the central bay is preferably positioned to face into the relative airflow.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to a first aspect of the invention, the axis of rotation of the rotor can be oriented relative to the front section <b>4</b> making it possible to control the advance of the drone in the rotary-wing configuration.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">If reference is now made more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, it may be seen that the drone <b>1</b> comprises a main electric motor <b>20</b>, preferably of the brushless type, housed in the front section <b>4</b> and connected to the propeller <b>3</b> by a drivetrain <b>30</b> comprising a shaft <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The front section <b>4</b> houses three actuators <b>40</b> arranged 120&#xb0; apart about the axis of rotation of the motor <b>20</b>. These actuators <b>40</b> are linear actuators in the example considered and each comprise a rod <b>41</b> able to move axially relative to the body <b>42</b> of the actuator. The rods <b>41</b> are connected at their end by a swivel joint <b>43</b> to a stator <b>50</b> and are able to control the orientation of the latter relative to the front section <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The stator <b>50</b> comprises a peripheral skirt <b>51</b> in the form of a portion of a sphere, which forms a swivel joint with an internal skirt <b>60</b> of corresponding shape belonging to the front section <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A deflector <b>61</b> mounted on the fuselage of the front section <b>4</b> partially covers the peripheral skirt <b>51</b> and provides a certain continuity of the exterior surface of the drone <b>1</b>, for better aerodynamic performance.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The wings <b>10</b> are borne by a rotor <b>70</b> which can rotate relative to the stator <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The motor <b>20</b> preferably incorporates an eddy current electromagnetic brake and a rotor positioning sensor such as an optical encoder.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The electromagnetic brake allows the rotor <b>70</b> running at full power to be immobilized quickly. Its position is continually determined by the optical encoder allowing the motor controller to reposition the rotor if necessary.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A transmission mechanism <b>80</b> allows the rotor <b>70</b> to be driven by the motor <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the example illustrated, this mechanism <b>80</b> is of the epicyclic reduction gearbox type and comprises, as is more particularly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an inner sungear <b>32</b> consisting of a gearwheel mounted on the shall <b>31</b>, a large ring gear <b>81</b> that forms an integral part of the rotor <b>70</b>, and a planet carrier <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The rotor <b>70</b> is guided by rolling bearings <b>84</b> and <b>85</b> borne by the stator <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">When this is blocked, rotation of the shaft <b>31</b> drives that of the rotor <b>70</b>, with a reduction ratio. In that case, the propeller <b>3</b> rotates in the opposite direction to the rotor <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the planet carrier <b>82</b> is free to rotate, the rotor <b>70</b> can have its rotation blocked.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the large ring gear <b>81</b> is blocked, only the propeller <b>3</b> is driven in rotation. When the large ring gear <b>81</b> is unblocked, the epicyclic gearbox acts like a reduction gearbox and drives the wings <b>10</b>. This sequence is reversible.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Actuators which have not been shown allow the selective blocking of the rotation of the planet carrier <b>82</b> or of the rotor <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The drivetrain <b>30</b> comprises a universal joint <b>33</b> between the shaft <b>31</b> and the motor <b>20</b> to allow the rotational torque of the motor <b>20</b> to be transmitted to the shaft <b>31</b> while at the same time allowing freedom in the orientation of the shaft <b>31</b> relative to the motor <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">This universal joint <b>33</b> may be of the constant-velocity joint type and comprise, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a cage <b>34</b> provided on its interior surface with grooves <b>35</b> which house balls <b>36</b> transmitting torque with an internal ball <b>37</b>. The cage <b>34</b> of the constant-velocity joint <b>33</b> and the swivel joint formed between the skirts <b>51</b> and <b>60</b> are substantially concentric.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">If reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> to <b>11</b></figref> it may be seen that the roots of the wings <b>10</b> comprise masts <b>11</b> connected to the rotor <b>70</b> and each comprising a joint <b>12</b>, visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, that allow the wings to be folded against the fuselage as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A rotary actuator <b>13</b> is housed in each wing to modify their incidence in the rotary-wing configuration or to block their incidence in the fixed-wing configuration.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The two working axes of the roots allow the wings <b>10</b> to be folded along the fuselage and their angle of attack to be adjusted. The wings <b>10</b> are automatically deployed by the relative airflow and locked by a locking ring <b>18</b> which fits over the articulation <b>12</b> when the mast <b>11</b> is moved axially relative to this ring <b>18</b> by the actuator <b>13</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>25</b></figref> in particular, each ring <b>18</b> takes the form of a cylindrical segment secured to its respective wing and provided with a pull reinforcement <b>17</b> perpendicular to its end. The reinforcement <b>17</b> hugs the chord of the roots and is embedded in the profile of the wing, behind the leading edge. A mechanism converts a rotational movement of the actuator <b>13</b> into an axial movement of the mast <b>11</b>. The latter may have a first stud <b>311</b> near to the actuator and a second stud <b>312</b> near to the rotor. The two studs <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> move together under the action of the actuator <b>13</b>. The latter drives the rotation of a drive ring <b>320</b> which has an axial slot <b>321</b> in which the first stud <b>311</b> is engaged. The first stud <b>311</b> is also engaged in a helical slot <b>325</b> of a tubular part <b>330</b> fixed with the wing, secured to the locking ring <b>18</b>. Thus, a rotation of the drive ring <b>320</b> is accompanied by an axial movement of the mast <b>11</b> relative to the locking ring <b>18</b> and to the fixed tubular part <b>330</b>. The second stud <b>312</b> is engaged in a slot <b>340</b> formed on the tubular part <b>341</b> which is fixed to the rotor <b>70</b> and which rotates therewith. This slot <b>340</b> has a first portion <b>343</b>, which is linear and extends radially, and a second portion <b>344</b> which is helical. When the mast <b>11</b> moves axially under the effect of the rotation of the actuator <b>13</b>, the second stud <b>312</b> moves along the linear first portion <b>343</b> and then into the helical second portion <b>344</b>. The first portion <b>343</b> serves to lock the wing <b>10</b> when advancing in fixed-wing configuration. The second portion <b>344</b> allows the modification of the incidence of the wing <b>10</b> in the rotary-wing configuration, in order to vary the collective pitch.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The actuators <b>13</b> may be powered from the rotor via rotary slip rings. The actuators may be controlled using carrier currents for example.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the rotary-wing configuration, the asymmetry between the propeller <b>3</b> and the rotor <b>70</b> is compensated for mechanically by the epicyclic gearbox which adjusts the number of revolutions per minute between the two. Thus, the volume of air swept by the propeller <b>30</b> is preferably substantially equal to the volume of air swept by the wings <b>10</b> rotating with the rotor.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The drone <b>1</b> can be launched by being contained, with all the wings folded, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in a launcher <b>100</b> like the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> to <b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As a preference, this launcher is capable of maneuvering at high speed and, during the launch phase, adopts the flight characteristics of a surface-to-air missile.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The launcher comprises a cap <b>101</b> of circular cross section and a cruciform empennage <b>102</b>. The maneuverability and controllability of the launcher are provided by four boosters <b>120</b> arranged symmetrically around the cap.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The cap <b>101</b> comprises two shells connected at the bottom by an articulation <b>103</b> visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The symmetrical thrust from the four boosters <b>120</b> acts together to keep the cap <b>101</b> closed until they enter their deceleration phase.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Vectored thrust optimizes the positioning times with a very tight turn between vertical launch and horizontal flight. Independent of its maneuverability, the use of vectored thrust means that control of the launcher can be maintained with just three boosters should one of the boosters fail.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The four boosters <b>120</b>, mounted symmetrically on each side of the cap, each have two degrees of freedom (vertical and horizontal) the resultant being vectored thrust. Each booster is directly connected to a deflector <b>122</b> which forces the gases to follow a toric section <b>123</b> with inbuilt nozzle, visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, providing horizontal corrections. Vertical corrections are achieved by the body of the deflector, which is made up of two units <b>124</b> encapsulating the toric section <b>123</b>. The latter is able to pivot about an axis of rotation X relative to the body of the deflector formed by the units <b>124</b>. The section <b>123</b> is produced with diametrically opposed stub axles <b>127</b> which are housed in corresponding openings in the body of the deflector, these openings being formed by the mating of cutouts <b>126</b> present on each of the units <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Each unit <b>124</b> comprises diametrically opposed half stub axles which when the units <b>124</b> are brought together form the stub axles <b>128</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, allowing the deflector to be oriented about an axis of rotation X perpendicular to the axis Y.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Each system of actuators <b>125</b> of a booster deflector <b>120</b> is preferably provided with symmetrical redundancy regarding commands for rotation both about the axis X and about the axis Y, giving the system reliability.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In particular, as illustrated, the body of the deflector may bear two actuators each one connected to a respective stub axle <b>127</b>, to control the tilting of the toric section <b>123</b> relative to the body of the deflector, and this can pivot about the axis Y under the action of two actuators each connected to a stub axle <b>128</b> by a respective linkage mechanism <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The reliability of release is critical to mission success and the load factors exerted on the cap <b>101</b> may compromise opening. In order to remove this risk, the cap is kept closed at high speed during the tight turns that the launcher is liable to make and during the deceleration phase thereof.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Throughout the duration of the flight, the airflow applies pressure to the convex deflection surface of the cap and separation occurs at a controlled velocity during deceleration. The launcher opening velocity is controlled by the joint effects of the air pressure, for example by way of a Pitot tube, and the mechanical pressure applied to the fuselage, for example by means of a piezoelectric pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Once it reaches the programmed position, the cap <b>101</b> opens, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, and ejects the drone <b>1</b> which can then continue its flight in fixed-wing or rotary-wing configuration. Once the mission is over, the drone <b>1</b> can be recovered by an autonomous land system with which it communicates.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The drone may, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, comprise a connector <b>300</b> connected to a corresponding connector present on the launcher (not visible) for the exchange of data between the two, and notably allowing control of the boosters and deflectors by the electronics of the drone during the launch phase. During the release of the drone, the connectors separate. The connector <b>300</b> may be present on the ventral face of the fuselage.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In an alternative, the drone is gyrostabilized by motors equipped with small bladed rotors housed in the fuselage. These motors play no part in the lift of the drone, and their capability is strictly limited to producing counter torque thrust and creating a moment that allows an approach path to be maintained with a given angle during landing. In order to avoid stability problems associated with the differences in pressure between the exterior surface of the cell and the inside, the openers may be closed off by a circular slide mechanism incorporated into the nose of the cell. The mechanism may be passive and the slide may reach its position under the effect of gravity. In the event of reversal of the configuration of the wing structures (rotary-wing/fixed wing) the extension generated by the slide shifts the center of gravity towards the rear of the platform, thus contributing to increasing its stability at low speed. At high speed, the slide retracts under the pressure of the relative airflow.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
