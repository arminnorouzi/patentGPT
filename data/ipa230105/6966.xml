For example, Mac randomization prevents listeners from using MAC addresses to build a history of device activity by randomizing MAC addresses used to connect with access points. Traditionally, a permanent MAC address of a NIC card is a string of numbers and letters used for tagging communications with an enterprise network. They are &#x201c;burned in&#x201d; identifiers that give them a unique worldwide address. The MAC randomization feature is supported by Windows, iOS and Android for dynamically changing the MAC address used for over-the-air communications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Problematically, computer devices are banned from enterprise networks as identified from the MAC address. Banning may be due to malicious behavior, violations of general usage policy or of MAC-based policy, have repeatedly failed authentication, or other reasons. By using randomized MAC addresses, banned computer devices may still be able access the enterprise network after being banned.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, what is needed is a robust technique for detecting use of randomized MAC address to bypass MAC address ban filtering, while authenticating a station on a Wi-Fi network for access to a backbone network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These shortcomings are addressed by the present disclosure of methods, computer program products, and systems for detecting use of randomized MAC address to bypass MAC address ban filtering, while authenticating a station on a Wi-Fi network for access to a backbone network.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, specific connection request is refused responsive to a match on the MAC ban list.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many additional variations made possible by the succinct description of techniques below.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">I. Systems for Preventing Bypass of MAC Address Ban Filtering (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a high-level illustration of a system <b>100</b> for detecting use of randomized MAC address to bypass MAC address ban filtering, while authenticating a station on a Wi-Fi network for access to a backbone network, according to an embodiment. The system <b>100</b> includes an access point <b>110</b> and a station <b>120</b>. Many other embodiments are possible, for example, more or fewer access points, more or fewer stations, and additional components, such as firewalls, routers and switches. The system <b>100</b> components can be located locally on a LAN or include remote cloud-based devices, and can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination similar to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The components of the system <b>100</b> are coupled in communication over a network <b>199</b>. Preferably, the access point <b>130</b> are connected to the data communication system via hard wire. Other components, such as the station <b>120</b> are connected indirectly via wireless connection. The network <b>199</b> can be a data communication network such as the Internet, a WAN, a LAN, WLAN, a cellular network (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G or 6G), or a hybrid of different types of networks. Various data protocols can dictate format for the data packets.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the access point <b>110</b> checks for attempts to bypass MAC list filtering with an additional check on hostname filtering. When stations violate network policy, or need to be kept off an enterprise network for other reasons, a unique MAC address associated with a NIC card of the station can be added to a MAC ban list. When the station <b>120</b> has MAC randomization enabled for using different MAC addresses, the bypass is prevented by checking against hostname as well. If both checks pass muster, then client connection is allowed to proceed. In another embodiment, the access point <b>110</b> cooperates with a cloud-based MAC filter machine learning server <b>140</b>. A central perspective allows global policies to be implemented and for more powerful MAC ban lists and hostname ban lists. Similarly, the access point <b>110</b> can cooperate with a Wi-Fi controller <b>130</b> located locally on the enterprise network for sharing information among access points.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The access point <b>110</b> also performs other functions related to managing stations.

Examples of network appliances include, but are not limited to, network gateways and network security appliances (e.g., FORTIGATE family of network security appliances and FORTICARRIER family of consolidated security appliances), messaging security appliances (e.g., FORTIMAIL family of messaging security appliances), database security and/or compliance appliances (e.g., FORTIDB database security and compliance appliance), web application firewall appliances (e.g., FORTIWEB family of web application firewall appliances), application acceleration appliances, server load balancing appliances (e.g., FORTIBALANCER family of application delivery controllers), vulnerability management appliances (e.g., FORTISCAN family of vulnerability management appliances), configuration, provisioning, update and/or management appliances (e.g., FORTIMANAGER family of management appliances), logging, analyzing and/or reporting appliances (e.g., FORTIANALYZER family of network security reporting appliances), bypass appliances (e.g., FORTIBRIDGE family of bypass appliances), Domain Name Server (DNS) appliances (e.g., FORTIDNS family of DNS appliances), wireless security appliances (e.g., FORTIWIFI family of wireless security gateways), FORIDDOS, wireless access point appliances (e.g., FORTIAP wireless access points), switches (e.g., FORTISWITCH family of switches) and IP-PBX phone system appliances (e.g., FORTIVOICE family of IP-PBX phone systems).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">This description of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
