In recent years, in such a message application, services using a bot application that automatically responds with a message in response to the content of a message transmitted to the message application by a user have been increasing. User operations on the message application using the bot application can be performed more interactively than conventional on-screen operations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Meanwhile, with the spread of web services, printing devices such as a printer configured to perform a printing operation are being provided with a network communication function so as to make the web services available. There is provided a web print service in which a user accesses a web service from a terminal or the like and issues a print instruction to a printing device via a network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to cause a printer to perform printing from the message application via the web print service, it is necessary to associate the message application with printer information registered in the web print service. A user can associate the message application with the printer information by exchanging information necessary for cooperation with the web print service with the bot application in an interactive manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF IRE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in a case where one printer is shared and used by a plurality of users, each of the users needs to individually communicate with the bot application to register the printer, which constitutes a problem of low user convenience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect of the present invention is to eliminate the above-mentioned problem with conventional technology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A feature of the present invention is to provide a technique for sharing a printer among a plurality of users via the message application.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing method executed by an information processing system cooperatively operating with a message application, the method comprising: registering by associating a group in the message application with a predetermined image recording device in response to an instruction by a first account in the group; and outputting print target data transmitted from the message application to the predetermined image recording device in response to a message transmitted by a second account in the group.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of
