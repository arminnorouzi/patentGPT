Such devices are often exposed to malware, which in turn may cause identity theft, theft of personal data, unauthorized access to privileged information or to a privileged account, unauthorized use of the Internet-connected device itself, and/or other malicious or harmful activities that are not authorized by the owner or the legitimate operator of the Internet-connected device. The Applicants have also realized that the utilization of a conventional anti-virus or anti-malware software, still does not provide proper and complete protection to such Internet-connected devices.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with some embodiments, a novel protection system utilizes a combination of two methods or processes or components. Some embodiments may be used in conjunction with non-encrypted Internet traffic, or in conjunction with encrypted Internet traffic, or in conjunction with both encrypted and non-encrypted Internet traffic.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A first method or process or component performs anomaly detection, by detecting an abnormally sharp increase (or other irregular increase) in the number of requests per second that are outgoing from the Internet-connected device, and/or by detecting a large number of requests to access websites or domains or other online venues that are known to be associated with negative reputation or with questionable reputation or with suspicious activities (e.g., &#x201c;phishing&#x201d; websites, social engineering websites, malware-serving or malware-containing websites).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A second method or process or components performs analysis of the behavioral variation of the Internet-connected device; such as, detecting changes in (or a deviation from) the navigation patterns that the device typically exhibited, thereby indicating a fraudulent or malicious activity. For example, an Internet-connect smoke detector or refrigerator is typically configured to access the same online destination or website or server; and new attempt(s) by such device to access a new, different, website or domain or server, may indicate that the device was compromised or that a malicious actor has taken control over the device (e.g., via malware, via a man-in-the-middle attack, via theft or switching of a SIM card, or the like). In another example, a legitimate human user may spend approximately the same time visiting the same types of websites (e.g., spending 60% of the time in Social Networks; spending 30% of the time in consuming News; and spending 10% of the time in Online Shopping); some embodiments may detect a change, or a deviation from, such exhibited usage patterns, of that user and/or of other users of the same type, thereby indicating fraudulent or malicious or unauthorized activity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some embodiments may provide a Machine Learning (ML) based system, able to detect anomalies for a non-labeled multi-variate time series. Such system may include, for example, a data collector and mediator unit; a predictor unit; a re-training unit; and/or other suitable components as described herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is a schematic block diagram illustration of a system <b>100</b> for protecting electronic and/or Internet-connected devices against fraudulent and malicious activities, in accordance with some demonstrative embodiments. One or more end-user devices or electronic devices or Internet-connected devices, such as devices <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, may be or may include, for example, a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a smart-watch, a smart television, a gaming device, an Internet Protocol (IP) connected device, an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device, an Internet-connected home appliance, an Internet-connected camera or security camera, an Internet-connected sensor, an Internet-connected smoke detector, an Internet-connected vending machine, or other electronic device or Internet-connected device or device having capability to connect to the Internet <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, device <b>101</b> (e.g., a smartphone) may connect to the Internet via a Cellular Service Provider (CSP); whereas device <b>102</b> (e.g., a laptop computer) may connect to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP); whereas device <b>103</b> (e.g., a desktop computer) may connect to the Internet over a wired communication link. Accordingly, system <b>100</b> may include a CSP/ISP network <b>110</b>, which includes one or more network elements, communication units, radios, switches, hubs, wired links, wireless links, and/or other elements that together provide the functionality of a CSP network and/or of an ISP network, and which provide Internet access or Internet connectivity to devices <b>101</b>-<b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, a Data Collector and Mediator Unit <b>112</b> is connected within the CSP network, or within the ISP network, or at an exit node of the CSP network, or at an exit node of the ISP network, or at a communication segment that connects the CSP network to the Internet, or at a communication segment that connects the ISP network to the Internet, or at a communication segment that connects the CSP/ISP network to an entry node of the Internet. In some embodiments, Data Collector and Mediator Unit <b>112</b> is deployed as an in-line network element or an in-line network node, between the CSP/ISP network <b>110</b> and the Internet <b>105</b>, or between the CSP/ISP network <b>110</b> and the public network. In other embodiments, Data Collector and Mediator Unit <b>112</b> is deployed in parallel to the communication segment that connects the CSP/ISP network <b>110</b> and the Internet <b>105</b>, operating in tap mode or as a network tap element. In some embodiments, Data Collector and Mediator Unit <b>112</b> intercepts traffic, or monitors traffic, or listens to traffic, or collects traffic, or duplicates or replicates traffic for monitoring. The monitored traffic may include packets, data packets, outgoing traffic, incoming traffic, outbound traffic, inbound traffic, payload, headers, meta-data of packets (e.g., origin, destination, packet number, packet size, timestamp), TCP/IP traffic, HTTP traffic, HTTPS traffic, FTP traffic, and/or other types of traffic. In some embodiments, Data Collector and Mediator Unit <b>112</b> collects or gathers traffic (e.g., packets), and replicates them with their respective timestamps; and stores them towards further analysis by the Predictor Unit <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, Data Collector and Mediator Unit <b>112</b> collects and provides traffic to the Predictor Unit <b>120</b>, or selectively generates and provides data records for selected monitored traffic; for example, traffic corresponding to (or associated with) a particular Internet-connected device, or traffic corresponding to (or associated with) a particular cellular subscriber or CSP subscriber or CSP customer, or traffic corresponding to (or associated with) a particular Internet subscriber or ISP subscriber or ISP customer, or traffic corresponding to (or associated with) a particular account or CSP account or ISP account, or traffic corresponding to (or associated with) a particular type of Internet-connected devices (e.g., traffic of smartphones; or, traffic of Android smartphones; or, traffic of Samsung Galaxy smartphones; or, traffic of Internet-connected smoke detectors; or the like), or traffic corresponding to a particular type of users or subscribers (e.g., traffic of Internet-connected devices of cellular service subscribers that are known to be males in the age of <b>21</b> to <b>35</b>; or traffic of devices of Internet subscribers that are known to be subscribed to a particular guaranteed bandwidth level), or other types of traffic or categories of traffic. In some embodiments, the type of traffic to be monitored, may be pre-configured in the system; or may be dynamically re-configured or modified based on one or more rules or condition (for example, specifically monitoring traffic that is outgoing from smoke detectors, based on a discovery of a new exploit in smoke detectors).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The Predictor Unit <b>120</b> operates to detect fraudulent or malicious activities, and/or to estimate or to determine that a particular traffic portion (e.g., a particular payload, or a particular set of packets) is associated with fraud or with a malicious activity or with an unauthorized use, based on Machine Learning/Deep Learning (ML/DL) analysis of the collected traffic and its features. Based on such analysis, Predictor Unit <b>120</b> sends a notification or a triggering signal or other signal or message to a Policy Enforcer Unit <b>111</b>, which may be located in the ISP/CSP network <b>111</b> or may be part of the ISP/CSP network <b>111</b> or may be operably associated with the ISP/CSP network <b>111</b> or may otherwise perform enforcement of a traffic-related policy with regard to traffic of ISP/CSP network <b>111</b> or with regard to traffic passing through ISP/CSP network <b>111</b> or with regard to traffic outgoing from ISP/CSP network <b>111</b> or with regard to traffic incoming to ISP/CSP network <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Policy Enforcer Unit <b>111</b> may include one or more suitable sub-units or components, for example, a firewall which may be dynamically configured or re-configured based on the analysis results, a switch, a hub, a router, a traffic discarding unit to discard packets or communication flows, a traffic blocking unit to block packets or communication flows, a traffic quarantine unit to temporarily quarantine packets or communication flows, a traffic transport delay unit to intentionally inject or add a time delay to the transport or to the passage or to the relay of particular packets or communication flows, a traffic shaping unit, a traffic limiting or constraining unit, a traffic bandwidth limiting unit or filter or filtering mechanism, a traffic steering unit, a traffic re-routing unit (e.g., to re-route certain packets or flows to alternate servers and/or through other communication routes or communication links), a traffic modification unit which may be capable of dropping and/or adding and/or replacing and/or re-writing packets or packet-portions (e.g., in order to selectively remove or discard or replace malicious components), a traffic-related billing unit or charging unit (e.g., configured to increase or to introduce a particular monetary charge to a particular Internet subscriber or Cellular subscriber due to detection of malicious activity), and/or other suitable traffic enforcement policies or operations.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the above-mentioned traffic-related policies or traffic enforcement policies, may be stored in a Bank of Traffic Policies <b>148</b>, for example, as sets of rules that pertain to each such policy and/or that describe or define each such policy; and a Traffic Policy Selector Unit <b>147</b> may select one or more of those traffic policies, that the Policy Enforcer Unit <b>111</b> then enforces towards the ISP/CSP network <b>110</b> and/or within the ISP/CSP network <b>110</b> and/or towards the traffic that pass through ISP/CSP network <b>110</b>.

In some embodiments, the recipient's identity may be dynamically determined; for example, it may be or may include an email address of a contact person or an owner of a domain name that is associated with an outgoing traffic-portion or with an incoming traffic-portion, or with a payload or a source or a destination of a particular set of packets. In some embodiments, the notification may optionally include a triggering signal or a triggering message, which may cause a remote server or a remote enforcement unit to perform one or more pre-defined operations (e.g., traffic blocking, traffic discarding, traffic quarantining, traffic steering, traffic re-routing, traffic delaying, or the like).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, a mitigation unit, such as an Attack/Fraud Mitigation Unit <b>146</b>, may be triggered or activated by Predictor Unit <b>120</b>, or by the Notification Generator <b>145</b>; and may select and enforce (or deploy, or activate, or launch) one or more attack mitigation operations and/or fraud mitigation operations, which may be selected from a Bank of Mitigation Operations <b>149</b> which describes or defines such operations and/or rules for their activation or enforcement. The mitigation operations may include one or more of the operations described above; and/or other suitable operations, for example, adding a &#x201c;fraud&#x201d; label or tag or a &#x201c;malicious activity&#x201d; label or tag to a particular account or subscriber or device or source or destination or payload; adding a source address and/or a destination address and/or a sender and/or a receiver to a blacklist, and/or removing it from a whitelist (if it had appeared in such whitelist); enforcing a blacklist and/or a whitelist of senders and/or recipients and/or payloads, which should not be transported (blacklist) or which should be transported (whitelist); performing one or more monetary operations as a result of the mitigation operations; putting a freeze or a hold on an account; and/or other suitable operations.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning now again to the operation of Predictor Unit <b>120</b>, this unit receives the data from the Data Collector and Mediator Unit <b>112</b>. The data may be receives as raw data; or as partially-processed data; or as data that is gathered or grouped into dataset(s) or data-clusters or data troves, for example, each dataset corresponding to a particular communication flow, or corresponding to a particular time-slot of communications, or to a particular recipient, or to a particular sender, or to particular payload (e.g., set of packets that are transported from a particular sender to a particular recipient), or to a type of payload, or to a type of recipients, or to a type of senders; or other dataset(s) which may be grouped based on one or more other parameters or traffic-related characteristics and/or sender-related characteristics and/or recipient-related characteristics and/or payload-related characteristics and/or other relevant characteristics (e.g., time-of-day; allocated time-slot or time-interval; day-of-week; calendar date; size of payload; size of packets; number or frequency of packets sent by a particular sender; number or frequency of packets that are destined to a particular recipient; or the like).
