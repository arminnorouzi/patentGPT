The main purpose of a pause is to load weight and power that starts from the beginning of the golf swing. It sets up the perfect storm for gravity to take over on the downswing and maximum speed unleashed into the ball. Those who pause are also known to be strategists on the golf course. They like to pick away at their targets and hit the ball relatively straight with very little curvature. It's also common to see those that pause to have amazing balance throughout their swing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most tempo training tools are electronic or only contain noise making devices without any feedback that can be felt in the hands (vibration).</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A golf swing trainer according to one disclosed non-limiting embodiment of the present disclosure includes a first tube with a first attachment arm that extends therefrom; a second tube at least partially telescoped into the first tube, the second tube having a second attachment arm that extends therefrom; a fourth attachment arm coupled to the first attachment arm for securing the first tube to a shaft of a golf club; a fifth attachment arm coupled to the second attachment arm for securing the second tube to the shaft of the golf club; and a weight movable within the first tube and the second tube.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The foregoing features and elements may be combined in various combinations without exclusivity, unless expressly indicated otherwise.

The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> allows the golfer <b>101</b> to adjust the configuration thereof to accommodate desired tempo. If the golfer <b>101</b> wants to practice a longer pause, he/she simply extends the size of the tube <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A weight <b>303</b>, such as the example elongated steel ball bearing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) on the inside of the tube <b>105</b>, operates as a physical and audible trigger to begin the downswing, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> When the weight hits an end point it causes a vibration that can be felt in the golfer's hands. The longer distance that the weight has to travel will naturally cause a length to the pause.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> assists a golfer <b>101</b> to start a down swing when the weight hits the bottom of the tube <b>105</b> near the hands, at the top of the back swing. The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> attaches to any standard golf club <b>102</b> and can be adjusted. The adjustable length of tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is specific to gravity's natural speed of a free falling object, (i.e., 9.8 meters per square second) providing a good range of tempo options.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> facilitates amateur and professional golfers to dial in the start of the downswing. A good golf swing is very consistent and repeatable; and the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> provides unique way to hear and feel a consistent golf swing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates components of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>. The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> generally includes a pair of interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b>, each of which have a pair of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>at a closed end of each interlocking tube <b>301</b>-<b>302</b>, a pair of securing attachment arms <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, and a weight <b>303</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second of the two interlocking tubes <b>302</b> fits within the first interlocking tube <b>301</b> and the position of each tube relative to the other may be adjusted to lengthen and shorten the total length of the combined interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b>. Each of the interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> may contain a flat alignment slot <b>304</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>on an outside surface of the interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> to prevent the combined interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> from rotating relative to each other when combined. The weight <b>303</b> also may be a sphere in alternate embodiments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The weight <b>303</b> is placed within the combined interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> before they are assembled. When the interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> are assembled, the two pairs of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are positioned at opposite ends of the combined interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b>. When so combined, the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> may be attached to a shaft of a golf club <b>102</b>, preferably adjacent to a user's grip.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">To attach the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> to the shaft of the golf club <b>102</b>, the two pairs of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are placed adjacent to the club shaft between the pair of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>at each end of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>. Each of the pair of securing attachment arms <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>is placed around the club shaft in an orientation that permits this pair of securing attachment arms <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>to be coupled to the corresponding pair of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. In the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the pair of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the pair of securing attachment arms <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are secured using a screw, pin or similar device that passes through the pair of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the pair of securing attachment arms <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>when they are together. The pair of attachment arms <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the pair of securing attachment arms <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, when coupled together, hold the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> in a configured location on the club shaft <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is so attached to the club shaft <b>102</b>, the pair of interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> may be telescoped inward/outward to change the total length of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> on the club shaft <b>102</b>. The total length of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> defines the length of delay the golfer is practicing before beginning a down swing.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates operation of a golf swing trainer for teaching a pause drill. The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> with the interlocking telescoping tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> connected together and the weight <b>303</b> within the pair of tubes. The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in its orientation before the golfer <b>101</b> begins a back swing. Initially, the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is oriented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in which gravity has caused the elongated ball bearing <b>303</b> to rest at a bottom end of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the golfer <b>101</b> begins a back swing, the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> follows an essentially circular path <b>401</b> upward as the club shaft <b>102</b> swings upward. This movement of the club shaft <b>102</b>, with the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> attached as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, imposes centrifugal force upon the weight <b>303</b> to keep it at its present end of the interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates operation of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> for teaching a pause drill. When the golfer <b>101</b> stops the back swing at the top of its swing, the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is now oriented into a position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The stoppage of the movement of the club shaft <b>102</b> and the attached tubular tempo device <b>100</b> eliminates the centrifugal force holding the weight <b>303</b> in place allowing the weight <b>303</b> to fall <b>501</b> within the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The weight <b>303</b> begins to fall as the golfer <b>101</b> is beginning the pause at the top of the back swing before beginning the down swing. The amount of time required by the weight to reach the opposite end of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is determined by the current configured length of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>. When the weight <b>303</b> reaches the opposite end of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>, the golfer will detect the impact of the weight <b>303</b> against the inner end of the tubular tempo device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The detection of this impact informs the golfer <b>101</b> that the pause has lasted the length of time as determined by the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> in its current configuration and the golfer may begin the down swing. By repeating this exercise while swinging the golf club <b>102</b>, the golfer <b>101</b> can train in waiting a desired and consistent length of time between the end of the back swing and the beginning of the down swing that results in consistent swings of the golf club <b>102</b> and better play.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the weight <b>303</b> may be changeable. The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> may include multiple different elongated steel ball bearings <b>303</b> with each having a different weight. When a golfer <b>101</b> desires to add resistance, a heavier weight <b>303</b> may be placed within the interlocking tubes <b>301</b>-<b>302</b> when the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> is configured. Similarly, the golfer <b>101</b> may decrease the weight of the elongated steel ball bearings <b>303</b> by using a lighter weight <b>303</b>. By adding a heavier weighted weight <b>303</b>, golfers <b>101</b> can increase their swing speeds and their distance by strengthening golf swing muscles.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of tubular tempo device <b>100</b> which utilizes a singular tubular, non-telescoping body <b>400</b> that is attached to the golf shaft with attachments <b>500</b> that screw into each end of the body <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The tubular tempo device <b>100</b> may include an air hole to facilitate movement of the weight <b>303</b>. The attachments <b>500</b> may include two portions that are clamped together by a screw <b>510</b> or other fastener to clamp onto the golf club shaft. In one example, the tubular tempo device <b>100</b> can be between 3 and 12 inches in length with a weight of a diameter of 0.375&#x2033;(&#x215c;&#x2033;).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Even though particular combinations of features are recited in the present application, these combinations are not intended to limit the disclosure of the invention.
