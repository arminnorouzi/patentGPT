Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to an aircraft system and, more particularly, to a thermal anti-icing system for the aircraft system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Background Information</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A modern aircraft propulsion system typically includes a gas turbine engine housed within a nacelle. The nacelle includes an inlet structure for directing incoming air to the gas turbine engine. This inlet structure includes an inlet lip, an inner barrel and an outer barrel. The inlet lip forms a leading edge of the inlet structure. The inner barrel is connected to a radial inner end of the inlet lip, and at least partially forms an outer peripheral boundary of an inlet duct into the aircraft propulsion system. The outer barrel is connected to a radial outer end of the inlet lip, and circumscribes the inner barrel.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Under certain environmental conditions, the inlet lip may be susceptible to ice accumulation. To melt ice that may accumulate on the inlet lip, the inlet structure may be configured with a thermal anti-icing system. A lip skin of the inlet lip, for example, may be configured with an electrical resistance heater. Such an electrical resistance heater may be attached to an interior surface of the lip skin to minimize a thermal conduction path length from the heater to an exterior surface of the lip skin/the inlet lip. While such electrical resistance heaters have various benefits, there is still room in the art for improvement. Damage to the lip skin and the electrical resistance heater arranged therewith following a foreign object impact, for example, may render a portion of or the entire electrical resistance heater inoperable where the damage severs one or more electrical resistance circuits within the electrical resistance heater.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to configure the inlet structure with one or more acoustic panels for attenuating sound (e.g., noise) generated by the gas turbine engine. Some efforts have been made to integrate such acoustic panels into the inlet lip. Acoustic panels, however, are difficult to de-ice. A typical acoustic panel, for example, includes a perforated face skin, a back skin and a honeycomb core between the face and the back skins. The honeycomb core includes a plurality of cavities that extend between the face and the back skins. While the cavities facilitate sound attenuation, these cavities also thermally insulate the face skin from the back skin. It is therefore difficult to integrate an electrical resistance heater with an acoustic panel, particularly where the heater is designed to be attached to an interior-most surface of the acoustic panel.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally speaking, efficiency of the aircraft propulsion system may be increased by, inter alia, reducing weight and size of the aircraft propulsion system. Shortening the inlet structure is one known way to reduce the weight and the size of the aircraft propulsion system. However, certain thermal de-icing requirements and certain sound attenuation requirements currently provide obstacles to reducing the weight and the size of the inlet structure further. There is a need in the art therefore for improved systems and structures which can facilitate reducing weight and/or size of a nacelle inlet structure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an assembly is provided for an aircraft structure.

Each of these waveguide segments <b>90</b> may focus the microwaves to a respective one of the susceptor segments <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">During operation of the thermal anti-icing system <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the microwave source <b>76</b> generates microwaves. These microwaves are received by the downstream waveguide <b>80</b>B through the upstream waveguide <b>80</b>A. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the downstream waveguide <b>80</b>B selectively directs the received microwaves <b>92</b> towards/to the susceptor <b>64</b> through the cellular core <b>32</b> as well as one or more other layers of the skin(s) <b>28</b> and/or <b>30</b>. These transmitted microwaves impinge against and are absorbed by the susceptor <b>64</b>, and are then transformed by the susceptor <b>64</b> into thermal energy <b>94</b>. This thermal energy <b>94</b> may be transferred via conduction from the susceptor <b>64</b> into a region of the aircraft structure exterior skin <b>62</b> adjacent and/or proximate the susceptor <b>64</b>. This transfer of the thermal energy <b>94</b> may heat the region of the aircraft structure exterior skin <b>62</b> and thereby melt and/or prevent ice accumulation over and/or about the aircraft structure exterior skin region.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">To facilitate transmission of the microwaves through the cellular core <b>32</b>, the cellular core <b>32</b> may be constructed from dielectric material. This dielectric material may be or otherwise include a polymer (e.g., a fluoropolymer) such as, but not limited to, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (e.g., Teflon&#xae; material) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The dielectric material may include fibrous material (e.g., glass fibers) within a polymer matrix. The dielectric material may also or alternatively include other polymeric materials and/or ceramics. For example, the dielectric material may include: ceramic matrix composite (CMC), alumina, silica, silicon carbide, silicon oxynitride, borosilicate glass, Pyrex, or other (e.g., &#x201c;microwave safe&#x201d;) dielectrics used for conventional household microwave ovens. The present disclosure, however, is not limited to the foregoing exemplary dielectric materials.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for example, the susceptor <b>64</b> may be an integral part of the first skin <b>28</b>. In other embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the susceptor <b>64</b> may be formed discrete from the first skin <b>28</b> and subsequently bonded to the first skin <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for example, the downstream waveguide <b>80</b>B may be an integral part of the second skin <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the downstream waveguide <b>80</b>B may be formed discrete from the second skin <b>30</b> and subsequently bonded to the second skin <b>30</b>, printed onto the second skin <b>30</b>, or otherwise attached to the second skin <b>30</b>. In still other embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the downstream waveguide <b>80</b>B may be configured discrete from the acoustic panel <b>26</b> and its second skin <b>30</b>. The downstream waveguide <b>80</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, for example, may be separated from the acoustic panel <b>26</b> and its second skin <b>30</b> by an air gap <b>95</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, the waveguides <b>80</b> may be configured as dielectric waveguides as described above. In other embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, one or each of the waveguides <b>80</b> may alternatively be configured as a hollow waveguide. At least the downstream waveguide <b>80</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, for example, includes a tubular body <b>96</b> with an internal passage <b>98</b> (e.g., a bore) configured to communicate the microwaves. This tubular body <b>96</b> may include one or more apertures <b>100</b>; e.g., slots, slits and/or perforations. Each of these apertures <b>100</b> extends through/pierces a sidewall of the respective waveguide <b>80</b>. Each of the apertures <b>100</b> is thereby operable to direct some of the microwaves from within its internal passage <b>98</b> towards/or the susceptor <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Of course, various other types of microwave waveguide are known in the art, and the present disclosure is not limited to any particular ones thereof.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition to facilitating heating of the aircraft structure exterior skin <b>62</b> through a thermally insulating structure such as the cellular core <b>32</b>, the thermal anti-icing system <b>24</b> of the present disclosure is also relatively resistant to foreign object damage (FOD). For example, during operation, the aircraft structure <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be subject to a foreign object impact. Under certain conditions, such an impact may crack and/or fracture, inter alia, the susceptor <b>64</b>; e.g., material within the susceptor layer <b>72</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Even where cracked/fractured, however, the susceptor <b>64</b> may still be operable to transform the microwaves into heat energy since no electrical interconnection within the susceptor <b>64</b> is required. Furthermore, provision of the relatively light weight susceptor <b>64</b> and waveguides <b>80</b> may reduce aircraft weight by obviating the need for ducting and valve associated with a traditional forced hot air anti-icing system.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The thermal anti-icing system <b>24</b> of the present disclosure may also simplify manufacturing of the acoustic panel <b>26</b>. For example, where an acoustic panel is provided with an electrical resistance heater, electrical conduction paths for that heater must be carefully mapped to ensure that those paths are not severed during perforation of its exterior skin. However, as discussed above, perforation of the susceptor <b>64</b> does not adversely impact its operation. Therefore, the first skin perforations <b>40</b> may be formed without detailed, time intensive mappings.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the microwave source <b>76</b> may be tuned to an absorption frequency of the susceptor <b>64</b>. This may facilitate provision of higher electromagnetic radiation frequencies, while reducing a footprint of the electromagnetic radiation. For example, the microwave source <b>76</b> may be tuned for a V-band frequency between forty gigahertz and eighty gigahertz; e.g., between 60 GHz and 77 GHz. Within such a frequency range, absorption by other aircraft structure materials is relatively low and the susceptor <b>64</b> may be made relatively small. The susceptor <b>64</b>, for example, may be about 1.25 mm thick for a microwave transmission frequency of about 60 GHz. The present disclosure, however, is not limited to the forgoing exemplary frequencies or sizes.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates an inlet structure <b>102</b> of a nacelle for an aircraft propulsion system; e.g., a turbofan or a turbojet propulsion system. This inlet structure <b>102</b> includes an inlet lip <b>104</b>, an inner barrel <b>106</b> and an outer barrel <b>108</b>. The inlet lip <b>104</b> forms a leading edge <b>110</b> of the inlet structure <b>102</b>. The inner barrel <b>106</b> is connected to a radial inner end of the inlet lip <b>104</b>, and at least partially forms an outer peripheral boundary of an inlet duct <b>111</b> into the aircraft propulsion system.

These acoustic panels <b>26</b> may collectively form at least an inner portion of the inlet lip <b>104</b> and an entirety (or a portion) of the inner barrel <b>106</b>. Each acoustic panel <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, for example, extends axially along an axial centerline <b>112</b> of the aircraft propulsion system from (or about) the leading edge <b>110</b> to (or towards) an aft end <b>114</b> of the inner barrel <b>106</b>. Each acoustic panel <b>26</b> may have an arcuate configuration, which extends partially circumferentially about the axial centerline <b>112</b>. With this arrangement, sound attenuation treatment may be carried past a typical forward end location <b>116</b> of the inner barrel <b>106</b> into the inlet lip <b>104</b>. An overall axial length of the inner barrel <b>106</b> and, thus, the entire inlet structure <b>102</b> may thereby be shorted while still providing a certain level of sound attenuation as well as thermal anti-icing for the inlet lip <b>104</b> as compared, for example, to a traditional inlet structure <b>1500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.
