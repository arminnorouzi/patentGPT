For instance, cross winds, bird impacts, or fan blade out (FBO) events can cause blade rub. Typically, the fan casing is designed to accommodate blade rub, e.g., through a section of abradable material, a trench filler, or the like in the fan casing to mitigate the effects of blade rub from composite fan blades. However, reinforcing the fan casing and/or the fan blades can add weight and complexity to the fan module, which can increase the cost of the fan module and impact engine performance, without avoiding rotor unbalance, e.g., during an FBO event. Similar disadvantages, e.g., with respect to tip rub and known casing modifications to mitigate the effects of tip rub, also may be realized with respect to other airfoils within aircraft gas turbine engines, as well as other gas turbine engines. Accordingly, improved composite airfoils for a gas turbine engine having features for mitigating airfoil tip rub would be desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter, a composite airfoil of a gas turbine engine is provided.

The ratio between the first portion of air <b>62</b> and the second portion of air <b>64</b> is commonly known as a bypass ratio. The pressure of the second portion of air <b>64</b> is then increased as it is routed through the high pressure (HP) compressor <b>24</b> and into the combustion section <b>26</b>, where it is mixed with fuel and burned to provide combustion gases <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The combustion gases <b>66</b> are routed through the HP turbine <b>28</b> where a portion of thermal and/or kinetic energy from the combustion gases <b>66</b> is extracted via sequential stages of HP turbine stator vanes <b>68</b> that are coupled to the outer casing <b>18</b> and HP turbine rotor blades <b>70</b> that are coupled to the HP shaft or spool <b>34</b>, thus causing the HP shaft or spool <b>34</b> to rotate, thereby supporting operation of the HP compressor <b>24</b>. The combustion gases <b>66</b> are then routed through the LP turbine <b>30</b> where a second portion of thermal and kinetic energy is extracted from the combustion gases <b>66</b> via sequential stages of LP turbine stator vanes <b>72</b> that are coupled to the outer casing <b>18</b> and LP turbine rotor blades <b>74</b> that are coupled to the LP shaft or spool <b>36</b>, thus causing the LP shaft or spool <b>36</b> to rotate, thereby supporting operation of the LP compressor <b>22</b> and/or rotation of the fan <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The combustion gases <b>66</b> are subsequently routed through the jet exhaust nozzle section <b>32</b> of the core turbine engine <b>16</b> to provide propulsive thrust.

Composite materials generally comprise a fibrous reinforcement material embedded in matrix material, e.g., a polymer or ceramic matrix material. The reinforcement material serves as a load-bearing constituent of the composite material, while the matrix of a composite material serves to bind the fibers together and act as the medium by which an externally applied stress is transmitted and distributed to the fibers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;composite&#x201d; is understood to include, but is not limited to, a PMC, a CMC, and a hybrid composite, e.g., a PMC in combination with metal or combinations of more than one PMC or combinations of more than one metal.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">PMC materials are typically fabricated by impregnating a fabric or unidirectional tape with a resin (prepreg), followed by curing. Prior to impregnation, the fabric may be referred to as a &#x201c;dry&#x201d; fabric and typically comprises a stack of two or more fiber layers (plies). The fiber layers may be formed of a variety of materials, nonlimiting examples of which include carbon (e.g., graphite), glass (e.g., fiberglass), polymer (e.g., Kevlar&#xae;) fibers, and metal fibers. Fibrous reinforcement materials can be used in the form of relatively short chopped fibers, generally less than two inches in length, and more preferably less than one inch, or long continuous fibers, the latter of which are often used to produce a woven fabric or unidirectional tape. PMC materials can be produced by dispersing dry fibers into a mold, and then flowing matrix material around the reinforcement fibers, or by using prepreg. For example, multiple layers of prepreg may be stacked to the proper thickness and orientation for the part, and then the resin may be cured and solidified to render a fiber reinforced composite part. Resins for PMC matrix materials can be generally classified as thermosets or thermoplastics. Thermoplastic resins are generally categorized as polymers that can be repeatedly softened and flowed when heated and hardened when sufficiently cooled due to physical rather than chemical changes. Notable example classes of thermosplastic resins include nylons, thermoplastic polyesters, polyaryletherketones, and polycarbonate resins. Specific examples of high performance thermoplastic resins that have been contemplated for use in aerospace applications include polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), polyetherimide (PEI), and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS). In contrast, once fully cured into a hard rigid solid, thermoset resins do not undergo significant softening when heated but, instead, thermally decompose when sufficiently heated. Notable examples of thermoset resins include epoxy, bismaleimide (BMI), and polyimide resins. Thus, generally, PMC materials include matrices that are thermoset or thermoplastic and reinforcements that include, but are not limited to, glass, graphite, aramid, or organic fiber of any length, size, or orientation or combination of these reinforcements, and are further understood to include, but are not limited to, being manufactured by injection molding, resin transfer molding, prepreg tape layup (hand or automated), pultrusion, or any other suitable method for manufacture of a reinforced polymer matrix composite structure or combination of these manufacturing methods.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Exemplary CMC materials may include silicon carbide (SiC), silicon, silica, carbon, or alumina matrix materials and combinations thereof. Ceramic fibers may be embedded within the matrix, such as oxidation stable reinforcing fibers including monofilaments like sapphire and silicon carbide (e.g., Textron's SCS-6), as well as rovings and yarn including silicon carbide (e.g., Nippon Carbon's NICALON&#xae;, Ube Industries' TYRANNO&#xae;, and Dow Corning's SYLRAMIC&#xae;), alumina silicates (e.g., 3M's Nextel 440 and 480), and chopped whiskers and fibers (e.g., 3M's Nextel 440 and SAFFIL&#xae;), and optionally ceramic particles (e.g., oxides of Si, Al, Zr, Y, and combinations thereof) and inorganic fillers (e.g., pyrophyllite, wollastonite, mica, talc, kyanite, and montmorillonite). For example, in certain embodiments, bundles of the fibers, which may include a ceramic refractory material coating, are formed as a reinforced tape, such as a unidirectional reinforced tape. A plurality of the tapes may be laid up together (e.g., as plies) to form a preform component. The bundles of fibers may be impregnated with a slurry composition prior to forming the preform or after formation of the preform. The preform may then undergo thermal processing, such as a cure or burn-out to yield a high char residue in the preform, and subsequent chemical processing, such as melt-infiltration with silicon, to arrive at a component formed of a CMC material having a desired chemical composition. In other embodiments, the CMC material may be formed as, e.g., a carbon fiber cloth rather than as a tape.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a composite component of a gas turbine engine, such as engine <b>10</b>, will be described according to an exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter. As illustrated in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the composite component may be a composite airfoil <b>100</b> of a fan blade <b>40</b>, but in other embodiments, the composite component may be another composite airfoil, such as an inlet guide vane (IGV) or an outlet guide vane (OGV) <b>52</b>, or other composite component. The fan blade <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> includes the composite airfoil <b>100</b> having a concave pressure side <b>102</b> opposite a convex suction side <b>104</b>. Opposite pressure and suction sides <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> of the airfoil <b>100</b> extend radially along a span S from a root <b>106</b> to a tip <b>108</b> at the radially outermost portion of the fan blade <b>40</b>. That is, the root <b>106</b> defines a first radial extremity of the airfoil <b>100</b>, and the tip <b>108</b> defines a second radial extremity of the airfoil <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, pressure and suction sides <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> of the airfoil <b>100</b> extend axially between a leading edge <b>110</b> and an opposite trailing edge <b>112</b>. The leading edge <b>110</b> defines a forward end of the airfoil <b>100</b>, and the trailing edge <b>112</b> defines an aft end of the airfoil <b>100</b>. Further, the pressure side <b>102</b> defines an outer pressure surface <b>114</b> of the airfoil <b>100</b>, and the suction side <b>104</b> defines an outer suction surface <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B</figref>) of the airfoil <b>100</b>. Additionally, in the depicted embodiment, a leading edge segment <b>118</b> is applied over or attached to the leading edge <b>110</b>, a trailing edge segment <b>120</b> is applied over or attached to the trailing edge <b>112</b>, and a tip cap <b>122</b> is applied over or attached to the tip <b>108</b>. A portion of each of the leading edge segment <b>118</b>, the trailing edge segment <b>120</b>, and the tip cap <b>122</b> contacts the outer pressure surface <b>114</b> and the outer suction surface <b>116</b>. The leading edge segment <b>118</b>, the trailing edge segment <b>120</b>, and the tip cap <b>122</b> may each be formed from a metal, e.g., the segment <b>118</b> may be a metallic leading edge segment, the segment <b>120</b> may be a metallic trailing edge segment, and the cap <b>122</b> may be a metallic tip cap <b>122</b>. However, other suitable materials for the leading and trailing edge segments <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and the tip cap <b>122</b> may be used as well.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Keeping with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the airfoil <b>100</b> has a body section <b>124</b> that extends radially along the span S, as well as a tip section <b>126</b> that extends radially along the span S and includes the tip <b>108</b> of the airfoil <b>100</b>. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the airfoil <b>100</b> also includes a transition section <b>128</b> disposed between the body section <b>124</b> and the tip section <b>126</b> such that the transition section <b>128</b> extends from the body section <b>124</b> to the tip section <b>126</b>. In other embodiments, the transition section <b>128</b> may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will be appreciated that the composite airfoil <b>100</b> is formed from a composite material. More particularly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the composite airfoil <b>100</b> may be formed from a composite material comprising fibers <b>130</b> disposed in a matrix material <b>132</b>. The composite material in the body section <b>124</b> has a body fiber volume, i.e., the fibers of the composite material forming the body section <b>124</b> together have a volume referred to herein as the body fiber volume. Similarly, the composite material in the tip section <b>126</b> has a tip fiber volume, i.e., the fibers of the composite material forming the tip section <b>126</b> together have a volume referred to herein as the tip fiber volume. The body fiber volume is greater than the tip fiber volume, as shown through a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, which illustrates a portion of the tip section <b>126</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, which illustrates a portion of the body section <b>124</b>. More specifically, the volume or density of fibers in the body section <b>124</b> is greater than the volume or density of fibers in the tip section <b>126</b>. As such, the tip section <b>126</b> has a reduced fiber content relative to the body section <b>124</b>, and the airfoil <b>100</b> may be described as having a low fiber volume tip.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The reduced fiber content of the tip section <b>126</b> facilitates breakup of the tip section <b>126</b>, e.g., when the tip section <b>126</b> experiences a load over a tip fracture load. For instance, where the composite airfoil <b>100</b> is a composite fan blade <b>40</b> of the gas turbine engine fan <b>38</b>, the threshold tip fracture load may be exceeded when the tip <b>108</b> rubs against the fan case <b>50</b> following large bird ingestion into the fan <b>38</b> and/or resulting from unbalance after a fan blade out (FBO) event. The frangible tip section <b>126</b> of the airfoil <b>100</b> allows the tip section <b>126</b> to disintegrate and thereby stop rubbing against the fan case <b>50</b>. More particularly, the fibers <b>130</b> take loads in the radial direction R, and with a reduced amount of fiber to reinforce the composite material, the load carrying capability is reduced in the reduced fiber tip section <b>126</b> such that the composite material in the tip section <b>126</b> breaks up sooner than, or under a lighter load than, other portions of the airfoil <b>100</b>. The disintegration of the tip section <b>126</b> may reduce or eliminate high rub conditions between the airfoil and another component and/or unbalance conditions. As such, the tip section <b>126</b> may be described as a fuse zone, which controls the portion of the airfoil <b>100</b> that may be lost or released by failing before the airfoil areas adjacent to the fuse zone, e.g., during impact from a foreign object. Unlike the tip section <b>126</b>, the higher fiber content body section <b>124</b> may remain intact, which may, e.g., preserve a sufficient airfoil shape for continued operation of the engine <b>10</b> and/or help prevent rotor unbalance.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, the composite material in the transition section <b>128</b> has a transition fiber volume, i.e., the fibers of the composite material forming the transition section <b>128</b> together have a volume referred to herein as the transition fiber volume. The transition section <b>128</b>, as a transition between the body section <b>124</b> and the tip section <b>126</b>, has a reduced fiber volume compared to the body section <b>124</b> but a greater fiber volume compared to the tip section <b>126</b>, as illustrated by a comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, depicting a portion of the transition section <b>128</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A</figref> (tip section <b>126</b>) and <b>3</b>B (body section <b>124</b>). That is, the body fiber volume is greater than the transition fiber volume, and the transition fiber volume is greater than the tip fiber volume. In some embodiments, the fibers in the transition section <b>128</b> may be distributed such that the amount of fiber tapers from a first segment of the transition section <b>128</b> adjacent the body section <b>124</b> to a second segment adjacent the tip section <b>126</b>. More particularly, the transition section <b>128</b> may have a graded fiber content, which is largest near the body section and diminishes along the radial direction R to a smallest transition section fiber content near the tip section <b>126</b>. As previously described, in some embodiments, the transition section <b>128</b> may be omitted. In some such embodiments, the fiber content in each of the body section <b>124</b> and the tip section <b>126</b> may be graded such that the amount of fiber in the airfoil <b>100</b> tapers from a largest fiber content near the root <b>106</b> to a smallest fiber content near the tip <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A reduced fiber content may be achieved in different ways. For example, the composite material may comprise a plurality of prepreg layers or prepreg plies <b>134</b>. Each prepreg layer <b>134</b> contains a plurality of fibers <b>130</b> disposed in the matrix material <b>132</b>, and in various embodiments described herein, the composite material in the tip section <b>126</b> has a higher matrix material to fiber ratio than the composite material in the body section <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the fibers <b>130</b> in each layer <b>134</b> may extend substantially along the same direction such that the prepreg layers <b>134</b> may be referred to as a unidirectional prepreg. The prepreg layers <b>134</b> may be oriented within the composite airfoil <b>100</b> to form a unidirectional laminate, i.e., the fibers throughout the airfoil <b>100</b> extend substantially along the same direction. In other embodiments, the prepreg layers <b>134</b> may be oriented such that the fibers <b>130</b> extend in 0/+45/&#x2212;45/+90 directions. More specifically, when laying up the prepreg layers <b>134</b>, unidirectional prepreg layers <b>134</b> may be laid up such that the fibers <b>130</b> within the prepreg layers <b>134</b> alternate between a 0&#xb0; orientation, a +45&#xb0; orientation, a &#x2212;45&#xb0; orientation, and a +90&#xb0; orientation with respect to a reference axis, such as an axial centerline of the fan case <b>50</b> where the composite component is the composite airfoil <b>100</b> of a fan blade <b>40</b>. Other orientations of fibers <b>130</b> may be used as well, e.g., 0/90 directions with respect to the reference axis or other directions with respect to the reference axis. Further, the airfoil <b>100</b> may be formed with the fibers <b>130</b> having such orientations, e.g., to form a unidirectional laminate, along the 0/+45/&#x2212;45/+90 directions, and along 0/90 directions, even where the composite material forming the airfoil <b>100</b> is not a composite prepreg material.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment the prepreg layers <b>134</b> forming the tip section <b>126</b> may have fewer fibers per layer than the prepreg layers <b>134</b> forming the body section <b>124</b>. Accordingly, when the tip section prepreg layers <b>134</b> are stacked together to form the tip section <b>126</b> and the body section prepreg layers <b>134</b> are stacked together to form the body section <b>124</b>, the tip section <b>126</b> has fewer fibers, or a lower tip fiber volume, than the body section <b>124</b>. Similarly, the transition section <b>128</b> may be formed from prepreg layers <b>134</b> that have fewer fibers per layer than the prepreg layers <b>134</b> forming the body section <b>124</b> but more fibers per layer than the prepreg layers <b>134</b> forming the tip section <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As another example, additional matrix material <b>132</b> may be disposed between adjacent layers forming the tip section <b>126</b>, which decreases the fiber content as a percentage of the total material content of the tip section <b>126</b>. For embodiments including a transition section <b>128</b>, additional matrix material <b>132</b> also may be disposed between layers forming the transition section <b>128</b> to reduce the fiber content of the transition section <b>128</b> compared to the body section <b>124</b>, with more matrix material <b>132</b> disposed between the tip section layers <b>134</b> to further reduce the fiber content. More particularly, in some embodiments, the same prepreg layers <b>134</b> may be used to form the body section <b>124</b> and the tip section <b>126</b>, as well as the transition section <b>128</b>. However, matrix material <b>132</b> may be inserted between prepreg layers <b>134</b> of the tip section <b>126</b>, while only prepreg layers <b>134</b> are used to form the body section <b>124</b>. For instance, the composite material may be a polymer matrix composite (PMC), and the matrix material <b>132</b> may be a resin. A first volume of the resin matrix material <b>132</b> may be disposed between the prepreg layers <b>134</b> forming the tip section <b>126</b>, thereby decreasing the fiber content of the tip section <b>126</b> compared to the body section <b>124</b> without the matrix material <b>132</b> between its layers <b>134</b>. For example, prepreg layers <b>134</b> may be alternated with layers of resin matrix material <b>132</b> to form the tip section <b>126</b>; in some embodiments, the layers of resin <b>132</b> may be injected or otherwise inserted between adjacent prepreg layers <b>134</b> such that pockets of resin are disposed among the composite prepreg layers <b>134</b>. In embodiments including the transition section <b>128</b>, a second volume of the resin matrix material <b>132</b> may be inserted between prepreg layers <b>134</b> of the transition section <b>128</b> to decrease the fiber content of the transition section <b>128</b> relative to the body section <b>124</b> but maintain a higher fiber content relative to the tip section <b>126</b>. Like the first volume of resin <b>132</b>, the second volume of resin <b>132</b> may be alternated with composite prepreg layers <b>134</b> to form the transition section <b>128</b>. It will be appreciated that the first volume of the resin matrix material <b>132</b> may be greater than the second volume of the resin matrix material <b>132</b> where the total volume of the tip section <b>126</b> and the transition section <b>128</b> are equal. Otherwise, the first volume and the second volume may be appropriate to ensure the fiber content as a percentage of total volume is less in the tip section <b>126</b> than in the transition section <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tip section <b>126</b> may run chordwise, or along the chord length of the airfoil <b>100</b>, or in other embodiments, the tip section <b>126</b> may run along any portion of the chord length of the airfoil <b>100</b>. Further, the tip section <b>126</b> may be distributed along the radial length or span S of the airfoil <b>100</b> or any portion of the span S of the airfoil <b>100</b>. Exemplary radial locations for the tip section <b>126</b>, as measured radially distal from the root <b>106</b>, may include, but are not limited to, from about 50% of the span S to 100% of the span S (i.e., from about mid-span to the tip <b>108</b>); from about 60% of the span S to 100% of the span S; from about 75% of the span S to 100% of the span S; from about 80% of the span S to 100% of the span S; and from about 85% of the span S to 100% of the span S. Exemplary radial locations for the transition section <b>128</b>, as measured radially distal from the root <b>106</b>, may include, but are not limited to, from about 40% of the span S to the tip section <b>126</b>; from about 50% of the span S to the tip section <b>126</b>; from about 60% of the span S to the tip section <b>126</b>; and from about 75% of the span S to the tip section <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As previously described, a leading edge segment <b>118</b> may be applied over the leading edge <b>110</b>, including over at least a portion of the leading edge <b>110</b> in the tip section <b>126</b>. The leading edge segment <b>118</b> may comprise a first breakaway feature <b>136</b> such that the leading edge segment <b>118</b> is configured to fracture under the tip fracture load. Similarly, a trailing edge segment <b>120</b> may be applied over the trailing edge <b>112</b> along at least a portion of the trailing edge <b>112</b> in the tip section <b>126</b>.

The present subject matter also provides methods for forming frangible tip airfoils. Such frangible tip airfoils may help in reducing rub between a non-stationary airfoil and a stationary component. For example, rub between a fan blade and an abradable fan case and/or a fan blade and a trench filler may be reduced for fan blades having frangible tips. The frangible tip airfoils may have a balanced design, e.g., the frangible tip area may be configured to fail once a load on the tip area meets or exceeds a threshold value. For instance, a fan blade having a low fiber volume tip and/or a tapered thickness tip cap may be designed such that the tip does not fail in light rub conditions or events, e.g., cross wind or medium flocking bird impact, but does fail in higher rub conditions or events, e.g., fan blade out (FBO) or large bird ingestion. Thus, the present subject matter may reduce fan unbalance, e.g., in FBO, and thereby reduce loads under an FBO event. Moreover, by reducing rub between the airfoil and an adjacent component, current apparatus intended to mitigate the effects of airfoil rub can be reduced or eliminated. For example, fan blades having low fiber volume tips and/or tapered thickness tip caps as described herein may reduce or completely eliminate the thickness of the current trench-filler system on the fan casing of certain gas turbine engines. By reducing or eliminating apparatus such as the trench-filler system and/or other devices for minimizing the effects of airfoil or blade rub, the overall weight and cost of the airfoil module (e.g., the fan module) can be significantly reduced. Reducing the weight of the module can lead to performance benefits. Further, as described herein, airfoils having frangible tips may be achieved without compromising on the strength and durability of the airfoil, e.g., frangible tip fan blades formed as described herein may have comparable strength and durability of fan blades with non-frangible tips. Other advantages of the subject matter described herein also may be realized by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further aspects of the invention are provided by the subject matter of the following clauses:</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">1.
