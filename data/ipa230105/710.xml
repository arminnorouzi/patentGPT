Exoskeletons can enhance the function of different joints in the body, such as an ankle, a knee, or an elbow. For example, an exoskeleton can include an actuator configured to transmit torque to the joint in order to actuate it.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This specification describes an actuation system for exoskeletons and other wearable assistive devices, including actuation systems that use a differential pulley drum (e.g., a differential windlass) to selectively apply force to actuate a joint of a wearer's body.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By utilizing the differential pulley drum, the actuation system described in this specification allows for highly customizable transmission ratios without gears (e.g., by adjusting the radius of one part of the differential pulley drum relative to the other part) and for significantly more freedom in the design of the actuation system. Accordingly, the actuation system can be applicable to different joints of a wearer's upper and lower body, and it can accommodate different body types and force delivery requirements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The actuation system can include a motor coupled to the differential pulley drum and configured to be placed at one side of the joint, a pulley or other guide member to be placed at the other side of the joint, a flexible sleeve extending from the differential pulley drum to the pulley, and a strand that extends through the flexible sleeve around the guide member to form a loop. The strand can be wound around the differential pulley drum. By engaging the motor to rotate the differential pulley drum and shorten the length of the un-wound strand loop, the actuation system can control the tension in the strand loop and consequently the force pulling up on the pulley. The flexible sleeve can freely conform to the body. This arrangement can be used to provide actuation for a shoulder, an ankle, knee, elbow, wrist, or other joint.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many conventional exoskeletons feature mechanical systems that are bulky, heavy, difficult to use, and lead to large penalties for metabolic cost of transport. For example, current actuation strategies require compression sheaths and rigid structures alongside the strand to maintain compressive reaction forces, which increase the overall weight of the system, add nonlinear effects in the force transmission and decrease controllability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By contrast, the assistive device described in this specification includes active components arranged on one side of the joint, and only a passive guide member arranged on the other side of the joint, which makes it substantially lightweight and comfortable to wear. For example, when used with an ankle, the guide member can be a pulley coupled to the back of the wearer's foot, so that winding strand around a differential pulley drum at the upper portion of the system pulls up on the back of the foot. In this case, the motor, the differential pulley drum, battery, control electronics, sensors, and other components can be placed at the upper shin, while the pulley is coupled to a wearer's shoe. This places most of the mass of the actuation system, and especially the heaviest components such as the motor assembly and the differential pulley drum, relatively high on the body (e.g., less distal). This provides good metabolic efficiency and comfort, since efficiency is heavily penalized by mass the further down the leg it goes. Moreover, the assistive device can feature a flexible sleeve with a spring, allowing for substantially low profile and flexible form factor that can conform to the body and minimize strand slacking.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, currently known exoskeletons often require artificial joint components in addition to the biological joints in order to assist with the desired plane of movement. Accordingly, they can restrict the freedom of movement of the joint in directions other than the direction in which the joint is being actuated. For example, mechanically applying ankle flexion restricts inversion/eversion and internal/external rotation of the foot.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The assistive device described in this specification can use the joint of the wearer's body without a separate, artificial joint that can interfere with or restrict natural movement of the patient's joint. For example, when used with the ankle, coupling the guide member to the back of the wearer's foot and delivering tension to the strand that forms a loop around the guide member allows to pull up on the back of the foot such that the wearer's biological joint, the ankle, is actuated and no bulky or restrictive components hinder other natural movement of the ankle. The assistive device can induce plantarflexion and/or dorsiflexion (e.g., flexion and extension of the ankle) without restricting inversion and eversion (e.g., side-to-side movements that roll the sole of the foot medially and laterally) and without restricting medial and lateral rotation of the ankle (e.g., internal rotation and external rotation).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Lastly, traditional spool actuators (e.g., actuators having a single spool and a single cable winding around the spool) have a lower limit on the spool radius, which is dictated by the strength of the spool material and the tension forces in the cable, and significantly limits the customization and freedom of actuator design.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">By contrast, the assistive device described in this specification is not limited by the spool radius, is highly customizable, and allows for a high rotary-to-linear transmission (e.g., the ratio of the rotation of the differential pulley drum and the displacement of the strand connected to the pulley).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented so as to realize, but are not limited to, one or more of the following advantages. For example, the assistive device can have a low profile, and being substantially flexible, compliant, lightweight, and comfortable, while maintaining the ability to effectively assist with natural movements of the wearer's body without unduly restricting them. Further, the device may use the biological joint without the need for any artificial joints (e.g., hinges integrated as part of the overall mechanical system. Further, the device can freely conform to the curves of the wearer's body and can be highly customizable.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a human wearing an example ankle joint assistive device according to a first implementation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a human wearing an example knee joint assistive device according to the first implementation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates the medial view of an example assistive device according to the first version.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates the rear view of an example assistive device according to the first implementation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates the lateral view of an example assistive device according to the first implementation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a first implementation of flexible sleeve.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a second implementation of flexible sleeve.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a third implementation of flexible sleeve.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the rear view of an example assistive device according to a second implementation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates the side view of an example assistive device according to a third implementation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates the rear view of an example assistive device according to the third implementation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates the side view of an example assistive device according to a fourth implementation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates the rear view of an example assistive device according to the fourth implementation.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The assistive device described in this specification effectively converts the rotation of a differential pulley drum into actuation of a joint of a wearer's body. By varying the radius of one portion of the drum relative to the other, the linear-to-rotary transmission can be customized, which allows to accommodate different joints of a wearer's body, body types and force delivery requirements. The heaviest components of the system, such as the motor assembly and the differential pulley drum, can be placed relatively high on the body (e.g., less distal), thereby reducing metabolic cost of transport. Housing the strand within a flexible sleeve allows the assistive device to freely conform to the curves of a wearer's body and minimize slacking of the strand. Placing the active components on one side of the joint and only a passive guide member on the other allows for freedom of movement of the joint in directions other than the direction in which it is being actuated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a human <b>100</b> wearing an example assistive device according to a first implementation, an assistive device <b>110</b> in this example. The structural components of the first implementation of the assistive device <b>110</b> will be described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref>. The assistive device <b>110</b> may be worn on the lower limb in order to assist the wearer <b>100</b> with the actuation of the ankle joint during walking. For example, the assistive device <b>110</b> may deliver torque to the ankle joint to induce plantar flexion of the foot (extension of the ankle) at each step. Specifically, the rotation of a differential pulley drum (not shown) of the assistive device can be effectively converted into activation of the joint. Advantageously, the differential pulley drum can be designed in such a way so as to effectively accommodate the actuation of a joint with a low degree of flexion (e.g., an ankle, in this case). For example, by varying the radius of one drum portion relative to the other, the rotary-to-linear transmission can be customized to suit a particular joint. Further, the assistive device <b>110</b> can have substantially low profile, e.g., the components of the assistive device <b>110</b> can conform freely to the body, and it can be comfortably worn over or under clothes.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another implementation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a human <b>100</b> wearing an example assistive device <b>110</b> according to the first implementation, but in this implementation the assistive device <b>110</b> is worn on the lower limb in order to assist the wearer <b>100</b> with the actuation of the knee joint during walking. For example, the actuator <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may deliver torque to the knee joint to induce flexion of the joint at each step. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the rotation of a differential pulley drum (not shown) of the assistive device can be effectively converted into actuation of the joint. However, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the assistive device <b>110</b> delivers torque to a knee joint, i.e., a joint with a high degree of flexion. Advantageously, the rotary-to-linear transmission of the differential pulley drum can be customized to accommodate joints with a high degree of flexion as well. Furthermore, the assistive device <b>110</b> includes a flexible sleeve (not shown) that can freely bend and conform to the body even when the knee is flexed to a high degree (e.g., to approximately 140 degrees). The flexible sleeve (not shown) can house a strand that extends through a resilient member inside the flexible sleeve and connects the active components arranged on one side of the joint and a passive guide pulley on the other. When the knee is flexed to a high degree, the resistance of the strand against the resilient element inside the sleeve is increased, which, in turn, decreases the amount of power delivered by the motor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The components of four different implementations of the assistive device (<b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>410</b>) are described below. While the first implementation of the assistive device <b>110</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, is shown as being worn on the lower limb, all four implementations (<b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>410</b>) may be applicable to other joints of both the upper and the lower body such as, but not limited to, an elbow joint, a shoulder joint, a wrist joint, etc. Further, all four different implementations (<b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>410</b>) include a guide member, such as a pulley, coupled to a first attachment portion which may be placed on the wearer's body at one side of the joint, and active components, including the differential pulley drum, placed on the other side of the joint. The pulley may function together with the strand and the active components of the assistive device to provide the force to actuate the joint in such a way that the freedom of movement of the joint in other directions is preserved. Further, all four implementations (<b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>410</b>) may include a differential pulley drum having a first portion with a first drum radius and a second portion with a second drum radius. Since the rotary-to-linear transmission in the differential pulley drum depends on the difference between the first drum radius and the second drum radius, it may be easily and effectively customized by simply changing the radius of one of the drums relative to the other. This, in turn, makes the assistive device highly customizable and compliant. Further, all four implementations (<b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, and <b>410</b>) include a flexible sleeve that houses the strand, allowing for a low profile and flexible form factor that may easily conform to the body.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> show medial, rear, and lateral views, respectively, of an example assistive device <b>110</b> according to a first implementation.

The motor <b>220</b> and the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> include a common axis of rotation such that, when the motor <b>220</b> engages, it rotates the differential pulley drum <b>220</b>, which, in turn, increases (or decreases) a tension in the strand, thereby shortening (or lengthening) the loop of the strand <b>250</b>. When the loop of the strand <b>250</b> is shortened, the force in the strand <b>250</b> is converted to a linear motion of the lower attachment portion <b>280</b> towards the upper attachment portion <b>235</b>, thereby actuating the ankle joint.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The differential pulley drum <b>240</b> may have a first drum portion <b>240</b><i>a </i>and a second drum portion <b>240</b><i>a</i>.

The strand <b>250</b> may be a flexible element such as a cable, a belt, a strip, a string, a filament, a thread, etc. The strand <b>250</b> may wrap helically around the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> (e.g., if the strand <b>250</b> is a cable), or the strand <b>250</b> may wrap radially around the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> (e.g., if the strand <b>250</b> is a belt). In the latter implementation, allowing the strand <b>250</b> to wrap radially around the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> may allow for a more compact form factor of the actuator <b>110</b>.

The differential pulley drum <b>240</b> may receive and release a portion of the strand <b>250</b> in response to the operation of the motor <b>220</b>. For example, the motor <b>220</b> may rotate the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> and the strand <b>250</b> may be released from the first portion <b>240</b><i>a </i>of the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> and received by the second portion <b>240</b><i>b </i>of the differential pulley drum <b>240</b>. A position encoder coupled to, or integrated with, the motor <b>220</b>, may determine a position of the motor <b>220</b> or a component coupled to the motor <b>220</b>. The actuator <b>200</b> may also include a load sensor integrated with the motor <b>220</b> and coupled to the strand <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The motor <b>220</b> and the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> may be arranged in a housing <b>230</b> that may be coupled to a first attachment portion <b>235</b> arranged on one side of the joint. In some implementations, the motor <b>220</b> (e.g., the shaft of the motor <b>220</b>) can be arranged in series with the differential pulley drum <b>240</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref>, for an ankle joint assistive device, they may be arranged just below the knee. The first attachment portion <b>235</b> may hold the components on the leg via frictional forces. In some implementations, the load sensor is coupled to the housing <b>230</b>, the differential pulley drum <b>240</b>, and/or a guide <b>290</b>. The load sensor may be configured to measure a load on the strand at a position remote from the position of the load sensor, e.g., measure a load on the strand at a position that is proximal to the other components of the actuator <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The active components handling power and data (the motor <b>220</b> with integrated load cell and position encoder, and the differential pulley drum <b>240</b>) may be arranged in the housing <b>230</b> that is substantially flat, so that they lay flat against the leg <b>200</b> to minimize protrusion. The assistive device <b>200</b> may further include the guide <b>290</b> (e.g., a pulley) arranged on a second attachment portion <b>280</b> on the other side of the joint, which may also lay flat against the body to minimize protrusion. Arranging the components of the actuator <b>110</b> in such a way so as to minimize protrusion with respect to the leg <b>200</b> may give the actuator <b>110</b> overall a substantially low profile and make it comfortable to wear. Since the active components are arranged on one side of the joint with only the passive pulley <b>290</b> on the other, the distal mass may be reduced, which has larger penalties for metabolic cost of transport. The second attachment portion <b>280</b> may consist of a relatively stiff component so as to minimize the deformation of the shoe in response to the applied force and maximize the effective mechanical work delivered to the ankle.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The assistive device <b>110</b> may further include a flexible sleeve <b>270</b> extending between the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> and the pulley <b>290</b> (e.g., extending from one side of the joint to the other side of the joint). The sleeve <b>270</b> may be made from a substantially flexible material, such as fabric, so that it is able to bend and freely conform to the curves of the leg <b>200</b>. In one example, the flexible sleeve <b>270</b> may be attached to the housing <b>230</b> on one side of the joint and attachment portion <b>280</b> on the other side of the joint. In the first implementation of the actuator <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref>, the axis of rotation of the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> may extend through the flexible sleeve <b>270</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The assistive device <b>110</b> may further include a resilient element <b>260</b> extending from the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> and the pulley <b>290</b>, and located within the flexible sleeve <b>270</b>. The resilient element may be a spring, or any other element capable of storing elastic energy, and it may be made of metal, or fatigue resistant thermoplastic. The resilient element <b>260</b> may be coupled to the strand <b>250</b> (e.g., the strand <b>250</b> may extend through the resilient element <b>260</b> in the flexible sleeve <b>270</b>) and it may apply compressive force to the strand <b>250</b> between the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> and the pulley <b>290</b> to maintain the strand <b>250</b> under tension. In this way, the strand <b>250</b> may be easily kept taught to avoid snagging, and arranged closer to the body to avoid protrusion, allowing for substantially low profile and convenience of wear of the actuator <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the resilient element <b>260</b> can be coupled to the housing <b>230</b> and/or the lower attachment portion <b>280</b>. Different configurations of the flexible sleeve <b>270</b>, the resilient element <b>260</b>, and the strand <b>250</b> will be described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The strand <b>250</b> may extend from the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> to the guide member <b>290</b> (i.e., the pulley <b>220</b>) and form a loop around the guide member <b>290</b>. The strand <b>250</b> may connect the motor <b>220</b>, and the differential pulley drum <b>240</b>, arranged on one side of the joint, and the pulley <b>290</b> arranged on the other side of the joint. For example, the cable <b>230</b> may form a loop between the active components and the pulley <b>290</b>. The motor <b>220</b> may rotate the differential pulley drum <b>240</b> to increase tension in the strand <b>250</b> (e.g., to shorten the loop of the strand <b>250</b>) which may transmit force to the biological joint (e.g., ankle joint, in the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref>) and thereby actuate it. In other words, when the motor <b>220</b> rotates the differential pulley drum <b>240</b>, the strand <b>250</b> moves along the pulley <b>290</b> and tension increases. The tension in the stand <b>250</b> is transmitted to the foot as an upward force at the heel where the pulley <b>290</b> is attached. The force translates into a torque of the ankle joint such that the heel moves upward in the direction of the force and the toes of the foot move in the opposite direction. Since the strand <b>250</b> is arranged as a loop around the pulley <b>290</b>, the joint may move freely out of the main plane of actuation. For example, ankle plantar flexion may be applied lifting the heel while not affecting the foot ability to move freely in the yah and roll axis.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one example, the pulley <b>290</b> may be a rolling wheel pulley, such that the strand <b>250</b> is able to travel along with the rolling wheel. The axis of rotation of the pulley <b>290</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the joint. In another example, the pulley <b>290</b> may be a guide pulley with a channel, such that the cable is able to slide in the channel. The guide may be made using low friction plastic such as, but not limited to, Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene plastic. The strand <b>250</b> may slide in the slippery plastic groove of the guide pulley <b>290</b>. Having a passive pulley transmitting force to the biological joint negates the need for mechanically powered artificial joints, which significantly minimizes the overall physicality of the assistive device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">All implementations of the assistive device (<b>11</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>410</b>) may include a high-level controller (not shown), which may determine the course of action, and a low-level controller (not shown), which may determine how the course of action is achieved. The low-level controller may determine the desired force to be applied to the strand at all times to keep it under constant tension. The load sensor may measure the torque due to movement. In response to the measurement, the low-level controller may send a signal to the motor to rotate the differential pulley drum and thereby shorten or lengthen the strand loop. In this way, the active components of the assistive device may form a closed control feedback loop.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate a cross-sectional view of three different implementations (<b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b>) of a flexible sleeve.

Similarly, the second part of the strand <b>650</b>, that is wound around the second drum portion <b>640</b><i>b </i>and is directed by the second guide member <b>645</b><i>b </i>towards the pulley <b>690</b>, can be positioned inside, and extend through, the second bowden cable portion <b>685</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The bowden cable <b>685</b> effectively extends the total length of the assistive device <b>410</b>. This, in turn, can allow arranging the active components (the motor <b>620</b> and the differential pulley drum <b>640</b>) of the assistive device <b>410</b> remotely from the point of actuation of the joint (e.g., on the waist of a wearer, when the device <b>410</b> is arranged to actuate the ankle of the wearer's body). For example, an ankle joint could be powered by motors mounted on the thigh or waist allowing for more configuration flexibility and less distal mass. Further, the bowden cable <b>685</b> section of the assistive device <b>410</b> can be placed over highly curved areas of the body in order to reach distal parts of the body (e.g., a wrist) while keeping the active components proximal (e.g., mounted at the waist).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The fourth implementation of the assistive device <b>410</b> can further include a linear guide pin <b>665</b> attached to the lower attachment portion <b>680</b> and the middle attachment portion <b>695</b> and extending through the flexible sleeve <b>670</b>. The guide pin <b>665</b> can be made of a rigid material (e.g., a metal) and it can provide stiffness to the flexible sleeve <b>670</b>. However, the fourth implementation of the assistive device <b>410</b> can also be implemented without the guide pin <b>665</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The controller and other computing devices part of systems described herein can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware.
