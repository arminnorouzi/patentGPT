In rotary screen printing, a screen-printing cylinder usually interacts with an impression cylinder to form a printing gap. Through the use of a doctor blade, the printing medium, for example printing ink, is applied to the printing material through the screen-printing cylinder. In rotary screen printing, many different printing materials can be printed, for example textiles, carpets, paper, board and films. Rotary screen printing is used firstly during continuous printing, in which the material to be printed is transported from roll to roll. One important use of continuous rotary screen printing is the printing of labels. Secondly, rotary screen printing is also used in sheet-fed printing machines, in which the material to be printed is not fed to the printing machine continuously from roll to roll but in the form of individual sheets to be printed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In rotary screen printing on sheet-fed printing machines, the impression cylinder normally has a gripper system having one or more sheet gripper(s), which entrain the individual sheets and guide them past the screen-printing cylinder. In order to avoid the gripper system of the impression cylinder, which normally projects out of the cylinder shell of the impression cylinder, colliding with the screen-printing cylinder, different solutions have been proposed in the prior art. Firstly, it is known to periodically move out the screen-printing cylinder together with the doctor blade, i.e. to increase the distance from the impression cylinder, in order to create space for the elevated gripper system. Secondly, it is proposed to countersink the gripper system in the impression cylinder.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">European Patent Application EP 0 723 864 A1, corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 5,671,671, describes a rotary screen-printing machine for sheet-fed printing having an impression cylinder which has a cylinder groove in which the sheet gripper is countersunk.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">International Publication WO 99/48690, corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,777, describes a rotary screen-printing process for printing sheets, in which the sheets are guided through a coating section by using grippers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">International Publication WO 01/54907 A1, corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,681,690, describes a sheet-fed printing machine having two screen-printing cylinders for printing on both sides of a printing material, wherein at least one of the screen-printing cylinders has a holding device for the sheet-shaped printing materials, and at least one of the screen-printing cylinders has an indentation on its circumferential surface as a counterpart to the holding device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The prior art devices are associated with disadvantages. The regular movement in and out of a screen-printing cylinder and a doctor blade must be coordinated precisely with the screen-printing cylinder, the doctor blade and the impression cylinder. The simultaneous movement in and out of the screen-printing cylinder and the doctor blade is demanding mechanically and in terms of control, can limit the printing speed and leads to a higher requirement for maintenance of the components involved. Countersinking the gripper system in the impression cylinder places increased requirements on the gripper mechanism, so that it is often not possible for the comparatively robust and economical grippers used in elevated gripper systems to be used. One undesired effect of countersunk gripper systems is increased creasing of the guided sheet. That can lead to problems in the transfer of the sheet to the next driver roll and when stacking the finished printed sheets.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a screen-printing cylinder, which overcomes the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known cylinders of this general type. A printing system should include a screen-printing cylinder and an impression cylinder having an elevated gripper system for rotary screen printing of sheet-shaped printing materials which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art. The printing system should also be compatible with conventional impression cylinders having an elevated gripper system and not require the screen-printing cylinder to be moved in and out frequently. Intensified creasing of the guided sheet should be avoided.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Surprisingly, it has been found that, in a printing system including a screen-printing cylinder and an impression cylinder having an elevated sheet gripper system, it is not necessary to move out the screen-printing cylinder before contact with the elevated sheet gripper system of the impression cylinder if the contact points of the screen-printing cylinder with the sheet gripper system of the impression cylinder are provided with a resilient and/or springy surface element.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The printing system according to the invention makes it possible to use conventional impression cylinders having an elevated gripper system and places lower requirements on the control and mechanism of the cylinders. Moving the screen-printing cylinder in and out frequently is avoided. The wear and the requirement for maintenance of the components involved are reduced. No undesired creasing of the guided sheet during transport through the printing gap occurs. Printed results of high optical quality are obtained.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a printing system for rotary screen printing, comprising a screen-printing cylinder and an impression cylinder interacting with the screen-printing cylinder, the impression cylinder having one or more surface element(s) projecting out of its cylinder shell, and the screen-printing cylinder having one or more flexible surface element(s) on its cylinder shell which interact with the one or more surface element(s) projecting out of the cylinder shell of the impression cylinder.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment, the one or more surface element(s) projecting out of the cylinder shell of the impression cylinder are one or more sheet gripper(s).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further preferred embodiment, the one or more flexible surface element(s) of the screen-printing cylinder in the printing system according to the invention are configured to be resilient and/or springy.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Within the context of the present invention, a &#x201c;flexible surface element&#x201d; is understood in particular to be a surface element which, under the action of force, can be brought from its original form into a stretched form by an element projecting out of the cylinder shell of the impression cylinder and, when the action of force is ended, returns from this stretched form into its original form again. The one or more flexible surface element(s) are preferably configured to be resilient and/or springy.
