AAV belongs to the parvovirus family and contains a single-stranded DNA genome flanked by two inverted terminal repeats. Dozens of naturally occurring AAV capsids have been reported; their unique capsid structures enable them to recognize and transduce different cell types and organs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since the first trial which started in 1981, there has not been any vector-related toxicity reported in clinical trials of AAV vector-based gene therapy. The ever-accumulating safety records of AAV vector in clinical trials, combined with demonstrated efficacy, show that AAV is an attractive platform. In particular, AAV is easily manipulated as the virus has a single-stranded DNA virus with a relatively small genome (&#x2dc;4.7 kb) and simple genetic components&#x2014;inverted terminal repeats (ITR), the Rep and Cap genes. Only the ITRs and AAV capsid protein are required in AAV vectors, with the ITRs serving as replication and packaging signals for vector production and the capsid proteins playing a central role by forming capsids to accommodate vector genome DNA and determining tissue tropism.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">AAV are among the most effective vector candidates for gene therapy due to their low immunogenicity and non-pathogenic nature. However, despite allowing for efficient gene transfer, the AAV vectors currently used in the clinic can be hindered by preexisting immunity to the virus and restricted tissue tropism. Thus, additional AAV vectors are needed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Engineered AAV3B capsids are provided which are useful for generating rAAV vectors for delivery of a gene product.

As used herein, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d;, refers to one or more, for example, &#x201c;an ocular cell&#x201d; is understood to represent one or more ocular cells.

While various embodiments in the specification are presented using &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; language, under other circumstances, a related embodiment is also intended to be interpreted and described using &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; or &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; language.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With regard to the following description, it is intended that each of the compositions herein described, is useful, in another embodiment, in the methods of the invention. In addition, it is also intended that each of the compositions described as useful in the methods, is, in another embodiment, itself an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy is a promising way to treat diseases, especially rare diseases that have very few effective treatments. AAVs isolated from natural sources have limitations in terms of gene delivery efficiency and specificity. Directed evolution has been used to generate AAV mutants that may overcome those drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">We used a scorecard approach to generate the initial diversity of the AAV3B hypervariable region (HVR) VIII. We then conducted selections in human-hepatocytes-xenografted Fah<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>/Rag2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>/Il2rg<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> (FRG) mice, by injecting the libraries intravenously and retrieving AAV cDNA from human hepatocytes isolated from those mice to prepare new libraries for the next rounds. Sixteen AAV3B variants that showed dramatic increase of relative frequencies were evaluated in nonhuman primates (NHPs) with a validated barcode system. Most of the 16 variants were better than AAV3B in terms of liver transduction, with some showing high liver specificity. Two variants were further evaluated with a therapeutic transgene for liver gene therapy in NHPs and the preliminary results confirmed the NHP barcode evaluation result.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A &#x201c;recombinant AAV&#x201d; or &#x201c;rAAV&#x201d; is a DNAse-resistant viral particle containing two elements, an AAV capsid and a vector genome containing at least a non-AAV coding sequence packaged within the AAV capsid. Unless otherwise specified, this term may be used interchangeably with the phrase &#x201c;rAAV vector&#x201d;. The rAAV is a &#x201c;replication-defective virus&#x201d; or &#x201c;viral vector&#x201d;, as it lacks any functional AAV rep gene or functional AAV cap gene and cannot generate progeny. In certain embodiments, the only AAV sequences are the AAV inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITRs), typically located at the extreme 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the vector genome in order to allow the gene and regulatory sequences located between the ITRs to be packaged within the AAV capsid.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, a &#x201c;vector genome&#x201d; refers to the nucleic acid sequence packaged inside the rAAV capsid which forms a viral particle. Such a nucleic acid sequence contains AAV inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITRs). In the examples herein, a vector genome contains, at a minimum, from 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;, an AAV 5&#x2032; ITR, coding sequence(s), and an AAV 3&#x2032; ITR. ITRs from AAV2, a different source AAV than the capsid, or other than full-length ITRs may be selected. In certain embodiments, the ITRs are from the same AAV source as the AAV which provides the rep function during production or a transcomplementing AAV. Further, other ITRs may be used. Further, the vector genome contains regulatory sequences which direct expression of the gene products. Suitable components of a vector genome are discussed in more detail herein. The vector genome is sometimes referred to herein as the &#x201c;minigene&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A rAAV is composed of an AAV capsid and a vector genome. An AAV capsid is an assembly of a heterogeneous population of vp1, a heterogeneous population of vp2, and a heterogeneous population of vp3 proteins. As used herein when used to refer to vp capsid proteins, the term &#x201c;heterogeneous&#x201d; or any grammatical variation thereof, refers to a population consisting of elements that are not the same, for example, having vp1, vp2 or vp3 monomers (proteins) with different modified amino acid sequences.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;heterogeneous population&#x201d; as used in connection with vp1, vp2 and vp3 proteins (alternatively termed isoforms), refers to differences in the amino acid sequence of the vp1, vp2 and vp3 proteins within a capsid. The AAV capsid contains subpopulations within the vp1 proteins, within the vp2 proteins and within the vp3 proteins which have modifications from the predicted amino acid residues. These subpopulations include, at a minimum, certain deamidated asparagine (N or Asn) residues. For example, certain subpopulations comprise at least one, two, three or four highly deamidated asparagines (N) positions in asparagine-glycine pairs and optionally further comprising other deamidated amino acids, wherein the deamidation results in an amino acid change and other optional modifications.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, a &#x201c;subpopulation&#x201d; of vp proteins refers to a group of vp proteins which has at least one defined characteristic in common and which consists of at least one group member to less than all members of the reference group, unless otherwise specified. For example, a &#x201c;subpopulation&#x201d; of vp1 proteins may be at least one (1) vp1 protein and less than all vp1 proteins in an assembled AAV capsid, unless otherwise specified. A &#x201c;subpopulation&#x201d; of vp3 proteins may be one (1) vp3 protein to less than all vp3 proteins in an assembled AAV capsid, unless otherwise specified. For example, vp1 proteins may be a subpopulation of vp proteins; vp2 proteins may be a separate subpopulation of vp proteins, and vp3 are yet a further subpopulation of vp proteins in an assembled AAV capsid. In another example, vp1, vp2 and vp3 proteins may contain subpopulations having different modifications, e.g., at least one, two, three or four highly deamidated asparagines, e.g., at asparagine-glycine pairs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Unless otherwise specified, highly deamidated refers to at least 45% deamidated, at least 50% deamidated, at least 60% deamidated, at least 65% deamidated, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or up to about 100% deamidated at a referenced amino acid position, as compared to the predicted amino acid sequence at the reference amino acid position. Such percentages may be determined using 2D-gel, mass spectrometry techniques, or other suitable techniques.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Without wishing to be bound by theory, the deamidation of at least highly deamidated residues in the vp proteins in the AAV capsid is believed to be primarily non-enzymatic in nature, being caused by functional groups within the capsid protein which deamidate selected asparagines, and to a lesser extent, glutamine residues. Efficient capsid assembly of the majority of deamidation vp1 proteins indicates that either these events occur following capsid assembly or that deamidation in individual monomers (vp1, vp2 or vp3) is well-tolerated structurally and largely does not affect assembly dynamics. Extensive deamidation in the VP1-unique (VP1-u) region (&#x2dc;aa 1-137), generally considered to be located internally prior to cellular entry, suggests that VP deamidation may occur prior to capsid assembly.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Without wishing to be bound by theory, the deamidation of N may occur through its C-terminus residue's backbone nitrogen atom conducts a nucleophilic attack to the Asn side chain amide group carbon atom. An intermediate ring-closed succinimide residue is believed to form. The succinimide residue then conducts fast hydrolysis to lead to the final product aspartic acid (Asp) or iso aspartic acid (IsoAsp). Therefore, in certain embodiments, the deamidation of asparagine (N or Asn) leads to an Asp or IsoAsp, which may interconvert through the succinimide intermediate e.g., as illustrated below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="52.15mm" wi="138.51mm" file="US20230002788A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">As provided herein, each deamidated N in the VP1, VP2 or VP3 may independently be aspartic acid (Asp), isoaspartic acid (isoAsp), aspartate, and/or an interconverting blend of Asp and isoAsp, or combinations thereof. Any suitable ratio of &#x3b1;- and isoaspartic acid may be present. For example, in certain embodiments, the ratio may be from 10:1 to 1:10 aspartic to isoaspartic, about 50:50 aspartic: isoaspartic, or about 1:3 aspartic: isoaspartic, or another selected ratio.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In certain embodiments, one or more glutamine (Q) may deamidates to glutamic acid (Glu), i.e., &#x3b1;-glutamic acid, &#x3b3;-glutamic acid (Glu), or a blend of &#x3b1;- and &#x3b3;-glutamic acid, which may interconvert through a common glutarinimide intermediate. Any suitable ratio of &#x3b1;- and &#x3b3;-glutamic acid may be present.

Online chromatography may be performed with an Acclaim PepMap column and a Thermo UltiMate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive HF with a NanoFlex source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS data is acquired using a data-dependent top-20 method for the Q Exactive HF, dynamically choosing the most abundant not-yet-sequenced precursor ions from the survey scans (200-2000 m/z). Sequencing is performed via higher energy collisional dissociation fragmentation with a target value of 1e5 ions determined with predictive automatic gain control and an isolation of precursors was performed with a window of 4 m/z. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200. Resolution for HCD spectra may be set to 30,000 at m/z200 with a maximum ion injection time of 50 ms and a normalized collision energy of 30. The S-lens RF level may be set at 50, to give optimal transmission of the m/z region occupied by the peptides from the digest. Precursor ions may be excluded with single, unassigned, or six and higher charge states from fragmentation selection. BioPharma Finder 1.0 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific) may be used for analysis of the data acquired. For peptide mapping, searches are performed using a single-entry protein FASTA database with carbamidomethylation set as a fixed modification; and oxidation, deamidation, and phosphorylation set as variable modifications, a 10-ppm mass accuracy, a high protease specificity, and a confidence level of 0.8 for MS/MS spectra. Examples of suitable proteases may include, e.g., trypsin or chymotrypsin. Mass spectrometric identification of deamidated peptides is relatively straightforward, as deamidation adds to the mass of intact molecule+0.984 Da (the mass difference between &#x2014;OH and &#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>groups). The percent deamidation of a particular peptide is determined by mass area of the deamidated peptide divided by the sum of the area of the deamidated and native peptides. Considering the number of possible deamidation sites, isobaric species which are deamidated at different sites may co-migrate in a single peak. Consequently, fragment ions originating from peptides with multiple potential deamidation sites can be used to locate or differentiate multiple sites of deamidation. In these cases, the relative intensities within the observed isotope patterns can be used to specifically determine the relative abundance of the different deamidated peptide isomers. This method assumes that the fragmentation efficiency for all isomeric species is the same and independent on the site of deamidation. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that a number of variations on these illustrative methods can be used. For example, suitable mass spectrometers may include, e.g, a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (QTOF), such as a Waters Xevo or Agilent 6530 or an orbitrap instrument, such as the Orbitrap Fusion or Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher). Suitably liquid chromatography systems include, e.g., Acquity UPLC system from Waters or Agilent systems (1100 or 1200 series). Suitable data analysis software may include, e.g., MassLynx (Waters), Pinpoint and Pepfinder (Thermo Fischer Scientific), Mascot (Matrix Science), Peaks DB (Bioinformatics Solutions). Still other techniques may be described, e.g., in X. Jin et al, Hu Gene Therapy Methods, Vol. 28, No. 5, pp. 255-267, published online Jun. 16, 2017.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In addition to deamidations, other modifications may occur do not result in conversion of one amino acid to a different amino acid residue. Such modifications may include acetylated residues, isomerizations, phosphorylations, or oxidations. Modulation of Deamidation: In certain embodiments, the AAV is modified to change the glycine in an asparagine-glycine pair, to reduce deamidation. In other embodiments, the asparagine is altered to a different amino acid, e.g., a glutamine which deamidates at a slower rate; or to an amino acid which lacks amide groups (e.g., glutamine and asparagine contain amide groups); and/or to an amino acid which lacks amine groups (e.g., lysine, arginine and histidine contain amine groups). As used herein, amino acids lacking amide or amine side groups refer to, e.g., glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, cystine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, and/or proline. Modifications such as described may be in one, two, or three of the asparagine-glycine pairs found in the encoded AAV amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, such modifications are not made in all four of the asparagine-glycine pairs. Thus, a method for reducing deamidation of AAV and/or engineered AAV variants having lower deamidation rates. Additionally, or alternatively one or more other amide amino acids may be changed to a non-amide amino acid to reduce deamidation of the AAV. In certain embodiments, a mutant AAV capsid as described herein contains a mutation in an asparagine-glycine pair, such that the glycine is changed to an alanine or a serine. A mutant AAV capsid may contain one, two or three mutants where the reference AAV natively contains four NG pairs. In certain embodiments, an AAV capsid may contain one, two, three or four such mutants where the reference AAV natively contains five NG pairs. In certain embodiments, a mutant AAV capsid contains only a single mutation in an NG pair. In certain embodiments, a mutant AAV capsid contains mutations in two different NG pairs. In certain embodiments, a mutant AAV capsid contains mutation is two different NG pairs which are located in structurally separate location in the AAV capsid. In certain embodiments, the mutation is not in the VP1-unique region. In certain embodiments, one of the mutations is in the VP1-unique region. Optionally, a mutant AAV capsid contains no modifications in the NG pairs, but contains mutations to minimize or eliminate deamidation in one or more asparagines, or a glutamine, located outside of an NG pair.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">In certain embodiments, a method of increasing the potency of a rAAV vector is provided which comprises engineering an AAV capsid which eliminating one or more of the NGs in the wild-type AAV capsid. In certain embodiments, the coding sequence for the &#x201c;G&#x201d; of the &#x201c;NG&#x201d; is engineered to encode another amino acid. In certain examples below, an &#x201c;S&#x201d; or an &#x201c;A&#x201d; is substituted. However, other suitable amino acid coding sequences may be selected.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Amino acid modifications may be made by conventional genetic engineering techniques. For example, a nucleic acid sequence containing modified AAV vp codons may be generated in which one to three of the codons encoding glycine in asparagine-glycine pairs are modified to encode an amino acid other than glycine. In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence containing modified asparagine codons may be engineered at one to three of the asparagine-glycine pairs, such that the modified codon encodes an amino acid other than asparagine. Each modified codon may encode a different amino acid. Alternatively, one or more of the altered codons may encode the same amino acid. In certain embodiments, these modified nucleic acid sequences may be used to generate a mutant rAAV having a capsid with lower deamidation than the native AAV3B variant capsid. Such mutant rAAV may have reduced immunogenicity and/or increase stability on storage, particularly storage in suspension form.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">Also provided herein are nucleic acid sequences encoding the AAV capsids having reduced deamidation. It is within the skill in the art to design nucleic acid sequences encoding this AAV capsid, including DNA (genomic or cDNA), or RNA (e.g., mRNA). Such nucleic acid sequences may be codon-optimized for expression in a selected system (i.e., cell type) and can be designed by various methods. This optimization may be performed using methods which are available on-line (e.g., GeneArt), published methods, or a company which provides codon optimizing services, e.g., DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, Calif.). One codon optimizing method is described, e.g., in International Patent Publication No. WO 2015/012924, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. See also, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014/0032186 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0136184. Suitably, the entire length of the open reading frame (ORF) for the product is modified. However, in some embodiments, only a fragment of the ORF may be altered. By using one of these methods, one can apply the frequencies to any given polypeptide sequence and produce a nucleic acid fragment of a codon-optimized coding region which encodes the polypeptide. A number of options are available for performing the actual changes to the codons or for synthesizing the codon-optimized coding regions designed as described herein. Such modifications or synthesis can be performed using standard and routine molecular biological manipulations well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In one approach, a series of complementary oligonucleotide pairs of 80-90 nucleotides each in length and spanning the length of the desired sequence are synthesized by standard methods. These oligonucleotide pairs are synthesized such that upon annealing, they form double stranded fragments of 80-90 base pairs, containing cohesive ends, e.g., each oligonucleotide in the pair is synthesized to extend 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more bases beyond the region that is complementary to the other oligonucleotide in the pair. The single-stranded ends of each pair of oligonucleotides are designed to anneal with the single-stranded end of another pair of oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide pairs are allowed to anneal, and approximately five to six of these double-stranded fragments are then allowed to anneal together via the cohesive single stranded ends, and then they ligated together and cloned into a standard bacterial cloning vector, for example, a TOPO&#xae; vector available from Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif. The construct is then sequenced by standard methods. Several of these constructs consisting of 5 to 6 fragments of 80 to 90 base pair fragments ligated together, i.e., fragments of about 500 base pairs, are prepared, such that the entire desired sequence is represented in a series of plasmid constructs. The inserts of these plasmids are then cut with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated together to form the final construct. The final construct is then cloned into a standard bacterial cloning vector, and sequenced. Additional methods would be immediately apparent to the skilled artisan.

Optionally, the vectors further contain a minigene comprising a selected transgene which is flanked by AAV 5&#x2032; ITR and AAV 3&#x2032; ITR. In another embodiment, the AAV is a self-complementary AAV (sc-AAV) (See, U.S. 2012/0141422 which is incorporated herein by reference). Self-complementary vectors package an inverted repeat genome that can fold into dsDNA without the requirement for DNA synthesis or base-pairing between multiple vector genomes. Because scAAV have no need to convert the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) prior to expression, they are more efficient vectors. However, the trade-off for this efficiency is the loss of half the coding capacity of the vector, ScAAV are useful for small protein-coding genes (up to &#x2dc;55 kd) and any currently available RNA-based therapy.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">Pseudotyped vectors, wherein the capsid of one AAV is replaced with a heterologous capsid protein, are useful herein.

These endogenously expressed miRNAs form hairpin precursors which are subsequently processed into a miRNA duplex, and further into a &#x201c;mature&#x201d; single stranded miRNA molecule. This mature miRNA guides a multiprotein complex, miRISC, which identifies target site, e.g., in the 3&#x2032; UTR regions, of target mRNAs based upon their complementarity to the mature miRNA.</p><p

Thus, blocking (partially or totally) the activity of the miRNA (e.g., silencing the miRNA) can effectively induce, or restore, expression of a polypeptide whose expression is inhibited (derepress the polypeptide). In one embodiment, derepression of polypeptides encoded by mRNA targets of a miRNA is accomplished by inhibiting the miRNA activity in cells through any one of a variety of methods. For example, blocking the activity of a miRNA can be accomplished by hybridization with a small interfering nucleic acid (e.g., antisense oligonucleotide, miRNA sponge, TuD RNA) that is complementary, or substantially complementary to, the miRNA, thereby blocking interaction of the miRNA with its target mRNA, As used herein, a small interfering nucleic acid that is substantially complementary to a miRNA is one that is capable of hybridizing with a miRNA, and blocking the miRNA's activity. In some embodiments, a small interfering nucleic acid that is substantially complementary to a miRNA is a small interfering nucleic acid that is complementary with the miRNA at all but 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 bases. A &#x201c;miRNA Inhibitor&#x201d; is an agent that blocks miRNA function, expression and/or processing. For instance, these molecules include but are not limited to microRNA specific antisense, microRNA sponges, tough decoy RNAs (TuD RNAs) and microRNA oligonucleotides (double-stranded, hairpin, short oligonucleotides) that inhibit miRNA interaction with a Drosha complex.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0186">Still other useful transgenes may include those encoding immunoglobulins which confer passive immunity to a pathogen. An &#x201c;immunoglobulin molecule&#x201d; is a protein containing the immunologically-active portions of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and immunoglobulin light chain covalently coupled together and capable of specifically combining with antigen. Immunoglobulin molecules are of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass.

Useful gene products may include miRNAs. miRNAs and other small interfering nucleic acids regulate gene expression via target RNA transcript cleavage/degradation or translational repression of the target messenger RNA (mRNA). miRNAs are natively expressed, typically as final 19-25 non-translated RNA products. miRNAs exhibit their activity through sequence-specific interactions with the 3&#x2032; untranslated regions (UTR) of target mRNAs. These endogenously expressed miRNAs form hairpin precursors which are subsequently processed into a miRNA duplex, and further into a &#x201c;mature&#x201d; single stranded miRNA molecule. This mature miRNA guides a multiprotein complex, miRISC, which identifies target site, e.g., in the 3&#x2032; UTR regions, of target mRNAs based upon their complementarity to the mature miRNA.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0214">These above coding sequences, when associated with regulatory elements which drive their expression, provide signals detectable by conventional means, including enzymatic, radiographic, colorimetric, fluorescence or other spectrographic assays, fluorescent activating cell sorting assays and immunological assays, including enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemistry. For example, where the marker sequence is the LacZ gene, the presence of the vector carrying the signal is detected by assays for beta-galactosidase activity.

An IRES sequence, or other suitable systems, may be used to produce more than one polypeptide from a single gene transcript. An IRES (or other suitable sequence) is used to produce a protein that contains more than one polypeptide chain or to express two different proteins from or within the same cell. An exemplary IRES is the poliovirus internal ribosome entry sequence, which supports transgene expression in photoreceptors, RPE and ganglion cells.

Our barcode evaluation system was used to evaluate the performance of various AAV capsids at the same time. The key component of the system is a series of barcoded cis plasmids, each plasmid carrying a unique 6-bp DNA barcode. The cis plasmids were identical except the DNA barcodes. The backbone of the cis plasmids was the cis plasmid for self-complementary AAV vectors&#x2014;a transgene cassette flanked by a defective ITR (&#x394;ITR) at the cassette's 5&#x2032; end and a normal ITR at its 3&#x2032; end. The transgene cassette was CB8 promoter&#x2014;SV40 intron&#x2014;eGFP&#x2014;SV40 polyA signal. Further, all of the ATG codons within the eGFP transgene were removed so that no protein was expressed (the resulting ORF is named as dEGFP&#x2014;dead eGFP) and a 6-bp barcode was inserted right after the dEGFP.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0256">A barcoded cis plasmid was mixed with pAdAF6 and the trans plasmid carrying an AAV capsid gene to be tested for triple-transfection into HEK293 cells to produce an AAV vector prep.

Therefore, the barcode was linked to the tested capsid.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0257">For multiple capsids to be tested, the AAV vector preps were produced individually so each capsid linked to a unique DNA barcode. The preps were then pooled together for animal studies. After the pooled vectors were injected into animals, various tissues were then collected and preserved in RNAlater solution. PCR and RT-PCR can then be carried out and the barcode frequencies are then read by NGS.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Barcode&#x2003;Name</entry><entry>Barcode&#x2003;sequence</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>BC01</entry><entry>ATCACG</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC02</entry><entry>CGATGT</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC03</entry><entry>TTAGGC</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC04</entry><entry>TGACCA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC05</entry><entry>ACAGTG</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC06</entry><entry>GCCAAT</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC07</entry><entry>CAGATC</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC08</entry><entry>ACTTGA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC09</entry><entry>GATCAG</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC10</entry><entry>TAGCTT</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC11</entry><entry>GGCTAC</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BC12</entry><entry>CTTGTA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Overview</heading><p id="p-0263" num="0258">1.

Sixteen AAV3B variants that showed increases in relative frequencies were evaluated in nonhuman primates (NHPs) with a validated barcodes system. Most of the sixteen variants were better than AAV3B in terms of liver transduction, with some showing high liver specificity. Two variants were further evaluated with a therapeutic transgene for liver gene therapy in NHPs and the preliminary results confirmed the NHP barcode evaluation results.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0000">Creation of Vectors with High Tropism to Human Hepatocytes and Low Recognition by NAbs Based on Engineered Forms of AAV3B.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0260">We examined the HVR VIII of AAV3B and focused on the non-conserved amino acids compared to the other AAV serotypes. The AAV3B VP1 was aligned with that of 180 other AAVs, and 10 amino acids between 582-594 were chosen based on their variability among the aligned sequences. In order to maximize the viability of the mutant, degenerate codons were designed with the intention to introduce alternative amino acids appeared in other AAVs at the aligned position. The mutant capsid sequences were cloned into the AAV capsid expression plasmid, mixed with helper plasmid (pAdAF6) and pRep, and then transfected into 293 cells to produce the packaged AAV library.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0261">FRG mice with human hepatocyte xenografts were used to select AAV mutants with human liver tropism from the library. FRG stands for triple mutant of Fah(&#x2212;/&#x2212;), Rag-2(&#x2212;/&#x2212;) and IL2rg(&#x2212;/&#x2212;). The Fah is a gene in the catabolic pathway for tyrosine, and its deletion leads to liver damage unless the drug 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl) 1,3-cyclohexedione (NTBC) is supplemented to block the accumulation of the toxic metabolite. When NTBC is withdraw, hepatocyte from human donor can be introduced, and the double knockout of Rag-2(&#x2212;/&#x2212;) and IL2rg(&#x2212;/&#x2212;) cause severe immune-deficiency and allows the survival of the human hepatocyte. FRG mice with repopulated human hepatocyte were purchased from Yecuris (Tigard, Oreg., USA) and injected with the library intravenously at, minimally, 1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>GC per animal. At day 28, the livers were perfused with collagenase to harvest the hepatocytes. Among the 4 animals injected, up to 40 million human hepatocytes were recovered with over 95% viability. Magnetic beads with anti-H2-kb, which is a mouse specific marker, were used to remove mouse hepatocytes from the harvested cells. Primers targeting the designed mutations were used to amplify DNA fragments containing HVR VIII via RT-PCR. The DNA fragments were cloned back into the capsid expression plasmid to proceed with the next round of screening.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0262">To select vectors with high tropism to human hepatocytes from the library, we injected an AAV3B library into FRG mice xenografted with human hepatocytes. RNA fragments recovered from the isolated human hepatocytes was subjected to RT-PCR using primers flanking the engineered HVRVIII region and re-cloned into a cis-plasmid designed to express AAV3B VP1 for repeat selection. We performed next generation sequencing (NGS) on the libraries from before selection (denoted as AR0), after first round (AR1) and the plasmid after second round of humanized FRG selection (AR2) and examined the frequency of each variant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>).

Comparison Between AAV8 with AAV3B.AR2.16 Using rAAV Containing the Native hLDLR Coding Sequence</heading><p id="p-0284" num="0284">The AAV capsids of AAV8 and AAV3B.AR2.16 were compared using the PI intron and the wild type hLDLR coding sequence.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0285">Experimental results showed that the rAAV particles successfully delivered the vector genome to liver. Briefly, liver samples from the biopsy on day 18 as well as the necropsy on day 120 were evaluated. Genome copies (GC) of the vector genome were normalized by diploid genome and plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. Additionally, correlated LDLR mRNA relative expression was plotted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). A dose dependence was observed, i.e., a higher dose results in more copies of vector in a cell. Although a slight decrease over time in the vector copies was observed in most of the animals, on day 120, the vector genome was not eliminated in any of the animal, suggesting a long-term effect of the rAAV treatment.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0286">Further, a robust expression of the hLDLR protein was found in liver on day 18 post the AAV particle administration shown by western blot (WB), in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. On day 120, the expression level of liver LDLR protein was reduced in the animals treated with the AAV8 particles shown by WB, ISH and IHC as well as in the animals treated with high dose of the AAV3B.AR2.16 particles shown by WB. Still, LDLR expression in liver was observed even on day 120.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0287">The low dose of the AAV8 particle did not lead to a significant LDL reduction upon administration. The male animal identified as RA3344 that was treated with the high dose of the AAV8 particle showed an LDL level reduced to a quarter of the starting level on day 0, while the female animal identified as RA3403 had no significant change in its LDL level. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). However, both doses of the AAV3B.AR2.16 particle demonstrated its effectiveness shown by a significant reduction in the LDL level upon treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>), suggesting the AAV3B.AR2.16 capsid is more effective compared to the AAV8 for delivery to liver cells.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0288">Potential toxicity to the liver was further evaluated via measuring ALT and AST levels with and without steroid. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>. A transient increase after injection was observed in the of the female animal and in the AST level of both animals treated with high dose of the AAV3B.AR2.16 particle. A male animal treated with the high dose of the AAV8 particle also showed a similar increase in its AST level. However, all ALT and AST levels returned to normal, indicating that no long-term liver damage occurred.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">D. Comparison of the Three hLDLR Expression Cassettes</heading><p id="p-0289" num="0289">Studies were performed to evaluate the three hLDLR expression cassettes (&#x201c;hLDLR&#x201d; vs. &#x201c;hLDLR011&#x201d; vs. &#x201c;hLDLR011.triple&#x201d;). The AAV3B.AR2.16 capsid was used to deliver a vector genome comprising one of the expression cassettes.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0290">Expression of the hLDLR protein were identified in the liver samples of all groups biopsied on day 18 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) shown via both ISH and IHC. The IHC images were provided with the corresponding LDL levels noted in the corner, showing a positive correlation between the LDLR expression level and the reduction in LDL. More results relating to the LDL level are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>. At the higher dose, compared to the 75% reduction achieved by the wild-type LDLR coding sequence, both of the engineered sequences provided close to a 100% reduction upon administration. The lower dose of the rAAV.hLDLR011 particle resulted in an about 75% reduction and an about 100% reduction in LDL, while the lower dose of the rAAVhLDLR011.triple particle resulted in an about 50% reduction and an about 80% reduction. The data suggested that the engineered hLDLR coding sequences are better candidates in treating hypercholesterolemia compared to the wild-type sequence.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0291">With respect to liver toxicity, advantages of the engineered hLDLR coding sequences over the wild type sequence were observed. A comparably low and stable level of ALT as well as AST was shown in both low and high dose groups of the animals treated with rAAV.hLDLR011 or rAAV.hLDLR011.triple particles. However, high dose of the rAAV particle comprising the wild type hLDLR sequence lead to a transient increase upon administration in the ALT level in one animal and in the AST levels in both animals.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0292">Additionally, PCSK9 levels were also investigated for animals treated with AAV8.hLDLR, or AAV3B.AR2.08.hLDLR011.triple, or AAV3B.AR1.16.hLDLR011.triple. The LDL level of an animal treated with the AAV8.hLDLR particle followed the change in the PCSK9 level. See, for example, the animal identified as 17C027 from day 14 to day 42. However, such pattern was not found in the other two groups treated with AAV.hLDLR011.triple particles. See, for example, the animal identified as RA33289 from day 14 to day 28. The data suggest beneficial effects of the AAV.hLDLR011.triple particles. Additionally, a decline in the PCSK9 level up rAAV administration was observed, suggesting that PSCK9 responds to the decreased LDL level and/or the increased LDLR level due to the rAAV injection, and thus may play a negative role in reducing the LDL level if not controlled properly.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">E. Comparison of AAV3B Capsid with Two AAV3B Variants (all Containing the hLDLR011. Triple Coding Sequence)</heading><p id="p-0293" num="0293">The two tested AAV3B variants (i.e., AAV3B.AR2.08 and AAV3B.AR2.16) were further compared to the original AAV3B capsid via using the rAAV particles comprising the hLDLR011.triple coding sequence (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>).</p><p id="p-0294" num="0294">The LDLR expression was observed in all treated animals. Compared to the AAV3B particle, the AAV3B variant particles showed better effects in reducing the LDL level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>). For example, the LDL in the variant groups reached at a lower level upon treatment and stayed below the pre-treatment level for longer time. Additionally, the ALT level elevated in a sustained manner in the animals treated with the AAV3B particles while the AAV3B variants groups only showed a temporary increase. These results lead to a conclusion that the AAV3B variants are more advantageous over the original AAV3B capsid from the perspective of efficacy as well as safety.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0295">Interestingly, despite an initial response following administration, the ALT level and the LDL level shared a similar trend in the animals injected with AAV3B.AR2.08.hLDLR011.triple (See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref>). Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref> provide ISH and IHC results for LDLR protein expression on day 18, day 83/88, and day 120. A gradual reduction was found, suggesting a clearing mechanism of the hLDLR expression cassette and/or the hLDLR expressing cells.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">F.

We evaluated IVS.hLDLR011-triple vector for sustainable expression over a period of 120 days. Male DKO mice received an IV administration of AAV8.IVS.hLDLR011-triple vector at a high dose of 7.5&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>GC/kg. A stable reduction of LDL-C levels in the serum is observed at multiple time points after the gene transfer. Liver tissues (n=5 mice/time point) were harvested on day 1, 3, 7, 14 and 120 after vector infusion and collected serum samples. Transduction efficiency of hepatocytes measured by PCR analysis revealed diploid vector genome copies per cell at day 1 that decreased two-fold at different time points and stable transgene expression (hLDLR mRNA) at different time points. Compared to day 1, hLDLR protein expression was 2-3 fold higher at days 3, 7, 14 and 120 (relative expression was analyzed by western blot). IHC staining and in situ hybridization analyses of liver showed a high level of expression of hLDLR at different time points.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0297">Despite the observation of the hLDLR expression cassette being gradually removed, a sustained hLDLR production (in terms of both RNA and protein levels, along with low LDL level) was revealed over the entire observation period until day 120 post rAAV administration. These results were then compared with NHPs administrated with the low dose of the particles using the AAV3B variant vectors.
