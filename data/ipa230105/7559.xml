However, it takes several seconds to several minutes to establish the connection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1 discloses a technology of using a difference in a peripheral device detection method between high-speed communication means and low-speed communication means and transmitting information necessary for establishing a connection of the high-speed communication means by using the low-speed communication means, thereby reducing a time taken to establish the connection of the high-speed communication means.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In Patent Document 1, however, although the time taken to establish the connection between the communication units is reduced, it takes a certain time to switch a communication system because the establishment of the connection itself is performed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A delay in switching the communication system may cause, for example, the following problem: in a device that needs to reflect an operation of a communication target device in real time, a delay in a timing of reflecting the operation causes deterioration in operations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present technology has been made in view of such a circumstance, and an object thereof is to provide a technology capable of reducing a switching time when switching one communication system to another communication system due to deterioration in a communication condition of communication performed by the one communication system.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solutions to Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A communication control device according to the present technology includes: a first communication unit that performs communication by a device designation method that performs signal communication while designating a communication target device; a second communication unit that performs communication by a broadcasting method that performs signal communication without designating the communication target device; and a switching control unit that, when the first communication unit is performing communication with the communication target device, switches a communication system from the device designation method by the first communication unit to the broadcasting method by the second communication unit in accordance with a communication condition of the first communication unit such that the communication with the communication target device is continuously performed by the second communication unit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The communication by the broadcasting method is used when the communication is switched to the communication by the second communication unit, and thus the communication with the communication target device is performed without establishing a connection.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Herein, the communication by the device designation method indicates a signal communication that is performed while the communication target device is being designated and corresponds to, for example, Wi-Fi communication in a wireless local area network (LAN) system or the like.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the communication by the broadcasting method indicates a signal communication that is performed without designating the communication target device and is, for example, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication or the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the communication condition of the first communication unit indicates a communication condition that is referred to for switching from the communication by the first communication unit to the communication by the second communication unit and is, for example, a connection condition of the communication by the first communication unit, a state of radio field intensity of the communication by the first communication unit, or the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the communication control device according to the present technology described above, it is conceivable that, on the basis of correspondence information in which data to be transmitted by the device designation method is associated with a data identifier for identifying the data, the switching control unit causes the second communication unit to transmit the data identifier by the broadcasting method.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, the data identifier is transmitted to a peripheral device by the broadcasting method, and the peripheral device can acquire the content of the data on the basis of the received data identifier because the peripheral device has the correspondence information.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is conceivable that the communication control device according to the present technology described above further includes an information generation unit that generates the correspondence information.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Therefore, the correspondence information to be shared with the communication target device is generated in the own device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the communication control device according to the present technology described above, it is conceivable that the first communication unit receives the correspondence information transmitted by the device designation method.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, the correspondence information can be shared with the communication target device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the communication control device according to the present technology described above, it is conceivable that the data identifier transmitted by the second communication unit is converted into the data associated with the data identifier in the communication target device on the basis of the correspondence information.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, when a data identifier is transmitted to the communication target device in the communication by the broadcasting method, the communication target device acquires data corresponding to the data identifier.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the communication control device according to the present technology described above, it is conceivable that: the first communication unit performs encrypted communication;

Modification Examples</heading><p id="p-0245" num="0244">In the present embodiment, the video see-through AR glasses <b>2</b> and the head-mounted display have been described as examples of the operation target device <b>2</b>. However, the present technology is applicable to, for example, devices having two communication systems such as WF communication and BLE communication.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">The operation target device <b>2</b> is applicable to various devices and is applicable to, for example, imaging devices such as a digital still camera and a digital video camera, devices such as a mobile terminal including a smartphone, and the like.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Further, the present embodiment shows an example where the present technology is applied to the AR system <b>1</b> that performs communication between the AR glasses <b>2</b> and the controller <b>3</b>. However, the present technology is also applicable to a case where communication is performed between a smart speaker equipped with a voice assistant and a peripheral device.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">Herein, the operation target device <b>2</b> serves as the peripheral device such as a television device or an audio, and the operation device <b>3</b> serves as the smart speaker equipped with a voice assistant. In this case, the correspondence information is generated in each peripheral device and is shared in advance between each device and the smart speaker via WF communication or the like.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Then, in a case where, for example, the communication condition of WF communication is not good when the user operates the smart speaker by voice such as &#x201c;Turn on the television.&#x201d;, the communication is switched to BLE communication. Therefore, it is possible to control the television device serving as the peripheral device by using the smart speaker, without establishing a connection therebetween.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">Further, in the present embodiment, WF communication is performed by the first communication unit <b>207</b>, <b>301</b> when the communication condition of WF communication is good, and the communication is switched to BLE communication by the second communication unit <b>208</b>, <b>302</b> when the communication condition of WF communication deteriorates.
