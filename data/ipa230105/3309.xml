The production of these electromagnetic valves is complicated, and the solid friction which occurs during operation of the electromagnets reduces the accuracy with regard to the functional chain which is produced by the electromagnetic valves.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is a problem of the present invention to simplify the production of the electromagnetic valve and to make it less expensive, and to decrease the solid friction between the movable components in one development of the invention.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These problems are solved by way of the features of the first patent claim; the subclaims develop this solution.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention includes the technical teaching that the pole core consists of an outer magnetic pole and a valve sleeve which is enclosed by the magnetic pole, at least two fluid ducts running in the axial direction of the abovementioned components between the valve sleeve and the magnetic pole in zones which are delimited in a fluid-tight manner on the circumference of the valve sleeve.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, the valve sleeve has at least two cavities, preferably transverse bores, which run at a right angle with respect to the center axis of the valve sleeve and are connected fluidically to the abovementioned fluid ducts and, in interaction with the control edges of the valve slide, determine the function of the valve assembly in a manner which is dependent on the axial position of the valve slide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A fluidic connection which can be produced extremely inexpensively is provided between the transverse bores in the valve sleeve and the fluidic connectors by way of the fluid ducts which are arranged between the valve sleeve and the magnetic pole, and the transverse bores inexpensively produce control edges which interact with the control edges of the valve slide in a manner which opens or closes the valve. In this way, pressure control functions, throttle functions or switching functions can be produced in a known way as valve functions, throttle functions and switching functions acting in a known way via the stroke of the valve slide, which stroke is produced by way of the electromagnet counter to the force of the restoring spring, while pressure control functions are achieved in a known way, by a pressure force which acts on the valve slide being compared mechanically with that force of the electromagnet which likewise acts on the valve slide, and the valve slide stroke which results from the force difference releasing fluidic throughflows from the P connector to the A connector or from the A connector to the T connector.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first embodiment, the at least two fluid ducts for the connectors P and T advantageously run in cavities of the magnetic pole, the axial lengths of the cavities being dimensioned in such a way that there is firstly a fluid connection to in each case one sealed flange zone of a flange face and secondly there is in each case a fluid connection to the transverse bores in the valve sleeve, and, furthermore, a fluid connection of the connector P to an armature space of the electromagnet is shut.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, the connectors P and T are connected to the flange zones of the flange face, and the armature space of the electromagnet is preferably connected to the connector T, via the fluid duct which emanates from the connector T or via another fluidic connection.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A course of the fluid ducts in the cavities of the magnetic pole can be produced in a particularly inexpensive way if the magnetic pole is produced by way of a sintering process; here, the fluid ducts are produced by way of the pressing tool. In the case of this embodiment, the third fluid duct for the connector A is produced by way of a central bore in the valve sleeve, which bore also receives the valve slide. The third fluid duct does not require an additional cavity in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a second advantageous embodiment, the fluid ducts for the connectors P and T run in flattened portions and/or grooves of the valve sleeve, the axial lengths of the flattened portions and/or grooves likewise being dimensioned in such a way that firstly there is a fluid connection to in each case one sealed flange zone of a flange face and secondly there is in each case a fluid connection to the transverse bores in the valve sleeve, and, furthermore, a fluid connection of the connector P to the armature space is shut.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Axial or obliquely running bores for the fluid ducts P and T are not required either in the case of this second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The abovementioned axially running fluid ducts are preferably configured as flattened portions; if greater cross sections are required, however, or flattened portions are to be ruled out for production reasons, they are configured as grooves, or both flattened portions and grooves are provided.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one variant of the first embodiment, not only two, but rather three fluid ducts for the connectors P, T and A run in cavities of the magnetic pole, the lengths of the cavities being dimensioned in such a way that firstly there is a fluid connection to in each case one sealed flange zone of a flange face and secondly there is in each case a fluid connection to the first and the second transverse bore and to a third transverse bore in the valve sleeve, and, furthermore, in each case a fluid connection of the connectors P and A to the armature space of the electromagnet is shut.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case of this variant of the first embodiment, all three flange zones on the flange face are arranged at the same spacing from the center of the flange face; therefore, more space is available for the connector A. The designer has the freedom here to load or not to load an end face of the valve slide with the pressure of the connector A, depending on the embodiment of the valve slide and the task of the valve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one variant of the second embodiment, three fluid ducts for the connectors P, T and A run in flattened portions of the valve sleeve, the lengths of the flattened portions being dimensioned in such a way that firstly there is a fluid connection to in each case one sealed flange zone of a flange face and secondly there is in each case a fluid connection to the first and the second transverse bore and a third transverse bore in the valve sleeve, and, furthermore, in each case a fluid connection of the connectors P and A to the armature space is shut.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one advantageous embodiment, the magnet armature is radially mounted firstly in a bearing and secondly by way of a slide head of the valve slide, the magnet armature making contact by way of a conical face with the slide head, and it being possible for radial forces to be transmitted from the magnet armature to the slide head. In the case of this embodiment, a high precision of the relative radial position of the magnet armature with respect the magnetic pole can be produced inexpensively, without additional mounting of the magnet armature in the magnetic pole. The solid friction on the magnet armature is particularly low in the case of this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another advantageous embodiment, the effective length of the bearing for mounting the magnet armature corresponds to at least one third of the length of the magnet armature, preferably half the length and further preferably 70% of the length, the magnet armature making contact by way of a planar face with the slide head of the valve slide, and the valve slide having a flattened slide head which permits only a transmission of an axial pressure force from the magnet armature to the slide head.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">This embodiment concerns proven prone mounting of the magnet armature; the flattened slide head prevents a transmission of radially acting forces to the valve slide which, on account of its low diameter play relative to the valve sleeve, can absorb only low radial forces if its solid friction is to remain low.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the case of the first embodiment of the electromagnetic valve, the flange face has three flange zones, the third flange zone being connected fluidically to a central bore in the valve sleeve, which bore receives the valve slide, and the three flange zones being sealed with respect to one another and with respect to the surroundings by way of a shaped seal.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The use of the shaped seal simplifies the connection of the electromagnetic valve to a further apparatus which supports the electromagnetic valve and contains the abovementioned fluidic lines.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The three flange zones are also sealed with respect to one another and with respect to the surroundings by way of a shaped seal in the case of the second embodiment of the electromagnetic valve, but no central flange zone for the connector A is provided here. The flange zone for the connector A can be of greater configuration in the case of this second embodiment than in the case of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The shaped seal advantageously comprises three filter mats which are arranged in the flange zones and are connected to the material of the shaped seal in a non-positive, positively locking or integrally joined manner. The arrangement of the filters as filter mats in the shaped seal simplifies the assembly and therefore decreases the production costs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The electromagnetic valve according to the invention can be used, for example, as a pressure control valve in the design of a three-way pressure control valve, a first volume at a fluidic pressure to be controlled being connected to the connector A, a second volume at a supply pressure being connected to the connector P, and a line which leads to a supply tank being connected to the connector T.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Here, a force equilibrium between the force of the electromagnet and the pressure force of the fluid at the connector A is brought about in the electromagnetic valve at the valve slide, a fluidic connection between the connector P and the connector A being brought about in the valve assembly in the case where the force of the electromagnet is predominant, and a fluidic connection between the connector A and the connector T being brought about in the case where the abovementioned pressure force is predominant.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The electromagnetic valve according to the invention can also be used in a known way as a fluidic switching valve (also called a directional valve) in the case of a suitable design of the components of the valve assembly, by there being a fluidic connection between the connector A and the connector T in the valve assembly in the case of a non-energized electromagnet, and/or by there being a fluidic connection between the connector P and the connector A in the valve assembly in the case of a sufficiently energized electromagnet.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An application of the invention is also possible which produces a fluidic connection between the connector P and the connector A in the valve assembly in the case of a non-energized electromagnet, and/or which produces a fluidic connection between the connector A and the connector T in the valve assembly in the case of a sufficiently energized electromagnet.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">There is sufficient energization of the electromagnet here when the magnetic force which results from the energization is sufficient under all proper operating conditions to move the valve slide out of a rest position into a working position counter to the force of the restoring spring, counter to the active pressure forces of the connected fluid volumes and counter to the frictional forces on the valve slide, the fluidic connection between the connector P and the connector A existing in the working position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the case of a suitable design, the directional valve can also be operated with a proportional action in a known way; a proportional stroke of the valve slide which for its part determines the fluid connections through the valve assembly then corresponds to the electric current through the magnet coil. Here, the valve slide is configured in such a way that it does not have an active face for the connected pressures of the connectors A and P.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The drawings described herein are for illustrative purposes only of selected embodiments and not all possible implementations, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a sectional illustration of the first embodiment of the electromagnetic valve,</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a sectional illustration of the second embodiment of the electromagnetic valve,</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a sectional illustration of the third embodiment of the electromagnetic valve,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a view of the shaped seal of the first embodiment with the filter mat,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a view of the shaped seal of the second embodiment, and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a sectional illustration of the fourth embodiment of the electromagnetic valve.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DISCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an electromagnetic valve <b>1</b> according to the invention which has an electromagnet <b>2</b> which comprises a magnet coil <b>3</b>, a magnet armature <b>4</b>, a pole core <b>5</b>, a magnet yoke <b>6</b> and a housing <b>7</b> which closes the magnetic circuit.
