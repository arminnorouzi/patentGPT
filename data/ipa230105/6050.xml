ever-increasing demand for smaller and faster electronic devices that are able to perform a greater number of increasingly complex and sophisticated functions. Accordingly, there is a continuing trend in the semiconductor industry to manufacture low-cost, high-performance, and low-power integrated circuits (ICs). So far, these goals have been achieved in large part by scaling down semiconductor IC dimensions (e.g., minimum feature size) and thereby improving production efficiency and lowering associated costs. However, such miniaturization has introduced greater complexity into the semiconductor manufacturing process. Thus, the realization of continued advances in semiconductor ICs and devices calls for similar advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes and technology.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, multi-gate devices have been introduced in an effort to improve gate control by increasing gate-channel coupling, reduce OFF-state current, and reduce short-channel effects (SCEs). However, integration of fabrication of the multi-gate devices can be challenging.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the present disclosure are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying Figures.

Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some variations of the embodiments are described. Throughout the various views and illustrative embodiments, like reference numerals are used to designate like elements. It should be understood that additional operations can be provided before, during, and after the method, and some of the operations described can be replaced or eliminated for other embodiments of the method.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The nanostructure transistor (e.g. nanosheet transistor, nanowire transistor, multi-bridge channel, nano-ribbon FET, gate all around (GAA) transistor structures) described below may be patterned by any suitable method. For example, the structures may be patterned using one or more photolithography processes, including double-patterning or multi-patterning processes. Generally, double-patterning or multi-patterning processes combine photolithography and self-aligned processes, allowing patterns to be created that have, for example, smaller pitches than what is otherwise obtainable using a single, direct photolithography process. For example, in one embodiment, a sacrificial layer is formed over a substrate and patterned using a photolithography process. Spacers are formed alongside the patterned sacrificial layer using a self-aligned process. The sacrificial layer is then removed, and the remaining spacers may then be used to pattern the GAA structure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments of semiconductor structures and methods for forming the same are provided. The semiconductor structures may include nanostructures formed over a substrate and a gate structure wraps around the nanostructures. Dielectric features may be formed to separate the gate structure into different portions. In addition, the dielectric features may include bottom portions and top portions, and the top portions may include core portions and shell layers around the core portions. The core portion of the dielectric features may be made of a low k dielectric material and therefore may help to reduce the capacitance and improve the speed and performance of the resulting devices.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a diagrammatic top view of a semiconductor structure <b>100</b> in accordance with some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has been simplified for the sake of clarity to better understand the inventive concepts of the present disclosure.

Since the core portion <b>128</b><i>m</i>-<b>2</b> of the dielectric feature <b>134</b><i>m</i>-<b>2</b> has the recess <b>135</b><i>m </i>formed therein, a dielectric layer <b>190</b><i>m </i>formed over the metal layer <b>178</b><i>m</i>&#x2032; has an extending portion <b>191</b><i>m </i>extending into the recess <b>135</b><i>m </i>over the dielectric feature <b>134</b><i>m</i>-<b>2</b> in accordance with some embodiments.

However, if isolation features are formed through the gate structure to divide the gate structure, additional space may be needed to prevent mis-alignment issues when forming the isolation features. In some embodiments, dielectric features (e.g. the dielectric features <b>134</b>, <b>134</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>134</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>134</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>134</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> to <b>134</b><i>m</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>134</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> to <b>134</b><i>m</i>-<b>2</b>, <b>134</b><i>b</i>-<b>3</b> to <b>134</b><i>m</i>-<b>3</b>) are self-aligned to the spacing between the fin structures (e.g. the fin structure <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>104</b>-<b>3</b>, which will be formed as the nanostructures <b>108</b>&#x2032;), and therefore the distance between the fin structures can be reduced. In addition, a metal layer (e.g. the metal layer <b>178</b>&#x2032;) is formed over the separated portions of the gate structure and is patterned to connect some portions of the gate structure while some other portions of the gate structure are not connected. Since the connections and disconnections of different regions of the gate structure are achieved by the patterned metal layer and the patterning of the metal layer has a larger overlay shift tolerance, the device size may be further reduced. In addition, the nanostructures may therefore have a higher density and be wider.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Furthermore, the dielectric features are made of a top portion (e.g. the top portion <b>134</b>T) and the bottom portion (<b>134</b>B), and the bottom portion and the core portion (e.g. the core portion <b>128</b>) of the dielectric features may be made of low k dielectric materials. Therefore, the capacitance (e.g. gate structure to source/drain structure) may be reduced (e.g. 3-5%) and the speed of the resulting device may be improved (e.g. 3-5%). In addition, the power efficiency may also be improved (e.g. 4-6%).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In addition, although a cap layer (e.g. the cap layer <b>132</b>) formed over the core portion and a shell layer (e.g. the shell layer <b>126</b>) surrounding the core portion may be made of high k dielectric materials, these portions will be partially removed during the manufacturing process. Therefore, the dielectric features in the resulting device can still have a relatively low k value.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Moreover, although voids may tend to be formed in a thick high k structure (e.g. thicker than 4 nm), the high k portions in the dielectric features are relatively thin and the main portion of the dielectric features are the core portion and the bottom portion. In addition, an additional anneal process may be performed to prevent the formation of the voids during the formation of the core portions. Therefore, no or fewer voids will be formed in the dielectric features and the leakage paths resulting from the voids can be avoided. Accordingly, the reliability of the resulting device may be improved.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">It should be appreciated that the elements shown in the semiconductor structures <b>100</b> and <b>100</b><i>a </i>to <b>100</b><i>m </i>may be combined and/or exchanged.
