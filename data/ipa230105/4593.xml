For example, a first user may attach her mobile phone to a speaker system to play a song from her media playlist while, subsequently, a second user may attach his mobile phone to the speaker system to play a song from his playlist. Alternatively, a designated media-controlling user may decide what media to output such that users in a media group receive the media item. For example, an originating user A may select a song from her playlist, such that the song is provided to all of the users that are part of a given media group.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a first taste profile of a first user based on at least a first profile criteria may be received.

An area of interest may be determined based on the first taste profile and the second taste profile. A playlist may be generated and contain one or more media content items. The playlist may be based on the determined area of interest. A taste profile criteria may be one or more of a media content playback amount, a media content rank, a media content type, a location, a genre, a time period, a media content grouping, an artist, or the like.

As an example, the taste profile of a user A may be compared to the taste profile of a different user B. The comparison may result in the creation of a playlist such that, for example, the comparison may result in the identification of media items that are favorable to the taste profile of user A as well as to the taste profile of user B. A playlist may be generated based on the identified media items. It will be understood that although this disclosure generally refers to or provides examples for two users, the techniques disclosed herein are applicable to two or more users.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As applied herein, a media item may refer to any content in any medium, such as entertainment content, educational content, news content, financial content, sporting content, food content, travel content, music, video, static and dynamic images, animation, text and the like. As an example, a playlist may contain one or more of video clips, audio segments, images, etc. As applied herein, a user's media library may be stored on one or more user devices (e.g. mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, local server, etc.) or may be stored in a remote location (e.g., remote server or database, cloud server, etc.)</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As applied herein, a user may be any individual, account owner or application for which a taste profile may be generated and/or who is capable of accessing a playlist via a software or an application. For example, an individual user may have an account with a media application and access that application via the user's mobile phone. Once in the application, a taste profile for the user may be generated or accessed, and the taste profile may then be used to generate a playlist, as disclosed herein. An account owner may be an organization. For example an account owner may be a caf&#xe9; that has electronic device configured to output media items and for which a taste profile may be generated (e.g., based on the output media items).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> at <b>110</b> a first taste profile of a first user may be received and may be based on a first profile criteria. A taste profile for user may represent a user's media preference. A taste profile may be based on a user's playback history, a user's library characteristic, one or more user shares of media items, events associated with a user, or the like. According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, a user's taste profile may not simply be the media items in the user's library. As an example, if a user has 10 songs in her media library, the user's taste profile may not simply correspond to those 10 songs. Rather, the user's taste profile could correspond to a media preference that may factor in the 10 songs in the user's media library. According to an implementation, the media items in a user's media library may be a factor in determining the taste profile of a user. According to another implementation, the taste profile of a user may be determined without factoring in the specific media items in a user's media library.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A taste profile may be based on a user's playback history. A playback history may correspond to the activation of media items by the user, for the user, or in the presence of a user. The playback history may be determined based on all playback data available for a user. For example, the playback history of a user may be collected from a date such as &#x201c;day 1.&#x201d; The playback history may continue to be collected at day 500 such that the data from day 1 to day 500 is collected and encompasses the user's playback history. Alternatively, the playback history for a user may be limited to a set time range or quantity. As an example of a time range, continuing the previous example, the playback history of the user is limited to the previous year. Accordingly, only the last 365 days of the user's entire playback history may be factored when determining the user's taste profile. As an example of a quantity, only the past 200 media activations (e.g., video playbacks) for a given user may be factored when determining the user's taste profile.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A taste profile may be based on one or more characteristics of a user's media library. A characteristic of a user's media library may be determined in any applicable manner such as based on the metadata associated with the content in a user's media library, a theme or pattern associated with content in a media library, a trend derived from user selections, or the like. As an example, a user's media library may contain 100 songs. Eighty percent of the 30 most recently activated songs may be alternative rock songs. Accordingly, the taste profile for the user may correspond to one that favors alternative rock songs. As another example, a user may tend to activate songs by Rhianna between 8 am and 12 am and may tend to activate songs by Jay-Z between 7 pm and 10 pm. Accordingly, based on the trend, the user's taste profile may correspond to favoring Rhianna songs in the morning hours and Jay-Z songs in the evening hours. As yet another example, a user may tend to listen to country music songs when the user is in Denver and reggae songs when in San Francisco. Accordingly, based on the geographic location of the user corresponding to song activations, the user's taste profile may correspond to favoring country music while in Colorado and like states and reggae when in the Bay Area.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A taste profile may be based on shares by a user. A share may correspond to posts, likes, suggestions, links to, and mentions of media items or discussion regarding a media item. As a specific example, the arrangement may track the number of times the link to an image has been posted via a user's social media accounts. If the number of times meets or exceeds a predetermined threshold, then the arrangement may apply information about the media item towards the user's taste profile. It will be understood that user shares may correspond to shares within a single outlet (e.g., a social media platform) or over multiple outlets (e.g., social media platform, mail service, messaging platform, blog, website, etc.). A share may occur via any applicable medium such as an external social media outlet, a local outlet, or the like. As an example, an application may be used to determine a taste profile and/or to generate a playlist. The same application may contain chat/messaging/sharing features. Accordingly, the shares may occur via the application itself and those shares may be detected using any natural language processing, in order to generate a taste profile.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A taste profile may be based on one or more events associated with a user. More specifically, the taste profile may be based on an event that a user attends, coordinates, shares about, or the like. As an example, a user may attend a music concert. The user's taste profile may be based on the user attending the music concert such that the type of music or the artists performing may be a factor when generating the user's taste profile.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> at <b>110</b> a profile criteria may be used to determine a user's taste profile. A profile criteria may correspond to one or more of a media content playback amount, a preference indicator, a media content rank, a media content type, a location, a genre, a time period, a media content grouping, an artist preference or avoidance, or the like. One or more thresholds may be associated with a profile criterion or criteria (as applied herein, the term &#x201c;criteria&#x201d; can mean a single criterion or several criteria). As an example, a profile criterion associated with a media content playback amount may require a threshold number of song selections by a user before the song selections are factored into the user's taste profile.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A media content playback amount may correspond to the amount of times a specific media item or a category of media item (e.g., genre, artist, tempo, beat, time period, etc.) is activated. As an example, a profile criteria may be a 60% selection of songs by a user in a given time period. A user may select 20 songs from the 80s out of the previous 25 selections (i.e., 80% selection). Accordingly, given the 60% profile criteria, the user's taste profile would include a preference for 80s music. Velocity may also be taken into account. For example, the rate at which a user activates a given type of song (say, 16 per hour) may weight that song in the profile more heavily than the same number of a different type of song that has been activated over a period of days. Acceleration (positive or negative changes in velocity) can also be a factor. A rapidly accelerating rate of selection of a given type of song can cause that type to be more heavily weighted. A decelerating rate of selection of a type of song can cause it to be more rapidly diminished in its influence in forming a profile. Furthermore, concentration can also be taken into account in determining a profile. For example, if nine songs in a single genre are activated in a row, the influence of that genre on the profile can be greater than if the activation of the same nine songs were interspersed with the activation of many more songs from different genres.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A profile criteria may be based on a preference indicator. A preference indicator may be any indicator provided by a user. A preference indicator may be provided via a user's electronic device and, further, may be provided via an input device in connection with the electronic device. A preference indicator may indicate the preference of a user towards a media item. For example, a user may provide a preference indicator that indicates that the user is in favor of a currently provided media item. Alternatively, for example, a user may provide a preference indicator that indicates that the user is not in favor of a currently provided media item. Alternatively, for example, a user may provide a preference indicator that indicates the level of preference (e.g., positive or negative) towards a currently provided media item. A preference indicator may be an action associated with media content and may be taken for media provided via a media group. A preference indicator may correspond to a skip, a keep, a modify metadata, an increase rank, a decrease rank, or the like. A skip may correspond to a media item that is provided to a user on her device being skipped such that media is either ceased from being provided to the users or a different media item is provided to the users. A keep may correspond to a media item that is provided to a user via her device to continue being provided to the user.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A media content rank may correspond to a rank that a user gives to a media item or category of media item. Alternatively, a media content rank may correspond to an automatically generated rank for media content based on one or more factors such as playback frequency, percentage of media item(s) that a user is exposed to prior to stopping playback or skipping the media content, or the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A profile criteria may be location specific such that a user's taste profile is dynamically modified based on the user's or user's device location. As an example, a user may constantly listen to a category of music while at home (e.g., hip hop) and may listen to a different type of music while at work (e.g., instrumentals). Accordingly, the user's taste profile may be dynamically determined based on the user's present location.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An artist preference or avoidance may correspond to whether a user tends to listen to an artist, group, or category of artist or tends to skip media by an artist, group, or category of artist. As an example, a profile criterion may be the tendency of a user to be exposed to media vs to skip or ignore media. A user may tend to listen to songs by Michael Jackson a majority of the way through (e.g., listens to over 90% of each of his songs) and tend to skip songs by Beyonc&#xe9; within 5 seconds of the song being played on the user's device. Accordingly, the taste profile of the user may favor songs by Michael Jackson and disfavor songs by Beyonc&#xe9;.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, a first user's media content playback history may be received. For example, a user's song playback history for the past year, including song selections, skips, and repeats, may be received. A profile criteria threshold may be determined based on a profile criteria. Continuing the example, a profile criteria may be user rank of media and a threshold of a ranking below 5 may be determined. The threshold may be applied to the user's media content playback history and, based on the application, the user's taste profile may be modified. For example, a user's taste profile may be determined by applying the user rank profile criteria and applying the threshold rank of 5. Accordingly, the songs in the user's playback history that ranked below a 5 may be used to modify a user's taste preference.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, as shown at <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a second taste profile of a second user may be received and may be based on a second profile criteria. The first criteria (for the first user) and this second criteria may be based on the same criteria or may be separate criteria. As an example of the same criteria, the taste profile for a User A may be based on the number of selections of music by given artists. Similarly, the taste profile for a User B may be based on the number of selections of music by given artists. Note that the artists for User A may be the same or a different group of artists as for User B. However, the profile criteria here is the same (i.e., selection of music by given artists). As an example of different criteria, the taste profile for a User A may be based on the number of selections of music by given artists. The taste profile for a user B may be based on the number and content of shares about media items that User B has provided. A first user and a second user may be part of a media group, as disclosed herein, or may be users associated to a playlist such that the playlist is not necessarily made available to the users.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, as shown at <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an area of interest may be determined based on the first taste profile and the second taste profile. According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, as shown at <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a playlist containing one or more media items may be generated based on the determined area of interest. The playlist may be generated on a user device, a local storage device, a remote storage device, or a cloud server. As an example, determined areas of interest between a User A and a User B may be 80s music by the artist Prince. Accordingly, a playlist may be generated and may contain multiple songs that were released in the 80s, by the artist Prince. The playlist may be stored in a cloud server and may be accessible by both Users A and User B, or just by User A.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An area of interest may be determined based on a commonality between a first taste profile and a second taste profile. The commonality may be based on any applicable factor such a commonality between a type of media content, an artist, a time period, a media content grouping a rating, an event, or the like. As an example, a taste profile for User A may indicate that the user favors alternative rock, instrumental, and jazz music. A taste profile for User B may indicate that the user favors hip hop, heavy metal, and instrumental music. Accordingly, an area of interest between User A and User B may be instrumental music. As another example, a taste profile for User A may indicate that the user attended an event X. The taste profile for a User B may also indicated that the User B attended the same event X. Accordingly, the area of interest for User A and User B may at least include the event X and, thus, a playlist generated based on User A and User B's taste profiles may include music associated with the event X.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An area of interest may be determined based on a difference between a first taste profile and a second taste profile. One or more media items may be added to a playlist based on a determination that the media item does not correspond to two or more taste profiles. Adding a media item to a playlist based on a difference in taste profiles may enable users that access the playlist to be exposed to media items that are outside their taste profiles. As an example, a User A may wish to be exposed to media items to which she has not previously been exposed. User A and User B may have similar taste profiles, indicating that they have a similar taste in media. The taste profile for User A may indicate that the user favors hip hop, instrumental, and jazz music. The taste profile for User B may indicate that the user favors hip hop, instrumental music, and a taste profile for User A may indicate that the user favors hip hop and instrumental. A taste profile for User B may indicate that the user favors hip hop, instrumental, and alternative rock music. Notably, the difference between User A and User B's taste profiles may be that User B's taste profile includes alternative rock music while User A's taste profile does not. Accordingly, based on this difference, alternative rock music may be added to the playlist, allowing User A to be exposed to the alternative rock music when she accesses the playlist.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an illustrative example of the disclosed subject matter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, media preferences for a User A may be represented by data <b>210</b> and for a User B by data <b>220</b>. The profile criteria for both datasets <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> may be the play count for media items corresponding to artist. A threshold minimum of 10 play counts may be applied such that the taste profile for User A includes the artists Screaming Chair, Michael Jackson and S.G., based on the play counts associated with each of those artists being above 10. Similarly, the taste profile for User B includes the artists S.G., Bars, and Michael Jackson. Areas of interest for User A and User B's taste profiles include the artists Michael Jackson and S.G. Here, the areas of interest (i.e., Michael Jackson and S.G., in this example) are determined based on the commonality of artists between the two taste profiles. Accordingly, a playlist <b>200</b> may be generated and may include the song Thriller by Michael Jackson and Hometown by S.G.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As another illustrative example of the disclosed subject matter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, media preferences for a User A may be represented by data <b>230</b> and for a User B by data <b>240</b>. The profile criteria for dataset <b>230</b> may be play counts and the profile criteria for dataset <b>240</b> may be song rankings A threshold minimum play count of 10 may be applied to the dataset <b>230</b> such that the taste profile for User A includes the artists Screaming Chair, Michael Jackson, and S.G. A threshold minimum ranking of 5 may be applied to the dataset <b>240</b> such that the taste profile for User B includes the artists S.G., Metro, and Michael Jackson (i.e., artists whose songs have rankings of below 5). Areas of interest for User A and User B's taste profiles include the artists Michael Jackson and S.G. Here, the areas of interest (i.e., Michael Jackson and S.G., in this example) are determined based on the commonality of artists between the two taste profiles. This is similar to the previous illustrative example. However, it should be noted that the taste profiles in this example are generated based on different profile criteria (i.e., play counts for User A vs rankings for User B), whereas the profile criteria in the previous example was the same (i.e., play counts for both User A and User B). Accordingly, a playlist <b>200</b> may be generated and may include the song Bad by Michael Jackson and Night by S.G.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, one or more media items added to a playlist may be selected based on the media item having been shared by two or more users, based on whom the playlist is generated. As an example, a playlist may be generated based on the taste profiles for a User A and a User B. User A may have previously shared a song, Thriller, by Michael Jackson, with User B using a social media platform. Based on the share, the song Thriller, by Michael Jackson, may be included in the playlist.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, one or more media items may be added to a playlist based on a difference between a first taste profile and a second taste profile where the same difference is a commonality between the second taste profile and a third taste profile. As an example, as shown in Table 1, User A's taste profile may include Artist 1 and 2, User B's taste profile may include Artist 1, 2 and 3, and User C's taste profile may include Artist 3 and 4.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>User</entry><entry>Taste Profile</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>A</entry><entry>Artist 1, Artist 2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>B</entry><entry>Artist 1, Artist 2, Artist 3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>C</entry><entry>Artist 3, Artist 4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The difference between User A and User B's taste profiles may be that Artist 3 is not included in User A's taste profile. However, Artist 3 is included in both User B's taste profile and User C's taste profile. Accordingly, Artist 3 is a difference in User A and User B's profile and is a commonality in User B and User C's profile. Based on the difference in User A and User B's profile and the commonality between User B and User C's profile, songs by Artist 3 may be included in a playlist. Here, a user (e.g., User A in the previous example) may benefit from the inclusion of media items that do not correspond to her taste profile.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a playlist may be generated based on taste profiles of multiple users such that the multiple users need not access the playlist at the same time. For example, a User A and a User B may be friends and may select an option to generate a playlist based on their interests, via a mobile application. The mobile application may use both User A and User B's taste profiles to determine an area of interest and generate a playlist. User A may access the playlist at the same or different times as User B.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">Alternatively, a playlist may be generated for members of a media group. Media items in a media group playlist may be played the group's users at substantially the same time (a slight variance may result for latency, network connection, etc.). For example, a group of users (members of a media group) may access a virtual music room. A media group playlist may be generated based on the taste profiles of the members in that media group and playlist may be provided to all of the users that access the music room. As an example, if a user leaves the media group, the media group playlist may be dynamically adjusted to no longer factor in the taste profile of that user. Similarly, if a user joins a media group, the media group playlist may be dynamically adjusted to factor in the taste profile of that user.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">As applied herein, a media group may be any virtual space that two or more users can access the same item of media at substantially the same time. A media group may be associated with one or more specific storage devices or server. It will be understood that although two or more users are provided with media via a media group, individual users may be exposed to the media at slightly different times due to transactional factors such as an internet connection speed, latency, hardware capabilities, software capabilities, location, or the like. As an example, a user A and a user B may be part of the same media group and may be provided a song S at the same time. The song may be output from the speakers of user A's device a second faster than that of the speaker of user B's device due to user B's slower Internet connection. As another example, a user A and a user B may access the same playlist via the media group at the same time such that the playlist provides the same content to both user A and B at the same time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a media group where users <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>340</b> all access a media group playlist <b>300</b> at the same time.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a user may be invited to access a playlist. The invitation may be based on a determined area of interest between two or more other users. As an example, a determined area of interest for User A and User B may be alternative rock music. A User C may be invited to access a playlist based on User A and User B's taste profile if User C's taste profile would match the determined area of interest (i.e., alternative rock music in this example). As another example, a User C may access an application on her mobile phone and may select an option to search for a playlist that is suitable for User C. Based on the selection of the option, the application may match User C's taste profile to those of other users based on whom a playlist has been generated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">According to implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a user may be invited to access a playlist based on a connection between the user and one or more other uses for whom a playlist is generated. As an example, a playlist may be generated based on User A and User B's taste profiles. A User C may be connected to User A via a social networking outlet. Accordingly, User C may be invited to access the playlist generated based on User A and User B's taste profiles, based on the connection between User C and User A.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">According to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter, an external taste profile may be suggested to one or more users that have access to a playlist or based on whom a playlist is being generated. The external profile may be one that is similar to a given user's taste profile, different from a given user's taste profile, is complementary to a particular type of media a user listens to (e.g., if a user recently started listening to hip hop, then a hip hop heavy taste profile may be suggested), or the like. Alternatively or in addition, the suggested external taste profile may correspond to a user with whom recent interaction has occurred, one that matches an interest, one with whom an event is planned, one who is part of a common association, one who is within a given vicinity, one who has been in the same vicinity in the past, or the like. The one or more users may be given the option to incorporate the external taste profile or to ignore the external taste profile. As an example, a playlist may be generated based on a User A and a User B. User A may be given the option to incorporate the taste profile of a User C into the playlist. Here, User A may opt to incorporate User C's profile or to ignore the suggestion.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Similarly, a media item corresponding to an external taste profile may be provided to one or more users. The one or more users may provide a positive indication for the media item. A positive indication may result in incorporating the external taste profile with which the media item is associated with. For example, a playlist may be generated based on the taste profiles of User A and User B. Both User A and User B may be provided with the song Homeland by S.G., a song that is not on the playlist. If both User A and User B select an option indicating that they like the song Homeland by S.G., then the taste profile of a User C, with whom the song Homeland by S.G. is associated with, may be incorporated into the playlist.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Implementations of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in and used with a variety of component and network architectures (e.g., online media groups). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an example computer <b>20</b> (e.g., a mobile device, computer, laptop, etc.) suitable for implementing implementations of the presently disclosed subject matter.
