Nos. 7,693,320, 7,949,164 and 8,175,366, to Hadassa Degani et al., which disclose and describe methods and systems for reviewing and analyzing MRI imaging information related to the systems and methods disclosed and described herein, and the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0015">MRI imaging is well-known for medical applications, in which three dimensional (i.e., volumetric) imaging information of a patient's body region is acquired for diagnostic purposes. The MRI information may be acquired at a single point in time, or may be acquired at multiple points in time (&#x201c;dynamic imaging&#x201d;), in order to study the time progression of dynamic processes, such as the movement of blood.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0016">There are a number of parameters that influence the strength of the signal obtained from an MRI scanner, and the appearance of the acquired image. Some of these parameters are controlled by the operator of the scanner, such as the repetition time TR, the echo time TE, and the flip angle &#x3b1;. Other parameters are characteristics of the tissue being studied, such as the relaxation times T1 and T2. In principle, the unambiguous interpretation of an image involves only the observation and determination of the tissue dependent parameters, such as T1 and T2. In practice, however, these parameters are at least partially obscured by differing selections of TR and TE. Thus, it would be desirable to disentangle the effects of user-selected scanner parameters from the tissue-dependent imaging parameters.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0017">Commercially available computer-controlled workstations employ a number of common types of displays to communicate useful information to a radiologist or technician (together hereinafter referred to &#x201c;medical professional&#x201d;). For example, MRI displays for the study of breast tissue, e.g., to identify the presence and location of cancer lesions, are well-known. Such MRI displays for breast tissue typically display images showing various two-dimensional slices taken through one or both breasts, and provide the medical professional with the ability to scroll through the respective tissue image slices using a common device, such as mouse. This scrolling enables the medical professional or other reviewer to readily view different slices, eventually covering the entire breast region.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0018">Also, the medical professional or other reviewer may employ the MRI scanner to acquire volumetric image information of the breast/breasts using different MRI parameters to emphasize different physiological information. For example, &#x201c;T2 weighted&#x201d; images may be acquired with one set of acquisition parameters, and would show different information from &#x201c;T1 weighted&#x201d; images acquired with different scanner parameters. In addition, a set of images may be acquired before the administration of a contrast agent, and thereafter for several time periods after the contrast agent has entered the blood stream. The MRI workstation can be configured to display a selection of all of these image types, arranged in some order on a flat screen display. This arrangement of these multiple images is called the &#x201c;hanging protocol,&#x201d; and is usually set up by the manufacturer according to the preferences of the particular reviewer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0019">In addition to the different acquired images described above, a flat panel display is typically provided for showing certain computed information, such as &#x201c;maximum intensity projections&#x201d; (&#x201c;MIPs&#x201d;), 3-D volume renderings, and a graph displaying signal intensity as a function of time, such as that shown in the screen capture displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In particular, the &#x201c;signal intensity&#x201d; curves that appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depict the grey-level or pixel value at the user-selected voxel (y-axis) at each point in time (x-axis) in which the scanner acquired a time series of volumes. The first time point is taken before the introduction (e.g., by injection) of contrast agent into the patient's vasculature, and the subsequent time points after introduction of the contrast agent, typically spaced by approximately one minute per time point. Thus, each of the depicted signal intensity curves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> show a positive slope after the first time point, representing a &#x201c;signal enhancement&#x201d; taking place, which is due to the immediate increase in amount of contrast agent in the tissue volume being observed following introduction into the vasculature.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0020">Of particular interest is the &#x201c;shape&#x201d; of the respective curve after the initial rapid enhancement. By &#x201c;shape&#x201d; is meant whether the slope of curve after the &#x201c;knee&#x201d; is positive, flat, or negative. The criterion generally accepted by the medical imaging community is that a slope less than +&#x2212;10% is considered &#x201c;flat&#x201d; or &#x201c;plateau&#x201d;, and beyond 10% either sustained enhancement or &#x201c;washout.&#x201d; In particular, the shape of the curve is assumed to be indicative of different physiological conditions, and is often classified into three &#x201c;Types,&#x201d; i.e., Type I, Type II or Type III, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (reproduced from Kuhl et al 2), with Type I associated with benign tissue (sub-types &#x201c;Ia&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ib&#x201d; are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), Type II &#x201c;suggestive of malignancy&#x201d; (but often equivocal), and Type III associated with malignant lesions. With this in mind, in the screen capture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, curve <b>20</b> shows sustained enhancement; curve <b>22</b> shows Type I or rapid initial and sustained enhancement, curve <b>24</b> shows Type II or plateau behavior, and curve <b>26</b>, indicating the most suspicious lesions, shows Type III or rapid initial enhancement with washout.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0021">Notably, the manner in which the time progression of the signal intensity is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> gives the reviewer the impression that the signal is, at least in some way, proportional to the amount of contrast agent in the tissue volume being studied. However, this is not necessarily the case. Furthermore, based on the way the signal intensity is displayed in these figures, the reviewer may mistakenly assume that the signal is linearly proportional to the amount of contrast agent. Again, this is not necessarily the case. Instead, as will be explained in detail herein, such linearity is actually a necessary condition for the assignment of a Type I to III to a volume of tissue to be independent of MRI scanner acquisition parameters, particularly TR, TE, and flip angle &#x3b1;. Without such a linear relationship, a portion of tissue that appears as Type 1 or Type III, may change to Type II simply by being scanned with different acquisition parameters.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSED INVENTIONS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0022">In accordance with one aspect of the disclosed inventions, a magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) review workstation comprises a control processor, and a display integrated or otherwise operatively coupled with the control processor, wherein the control processor is configured to receive and analyze magnetic resonant imaging information pertaining to an imaged volume of tissue, and to cause to be displayed on the display output information that reflects or is otherwise indicative of an absorption rate of a contrast agent in the volume of tissue.

However, the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner. It is to be further understood that the various elements and/or features of different illustrative embodiments may be combined with each other and/or substituted for each other wherever possible within the scope of this disclosure and the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">In contrast to the prior art display modalities, a new display provided in accordance with one aspect of the disclosed inventions plots a concentration of contrast agent as a function of time, making the indirect connection between signal and concentration irrelevant. As explained herein, the concentration may be computed from the known physics of the MRI acquisition and the known acquisition parameters. Embodiments of the display are to be used with (as part of) an MRI display workstation, in which the time plot of contrast agent concentration may supplement or replace the presently used signal intensity plot depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in order to more provide more accurate information to the medical professional for evaluating patient MRI information.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">The difficulties resulting from the non-linear relationship between the signal and the concentration of contrast agent are demonstrated in Jansen et al [<b>1</b>], which describes a study performed of 601 patients, including <b>497</b> malignant and <b>185</b> benign lesions viewed on three different scanner/protocol combinations. The three data sets produced were called &#x201c;System <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>&#x201d; by the authors, each group indicating which of the three scanner/protocol combinations was used for each individual case. The table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> summarizes the MRI systems and Protocols used in the study. The present inventors believe the parameters most responsible for differences are shown in the TR/TE row and the Flip angle. The finding of this study was that only 47% of Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) lesions imaged with System <b>3</b> exhibited washout type curves, compared with 75% and 74% of those imaged with System <b>1</b> and System, 2. These differences are shown graphically in the pie charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, in which:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts the respective proportion of data sets exhibiting Type III washout (<b>40</b><i>a</i>), Type II plateau (<b>44</b><i>a</i>), and Type I persistent (<b>42</b><i>a</i>) for System <b>1</b>;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> depicts the respective proportion of data sets exhibiting Type III washout (<b>40</b><i>b</i>), Type II plateau (<b>44</b><i>b</i>), and Type I persistent (<b>42</b><i>b</i>) for System <b>2</b>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> depicts the respective proportion of data sets exhibiting Type III washout (<b>40</b><i>c</i>), Type II plateau (<b>44</b><i>c</i>), and Type I persistent (<b>42</b><i>c</i>) for System <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">It is believed that many if not most medical professional base their diagnosis of the malignancy of a lesion largely on which of these curve types is characteristic of its time curve, with Type III being most indicative of cancer, Type I indicative of benign tissue, and Type II either suggestive or ambiguous. There is an intuitive explanation of why a malignant lesion would be expected to have a Type III curve having to do with the vascularity of lesions and vessel permeability. Breast cancer has increased vascularity with an increased permeability leading to an early uptake and early washout behavior, i.e., Type III. However, the results of the Jansen et al study, as summarized in the pie charts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-C</figref>, suggest that cases may be placed into different types or classifications, due of differences in scanner/protocol parameters used in the signal acquisition, not only because of underlying likelihood of malignancy. This would appear to be a very serious disadvantage of the present method of analyzing kinetic behavior.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">The present inventors believe this problem occurs as a result of the non-linear relationship between the MRI signal and the contrast agent concentration, in particular, in a signal of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and not the concentration being observed and classified into Types I-III. In the spoiled gradient echo sequence, the standard method used in dynamic breast MRI, the signal intensity can be expressed as a function of tissue and acquisition parameters by equation 1 [3,4]:</p><p id="p-0039" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>S</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mi>t</mi>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>PD</mi>      <mo>&#xd7;</mo>      <mi>sin</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>      <mo>&#xd7;</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>-</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>exp</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <mrow>           <mo>-</mo>           <mi>TR</mi>          </mrow>          <mo>/</mo>          <msub>           <mi>T</mi>           <mn>1</mn>          </msub>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>-</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>cos</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>&#x3b1;exp</mi>          <mo>&#x2061;</mo>          <mo>(</mo>          <mrow>           <mrow>            <mo>-</mo>            <mi>TR</mi>           </mrow>           <mo>/</mo>           <msub>            <mi>T</mi>            <mn>1</mn>           </msub>          </mrow>          <mo>)</mo>         </mrow>        </mrow>       </mrow>      </mfrac>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0040" num="0000">where P is the proton density, D is the scanner gain, &#x3b1; is the flip angle, and T1 is the tissue relaxation time, a characteristic of the tissue being examined.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">The tissue relaxation time T<sub>1 </sub>is related to the pre-contrast relaxation time T<sub>10 </sub>and the local tissue relaxation rate R<sub>1</sub>.

num="0050">Relative signal enhancement allows the proton density to cancel out. This is the fundamental relationship between signal intensity E(t) and contrast agent concentration C(t), and it depends on many parameters that change between protocols, such as TR and flip angle &#x3b1;, and on parameters that depend on the tissue T<sub>10</sub>. Specifically, this demonstrates a highly non-linear relationship between S(t) and C(t), meaning that the shape of the C(t) curve will not in general be preserved when transformed to S(t).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">By way of demonstrative example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> depicts signal enhancement as a function of concentration for different values of T<sub>10</sub>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts the signal enhancement ratio versus contrast agent concentration from the 3 systems in Newstead et al with T<sub>10 </sub>selected at 1200 ms. One skilled in the art will be able to observe the non-linearity of the curves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. In particular, the curve for System <b>3</b> even shows saturation at approximately 200%, i.e., the concentration can increase greatly without a significant increase in signal.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">A hypothetical case demonstrates how a concentration curve with the suspicious time dependence of Type III can be turned into the ambivalent signal curve of Type II by this non-linear transformation. Curve <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the hypothetical concentration curve exhibiting high initial uptake followed by rapid washout. The y-axis for concentration is shown at left and is in units of mmol/liter. Curve <b>60</b> shows the signal enhancement derived from this with the transformation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The y-axis is on the right is in units of %. The peak concentration point occurring near time point <b>3</b> is depressed relative to later points due to the saturation of the concentration&#x2014;signal curve. This tends to make a &#x201c;peaking&#x201d; distribution (Type III), flatter, or more like Type II. Clearly, in this case, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the signal enhancement exhibits plateau behavior in spite of a clear Type III behavior of the concentration.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">Similarly, a continuously increasing concentration of the Type I curve type can artificially plateau because of the saturation of the Signal/Concentration curve, and become a Type II signal curve. In retrospect it is believed that the intuitive expectation of the curve types is actually an expectation of the curve shape for concentration enhancement, which is generally assumed to be equivalent to the curve shape for signal enhancement, but this would only be true if the transformation from the former to the later were linear, which it is not.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">Notably, the present inventors used the average peak signal enhancement ratio of malignant cancers in the UC data, and converted the ratio into contrast agent concentration to simulate the change in the pie chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. This is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, which shows much closer agreement to System <b>1</b> and System <b>2</b>, consistent with the proposition by the present inventors that the non-linear transformation from concentration to signal is responsible for the different proportions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. Thus, one advantage of proving a display of kinetic information in the form of Contrast as a function of time, rather than signal versus time, is that contrast is the quantity that is directly related to the physiology of the lesion, independent of scanner parameters such as TR and TE and flip angle &#x3b1;, and thus avoids the adverse effects caused by non-linearity.</p><p id="p-0051"

&#x201c;FLASH&#x201d; equation, is correct for the spoiled gradient echo sequence, which is the most commonly used sequence for breast MRI [8]. Other sequences, such as &#x201c;TURBO FLASH&#x201d;, although rarely used in breast MRI applications, will have other known equations relating Signal E(t) to Concentration C(t). In this equation, the repetition time TR and flip angle &#x3b1; are parameters set by the operator of the scanner. R<sub>1 </sub>is the rate constant, measured in other experiments to be 4.3 to 6.7 L/mml s, depending on the type of Gadolineum Chelate used [7]. The remaining parameter in this equation is T<sub>10</sub>, the pre-contrast value of tissue T<sub>1</sub>. Although &#x201c;textbook&#x201d; values for T<sub>10 </sub>may be taken from published measurements of &#x201c;typical tissue,&#x201d; these numbers can have significant errors when applied to different individuals, and do not adequately take into account the variability observed in an actual tissue lesion.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">Alternative methods of measuring the T<sub>10 </sub>value at each voxel of the imaged volume from the individual patient include T1 mapping, which requires at least one, and preferably two extra volume acquisitions prior to injection of CA, each acquisition using a different flip angle &#x3b1;. This method can be understood by considering the signal equations for the commonly used scanner sequences used in breast imaging (SPGR, FFE, or FLASH). In these sequences a series of low flip angle RF pulses are used within a short TR period. The signal from an FFE sequence with flip angle &#x3b1; across the whole slice is given by equation 5:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00005" num="00005"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mi>a</mi>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>       <mn>0</mn>      </msub>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>-</mo>        <msup>         <mi>e</mi>         <mrow>          <mi>TR</mi>          <mo>/</mo>          <msub>           <mi>T</mi>           <mn>1</mn>          </msub>         </mrow>        </msup>       </mrow>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>-</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>cos</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>a</mi>         <mo>&#xd7;</mo>         <msup>          <mi>e</mi>          <mrow>           <mi>TR</mi>           <mo>/</mo>           <msub>            <mi>T</mi>            <mn>1</mn>           </msub>          </mrow>         </msup>        </mrow>       </mrow>      </mfrac>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>sin</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>a</mi>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>5</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0057" num="0059">A computationally simple method for estimating T1 can be obtained by manipulating equation 4 and rearranging into the form shown below in equation 6.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00006" num="00006"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mi>a</mi>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>sin</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>a</mi>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <msup>        <mi>e</mi>        <mrow>         <mrow>          <mo>-</mo>          <mi>TR</mi>         </mrow>         <mo>/</mo>         <msub>          <mi>T</mi>          <mn>1</mn>         </msub>        </mrow>       </msup>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mfrac>        <mrow>         <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>a</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>tan</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mi>a</mi>        </mrow>       </mfrac>      </mrow>      <mo>+</mo>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>        <mn>0</mn>       </msub>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>-</mo>        <msup>         <mi>e</mi>         <mrow>          <mrow>           <mo>-</mo>           <mi>TR</mi>          </mrow>          <mo>/</mo>          <msub>           <mi>T</mi>           <mn>1</mn>          </msub>         </mrow>        </msup>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>6</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">Note that a plot of p/(sin&#x3b1; vs &#x3c1;/tan&#x3b1;) at different values of flip angle forms a straight line with slope a=exp(&#x2212;TR/T1).

T1 mapping therefore requires extra volume acquisitions, each one adding approximately a minute to the total patient procedure. It may happen that this extra scanning time is prohibitively expensive for many medical facilities, and for this reason the present inventors prefer a further alternative approach using reference tissue instead of textbook values or T1 mapping. In particular assuming, as in conventional DCE-MRI protocols, the use of short TR and small flip angle, the relative signal S(0)/S<sub>ref</sub>(0) (as opposed to the absolute signal S(0) of a lesion) is relatively insensitive to the actual protocol adjustment of MRI system.
