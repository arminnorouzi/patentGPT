The device wafer or layer defines a device plane. In this disclosure, the device plane will be illustrated as the xy-plane.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A proof mass formed in the device wafer or layer can be configured to respond to acceleration in the direction of a z-axis (which is perpendicular to the xy-plane) by rotating in seesaw motion about a rotation axis which lies in the xy-plane. The proof mass needs to be asymmetric with respect to this rotation axis, so that it's center of mass does not lie on the axis. The proof mass may be suspended from fixed anchor points by suspenders which are sufficiently thin to undergo torsional twisting when the accelerometer experiences acceleration in the z-direction and the proof mass begins to turn out of the xy-plane.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A general problem in microelectromechanical devices is that suspension arrangements which are designed to allow a certain mode of motion will also allow other modes. Many of these additional modes will be undesired because they disturb the acceleration measurement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Document U.S. Pat. No. 8,539,836 discloses an accelerometer where two proof masses are suspended side by side to rotate out of the device plane in seesaw motion. In this suspension arrangement the proof masses are liable to undergo parasitic oscillation due to the influence of external vibrations. Such parasitic oscillation may disturb the out-of-plane measurement.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present disclosure is to provide an apparatus which alleviates the above disadvantage.

An advantage of this arrangement is that the suspension structure can more stiffly resist vibrations in the device plane.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the following the disclosure will be described in greater detail by means of preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrate accelerometers with two different designs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrate accelerometers where the first and second rotation axes coincide and corresponding central anchoring arrangements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrates various dimensions in the accelerometer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref> illustrate accelerometers where the y-coordinate of the first rotation axis is greater than the y-coordinate of the second rotation axis and a corresponding central anchoring arrangement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrate alternative central anchoring arrangements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b><i>a</i>-<b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrate accelerometers with additional elements for measuring acceleration in the direction of the x-axis and/or the y-axis.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrate a measurement geometry which can be used if the first and second rotation axes do not coincide.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">This disclosure describes an accelerometer for measuring acceleration in the direction of a z-axis which is perpendicular to an xy-plane. The accelerometer comprises a first proof mass and a second proof mass. The first proof mass is adjacent to the second proof mass. The accelerometer further comprises one or more central anchor points located substantially between the first proof mass and the second proof mass. The accelerometer further comprises a first side anchor point and a second side anchor point.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first proof mass is suspended from the first side anchor point and from the one or more central anchor points with a first suspension structure. The first suspension structure allows the first proof mass to undergo rotation about a first rotation axis. The second proof mass is suspended from the one or more central anchor points and from the second side anchor point with a second suspension structure. The second suspension structure allows the second proof mass to undergo rotation about a second rotation axis. The first and the second rotation axes are parallel to each other and define an x-direction which is parallel to the first and the second rotation axes and a y-direction which is perpendicular to the x-direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The x-coordinate of the second side anchor point is greater than the x-coordinate of the first side anchor point. The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the first proof mass is greater than the y-coordinate of the first rotation axis. The y-coordinate of the center of mass of the second proof mass is less than the y-coordinate of the second rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first suspension structure comprises a first torsion element which is attached between the first side anchor point and the first proof mass. The first suspension structure also comprises a second torsion element which is attached between one of the one or more central anchor points and the first proof mass.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second suspension structure comprises a third torsion element which is attached between one of the one or more central anchor points and the second proof mass. The second suspension structure also comprises a fourth torsion element which is attached between the second side anchor point and the second proof mass.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The x-coordinate of the center of the first torsion element is less than the x-coordinate of the first side anchor point. The x-coordinate of the center of the fourth torsion element is greater than the x-coordinate of the second side anchor point.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this disclosure the device plane is illustrated and referred to as the xy-plane. The device plane is determined by the device wafer or layer where proof masses and suspension structures are formed by etching. The vertical z-axis is perpendicular to the xy-plane. Motion where the center of gravity of a proof mass moves in a vertical direction may be referred to as out-of-plane motion, or motion out of the device plane. Motion where the center of gravity of a proof mass moves in the xy-plane may be referred to as in-plane motion, or motion in the device plane. The center of gravity of each proof mass may lie in the device plane when the proof mass is in its rest position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The micromechanical structures which form the mobile parts (such as proof masses and flexible suspenders) of the accelerometer can be prepared in the device wafer by etching the wafer. When the structures are completed, the fixed parts of the device wafer form a supporting body which typically surrounds the mobile parts in the device plane. The device wafer may be a silicon wafer. The partly mobile parts may be manufactured from the device wafer by etching the wafer. The device wafer may require structural support from a separate, much thicker wafer during manufacturing and/or in the finished component. These thicker wafers may be called handle wafers or support wafers. Similar arrangements can be used when a device layer is etched.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of the first and second proof masses forms a seesaw, which may also be called a teeter-totter. Each seesaw responds to acceleration in the direction of the z-axis with out-of-plane rotation. If the seesaws are not coupled to each other, the response of each seesaw is independent of the response of the other. The accelerometer can be made more robust by coupling the two to each other, so that they move in unison in response to acceleration along the z-axis.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Anchor points are fixed structures which do not undergo any movement with respect to the fixed surroundings of the accelerometer when the device undergoes acceleration. The proof masses are suspended from these anchor points with suspension structures. These suspension structures include at least some flexible parts, such as the torsionally flexible torsion elements. The suspension structures may also include substantially rigid extension parts which may be fixed at one end to an anchor point. The extension bars are dimensioned so that they undergo far less elastic deformation than the flexible parts when the device is in operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The parts of the suspension structure which flexibly allow out-of-plane motion are referred to as torsion elements in this disclosure. As illustrated in the figures of this disclosure, they may be torsion bars which are narrow in the direction which is perpendicular to the corresponding rotation axis. Other torsionally flexible structures, like e.g. meander springs, could alternatively be used. In the figures of this disclosure each torsion element in a suspension structure lies on the corresponding rotation axis. However, a torsion element can alternatively comprise two or more torsionally flexible parts on different sides of the axis, and in that case none of these parts needs to lie exactly on the rotation axis. This option has not been illustrated, but it could be implemented for any torsion element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first torsion element may be aligned on the first rotation axis, the second torsion element may be aligned on the first rotation axis, the third torsion element may be aligned on the second rotation axis and the fourth torsion element may be aligned on the second rotation axis. However, for the reasons presented above these alignments are optional. Any of these torsion elements could alternatively be implemented so that they are not aligned on the corresponding rotation axis. The center of gravity of each proof mass lies off its rotation axis. The suspension arrangement can be configured to allow torsional twisting about the rotation axis. By dimensioning the suspension arrangement suitably, it allows the proof mass to rotate when a given minimum amount of z-axis acceleration is exceeded. The proof mass undergoes a predesigned amount of out-of-plane rotation in response to z-axis acceleration of a certain magnitude. The torsional stiffness of the suspension arrangements can be selected so that suitable tilt angles are obtained in the range of z-axis acceleration values where the sensor is expected to operate. The tilt angle of a proof mass can be measured capacitively with sensing electrodes attached to the proof mass and to an opposing fixed structure. The magnitude of the acceleration can be calculated from this measurement.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates an accelerometer. The illustrated x-axis here shows the positive x-direction, i.e. the direction in which the x-coordinate increases. A first proof mass <b>11</b> is suspended from a first side anchor point <b>171</b> and a central anchor point <b>145</b>. A second proof mass <b>12</b> is suspended from a second side anchor point <b>172</b> and the central anchor point <b>145</b>. Only one central anchor point <b>145</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, but multiple central anchor points could alternatively be used and the first and second proof masses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> could be suspended from different central anchor points. If the accelerometer comprises more than one central anchor points, then said more than one central anchor points may be adjacent to each other and they may be located between the first proof mass and the second proof mass.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>the y-axis illustrates the positive y-direction, i.e. the direction in which the y-coordinate increases. The y-coordinate of the center of mass <b>111</b> of the first proof mass <b>11</b> is therefore greater than the y-coordinate of the first rotation axis <b>191</b>, while the y-coordinate of the center of mass <b>121</b> of the second proof mass <b>12</b> is less than the y-coordinate of the second rotation axis <b>192</b>. The first and second proof masses will therefore rotate in opposite out-of-plane directions when the accelerometer undergoes acceleration in the z-direction which is perpendicular to the xy-plane.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first suspension structure which suspends the first proof mass here comprises a first torsion element <b>131</b> which extends between the first side anchor point <b>171</b> and the first proof mass <b>11</b>. The first suspension structure also comprises a second torsion element <b>132</b> which extends between the central anchor point <b>145</b> and the first proof mass <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The second suspension structure which suspends the second proof mass correspondingly comprises a third torsion element <b>133</b> which extends between the central anchor point <b>145</b> and the second proof mass <b>12</b>.

The first and second rotation axes are indicated with reference numbers <b>191</b> and <b>192</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The x-coordinate of the center of the first torsion element <b>131</b> is less than the x-coordinate of the first side anchor point <b>171</b>. The x-coordinate of the center of the fourth torsion element <b>134</b> is greater than the x-coordinate of the second side anchor point <b>172</b>. This has the advantage that the first torsion element <b>131</b> can be placed far from the second torsion element <b>132</b> in the x-direction, and the third torsion element <b>133</b> can be placed far from the fourth torsion element <b>134</b> in the x-direction. Placing these parts far away from each other raises the resonance frequencies of parasitic oscillation modes, for example modes where the proof mass rotates about the z-axis or the y-axis. It also reduces the bending which may occur in the proof mass when the accelerometer undergoes motion in the y- or z-direction. The risk that external disturbances or proof mass bending would influence the z-acceleration measurement is thereby reduced.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is typically advantageous to place the first and second side anchor points and the one or more central anchor points close to each other. Mechanical stresses will then influence the proof masses in approximately the same way. The effect of such stress can then often be cancelled (at least to some extent) in a differential measurement.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first suspension structure may comprise a substantially rigid first extension bar which extends from the first side anchor point to the first torsion element. The second suspension structure may comprise a substantially rigid second extension bar which extends from the second side anchor point to the fourth torsion element. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates an accelerometer where the first suspension structure comprises a substantially rigid extension bar <b>151</b> which lies on the first rotation axis <b>191</b> and extends from the first side anchor point <b>171</b> to the first torsion element <b>131</b>.
