Wastewater grit majorly consists of sand and gravel, and also contains pathogens and some impurities such as eggshells, bone chips, seeds, coffee grounds, and large organic particles (USEPA, 2003). Large water resource recovery facilities produce a high volume of wastewater grit, and the amount can rise in winter due to the use of sand for winter maintenance (The Seattle Times, 2009). Wastewater grit is directly landfilled instead of being reused or recovered in the current practice. Landfilling is costly and unsustainable, and the reusable values of wastewater grit cannot be further tapped. Hence, there is an urgent need for better methods for disposing and/or recycling wastewater grit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed are methods for the treatment of wastewater grit to inactivate pathogens and prepare solidified materials that include wastewater grit.

Grit majorly consists of sand and gravel, and also contains pathogens and some impurities such as eggshells, bone chips, seeds, coffee grounds, and large organic particles (USEPA, 2003). Large water resource recovery facilities produce a high volume of grit, and the amount can rise in winter due to the use of sand for winter maintenance (The Seattle Times, 2009). Grit is directly landfilled instead of being reused or recovered in the current practice. Landfilling is costly and unsustainable, and the reusable values of grit cannot be further tapped. Hence, there is an urgent need for a better grit disposal solution.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPC) is a dense and insoluble ceramic matrix of magnesium potassium phosphate hydrate which can be fabricated by the reaction: MgO+KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>+5H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;MgKPO<sub>4</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O. Other alkaline earth metals' oxides or hydroxides (e.g. CaO) can also be used to form CBPC. In addition to hydrophosphates of potassium (e.g. KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), other typical acid-phosphates can also be used as a CBPC ingredient, including hydrophosphates of ammonia, calcium, sodium, magnesium, and aluminum (e.g. (NH<sub>4</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Mg(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, and AlH<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O). CBPC is an excellent and fast setting material for stabilizing and solidifying waste streams (e.g. fly ash, cement sludge, and mercury-containing waste) (Liu et al., 2008; Singh et al., 1997). As for transportation infrastructure applications such as pothole repairs, fly-ash-based CBPC has been tested at a small scale and shown good integrity with asphalt pavement in cold weather (Wagh, 2016). All the previously studied wastes are inorganic materials. However, grit is a unique mixed waste of inorganic and organic material containing infectious microorganism (i.e., pathogen), which is more complex and has never been treated using CBPC.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The present disclosure describes a novel method for integrating grit and CBPC for grit pathogen inactivation and grit solidification. Before synthesizing the grit-based CBPC material, the pathogens remaining in grit must be greatly reduced to protect the environment and public health. The mixture of calcium and magnesium oxides or hydroxides such as CaO/MgO mixture (i.e. CBPC ingredients) can form a high pH alkaline solution for pathogen inactivation. In particular, a small amount of calcium oxides or hydroxides (e.g. CaO) can raise pH to above 12, which is enough to kill most pathogens (Jimenez-Cisneros et al., 2001). Magnesium oxides or hydroxides (e.g. MgO) are also effective in reducing pathogens (Jin and He, 2011). The grit-CBPC mortar can be further produced by mixing pathogen-reduced alkaline grit slurry with hydrophosphates of ammonia, calcium, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, and potassium (e.g. (NH<sub>4</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, Ca(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Mg(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, AlH<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), then grit-based CBPC material is ready to be solidified for further applications. The production and application of grit-based CBPC is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">We have proven that grit pathogen can be minimized by CBPC ingredients (i.e., CaO and MgO mixture was used) and the solidified grit-based CBPC material, in which KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>was used as the hydrophosphate, can meet the unconfined compressive strength requirement for asphalt pavement set by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Moreover, grit-based CBPC can be cured under low temperature (e.g. &#x2212;10 degrees Celsius) to meet the specified compressive strength. The grit-based CBPC material (mixture of raw grit, CaO, MgO, and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) can contain up to 50% raw grit by mass with satisfied compressive strength without extra additives. Assuming the average moisture content of raw grit is 80%, per the total mass of the mixture of raw grit, CaO, MgO, and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, raw grit concentration varies from 1% to 50%, CaO concentration varies from 0.1% to 1.5%, MgO concentration varies from 1% to 25%, and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>concentration varies from 3% to 75%. This novel treatment and disposal method can largely divert grit from landfill and convert it to useful products.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The work described below was performed to evaluate the performance of grit-based CBPC in terms of pathogen inactivation and compressive strength by varying grit loading, inactivation time, curing time, and curing temperature. The grit-based performance was compared to that of the pure CBPC material.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Methodology</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0088">For the grit pathogen inactivation test (fecal coliform as indicator), a small amount of CaO and MgO mixture was added to raw grit with water. The amount of water depends on the grit moisture content and the total amount CBPC ingredients. The raw grit loading in the grit-based CBPC (mixture of raw grit, CaO, MgO, and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) varied from 10% to 60% by mass. The fecal coliform density (i.e. CFU: colony-forming unit) of each alkaline grit slurry was analyzed using the Colilert&#xae; method (www.nemi.gov, 2017) after 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours to determine the optimal pathogen inactivation time that meets the pathogen standard. The pathogen standard for Class A biosolids management regulated by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) was used to evaluate the inactivation effectiveness (Wisconsin State Legislature, 2011). The pathogen inactivation performance was compared to the same procedure with MgO only.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For the compressive strength test, the grit-based CBPC mortar was formed by adding KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>into the pathogen-reduced alkaline slurries. The mortar was cured in the mold for different durations (1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 curing days) at room temperature (20 degrees Celsius). The mortar was also cured under other temperatures (&#x2212;30, &#x2212;10, 0, 40, and 60 degrees Celsius) for 28 days. The compressive strength of each specimen was tested in compression by a load frame. The loading rate during the test was maintained constant at 0.02 in/min.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Results and Discussion</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Grit pathogen densities were reduced by CaO/MgO mixture (CBPC ingredients) from 375 CFU/g TS (per gram of total solids of grit) of the raw grit to below 5 CFU/g TS of the inactivated grit with the 10-40% grit loading and 12-hour inactivation time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). As for the 10-40% grit loading, the pathogen densities inactivated by MgO solely were approximately 40 CFU/g TS, which were higher than those inactivated by CaO/MgO mixture. Therefore, CaO/MgO mixture should be used to minimize the grit pathogen density. The inactivated pathogen density also met the standard of 1000 CFU/g TS set by WDNR.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As for higher grit loadings (50% and 60%), a high-moisture slurry could not be formed since the addition of water was not necessary (i.e. grit moisture was sufficient for CBPC synthesis). Hence, the mixing between inactivation agents (CaO/MgO mixture and MgO) and grit was not good, leading to a high pathogen density similar to that of raw grit. As for the inactivation time, the pathogen density was quickly minimized within an hour and the inactivation was stable through twelve hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The grit-based CBPCs with the grit loading of 10-50% met the unconfined compressive strength requirement of 2.1 MPa (equal to Marshall stability of 8 kN) for asphalt pavement specified by AASHTO (Hassan and Setyawan, 2002) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). This compressive strength is widely used by state transportation agencies in the United States (search &#x201c;Division 400 pavements&#x201d; in Google). If a safety factor of 1.5 is required, only the average compressive strength of 20% and 30% grit loadings was qualified. Therefore, the recommended highest grit loading was 30% for a strength-guaranteed grit-based CBPC.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The compressive strength of the grit-based CBPC with 20% and 30% grit loadings was also monitored during 28 curing days (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The average grit-based compressive strength reached approximately 2 MPa in one day. The strength developed to over 2 MPa after three days and to over 3 MPa after seven days. The evolution of the grit-based compressive strength slowed down in the last 21 days. Compared to grit-based CBPC, the compressive strength of pure CBPC still increased after 7 days and was finally close to 8 MPa.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Grit-based CBPC was solidified successfully at low and high temperatures, but only the compressive strength of the specimens cured at &#x2212;10, 0, and 40&#xb0; C. met the requirement of 2.1 MPa for asphalt pavement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). As for these strength-qualified specimens, except the specimen with 30% grit loading and cured at &#x2212;10&#xb0; C., all the compressive strength was over 3.15 MPa (the strength with a safety factor of 1.5), indicating that the temperature impact was limited. However, under the extreme temperatures (i.e. &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. and 60&#xb0; C.), the chemical bond formation between MgO and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>was most likely retarded or partially inhibited, resulting in the fragile structure with a lower compressive strength.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Significance</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0095">A.

Raw grit with water was placed in a centrifuge to separate water and light organic components from the heavy particles (mainly inorganic particles and was called inorganic particles in this research). The separated water and light organic components were disposed. The inorganic particles were used for GAP synthesis with different loadings (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% by mass). The compressive strength of each specimen was measured after 1, 3, 7 and 28 curing days, respectively, under room temperature. It was found that the compressive strength of GAP specimens with inorganic particles was similar to that of specimens with raw grits if they had same solid grit loading by mass. However, the centrifuged grit did not have the strong smell as that of raw grit, occupied much smaller storing space, and could be kept in room temperature for relatively long period without growing mold.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Long-Term Stability of Inactivated Grit</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The pathogen density analysis was conducted using Standard Method 9223B to evaluate the long-term pathogen density of raw and inactivated grits. A small amount of calcium oxide (CaO) was added to raw grit and mixed to achieve a homogenous slurry to obtain inactivated grit. The pathogen densities of both raw and inactivated grits were evaluated at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. Analysis for Day 1 demonstrated a raw grit pathogen density of 1.9&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>&#xb1;2.5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>cfu/100 mL, and the alkaline slurry of 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>2</sup>&#xb1;2.0&#xd7;10<sup>2 </sup>cfu/100 mL. Day 3, the raw grit pathogen density was 1.6&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>&#xb1;7.8&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>cfu/100 mL, with the alkaline slurry having no detectableb colonies. The inactivated grits remained at non-detectable levels for the remainder of the long-term study. Day 7, Day 14, and Day 28 demonstrated a raw grit of 6.0&#xd7;10<sup>2</sup>&#xb1;2.0&#xd7;10<sup>2 </sup>cfu/100 mL, 1.1&#xd7;10<sup>2</sup>&#xb1;5.9&#xd7;10<sup>1 </sup>cfu/100 mL, and 1.3&#xd7;10<sup>2</sup>&#xb1;8.8&#xd7;10&#x2032; cfu/100 mL, respectively. Therefore, CaO could effectively inactivate the pathogens in grits and the inactivated grits were stable for long-term storage.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Formulating Color of GAP</heading><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Black pigment powder was used to change the color of GAP to make it more compatible with asphalt pavement aesthetically. The compressive strengths of the color-formulated samples were measured after 3 and 21 curing days under room temperature. The formulated colors were compared with those of aged and new asphalt pavements. The pigment-added samples had dark grey color, which was close to that of aged asphalt pavement. As for the compressive strength, the compressive strength of color-formulated samples was similar to that of the control sample and met the requirement of 2.1 MPa for asphalt pavement application.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Field Testing of the GAP</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Three potholes on the roads at the South Shore Water Reclamation Facility (Oak Creek, WI) were selected to be repaired by GAP. These potholes were located on a parking lot, light-traffic load and heavy traffic load, respectively, to study the performance of GAP in field subjected to real environment and different traffic conditions. The debris in the potholes was removed by vacuum before the GAP repairment. The following pictures show before and after GAP repairment of a pothole.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the foregoing description, it will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that varying substitutions and modifications may be made to the invention disclosed herein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
