Furthermore, the invention relates to an electrical drive system having a corresponding device and a vehicle having an electrical drive system as well as a computer program and a computer-readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electrical rotating field machines, in particular permanent excitation synchronous machines having trenched magnets, are activated to generate a desired torque by means of a suitable combination of direct torque and reluctance torque. In field-oriented control, the direct torque and the reluctance torque are set by means of a corresponding selection of the d-current and q-current operating points (id, iq) in the rotor-fixed coordinate system. For current control in a field-oriented control (FOC), in particular in the base speed range, the associated current for a desired torque is ascertained from a locus curve, the so-called MTPC (maximum torque per current). These MTPC locus curves can be analytically determined, for example, under the assumption of an ideal machine having known inductances Ld and Lq. For real machines having saturation effects, a further approach is preferably to generate the MTPC locus curve numerically from simulation data (for example, finite element simulations). Further dependencies, for example temperature dependencies, internal electrical machine losses, spreads of material parameters and flows, appear in many cases to be the most viable way for an experimental determination of the MTPC locus curve on the test bench, preferably by way of example on a golden sample machine. Exemplar spreads, tolerances, etc. are neglected here. For example, a characteristic map of the torque over id/iq is sampled, currents and torques are measured, and the points for the shortest current pointer for desired torques are ascertained and suitably saved. This procedure is often complex and slow and therefore costly.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is therefore a need for alternative methods and devices for calibrating a control of an electrical machine for a specifiable torque value.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method is provided for calibrating a control, preferably a current control, of an electrical machine for a specifiable torque value. The electrical machine is operated using a field-oriented control. The method comprises the following steps:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">a.) Specifying a current vector to generate the specifiable torque value by means of a connectable electrical machine. The current vector has a length and a direction as parameters.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">b.) Specifying a test signal and superimposing the current vector with the test signal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">c.) Capturing a response signal resulting from the superposition, preferably the amplitude of the resulting response signal, by means of a sensor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">d.) Evaluating the response signal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">e.) Determining a calibrated current vector as a function of the evaluation of the response signal.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">f.) Operating the control of the electrical machine for the specifiable torque value by means of specifying the calibrated current vector.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The operation of electrical machines by means of field-oriented controls is known. The alternating variables of the phase currents are each transferred into a coordinate system rotating at the frequency of the alternating variables. Within the rotating coordinate system, zero-frequency variables, to which all typical methods of control technology can be applied, then result from the alternating variables in stationary operation of the electrical machine. Due to the multiphase phase- offset in alternating currents applied in the stator, a rotating magnetic field, consisting of a stator flux and a rotor flux, results during operation of the electrical machine. The control of the electrical machine specifies a stator current as a function of a specifiable torque value. Within the rotating coordinate system, the d/q coordinate system, which rotates synchronously with the rotor flux and the d axis of which points in the direction of the rotor flux, a stator current is represented as a stator current pointer or stator current vector, which is characterized via its length and its direction. This current pointer rotates synchronously with the rotating stator flux or rotor flux of the electrical machine. In the d/q coordinate system, the current pointer can be represented in accordance with its length and its direction by means of two components Id and Iq perpendicular to one another, which are zero-frequency variables in the stationary case. Machine-specific lines can be represented in this coordinate system, along which the electrical machine emits a constant torque, so-called iso-torque lines. A control of an electrical machine can access desired operating points on these iso-torque lines by means of characteristic maps, wherein these parameters can change due to above-mentioned dependencies for each machine (exemplary spreads), the rotor temperature, and over the runtime of the machine and are thus to be calibrated. For current vectors of equal length, there is only one very specific direction, in which the maximum torque is generated by a connected electrical machine. In one step of the method, a current vector is specified to generate a specifiable torque value. To check whether it is the correct direction to generate the maximum torque, a test signal is specified and superimposed on the current vector. This superposition results in an oscillation of the emitted torque in a connected electrical machine. This oscillation in the torque results, due to the mechanical coupling of the electrical machine with the housing, in a mechanical and/or acoustic oscillation of the housing and components connected thereto. The mechanical transmission behavior of the mechanical system results in a noise excitation of a connected electrical machine and/or of the power electronics, which is measurable using a suitable sensor, for example, acoustically. The torque oscillation or oscillations resulting therefrom are captured as a response signal from the superposition of the current vector and the test signal by means of a sensor. This response signal is evaluated and the calibrated current vector, preferably the direction of the calibrated current vector, is determined as a function of the evaluation of the response signal. The parameter of the direction of a current vector to emit a specifiable torque value is thus calibrated and stored in a characteristic map. Subsequently, the control of the electrical machine is operated for the specifiable torque value by means of specifying the calibrated current vector.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, a method is provided for calibrating a control, preferably a current control, of an electrical machine for a specifiable torque value. The method is preferably provided for an integrated electrical axle, consisting of the rotary field machine and a power electronics unit, which is mechanically attached to the machine, preferably coupled mechanically strongly or fixedly, or is integrated. The method enables the method to be carried out for each individual electrical machine. It can be carried out both at the end of the production line and/or during the lifetime of the electrical drive as desired, also during a regular driving mode. A drive component (for example, an e-axle) preferably comprises the sensor and the method. A possibility is provided of having the method run during startup, a check at the belt end, or in the driving mode. The calibration parameters can thus be determined and readjusted or relearned specifically by exemplar, dependent on temperature, and/or dependent on aging. A method is provided which provides a self-learning self-calibrating control for an electrical drive. A self-calibration for the MTPC locus curve is enabled, which runs independently of a test bench and an external measurement sensor system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment of the invention, the test signal has a length and a direction, wherein the direction is aligned orthogonally to the current vector, the test signal oscillates on both sides of the current vector and is preferably vectorially added to the current vector.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The test signal has a length and a direction in accordance with the predefined current vector as parameters. The superposition takes place vectorially. In the rotating coordinate system, a vectorial addition of the current vector and the test signal results. The test signal is aligned orthogonally to the current vector and oscillates, preferably at a specifiable frequency. Due to the oscillation of the test signal, a connected electrical machine generates a different torque, in particular of the harmonically oscillating component, depending on the present length and direction of the test signal. Two distinctive response signal types result. The amplitude of the oscillation of the torque becomes greater the greater the deviation of the direction of the specified current vector from the maximum torque achievable with its length. The oscillation of the torque and the test signal have a common phasing and frequency in this case. The amplitude of the oscillation of the torque becomes less the lower the deviation of the direction of the specified torque vector is from the maximum torque achievable with its length. The oscillation of the torque contains a frequency component at double the frequency of the test signal precisely when the direction of the current vector is in the very close vicinity of that which is associated with the torque achievable with this length. This double-frequency current occurs because due to the typical curvature of the iso-torque lines, an oscillation in the tangential direction of the iso-torque line to the right and left of the output current vector results in a minimum of the torque, the double frequency. The minimized oscillation of the torque or the disappearing torque ripple or also the occurrence of the double frequency can be acoustically detected using suitable frequencies of the harmonics, thus when the corresponding frequency disappears or appears in the measured noise. Particularly suitable frequencies of the oscillation of the test signal are to be selected as those at which the connected machine has no or only minor intrinsic electromagnetic excitations, this could be, for example, for a 3-phase electrical machine, preferably the 5 or 7 order in the torque, since intrinsic excitations are expected here, for example, at the 6 and 12 order. An advantageous excitation order with respect to the said electrical frequency for this method is preferably selected so that at this order without specified test signal, no or hardly any intrinsic electromagnetic orders are generated in the oscillation of the torque. The response signal to be expected would thus be solely coupled to the method and the disappearing response signal can be used as a target variable.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, preferably in the selection of the excitation frequency or order, preferably a frequency/order is to be selected which is detectable well by the sensor, which relates to the sensor sensitivity and above all the transmission behavior of this frequency of a torque ripple on the sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A possible test signal is advantageously provided which enables a judgment of the direction of the specified current vector with respect to the achievable maximum torque.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment of the invention, steps a.) to d.) are repeated at least twice, wherein the direction of the current vector is specified changed in each case by a specifiable absolute value. In the evaluation of the response signals according to step d.), the captured response signals are compared. A gradient or a minimum of the captured response signals is ascertained.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The specification of the current vector and the test signal are repeated at least two times using different directions of the current vector. The response signals are evaluated in that the response signals, preferably the amplitudes of the response signals, are compared. Preferably, it is derived on the basis of the dimension and the change of the amplitude, preferably as a function of the gradient and/or the minimum of the response signal, whether the specified current vector generates the maximum torque in a connected electrical machine or in which direction the current vector has to be changed upon further repetitions in order to further approximate the direction in which a connected electrical machine generates the maximum torque. With greater length or a greater absolute value of the test signal, the amplitude of the resulting oscillation of the torque increases. Therefore, the length of the test signal is to be reduced at excessively large amplitudes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A method for iterative approximation to the direction of the current vector, at which a connected electrical machine generates the maximum torque, is advantageously provided.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment of the invention, the direction of the current vector is specified in each case upon the repetition of the steps by a specifiable absolute value, preferably new in each iteration step, in the positive and negative directions of the last specified current vector or in each case in positive or negative direction of the last specified current vector. The repetition of the steps is preferably executed until the gradient between the preferably approximately last three response signals falls below a first specifiable limiting value or the response signal falls below a second specifiable limiting value.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, different variants are provided for the iterative approximation to the direction of the current vector, at which a connected electrical machine generates the maximum torque.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment of the invention, according to step e.), the calibrated current vector is specified in that the parameter of the specified current vector, the captured response signal of which is minimal, is specified for the calibrated current vector.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the direction of the current vector is reached at which a connected electrical machine would generate the maximum torque, a minimal response signal thus results, preferably a minimal amplitude of the response signal.

Zero-frequency variables result within the rotating coordinate system in stationary operation of the electrical machine from the alternating variables, for example, the phase currents. In the d/q coordinate system, which rotates synchronously with the rotor flux and the d axis of which points in the direction of the rotor flux, a stator current is represented as the current vector Ix_v, which is characterized via its absolute value or its length <b>1</b>_s and its direction Ix_a.
