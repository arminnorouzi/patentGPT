For example, a ramp may be used on a toy hauler such that an operator may drive a motorcycle, car, utility vehicle, etc. over the ramp and directly into a storage bay of the toy hauler. Often, such ramps may weigh several hundred pounds or more. When deploying the ramp from a vertical storage position, the ramp may be initially easy to hold up, but the ramp will begin to accelerate by gravity as the ramp is lowered. This may cause injury or damage. When lifting a ramp from the deployed position to the stowed position, the ramp may be difficult to raise due to the weight of the ramp.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing technology may use cables, winches, motors, etc. to lower and raise the ramps. Such technology may be burdensome to operate, provide a tripping hazard, or possibly hinder access by blocking a portion of the ramp.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The counterbalance hinge assembly includes a cam and compression device that counterbalances a weight of a door or a ramp. The compression device biases against a rotation of the door or ramp. The movement of the door or ramp drives cam followers of a cam follower holder against the cam. The counterbalance hinge assembly lessens a force needed to move the door or ramp between stowed and deployed positions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The counterbalance hinge assembly may be used with a variety of movable members, such as, for example, ramps, platforms, doors, and other structures. The counterbalance hinge assembly allows the operator to deploy or stow such a ramp with minimal force. The counterbalance hinge assembly may be integrated into delivery trucks, work trucks, trailers, recreational vehicles, toy haulers, campers, etc. The counterbalance hinge assembly generally buffers or counterbalances a torque caused by the rotational movement of the ramp, platform, door, or other structure in the opening direction. In a closing direction, stored energy from the compression device helps to raise the ramp, platform, door, or other structure. The counterbalance hinge assembly at least partially supports or buffers a weight of the ramp, platform, door, or other structure making it easier for the user to move the ramp or platform.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one application, the counterbalance hinge assembly may be used on a platform or deck of a toy hauler. The platform may include deployable footings that provide for the ramp to deploy generally parallel to the ground and serve as a deck or an elevated observation platform.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other applications, a single trailer may employ multiple counterbalance hinge assemblies in different positions. For example, the single trailer may include a ramp at a rear of the trailer deployed with a first counterbalance hinge assembly and the single trailer may include a deck or platform on a side of the same trailer deployed with a second counterbalance hinge assembly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The counterbalance hinge assembly requires minimal effort in both deploying or stowing of a ramp or platform. The counterbalance hinge assembly provides assistance when moving the ramp or platform upwards and downwards. The counterbalance hinge assembly also provides several benefits. The counterbalance hinge assembly does not require exposed cables or devices that interfere with side access or egress of the ramp, which may form a possible tripping hazard.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, the counterbalance hinge assembly may be used with a variety of ramps, platforms, doors, and other structures. The counterbalance hinge assembly may be used with a small deck (platform) or larger ramps, such as a full-size ramp door. The counterbalance hinge assembly is not limited to a particular type or size of ramp or platform.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The operation of the counterbalance hinge assembly provides for a weight of the ramp or platform to be minimized during the deploying or stowing of the ramp or platform. An operator may only need to apply a minimal pulling force, such as provided by a single finger of the operator, to begin to move the ramp or platform from the fully stowed position to a fully deployed position. Further, the counterbalance hinge assembly provides for the ramp or platform to move from the fully stowed position to the fully deployed position at a controlled rate, i.e., the ramp or platform does not generally fall to the fully deployed position at a rate that could injure the operator or damage the ramp or platform.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Likewise, when the ramp or platform is in a fully deployed position, an operator may only need to apply a minimal lifting force, such as provided by a single finger of the operator, to begin to move the ramp or platform from the fully deployed position to a fully stowed position. This is especially helpful when moving the ramp or platform to the fully stowed position, as the ramp or platform may weigh several hundred pounds or more.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The counterbalance hinge assembly includes adjustable operation to work with different sizes of ramps and platforms and different applications in which additional or less closing or opening force is preferred to close or open the ramp or platform.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect, a downward movement of the door or ramp drives cam followers in angled slots of a cam. The angled slots include varying angles of incline to correspond to varying torque forces of the door or ramp during the opening or closing movement of the door or ramp.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The counterbalance hinge assembly provides for smooth operation. When the ramp or platform is fully stowed, the ramp or platform may be in a generally vertical alignment, and is in a generally neutral position with most of its weight balanced over the counterbalance hinge assembly. In order to begin moving the ramp or platform from the fully stowed position, minimal force is required. As the platform begins to move downward, the weight of the platform increases the opening force, but this weight is counterbalanced by the hinge assembly&#x2014;and the platform does not fall in an uncontrolled manner.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The counterbalance hinge assembly is adjustable. The counterbalance hinge assembly may be adjusted to have neutral resistance while maintaining the ramp or platform in the stowed position (with a neutralizing force between the stowed and deployed directions), to possibly having a small amount of positive force applied to the stowed direction (to maintain stowed position) or a force just below the neutralizing force to allow the ramp to deploy a slight amount to a holding position until an external force is applied to either move the ramp to a deployed position or to put the ramp back to the fully stowed position. Alternatively, by adjusting the counterbalance hinge to have a slight positive force to move the ramp to the stowed position or to decrease the positive force allowing the ramp to deploy a slight amount when released from the stowed position by a securing or holding device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Once the ramp has been released to deploy, the counterbalance hinge settings allow minimal force to move the ramp to the deployed direction. When returning the ramp to a stowed position from fully deployed, the force required to lift the ramp is a minimal amount or an acceptable % of the actual ramp weight so that it can be lifted easily by one person. Once the ramp is moved to approximately 90&#xb0; or less it will be easier to lift to the stowed position.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the movable member may include a platform, door, decking, closure or other structure that moves up and down or in a vertical direction with a first side proximal to a hinge, pivot, or other movable connection and a second side distal from the hinge, pivot, or other movable connection.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, the counterbalance hinge assembly includes a slot with a first slot end and a second slot end. The first slot end corresponds to a stowed position, and the second slot end corresponds to a deployed position. The slot has a varying angle of incline as the slot transitions from having a first angle of incline at the first slot end, to having a second angle of incline of between the first slot end and the second slot end, and to having a third angle of incline at the second slot end, wherein the second angle of incline is greater than both the first angle of incline and the second angle of incline.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect, the counterbalance hinge assembly includes a cam having a slot having sidewalls. The sidewalls comprise a first section of incline for a stowed configuration to a partially deployed configuration, a second section of incline for the partially deployed configuration, and a third section of incline for the partially deployed configuration to a deployed configuration.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another aspect, the counterbalance hinge assembly includes a cam having a slot having sidewalls. The sidewalls form an angle of incline, which transitions from having a first incline, to having a second incline, and to having a third incline, wherein the second incline is greater than both the first incline and the second incline.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view of the trailer with the ramp in the stowed position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view of the counterbalance hinge assembly.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view of the ramp partially deployed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view of the counterbalance hinge assembly of the trailer with the ramp partially deployed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view of the ramp fully deployed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view of the counterbalance hinge assembly of the trailer with the ramp fully deployed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of the counterbalance hinge assembly.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front view of the counterbalance hinge assembly.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of the counterbalance hinge assembly with the housing removed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a front view of the counterbalance hinge assembly with the housing removed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a partial view of the counterbalance hinge assembly with the housing removed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a sectional view of the counterbalance hinge assembly with the housing removed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a sectional view of the counterbalance hinge assembly with the housing removed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a view of the cam.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a view of the cam follower holder and cam followers.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a view of the trailer with the deck in the deployed position.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a graph showing the varying angle of incline of the slots.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is an exploded view of the counterbalance hinge assembly.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a sectional view showing the right support bearing.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a sectional view showing the left support bearing.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is an exploded view of the right end of counterbalance hinge assembly.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A counterbalance hinge assembly <b>10</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>21</b></figref>.

With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, as the hex head <b>117</b> is tightened, a nut plate assembly <b>126</b> is moved to the right, and the compression device <b>400</b> is further biased, thus adding additional force against the cam follower holder <b>200</b>. The nut plate assembly <b>126</b> includes the nut <b>127</b>, a tube <b>129</b>, and a spring holding plate <b>131</b>.

In this aspect, the nut plate assembly includes the nut <b>127</b>, the tube <b>129</b>, and the spring holding plate <b>131</b> welded or formed together in an integral fashion. Similarly, the hex head <b>117</b> may be loosened, which withdraws the nut <b>127</b> from the shaft <b>100</b> and moves the nut assembly <b>126</b> to the left, thus reducing a compression force against the cam follower holder <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The counterbalance hinge assembly <b>10</b> minimizes the physical, electrical, electro-mechanical or mechanical force required to move the movable member <b>20</b> to the deployed or stowed position. The counterbalance hinge assembly <b>10</b> uses an applied counterbalance force from the compression device <b>400</b>, which may include, for example, a spring or combinations of springs. The compression device <b>400</b> is not limited to springs, or types of springs. Pneumatics, hydraulics, and/or combinations thereof may be used with or without the springs as the compression device <b>400</b> that biases the cam follower holder <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The cam follower holder <b>200</b> transitions the applied counterbalance force into the cam <b>300</b>. The slots <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b> in the cam assembly maintain an approximately equal counterbalance to the movable member <b>20</b>'s increasing torsional weight throughout rotation until approximately 90&#xb0; in the deployed state. These components interface to a fixing point including an opposite end fixing point that is bridged by the movable member <b>20</b> that is free to rotate via rotational devices connecting to the first and second fixed end supports <b>115</b> and <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As the movable member <b>20</b> rotates to the deployed position, the cam follower holder <b>200</b> drives against the cam <b>300</b> causing lateral movement of the cam follower holder <b>200</b> against the compression device <b>400</b> further compressing the compression device <b>400</b> to generally maintain equilibrium between the torque of the movable member <b>20</b>, which is increasing due to the changing center of gravity of the movable member <b>20</b> during rotation. This is accomplished through the slots <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b> configured in the cam <b>300</b> compensating for weight increase as the movable member <b>20</b> rotates to the deployed position by controlling varying cam angles. As the cam follower holder <b>200</b> passes the approximate 90&#xb0; to the deployed position, the cam slot angles decrease to compensate for the slight decrease in torque of the movable member <b>20</b> to maintain a slightly negative counterbalance to allow the movable member <b>20</b> to slowly travel to final deployed position without external input other than gravity. This is done to prevent the movable member <b>20</b> from stalling after 90&#xb0; and not moving to the full deployed angle. The decreased cam slot angle after 90&#xb0; also helps to maintain the movable member <b>20</b> in the fully deployed position and helps to mitigate unwanted upward movement caused by wind, the movement of gear or vehicles over the movable member, the ingress/egress of personnel, etc.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this aspect, a stack of disc washers forms the compression device <b>400</b>. Disc washers may also be commonly called a Belleville washer, a coned-disc spring, a conical spring washer, and a disc spring. The number and arrangement of disc washers may be varied depending on the size of the movable member <b>20</b>, the amount of rotation needed for the movable member <b>20</b>, and/or the desired operator force required to move the movable member <b>20</b>. The number and arrangement of disc washers may be varied depending upon the spring rate of the disc washers used. The number and arrangement of disc washers may be varied depending on the size, type, and/or style of the disc washers. In this aspect, the disc washers each include a central opening and the shaft <b>100</b> is passed through the central openings. The disc washers may be employed in stacks of disc washers in parallel, series, and/or combinations thereof. The stacks of disc washers may include a plurality of the same disc washers or a combination of different types of disc washers. As noted above, different types of springs may be used as the compression device <b>400</b>. For example, one or more coil springs may be used as the compression device <b>400</b> or used in conjunction with disc washers or other bias inducing members.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the deploying (lowering) of the movable member <b>20</b> from the secured position (reference 0&#xb0;) to a deploying angle of approximately 85&#xb0; to 95&#xb0;, the counterbalance hinge assembly <b>10</b> is capable of maintaining a neutralizing force to the movable member <b>20</b> (force can be adjusted (&#x2212;) to allow slight freefall (lowering), which will require more(+) force applied to move to the stowed position (lifting) or vice versa) on the movable member <b>20</b>, and a small amount of external force (+) is used to move in either deploy or stow direction. The counterbalance hinge assembly <b>10</b> accommodates for increased force generated by the movable member <b>20</b> angle change to the approximate 90&#xb0; angle. An angle greater than the approximate 90&#xb0; angle is where the hinge force to the movable member <b>20</b> transitions allowing the movable member <b>20</b> to move slowly, on its own, toward the fully deployed position. At the fully deployed position, the movable member <b>20</b> may have rotated approximately 90&#xb0; for a platform and approximately up to 125&#xb0; for a ramp. In the ramp aspect, the ramp may be rotated until the distal side contacts the ground or other support. The rotation amounts are not limited to 90&#xb0; or 125&#xb0;, and depend on the initial stowed angle of the movable member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The above description for deploying (lowering) is reversed for stowing (lifting) process of the movable member <b>20</b>. The force required to initial lifting of the movable member <b>20</b> toward the stowed position is typically slightly more from an angle greater than approximated 90&#xb0; compared to an angle less than the approximate 90&#xb0; neutral zone. Once lifted to an angle less than the approximate 90&#xb0; angle, the lift force becomes less depending on counterbalance hinge adjustment mentioned above for (&#x2212;) or (+) factor of hinge neutral counterbalance.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one example, the movable member <b>20</b> includes a ramp with a height of 76.5 inches, a width of 63.5 inches, a thickness of 1.75 inches, and a weight of 104 pounds. The compression device <b>400</b> includes 100 series washer stack having a spring rate of approximately 1000 pounds/inch. This combination of the movable member <b>20</b> and compression device <b>400</b> provide smooth opening and closing with a user applied force pulling or pushing force of approximately 5 pounds to approximately 40 pounds. Of course, the required pulling or pushing may be adjusted by changing the compression device <b>400</b>, modulating the number of springs in the compression device <b>400</b>, adjusting the compression device <b>400</b>, adjusting the hex head <b>117</b>, etc. The required pulling or pushing may be adjusted based on the weight of the ramp. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a graph showing the of incline of the slots <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b> of this example.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a view of a trailer with a deck <b>21</b> in the deployed position.

For example, in other aspects, the cam <b>300</b> may be mounted to the housing <b>60</b> and the cam <b>300</b> rotates along with the housing <b>60</b> and the movable member <b>20</b>, while the cam follower holder <b>200</b> is mounted in a fixed and stationary position.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, in other aspects, the slots <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b> may be modified to have a constant or linear angle of incline. The counterbalance hinge assembly <b>10</b>, with such an arrangement, will provide a more constant force to assist in deploying or stowing the movable member <b>20</b>. The constant force may reduce the amount of force needed to stow or deploy the movable member <b>20</b>. Of course, the amount of force needed to stow or deploy the movable member <b>20</b>, when using a constant or a linear angle of incline, may vary as the movable member <b>20</b> is moved through it range of motion. However, the counterbalance hinge assembly <b>10</b> with the linear or constant angle of incline may still find utility in providing a power-assist feature to the movable member <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As such, it should be understood that the disclosure is not limited to the particular aspects described herein, but that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this novel concept as defined by the following claims.
