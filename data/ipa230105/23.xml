In addition, such indoor garden centers may include an environmental control system that maintains the growing chamber at a desired temperature or humidity. Certain indoor garden centers may also include hydration systems for watering the plants and/or artificial lighting systems that provide the light necessary for such plants to grow.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain indoor garden centers include a rotating plant support rack that divides the grow chamber into a plurality of sub-compartments. The environment in each of these sub-compartments may be maintained independently as needed depending on the plants stored in that sub-compartment. For example, the temperature, humidity, hydration cycles, and lighting profiles may vary depending on the particular plants present within a particular sub-compartment. However, drive motors that rotate these conventional support racks often lack positional precision and may presume a position of the grow module based on motor drive time or other factors. However, this may frequently result in the plant support rack not being positioned properly within a desired zone, e.g., such that the plant support rack is positioned between zones where a seal between adjacent sub-compartments may be ineffective. For example, the grow module may become stuck at an intermediate position due to plant growth getting caught or another mechanical issue or obstruction. As a result, independent environmental control may be difficult, light may bleed between sub-compartments may occur, and overall perceived appliance quality may be degraded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, an improved indoor garden center would be useful. More particularly, an indoor garden center with a drive system that more accurately positions a grow module within a grow chamber and detects when the grow module is stuck would be particularly beneficial.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be apparent from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one exemplary embodiment, a gardening appliance defining a vertical direction is provided.

The controller is configured to operate the drive assembly to initiate rotation of the turntable from a first angular position toward a second angular position, determine that the turntable should have reached the second angular position based at least in part on the operation of the drive assembly, determine that the turntable has not reached the second angular position using the position sensing assembly, and identify a drive assembly fault in response to determining that the turntable has not reached the second angular position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another exemplary embodiment, a method of operating a gardening appliance is provided. The gardening appliance includes a turntable rotatably mounted to a sump and being configured for supporting a grow module, a position sensing assembly operably coupled to the sump and the turntable for monitoring an angular position of the turntable relative to the sump, and a drive assembly for selectively rotating the turntable. The method includes operating the drive assembly to initiate rotation of the turntable from a first angular position toward a second angular position, determining that the turntable should have reached the second angular position based at least in part on the operation of the drive assembly, determining that the turntable has not reached the second angular position using the position sensing assembly, and identifying a drive assembly fault in response to determining that the turntable has not reached the second angular position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.

Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates sealed system <b>150</b> within mechanical compartment <b>140</b>. Although an exemplary sealed system is illustrated and described herein, it should be appreciated that variations and modifications may be made to sealed system <b>150</b> while remaining within the scope of the present subject matter. For example, sealed system <b>150</b> may include additional or alternative components, different ducting configurations, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown, sealed system <b>150</b> includes a compressor <b>152</b>, a first heat exchanger or evaporator <b>154</b> and a second heat exchanger or condenser <b>156</b>. As is generally understood, compressor <b>152</b> is generally operable to circulate or urge a flow of refrigerant through sealed system <b>150</b>, which may include various conduits which may be utilized to flow refrigerant between the various components of sealed system <b>150</b>. Thus, evaporator <b>154</b> and condenser <b>156</b> may be between and in fluid communication with each other and compressor <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">During operation of sealed system <b>150</b>, refrigerant flows from evaporator <b>154</b> and to compressor <b>152</b>, and compressor <b>152</b> is generally configured to direct compressed refrigerant from compressor <b>152</b> to condenser <b>156</b>. For example, refrigerant may exit evaporator <b>154</b> as a fluid in the form of a superheated vapor. Upon exiting evaporator <b>154</b>, the refrigerant may enter compressor <b>152</b>, which is operable to compress the refrigerant. Accordingly, the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant may be increased in compressor <b>152</b> such that the refrigerant becomes a more superheated vapor.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Condenser <b>156</b> is disposed downstream of compressor <b>152</b> and is operable to reject heat from the refrigerant. For example, the superheated vapor from compressor <b>152</b> may enter condenser <b>156</b> and transfer energy to air surrounding condenser <b>156</b> (e.g., to create a flow of heated air). In this manner, the refrigerant condenses into a saturated liquid and/or liquid vapor mixture.

In this regard, refrigerant may exit condenser <b>156</b> in the form of high liquid quality/saturated liquid vapor mixture and travel through variable electronic expansion valve <b>158</b> before flowing through evaporator <b>154</b>. Variable electronic expansion valve <b>158</b> is generally configured to be adjustable, e.g., such that the flow of refrigerant (e.g., volumetric flow rate in milliliters per second) through variable electronic expansion valve <b>158</b> may be selectively varied or adjusted.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Evaporator <b>154</b> is disposed downstream of variable electronic expansion valve <b>158</b> and is operable to heat refrigerant within evaporator <b>154</b>, e.g., by absorbing thermal energy from air surrounding the evaporator (e.g., to create a flow of cooled air). For example, the liquid or liquid vapor mixture refrigerant from variable electronic expansion valve <b>158</b> may enter evaporator <b>154</b>. Within evaporator <b>154</b>, the refrigerant from variable electronic expansion valve <b>158</b> receives energy from the flow of cooled air and vaporizes into superheated vapor and/or high quality vapor mixture. An air handler or evaporator fan (not shown) is positioned adjacent evaporator <b>154</b> and may facilitate or urge the flow of cooled air across evaporator <b>154</b> in order to facilitate heat transfer. From evaporator <b>154</b>, refrigerant may return to compressor <b>152</b> and the vapor-compression cycle may continue.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As explained above, environmental control system <b>148</b> includes a sealed system <b>150</b> for providing a flow of heated air or a flow cooled air throughout grow chamber <b>122</b> as needed.

As illustrated, grow module <b>200</b> includes a central hub <b>202</b> that extends along and is rotatable about a central axis <b>204</b>. Specifically, according to the illustrated embodiment, central axis <b>204</b> is parallel to the vertical direction V. However, it should be appreciated that central axis <b>204</b> could alternatively extend in any suitable direction, e.g., such as the horizontal direction. In this regard, grow module <b>200</b> generally defines an axial direction, i.e., parallel to central axis <b>204</b>, a radial direction R that extends perpendicular to central axis <b>204</b>, and a circumferential direction C that extends around central axis <b>204</b> (e.g., in a plane perpendicular to central axis <b>204</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Grow module <b>200</b> may further include a plurality of partitions <b>206</b> that extend from central hub <b>202</b> substantially along the radial direction R.

Referring specifically to a first embodiment of grow module <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>8</b></figref>, grow module <b>200</b> includes three partitions <b>206</b> to define a first chamber <b>212</b>, a second chamber <b>214</b>, and a third chamber <b>216</b>, which are circumferentially spaced relative to each other. In general, as grow module <b>200</b> is rotated within grow chamber <b>122</b>, the plurality of chambers <b>210</b> define substantially separate and distinct growing environments, e.g., for growing plants <b>124</b> having different growth needs.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">More specifically, partitions <b>206</b> may extend from central hub <b>202</b> to a location immediately adjacent liner <b>120</b>.

As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, turntable <b>304</b> is rotatably mounted within an aperture <b>310</b> that is defined in a sump <b>312</b> that partially defines grow chamber <b>122</b>. As illustrated, sump <b>312</b> defines a collection reservoir <b>314</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) within which water runoff, excess nutrients, and other byproducts of the growing process may be collected under the force of gravity. In this regard, for example, turntable <b>304</b> may include one or more apertures or channels through which liquids and other debris may flow into collection reservoir <b>314</b> (e.g., for recirculation or disposal). As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, motor assembly <b>302</b> may be positioned at least partially below sump <b>312</b> and may be protected from liquids in collection reservoir <b>314</b>. It should be appreciated the gardening appliance <b>100</b> may include additional features for isolating or sealing motor assembly <b>302</b> to protect it from liquid collected within collection reservoir <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Notably, motor assembly <b>302</b> may be the same or similar to motor <b>230</b> described above. In this regard, motor assembly <b>302</b> may include any suitable drive motor and/or transmission assembly for rotating grow module <b>200</b>. For example, motor assembly <b>302</b> may include a brushless DC electric motor, a stepper motor, or any other suitable type or configuration of motor. For example, motor assembly <b>302</b> may include an AC motor, an induction motor, a permanent magnet synchronous motor, or any other suitable type of AC motor. In addition, motor assembly <b>302</b> may include any suitable transmission assemblies, clutch mechanisms, or other components. According to exemplary embodiments, motor assembly <b>302</b> is capable of bi-directional rotation, e.g., such that it may rotate grow module <b>200</b> in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, as illustrated, motor assembly <b>302</b> includes a drive motor <b>320</b> that selectively rotates a motor shaft <b>322</b>. In this regard, motor shaft <b>322</b> may define an axial direction A corresponding to the axis of rotation of drive motor <b>320</b>, a radial direction R that extends perpendicular to the axial direction A, and a circumferential direction C that corresponds with the direction of rotation of motor shaft <b>322</b> (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise). References to the axial direction A, the radial direction R, and the circumferential direction C may be used herein to refer to the position of turntable <b>304</b> relative to sump <b>312</b> or cabinet <b>102</b>. It should be appreciated that these directional orientations may refer to the same or similar orientations as described above for grow module <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to exemplary embodiments, controller <b>174</b> may include a power supply that is operably coupled to drive motor <b>320</b> for regulating its operation. For example, controller <b>174</b> may operate the power supply to operate drive motor <b>320</b> in a manner that rotates turntable <b>304</b> at the desired times, at the desired rotational speeds, and/or to the desired positions. For example, controller <b>174</b> may regulate operation of drive motor <b>320</b> by varying an input voltage or power. Alternatively, the power level of drive motor <b>320</b> may be adjusted by manipulating a motor control signal. In this regard, for example, the power supply may be a dedicated inverter power supply and the motor control signal may be any suitable digital control signal, such as a pulse width modulated signal having a duty cycle that is roughly proportional to the power level of drive motor <b>320</b>. In this regard, for example, a fifty percent duty cycle may operate drive motor <b>320</b> at fifty percent of its rated speed, an eighty percent duty cycle may operate drive motor <b>320</b> at eighty percent of its rated speed, etc. It should be appreciated that other means for controlling the power level and speed of drive motor <b>320</b> are possible and within the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Clutch assembly <b>306</b> may rotatably couple motor shaft <b>322</b> to turntable <b>304</b>. Specifically, motor shaft <b>322</b> may be mechanically coupled to turntable <b>304</b> through clutch assembly <b>306</b> for providing drive torque to facilitate rotational motion of grow module <b>200</b> and vertical support for supporting the weight of grow module <b>200</b>, plants <b>124</b>, etc. Notably, clutch assembly <b>306</b> may include an internal clutch mechanism that is generally configured for limiting the torque from drive motor <b>320</b> to turntable <b>304</b>. In this regard, clutch assembly <b>306</b> may have a torque slip threshold beyond which clutch assembly <b>306</b> disengages drive motor <b>320</b> from turntable <b>304</b>. This torque slip threshold may be any suitable torque selected for any suitable purpose, e.g., as a safety measure or to protect plants <b>124</b>. For example, the torque slip threshold may be selected to ensure safe operation and rotation of grow module <b>200</b>. In this regard, the torque slip threshold may be selected to prevent harm to a user and prevent pinch points, e.g., between grow module <b>200</b> and liner <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Notably, the drive assembly <b>300</b> described above provides an improved drive mechanism for rotating a grow module of a gardening appliance. In this regard, drive assembly <b>300</b> provides for efficient transmission of torque to facilitate bi-directional rotation of grow module <b>200</b> while providing a safety threshold to avoid dangerous conditions related to pinch points, e.g., using clutch assembly <b>306</b>. In addition, the engagement between motor assembly <b>302</b>, clutch assembly <b>306</b>, and turntable <b>306</b> provides solid support structures for vertical loading and moment loading, e.g., tilting of grow module <b>200</b> that may occur when plants <b>124</b> are not equally balanced around the axial direction A. Moreover, it should be appreciated that drive assembly <b>300</b> may be fully disassembled, e.g., by removing motor assembly <b>302</b>, turntable <b>304</b>, and/or clutch assembly <b>306</b> for cleaning and/or maintenance. Other advantages to such a system will be evident one having ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> through <b>16</b></figref>, a position sensing assembly <b>330</b> that may be used to provide closed-loop feedback to drive assembly <b>300</b> regarding the angular position of turntable <b>304</b> relative to sump <b>312</b> or cabinet <b>102</b> will be described according to exemplary embodiments of the present subject matter. In general, position sensing assembly <b>330</b> may be any suitable combination of sensors, actuators, indicators, switches, or other triggers that may be used to identify the angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b> and grow module <b>200</b> within gardening appliance <b>100</b>. Notably, as described above, accurate positioning of grow module <b>200</b> within liner <b>120</b> may be desirable to improve isolation of grow chambers <b>212</b>-<b>216</b>, to prevent light bleed from light assembly <b>280</b> through front display opening <b>132</b>, and to improve overall perception of the workmanship and quality of gardening appliance <b>100</b>. In addition, knowledge regarding the inaccurate positioning or stalling of grow module <b>200</b> may be used to identify a slipping clutch, a stuck or binding turntable <b>304</b>, or another mechanical failure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to exemplary embodiments of the present subject matter, position sensing assembly <b>330</b> generally includes a proximity sensor assembly <b>332</b> that is mounted onto or underneath sump <b>312</b> and a proximity indicator assembly <b>334</b> that is mounted onto or underneath turntable <b>304</b>. In general, proximity sensor assembly <b>332</b> and proximity indicator assembly <b>334</b> may include any system of sensors, emitters, detectors, triggers, switches, actuators, or other detection assemblies that operate together to provide feedback regarding the angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, proximity sensor assembly <b>332</b> is fixed underneath sump <b>312</b> while proximity indicator assembly <b>334</b> rotates along with turntable <b>304</b>. However, it should be appreciated that according to alternative embodiments, these assemblies <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> may be reversed while remaining within the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to the illustrated embodiment, proximity sensor assembly <b>332</b> generally includes a first proximity sensor <b>340</b> that is mounted to sump <b>312</b> at a first radial position <b>342</b> and a second proximity sensor <b>344</b> that is mounted to sump <b>312</b> and a second radial position <b>346</b> different than the first radial position <b>342</b>. As used herein, the &#x201c;radial position&#x201d; is intended to the radial location (e.g., as measured relative to the motor shaft <b>322</b> or central axis) on either sump <b>312</b> or turntable <b>304</b>, depending on the context. According to an exemplary embodiment, each of first proximity sensor <b>340</b> and second proximity sensor <b>344</b> may be mounted to sump <b>312</b> along a hub alignment position <b>348</b> along the circumferential direction C. As shown, hub alignment position <b>348</b> is identified by a dotted line extending along the radial direction R at a fixed circumferential position on sump <b>312</b>. In this manner, hub alignment position <b>348</b> may be used as a reference angle, e.g., to determine an angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b>. Specifically, the angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b> angle may be measured along the circumferential direction C between hub alignment position <b>348</b> and a particular position (or positions) identified by proximity indicator assembly <b>334</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown, proximity indicator assembly <b>334</b> may include a plurality of proximity indicators (e.g., identified generally by reference numeral <b>350</b>) that are positioned at desirable locations on turntable <b>304</b> and are detectable by proximity sensor assembly <b>332</b> (e.g., first proximity sensor <b>340</b> and second proximity sensor <b>344</b>) when turntable <b>304</b> is rotated to align proximity indicators <b>350</b> with the hub alignment position <b>348</b> along the circumferential direction C. In this regard, when proximity indicators <b>350</b> are positioned over proximity sensors <b>340</b>, <b>344</b> along the axial direction A or the vertical direction V, one or both of proximity sensors <b>340</b>, <b>344</b> may be triggered depending on the radial position of proximity indicators <b>350</b>. For example, if a proximity sensor <b>350</b> that is mounted to turntable <b>304</b> at the first radial position <b>342</b>, that proximity sensor <b>350</b> will trigger first proximity sensor <b>340</b> (i.e., also positioned at the first radial position <b>342</b>) one time for each revolution of turntable <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In other words, proximity indicators <b>350</b> may be positioned at various circumferential positions around turntable <b>304</b> and at different radiuses is to define a unique radial configuration at each circumferential position. When each respective circumferential position crosses hub alignment position <b>348</b>, such that proximity sensors <b>350</b> positioned on that radial line or at that circumferential position pass over first proximity sensor <b>340</b> and second proximity sensor <b>344</b>, a controller coupled to first proximity sensor <b>340</b> and second proximity sensor <b>344</b> (e.g., such as controller <b>174</b>) may detect the unique radial configuration of proximity sensors <b>350</b> to determine the angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b> relative to sump <b>312</b>. This process will be described in more detail below according to exemplary embodiments of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring now specifically to the illustrated embodiment, and as best shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, the plurality of proximity indicators <b>350</b> may generally include a first proximity indicator <b>352</b> mounted to turntable <b>304</b> at the first radial position <b>342</b> and at a first circumferential position <b>354</b> on turntable <b>304</b>. In this manner, first proximity indicator <b>352</b> passes over first proximity sensor <b>340</b> when turntable <b>304</b> rotates to a first angular orientation, e.g., defined as an angular orientation where first circumferential position <b>354</b> is aligned with hub alignment position <b>348</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, the plurality of proximity indicators <b>350</b> may include a second proximity indicator <b>356</b> mounted to turntable <b>304</b> at the second radial position <b>346</b> and at a second circumferential position <b>358</b> on turntable <b>304</b>. In this manner, second proximity indicator <b>356</b> passes over second proximity sensor <b>344</b> as turntable <b>304</b> rotates to a second angular orientation, e.g., defined as an angular orientation where second circumferential position <b>358</b> is aligned with hub alignment position <b>348</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, the plurality of proximity indicators <b>350</b> may include a third proximity indicator <b>360</b> mounted to turntable <b>304</b> at the first radial position <b>342</b> and a fourth proximity indicator <b>362</b> mounted to turntable <b>304</b> at the second radial position <b>346</b>. Notably, both third proximity indicator <b>360</b> and forth proximity indicator <b>362</b> are mounted to turntable <b>304</b> at a third circumferential position <b>364</b>, which corresponds to a third angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b>. As a result, when turntable <b>304</b> is rotated such that third circumferential position <b>364</b> is aligned with or passes over hub alignment position <b>348</b>, third proximity indicator <b>360</b> may pass over and trigger first proximity sensor <b>340</b>, while fourth proximity indicator <b>362</b> may pass over and trigger second proximity sensor <b>344</b>. By monitoring when proximity sensors <b>340</b>, <b>344</b> are triggered and which proximity sensors <b>340</b>, <b>344</b> triggered, controller <b>174</b> may be programmed to determine the angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b> relative to sump <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Specifically, the radial configuration of proximity sensors <b>350</b> at each circumferential position <b>354</b>, <b>358</b>, <b>364</b> may define a unique two-digit binary code corresponding to the respective circumferential positions. In this regard, for example, the first digit of the two-digit binary code may be a 0 or a 1 depending on whether first proximity sensor <b>340</b> is triggered. By contrast, the second digit of the two-digit binary code may be a 0 or 1 depending on whether second proximity sensor <b>344</b> is triggered. Thus, using this identification protocol, when first circumferential position <b>354</b> of turntable <b>304</b> passes hub alignment position <b>348</b>, only first proximity sensor <b>340</b> is triggered, so the two-digit binary code would be [10]. By contrast, when second circumferential position <b>358</b> of turntable <b>304</b> crosses hub alignment position <b>348</b>, only second proximity sensor <b>344</b> is triggered, so the two-digit binary code would be [01]. If the third circumferential position <b>364</b> rotates past hub alignment position <b>348</b>, both proximity sensors <b>340</b>, <b>344</b> are triggered, so the two-digit binary code would be [11].</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Notably, according to exemplary embodiments, turntable includes proximity sensors <b>350</b> at three circumferential positions.

However, it should be appreciated that according to alternative embodiments, turntable <b>304</b> may have any other suitable number, type, and configuration of proximity sensors <b>350</b> positioned at any suitable number of circumferential positions in any suitable manner about the circumferential direction C. Moreover, although proximity sensor assembly <b>332</b> is described herein as having two proximity sensors <b>340</b>, <b>344</b> for generating a two-digit binary code, it should be appreciated that according to exemplary embodiments, turntable <b>304</b> may have additional proximity sensors positioned at other radial locations to generate additional positional codes.

In this regard, for example, controller <b>174</b> may receive a command to rotate to a target angular orientation, e.g., such as the angular orientation where first chamber <b>212</b> is positioned toward front display opening <b>132</b>. Upon determining the target angular orientation of grow module <b>200</b> and turntable <b>304</b>, controller <b>174</b> may obtain a two-digit binary code associated with the target angular orientation (e.g., from a lookup table, database, etc.). Controller <b>174</b> may then operate drive assembly <b>300</b> to rotate turntable <b>304</b> until the target angular orientation is achieved. In other words, controller <b>174</b> may be configured for stopping rotation of turntable <b>304</b> when the two-digit binary code associated with the target angular orientation is generated by positioning assembly <b>330</b>.

For example, according to the illustrated embodiment, proximity sensor assembly <b>332</b> includes Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b>, which are generally configured for detecting the proximity of a magnetic field. In addition, proximity indicators <b>350</b> may each be one or more magnets <b>372</b> that are positioned for interacting with Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b>, e.g., as described herein.

By contrast, magnets <b>372</b> are positioned at the desired radial positions on turntable <b>304</b> (e.g., mounted below, onto, or within turntable <b>304</b>) as described above.

In addition, magnets <b>372</b> may be mounted on a bottom side of or integrated into turntable <b>304</b>. In this manner, the magnetic field generated by each magnet <b>372</b> may be detected by the respective Hall-effect sensor <b>370</b>. Moreover, Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b> may be omni-polar magnetic sensors, such that they may detect the magnetic fields of magnets <b>372</b> regardless of how magnets <b>372</b> are installed, e.g., whether the north/south poles of magnets <b>372</b> are oriented up or down.

However, controller <b>174</b> may operate drive assembly <b>300</b> to rotate turntable <b>304</b> through an additional incremental amount, e.g., to compensate for the diameter of circular detection zone <b>374</b> and ensure that the magnets <b>372</b> are centered within circular detection zone <b>374</b> before stopping rotation.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Notably, to prevent interaction between the first proximity sensor <b>340</b> and magnets <b>372</b> positioned at second radial position <b>346</b>, and to prevent interaction between second proximity sensor <b>344</b> and magnets <b>372</b> positioned at first radial position <b>342</b>, it may be desirable that the first radial position <b>342</b> and the second radial position <b>346</b> are spaced apart along the radial direction R by a radial distance <b>376</b> that is greater than circular detection zone <b>374</b>. According to still other embodiments, radial distance <b>376</b> may be greater than one circular detection zone <b>374</b>, greater than two circular detection zones <b>374</b>, or greater.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to exemplary embodiments, controller <b>174</b> may be preprogrammed with knowledge regarding the circular detection zone <b>374</b> of Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b>. By contrast, according to alternative embodiments, controller <b>174</b> may be programmed for periodically initiating a calibration procedure for ensuring that magnets <b>372</b> are centered within the circular detection zone <b>374</b> of Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b> before the rotation of turntable <b>304</b> stopped. For example, this calibration process may include rotating the turntable <b>304</b> in a first direction, e.g., the counterclockwise direction, and determining when the magnet <b>372</b> is first detected. The angular position where the magnet <b>372</b> is first detected may be recorded as a first angular position. Controller <b>174</b> may then continue rotation of turntable <b>304</b> in the same direction (e.g., counterclockwise) until the magnet <b>372</b> is no longer detected (e.g., magnet <b>372</b> has left the circular detection zone <b>374</b>). The calibration process may then include rotating the turntable in a second direction, e.g., the clockwise direction, and determining when the magnet <b>372</b> is again first detected. The angular position of turntable <b>304</b> when the magnet <b>372</b> is first detected while moving clockwise may be the second angular position. The circular detection zone <b>374</b> may be determined based at least in part on the difference between the second angular position and the first angular position. Other calibration procedures are possible and within scope the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to exemplary embodiments, it may be desirable to slow the speed of rotation of turntable <b>304</b> as the various circumferential positions are approaching the hub alignment position <b>348</b>. Doing this may increase the accuracy of positioning of turntable <b>304</b>, by permitting controller <b>176</b> to better regulate drive assembly <b>300</b> to stop turntable <b>304</b> at the desired angular orientation. Thus, when turntable <b>304</b> is being moved from the first angular position (e.g., corresponding to the first circumferential position <b>354</b> aligning with the hub alignment position <b>348</b>) to a second angular position (e.g., corresponding to the second circumferential position <b>358</b> aligning with the hub alignment position <b>348</b>), controller <b>174</b> may implement an acceleration profile that moves between these two angular positions at a suitable rate while preventing an overshoot of the second angular position. In this regard, for example, controller <b>174</b> may operate drive assembly <b>300</b> by starting at the first angular position, increasing the rotational speed of turntable <b>304</b> to a cruise speed, and then decreasing the rotational speed of turntable <b>304</b> to a detection speed prior to reaching the second angular position. This detection speed may be maintained until the positioning assembly <b>330</b> detects that the second angular position has been reached.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Aspects of the present subject matter provide a gardening appliance <b>100</b> having a grow module <b>200</b> with Hall-effect sensing and zone identification features. In specific, three sets of magnets <b>372</b> may be permanently affixed to the underside of turntable <b>304</b> which serves as the base of the rotating grow module <b>200</b>. Each set consists of either one or two magnets <b>372</b> which are located along radial lines at one or both of two radial distances from the center of rotation. The magnets <b>372</b> of each set are separated by enough distance that their respective magnetic fields have negligible effect on the others. Each set is evenly and angularly separated around the turntable <b>304</b> for example, by 120 degrees for three growing zones. This combination uniquely assigns a two-digit binary representation for each 120 degree grow zone. One set may contain magnets at both radiuses [11], one at just the small radius [10], and one at just the larger radius [01]. Two Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b> are discretely mounted beneath the non-rotating sump <b>312</b> at the same two radiuses of the magnet positions along the radial line of the back-most set of magnets when the turntable <b>304</b> is properly positioned. These sensors <b>370</b> can be of the omni-polar type so that the polarity of the detected magnets <b>372</b> does not matter. The Hall-effect <b>370</b> sensors will detect the set of magnets <b>372</b> in the turntable <b>304</b> once the correct position is reached and accordingly a signal is sent to the appliance controls to stop grow module <b>200</b> rotation. This allows for accurate position and identification of each side of the grow module <b>200</b>. This means that the grow module <b>200</b> will be able to successfully position itself and properly contact the environmental seals at the end of each indexing rotation regardless of any clutch slippage. Further, the user will always know the position of each side of the grow module <b>200</b> due to the unique magnet identification.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The subject matter contemplates accurate positioning of turntable <b>304</b> based on feedback from Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b>. As a result, accurate calibration of these sensors may be desirable to accurately position turntable <b>304</b> and grow module <b>200</b> in the desired zones. This calibration procedure may include the following: Step 1: Rotate the turntable <b>304</b> until a magnet <b>372</b> is detected. At this point, the motor feedback starts counting from zero. Step 2: Rotation continues in the same direction so that the sensor <b>372</b> passes through the entire circular detection zone <b>374</b> and reaches an opposite side, at which point the rotation stops. Step 3: Rotation begins again in the opposite direction until the magnets <b>372</b> are detected again. Step 4: The diameter of the circular detection zone <b>374</b> is calculated from the displacement of the motor between the detections in steps 1 and 3. Step 5: Steps 1-4 are repeated for the remaining magnets sets. The calibration technique can be executed before start of the grow cycle or during a pause phase of gardening appliance <b>100</b> and can be repeated automatically, or via a manual request by the user. The detection diameter as measured in step 4 may underestimate the true detection diameter by a term equal to the backlash of the transmission between the motor shaft and the turntable, which can be approximated by lab testing.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Aspects of the present subject matter are further directed to methods for precise location adjustment of the turntable. In this regard, during rotation of turntable <b>304</b> and grow module <b>200</b>, the Hall-effect sensor <b>370</b> detects the magnet <b>372</b> when the magnetic field is within the detection zone of the Hall-effect sensor (e.g., a substantially circular detection zone having a non-zero diameter). Accordingly, the turntable must rotate an additional corrective amount equivalent to the radius of the circular detection zone <b>374</b> at the radius of the magnet <b>372</b> location (e.g., first radial position <b>342</b> or second radial position <b>346</b>). After such a correction, the drive assembly <b>300</b> will stop rotation of turntable <b>304</b> where magnet <b>372</b> will stop at the center of the circular detection zone <b>374</b>, and the turntable <b>304</b> and grow module will thus be in the correct position. The control of this corrective angular adjustment can be achieved by determining the angular displacement of the magnets within the Hall-effect sensor's circular detection zone <b>374</b>. While motor feedback may not account for clutch slippage, it is unlikely that slippage will be able to occur within the period from magnet detection to the end of rotation.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to exemplary embodiments, the proposed rotation cycle to index the turntable <b>304</b> from one grow zone to the next is as follows. During phase 1, drive assembly <b>300</b> accelerates turntable <b>304</b> to a cruising speed and then decelerates to a detection speed. There might be no closed loop feedback during this phase. If no slippage occurs, the turntable <b>304</b> will rotate through some set angle, e.g., <b>115</b> of the total 120 degrees. According to alternative embodiments, the detection speed may be substantially equal to the cruising speed, thus eliminating any pre-detection deceleration. Phase 2 includes operating drive assembly <b>300</b> at a relatively low detection speed until either the phase times out (which means that something may be preventing the turntable <b>304</b> from rotating and thus slippage is occurring) or until the magnets <b>372</b> are sensed by Hall-effect sensors <b>370</b>. Assuming magnets <b>372</b> are sensed in phase 2, phase 3 includes applying the corrective positioning angular adjustment in order to precisely stop the turntable <b>204</b> and grow module <b>200</b> at the optimal or desired location.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Now that the construction and configuration of gardening appliance <b>100</b>, drive assembly <b>300</b>, and positioning assembly <b>330</b> have been presented according to an exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter, an exemplary method <b>400</b> for operating a gardening appliance <b>100</b> is provided. Method <b>400</b> can be used to operate gardening appliance <b>100</b>, or to operate any other suitable drive and positioning assemblies for a garden center. In this regard, for example, controller <b>174</b> may be configured for implementing method <b>400</b>. However, it should be appreciated that the exemplary method <b>400</b> is discussed herein only to describe exemplary aspects of the present subject matter and is not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, method <b>400</b> includes, at step <b>410</b>, operating a drive assembly of an indoor gardening appliance to initiate the rotation of a turntable. In this regard, continuing the example from above, drive assembly <b>300</b> may be used to rotate turntable <b>304</b> and grow module <b>200</b> within gardening appliance <b>100</b>. Notably, as grow module <b>200</b> rotates within liner <b>120</b>, foreign objects, plants <b>124</b>, or other items may become lodged between grow module <b>200</b> and liner <b>120</b> or between other components of gardening appliance <b>100</b> which may result in the sticking or binding of grow module <b>200</b>. Notably, it may be desirable to identify such a situation to facilitate improved safety and so that the user may implement corrective action to facilitate continued plant growth. Accordingly, aspects of the present subject matter are directed to systems and methods for identifying a slipping clutch, a stuck grow module <b>200</b> or turntable <b>304</b>, or another mechanical failure or a drive assembly fault within a gardening appliance.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In order to facilitate discussion of method <b>200</b> of detecting a drive assembly fault, movement of turntable <b>304</b> between two angular positions will be described. Specifically, the discussion below refers to the rotation of turntable <b>304</b> between a first angular position and a second angular position. According to exemplary embodiments, the first angular position may be the position of turntable <b>304</b> where first circumferential position <b>354</b> is aligned with hub alignment position <b>348</b> and the second angular position may be the position of turntable <b>304</b> where second circumferential position <b>358</b> is aligned with hub alignment position <b>348</b>. However, it should be appreciated that aspects the present subject matter may monitor the movement of turntable <b>304</b> between any suitable angular positions.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Accordingly, step <b>410</b> includes the operation of drive assembly to move turntable <b>304</b> between the first angular position toward the second angular position, e.g., an angular position that is 120&#xb0; away from the first angular position. According to exemplary embodiments, this operation of drive assembly <b>300</b> may include operating drive motor <b>320</b> at a constant power, torque, or speed.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Step <b>420</b> may include determining that the turntable should have reached the second angular position based at least in part on the operation of the drive assembly. In this regard, for example, method <b>400</b> may include monitoring the operation of drive assembly <b>300</b> to predict when turntable <b>304</b> has reached the second angular position. As will be described in more detail below, positioning sensing assembly <b>330</b> may monitor the actual position of turntable <b>304</b>, and if turntable <b>304</b> does not actually reach the second angular position (e.g., as determined by position sensing assembly <b>330</b>) within the expected amount of time, controller <b>174</b> may conclude that turntable <b>304</b> is not moving, clutch assembly <b>306</b> is slipping, or another mechanical failure or drive assembly fault has occurred.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">It should be appreciated that method <b>400</b> may include determining that the turntable should have reached the second angular position based on monitoring motor drive time, based on the motor drive signal, based on actual applied motor power or current, based on the back electromotive force of the motor, or based on any other suitable motor drive signals or feedback signals. For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, step <b>420</b> may include determining that the turntable should have reached the second the position based on the amount of time that drive motor <b>320</b> has been operating. In this regard, for example, controller <b>174</b> may start a timer when turntable <b>304</b> is in the first angular position, e.g., just as drive motor <b>320</b> begins operation in step <b>410</b>. Step <b>420</b> may further include determining that a predetermined amount of time has passed since starting the timer.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this regard, the predetermined amount of time may be an empirically determined or programmed time period that drive motor <b>320</b> should be operated to rotate turntable <b>304</b> through a desired angle (e.g., such as the 120&#xb0; between the first angular position in the second angular position). For example, referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, operation of drive assembly <b>330</b> while moving turntable <b>304</b> from the first angular position to the second angular position is provided according to an exemplary embodiment. More specifically, the digital feedback signal forming the pulse train corresponding to the operation of drive motor <b>320</b> is identified generally by reference numeral <b>500</b>. In general, this digital signal forming the pulse train may be generated as a magnet that is rotating with the motor drive shaft passes over a Hall-effect sensor that is fixed relative to the motor.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown, drive signal <b>500</b> is initiated at time t0. Based on empirical data, the predetermined drive time to reach the second angular position is identified as time t1. Accordingly, if drive motor <b>320</b> is initiated at t0 and reaches t1, then turntable <b>304</b> should have reached the second angular position. Specifically, if drive motor <b>320</b> has been operating for the predetermined time period <b>502</b> (e.g., the duration between t0 and t1), method <b>400</b> may include determining that the turntable <b>304</b> should have reached the second angular position.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to alternative exemplary embodiments, step <b>420</b> of determining that the turntable should have reached the second angular position may include tracking the number of pulses or ticks in the digital feedback signal forming the pulse train <b>500</b>. In this regard, for example, each pulse of the digital feedback signal forming the pulse train <b>500</b> may correspond to a known angular increment of turntable <b>304</b>. Accordingly, in order to move turntable <b>304</b> from the first angular position to the second angular position, e.g., 120&#xb0; of angular rotation, it can be expected that a specific number of pulses should be sent from controller <b>174</b> to drive motor <b>320</b>. By monitoring the number of pulses of signal <b>500</b>, controller <b>174</b> may predict the anticipated angular orientation of turntable <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Notably, step <b>430</b> may include determining that the turntable has not reached the second angular position using a position sensing assembly. In this regard, continuing the example from above, position sensing assembly <b>330</b> may be used to determine when turntable <b>304</b> leaves the first angular orientation and when turntable <b>304</b> reaches the second angular orientation. If turntable <b>304</b> has not been detected at the second angular orientation when it should (e.g., based on motor drive time or pulse train ticks), controller <b>174</b> may conclude that there is a slipping clutch, stuck turntable <b>304</b>, or other mechanical failure. Specifically, step <b>440</b> may include identifying a drive assembly fault in response to determining that the turntable has not reached the second angular position (e.g., as determined at step <b>430</b>) when the turntable should have reached the second angular position (e.g., as determined at step <b>420</b>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, or alternatively, method <b>400</b> may include identifying a slipping clutch by monitoring the actual power applied by drive motor <b>320</b>. For example, drive motor <b>320</b> may be operatively coupled with a current sensing module such as a current clamp or a resistor for monitoring the actual electrical current passed through drive motor <b>320</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary current profile <b>504</b> supplied to drive motor <b>320</b> while rotating turntable <b>304</b> from the first angular position toward the second angular position. Notably, if drive motor <b>320</b> is operating at constant power and moving turntable <b>304</b> at a constant rotational speed, the electric current <b>504</b> should be relatively constant. However, in the event that the clutch begins slipping (e.g., as shown schematically at point <b>506</b>), the electric current <b>504</b> will typically spike or show some other known deviation from normal operating current. Accordingly, controller <b>174</b> may sense that electrical current signature that is associated with clutch slippage (e.g., at <b>506</b>) and may conclude that a clutch slipping event or a drive assembly fault has occurred.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> depicts an exemplary control method having steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion.
