The models and methods can be used for identifying, testing or characterizing candidate molecules with respect to their suitability to treat renal injury.

Known causes of CKD comprise diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis (GN) or glomerular nephritis refers to several kidney diseases, some of them being characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli or of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. Existing CKD classification system(s) can assist in predicting outcomes such as kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease. They are furthermore applied to decide on therapeutic interventions in earlier stages to slow down disease progression, to improve quality of life and survival, or to reduce complications. These complications may for example relate to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Biomarkers such as albuminuria may precede kidney function decline and show strong correlations with disease progression and outcomes. Measured as ACR, albuminuria is the most sensitive indirect marker of CKD progression or glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) diseases in clinical practice. In clinical drug trials ACR has been used as surrogate endpoint. In humans, an ACR&#x3c;10 mg/g (&#x3c;1 mg/mmol) is considered normal, an ACR 10-30 mg/g (1-3 mg/mmol) is considered high normal and an ACR&#x3e;2200 mg/g (&#x3e;220 mg/mmol) is considered nephrotic range.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While there is a need for further drug development in the field of CKD and related diseases, identification, optimization and characterization of compounds with medical potential remains a challenge. In vivo kidney model systems are one option to identify or characterize substances with a potential effect in kidney related diseases. Animal models of renal disease have provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of acute and chronic kidney disease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For these methods, the renal injury can be induced by a variety of methods. Surgical manipulations may reproduce the injury that causes renal disease (e.g. ureteric obstruction) or reproduce the consequences of renal injury (e.g. renal ischaemia, reduction in renal mass). Animal models based on surgical manipulations are technically demanding and not reversible. Technically challenging genetically engineered animal models are a further option for the induction of renal injury, but are characterized by high costs. Chemical induction of renal injury is a further option for the development of a renal model system. The group of chemical models can also comprise immunological models, where an antibody (e.g. anti-GBM antibodies) or sera are administered to induce the renal injury.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typical methods for assessing GFR in small laboratory animals, as required for example in kidney disease models, nephrotoxicity studies or the characterization of genetically modified animals, are cumbersome, invasive and/or time consuming, due to required multiple blood and/or urine sampling and subsequent sample analysis. Common kidney in vivo models with albuminuria as a relevant readout parameter are likewise complicated invasive chronic models, with a typical duration of several weeks. These obstacles make the drug screening process challenging and susceptible to complications. Early direct evidence of GFB injury is only accessible with a glomerular histological end stage study or kidney biopsies, in humans as well in experimental nephrological animal models.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to prior art renal nephrotic models, the renal injury is induced via a constant femoral vein infusion of human angiotensin peptide II (AngII). A brief description of such an approach is disclosed e.g. in Jeansson M et al, Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 14(7), 2003, p. 1756-1765, Rippe C et al., American Journal Renal Physiology, 293(5), 2007, p. 1533-8, and Axelsson J et al., American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology, 303(6), 2012, p. F790-F799, where the authors are exploring the filtration capability of the glomeruli, a renal sub unit responsible for blood filtration and production of the pre-urine in the inner glomerular space. In brief, following the cannulation of the left ureter, experiments start with an initial rest period of 20 min. After the rest period, sampling of urine and plasma for Ficoll-sieving measurements is performed during a 5-min control period for baseline determination, before the start of the infusion of AngII. AngII is given as an injury inducer by continuous infusion throughout the experiment. The integrity of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is investigated using a mixture of polymers with different molecular density. Ficoll-70 kDa and 400 kDa are used as readout parameters in the final urine output. When the GBM integrity is lost during a glomerular injury the amount and quality of the Ficoll mixture ratio can change with linear progression of GBM damage. In the absence of injury, the urine output does not contain the polymer, due to the GBMs capability to stop proteins with a specific molecular weight of 60 to 70 kDa. For sieving of FITC-Ficoll, a mixture of FITC-Ficoll-70 and FITC-Ficoll-400 was used in a 1:24 relationship together with FITC-inulin. The bolus dose was followed by constant infusion of 10 ml&#xb7;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(FITC-Ficoll-70, 20 &#x3bc;g/ml; FITC-Ficoll-400, 0.48 mg/ml; FITC-inulin, 0.5 mg/ml; and <sup>51</sup>Cr-EDTA, 0.3 MBq/ml) for at least 20 min before sieving measurements, after which urine from the left kidney was collected for 5 min, with a midpoint (2.5 min) plasma sample collected. Plasma and urine samples were assessed for FITC-Ficoll concentrations on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The methodology described has several critical points: the necessity of ureter cannulation for urine sampling, femoral vein access for blood sampling as well as constant fluid infusion and AngII administration complicate the method. Handling of radioactive compounds such as <sup>51</sup>Cr-EDTA for GFR assessment requires complicated and specific competences for radioactive-good practice guidelines, necessitating appropriate user-trainings and security clearances. In addition, procedures for handling of radioactive waste and samples are laborious in itself. Moreover, laboratory animals are anesthetized for the experimental procedure. The anesthesia induces a significant alteration of the GFR. In addition to these issues, the complex methodology has a high expenditure of time and a limited output, which is not in line with the needs of high throughput drug discovery.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">So Yeon Chin et al. (American Journal of Physiology, 274 (5 Pt 2), 1998, p. F876-82) describe an AngII infusion rat model, where synthetic AngII is delivered continuously at a rate of 65 ng/min via osmotic minipumps implanted at the dorsum of the neck. The AngII is infused into the interstitium to allow slow absorption into the circulation. A sham operation is performed on the normotensive control rats. After recovery, renal clearance experiments are performed 13 days after the implantation of minipumps or sham operation to assess renal hemodynamics. In 2001, Cervenka et al (Hypertension, 37(3), 2001, p. 967-973) transferred the described long term AngII-osmotic pump model from rat into mouse.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Eckel et al. (Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 22(3), 2011, p. 526-535) describe a long term osmotic pump AngII infusion mouse model to study renal disease, wherein renal injury is induced by 28-day infusion of AngII at a dose of 1000 ng/kg/min using primed osmotic minipumps. The pumps were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal region under isoflurane anesthesia. After a recovery period of 3 to 4 days, the evolution of kidney function parameters was checked weekly until the end point date of 28 days.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">All these models have in common that the induction of kidney injury is established by long term infusion of an injury inducer. Hence, the experiments easily last longer than 20 days and/or require complicated operations, rendering the drug screening inefficient and time consuming.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A modified method for the measurement of glomerular permeability in mice has been described by K&#xf6;nigshausen et al. (Scientific Reports 6:39513, 2016, p. 1-14). In brief, anesthesized female FVB mice were catheterized and urine was collected continuously. FITC-Ficoll 70 was injected i.p., whereas AngII was applied by continuous infusion. Collected urine was subjected to fluorescence measurement and creatinine was analyzed via enzymatic assay. However, the method of Konigshausen et al. remains invasive, irreversible and comparably slow. The required anesthesia has a known influence on the GFR, affecting the accuracy of the method. The drug screening for innovative fast therapeutic GFR solutions thus remains slow and similarly challenging as for anti-albuminuric drugs.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In 2009, Schock-Kusch et al. described an approach for transcutaneous determination of GFR by using fluoresceinisothiocyanate-labelled sinistrin (FITC-S) in rats. In small animal research this approach is known as tGFR (transcutaneous GFR). This model overcomes the poor water solubility of FITC-labelled inulin (FITC-I), which had been suggested as a GFR marker in a previously described animal model (Lorenz et al., Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 1999; 276: F172-F177). In brief, for marker application and blood sampling, catheters were inserted into the femoral vein and artery under intramuscular/intraperitoneal anesthesia and exteriorized at the back of the neck. Fluorescence was analyzed using a transcutaneous device capable of fluorescence detection through the small capillary system under the skin. The fluorescence decay is used for the calculation of half-life and GFR.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is hence an object of the present invention to provide an improved, e.g., faster, reversible, less invasive, and/or more robust model for the induction of renal injury. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved, e.g., faster, reversible, less invasive, and/or more robust method and/or system for identifying, testing or characterizing a candidate molecule for its suitability to treat renal injury. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved, e.g., faster, reversible, less invasive, and/or more robust method and/or system for screening a population of candidate molecules for suitability to treat renal injury.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for creating a renal injury model, wherein the method comprises the following steps: (i) inducing, in a test subject, renal injury by administering subcutaneously a bolus of a renal injury inducer, in a dosage sufficiently high to induce renal injury, (ii) determining at least the albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) in a urine sample taken from the subject, and (iii) determining from the ACR determined in step (ii) the degree of renal injury that has been induced in the test subject.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for creating a renal injury model, wherein the method comprises the following steps: (i) inducing, in a test subject, renal injury by administering subcutaneously and/or intravenously a bolus of a renal injury inducer, in a dosage sufficiently high to induce renal injury, (ii) administering a pharmaceutically suitable fluorescent molecule to the test subject, wherein the total molecular weight of the molecule is &#x2265;60 kDa or &#x2264;15 kDa, preferably &#x2264;10 kDa, (iii) determining at least the development of the transcutaneous fluorescence (TF) for the test subject, and (iv) determining from the development of the TF determined in step (iii) the degree of renal injury that has been induced in the test subject.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a some further aspects of the invention, there are provided methods of identifying, testing or characterizing a candidate molecule or a population of candidate molecules for their suitability to modulate or treat renal injury, wherein the methods are based on the methods to create a renal injury model as described before and wherein the methods further comprise the administration of a candidate molecule and the determination whether or not the candidate molecule is capable of modulating, alleviating or preventing the renal injury induced in the test subject based on the respective readout.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to further aspects of the invention there are provided molecules and compositions for the modulation or treatment of renal injury and methods for producing these compositions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, &#x201c;about&#x201d; can mean within one or more than one standard deviation, per the practice in the art.

The GFB is responsible for the filtration of substances including toxins from the peripheral blood into the pre-urine while retaining the proteins and cellular components of the blood. The GFB is a three part fenestrate fibro-cellular membrane composed of three different components. (i) The glomerular capillary endothelial cell barrier serves as first blood capillary filtering tool. (ii) The glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a multi-collagenous membranous serves as support of the adjacent filtration components and (iii) the glomerular visceral epithelia cell barrier (known as podocyte-podocyte filtration barrier) serves as sieving tool inside the glomerulus and is responsible for the last filtration step. The glomerular filtrate is then collected in a cavity within the glomerular capsule called Bowman's space. The GFB is responsible for maintaining the protein concentration in the blood stream by avoiding their passage into the pre-urine inside the Bowman's space. With a molecular weight beyond the filtration size limit of approx. 60 kDa to 70 kDa molecules cannot pass.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The &#x201c;glomerular filtration rate&#x201d; (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. The GFR is therefore an important marker of kidney function. In clinical use, the GFR levels are used for staging of chronic kidney disease. GFR can be measured indirectly as the clearance of filtration markers that are eliminated by the kidney only by glomerular filtration. Preferably, such a marker is freely filtered at the glomeruli and neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the renal tubules. Measuring GFR typically occurs based on biochemical analysis of repeatedly collected blood and urine samples and estimation of the component Creatinine GFR can also be measured using radioactive substances, in particular Chromium-51 and Technetium-99m. These come close to the ideal properties of inulin (undergoing only glomerular filtration) but can be measured more practically with only a few urine or blood samples.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">&#x201c;Creatinine&#x201d; is a constantly produced byproduct of muscle metabolism and is removed from the blood mainly by the kidneys, primarily by glomerular filtration, but also by proximal tubular secretion. Little or no tubular reabsorption of creatinine occurs. If the filtration in the kidney is deficient, creatinine blood levels rise. Therefore, creatinine levels in blood and urine may be used to calculate the creatinine clearance (CrCl), which correlates approx. with the GFR (10%-20% deviation).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">&#x201c;Inulin&#x201d; is an exogenous filtration marker derived from a fructose polymer and is a physiologically inert substance. Although inulin clearance is considered the gold-standard method for assessing GFR in patients, the need for continuous infusion, multiple blood samples and urine collection, make it cumbersome and expensive to measure. This has led to some research to develop alternative methods based on different biomarkers.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Like inulin the polymer &#x201c;sinistrin&#x201d; is not metabolized in human blood and passes the kidneys unchanged. The average molecular is at 3500 Da with a range from 2000 to 6000 Da. Sinistrin is an inulin-type &#x3b2;-D-fructan with branches on position 6. Main differences between sinistrin and inulin are the higher alkali-resistance, a better water solubility and easier handling of sinistrin compared to inulin.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">&#x201c;Albumin&#x201d; is a globular serum protein with an approximate molecular weight of 65 kDa. Albuminuria occurs when the kidney leaks small amounts of albumin into the urine, i.e., when there is an abnormally high permeability for albumin in the glomerulus of the kidney. To compensate for variations in urine concentration, the albumin concentration in the urine sample can be normalized to the concentration of creatinine, which is constant even under the conditions described above. The resulting &#x201c;albumin/creatinine ratio&#x201d; (ACR) can be used as readout parameter for albuminuria. The determination of protein content from the urine samples can be assessed by any method known in the art. Methods known in the art to determine albumin and creatine content comprise immunologic methods such as ELISA or radioimmunoassay, mass spectrometry based methods and a variety of other methods. Various devices or urine test strips are likewise available to directly assess the ACR.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The term &#x201c;renal injury&#x201d; comprises structural and functional alterations affecting the physiological function of the kidney. In particular, these structural changes may involve one or more structural component(s) of the GFB. Renal injury can be measured by a variety of methods known in the art. Occurrence of albuminuria, a detectable amount of ACR or a change in GFR are some of the symptoms of renal injury.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A &#x201c;renal injury model&#x201d; is an animal model to study renal injury. For instance, such a model can be used for the development of novel drugs or modulators of different types of renal disease. It can furthermore be used to determine potential renal toxicity of compounds. Suitable subjects for such a renal injury model are all non-human animals with a renal system which is structurally and/or functionally comparable with the human renal system. Suitable subjects are all non-human animals that can be used to mimic the mechanisms of human renal disease. Preferably, the subject of a renal injury model is a pig, a monkey, a dog, a sheep, a rabbit or a rodent, such as a rat or a mouse. For instance, the subject of a renal injury model can be a rat, such as a Wistar Kyoto rat or a mouse, such as a C57Bl/6 mouse.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The term &#x201c;renal injury inducer&#x201d; or &#x201c;inducer of renal injury&#x201d; as used herein refers to any composition, compound or molecule suitable to induce renal injury. For example, the injury inducer can be a small molecule or a biomolecule, such as an antibody. The ability of kidneys to concentrate and metabolize chemicals makes them particularly prone to toxic damage. Molecules can have renal toxicity in a variety of ways, including having deleterious effects on the vasculature, GBM, glomerular cells, and tubular epithelium. A variety of toxic compounds and substances is known in the art and can be used to establish a renal injury model system, including GBM toxins, podocyte toxins (e.g. adriamycin), tubular toxins (e.g. cisplatin, mercuric chloride, gentamicin) or substances leading to tubular obstruction (e.g. by long term feeding of adenine, or IP injection of folic acid). For example, the renal injury inducer may be an inducer of GFB injury, such as angiotensin. Of note, the applied dose of a substance may have an impact on the type of injury, i.e. depending on the dose different renal structures may be affected. For example, at the concentration applied the renal injury inducer vasopressin may be an inducer of GFB injury in a subject. In yet another example, at the concentration applied the renal injury inducer Sema3a may be an inducer of podocyte injury in a subject. In a further example, at the concentration applied the renal injury inducer heparanase may be an inducer of endothelial cell injury in a subject.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The term angiotensin II (AngII) comprises the peptide hormone of the sequence Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe. In particular, the term AngII refers to human angiotensin II or a derivative thereof. Angiotensin II can directly constrict vascular smooth muscle cells, stimulate aldosterone production, activate the sympathetic nervous system and increase sodium reabsorption, all of which are mediated through AngII type (AT) 1 receptor activation, and can contribute to the development of hypertension. In addition to its hypertensinogenic effect, locally produced AngII in the kidney can activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways and induce inflammation, renal cell growth, mitogenesis, apoptosis, migration and differentiation. These effects of AngII can also be mediated through AT1 receptor activation and play an important role in the pathogenesis of renal tissue injury. In the long-term model described by Rippe C et al 2007, AngII is used to develop a damage of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">&#x201c;Antidiuretic hormone&#x201d;, also known as &#x201c;Vasopressin&#x201d; (AVP), is a nine amino acid peptide secreted from the posterior pituitary. As used herein, the term also comprises vasopressin and derivatives thereof as well as AVP salts, such as ARG8-vasopressin acetate salt. Vasopressin is essential for cardiovascular homeostasis, acting via the kidney to regulate water resorption and on the vasculature to regulate smooth muscle tone. AVP can bind to receptors of its target cells in the kidney tubules and vascular smooth muscle. Vasopressin can bind with three different receptors (V<sub>1</sub>A, V<sub>1</sub>B, and V<sub>2</sub>). Vasopressin-V<sub>1 </sub>binding is caused by decreased vessel tone, decreased vascular resistance and decreased blood pressure. V<sub>1 </sub>receptors are found in blood vessels and binding stimulates vasoconstriction. Vasopressin-V<sub>2 </sub>binding is caused by an increase in plasma osmolarity. Vasopressin binding to V<sub>2 </sub>receptors stimulates the G-protein coupled cAMP second messenger system. This system increases the concentration of cAMP in the collecting ducts of the kidney, creating aquaporins (AQP-Z) by exocytosis, allowing for water reabsorption and vasculature constriction. The activation of these receptors during kidney disease plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal tissue injury.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The term &#x201c;Sema3a&#x201d; refers to the protein Semaphorin-3A. The Sema3a protein is encoded by the gene SEMA3A. Alternative names for the Sema3a protein comprise Sema3A, Semaphorin III and Sema II.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Alternative names for the gene SEMA3A comprise SEMAD.

The ability of Sema3a to induce non hypertensive injury of the GBM and albuminuria has been described by Tapia R et al., Kidney International, 73(6), 2008, p. 733-740. Recombinant Sema3a as a trigger to mimic human hypertensive glomerular disease has a known mode of action, leads to a fast onset of injury, can be injected in rodents, and damages the integrity of the GBM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>).

In the ECM, heparan sulphate proteolglycans (HSPGs) interact with fibronectin, laminin, collagen and growth factors to help maintain cellular architecture. One of the key enzymes involved in specifically degrading the heparan sulphate (HS) component of the ECM is the endo-b-glucuronidase enzyme heparanase. The glomerular endothelium is highly fenestrated and the fenestrae are filled with dense glycocalyx. The glycocalyx maintains the protein filtration barrier at this site. Heparan sulfate is the key polysaccharide within the glycocalyx and keeps the filtration barrier intact. Overexpression of HPSE leads to albuminuria in unchallenged genetically overexpressing HPSE transgenic mice (HPSEtg) and increased kidney damage after I/R injury in HPSEtg (van den Hoven et al, Kidney Int, 70(12), 2006, p. 2100-8, van den Hoven et al, Kidney Int, 73, 2008, p. 278-287, Masola et al., PlosOne, 11(7), 2016, e0160074). Increased HPSE markedly reduced HS expression in the kidney and leads to significant higher levels of albuminuria during glomerular injury. In some embodiments, the injury inducer is heparanase, e.g. recombinant active heparanase. In some embodiments, HPSE is applied at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg to induce the renal injury.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">For each aspect of the current invention there are provided some embodiments, wherein the method besides a subcutaneous injection further comprises the intravenous administration of a second bolus of the same or a different renal injury inducer, in a dosage sufficiently high to induce renal injury together with the subcutaneous bolus of the first renal injury inducer.

In some embodiments, the two boli comprise an identical dosage. However, it can likewise be provided that the two boli comprise different dosages.

For the AGISHA model, the Albumin/creatinine ratio was used as readout. However, as discussed below, the AGISHA model can be adapted, for example such that GFR is used as readout. Albumin is a protein that is present in high concentrations in the blood. Virtually no albumin is present in the urine when the kidneys are functioning properly. However, albumin may be detected in the urine even in the early stages of kidney disease (albuminuria). Creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, is normally released into the urine at a constant rate and its level in the urine is an indicator of the urine concentration. Creatinine levels can therefore be used to correct for urine concentration in a random urine sample. For human patients, the American Diabetes Association has stated a preference for the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) for screening for albuminuria indicating early kidney disease.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0089">The determination of the albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) is preferably carried out using routine analysis after urine collection. For example, following the induction of renal injury, e.g., with AngII, test subjects are placed within metabolic cages for up to 4 hours. In some preferred embodiments, urine of the subject is collected non-invasively for &#x2265;0.25, &#x2265;1, &#x2265;2, &#x2265;3, &#x2265;4, &#x2265;5 or &#x2265;6 hours. According to some embodiments of the invention, the collection of urine for the determination of the ACR is carried out between &#x2265;2 hrs and &#x2264;6 hrs after administration of the first bolus of injury inducer. According to some embodiments of the invention, the collection of urine for the determination of the ACR is carried out between &#x2265;0 hrs and &#x2264;12 hrs after administration of the first bolus.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0090">The collected urine is analysed by an automatic analyser for urinary albumin (automatic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method or any other suitable method known in the art) as well as urinary creatinine (any suitable method known in the art, such as an enzyme method, such as Cobas&#xae; Integra 400 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) or via ELISA (e.g. Mouse albumin ELISA kit, ABCAM, Cambridge, UK). ACR is calculated by dividing the obtained albumin concentration by the obtained creatinine concentration.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0091">Based on the ACR the degree of renal injury can be determined. For the AGISHA model, the ACR can be used as a direct measure for the degree of renal injury. In one embodiment the ACR determined in one or more test subjects is compared to the ACR of one or more control subjects wherein renal injury has not been induced, e.g., because the bolus administered comprised only saline. In one embodiment the ACR determined in one or more test subjects is compared to reference values for ACR, wherein these reference values have been acquired for healthy control subjects in a comparable setup of the AGISHA model.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0092">For the animal model according to the first aspect, the primary readout parameter ACR is obtained after 4 hours, leading to a fundamentally reduced expenditure of time for the model. Compared with the ureter cannulation proposed by prior art models, the use of metabolic cages is less invasive and does not require anesthesia.

In some embodiments, the continuous or discontinuous measurement(s) of TF occurs for less than approx. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 24 hours, wherein for this particular context, the term &#x201c;approx.&#x201d; refers to +/&#x2212;30 min. In some preferred embodiments, the measurement of the TF occurs for &#x2264;2 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the measurement of the TF occurs for approximately 30 minutes.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0106">The half-life of the fluorescent molecule can be determined based on the fluorescence intensity as known in the art and as shown for instance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. The faster the decay in TF and the lower the half-life of the fluorescent molecule in the blood is, the higher is the degree of renal injury. Based on the development of the TF in a group of treated animals compared to a control group, the degree of renal injury can be assessed (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). In some embodiments, for an experimental group, the development of the TF and/or the half-life of the fluorescent dye Ficoll-FITC in the peripheral blood compartment is compared with an experimental control group.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0107">Furthermore, there is provided a third aspect according to the current invention, wherein the main steps of the second aspect are maintained, while the readout system is slightly modified. More specifically, the third aspect of the current invention is based on the development of the TF as an indicator for glomerular filtration rate as readout parameter(s). It has been shown that loss or partial damage of the functional units of the kidney (nephrons) leads to a significant reduction of GFR. Loss or damage of the nephrons is difficult to monitor and the GFR remains the gold standard to indirectly measure this pathological effect. Modulation of the GFR can be modeled in rodents, but these are typically long and complex CKD models.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0108">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for creating a renal injury model, wherein the method comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0109">a) inducing, in a test subject, renal injury by administering subcutaneously and/or intravenously a bolus of a renal injury inducer, in a dosage sufficiently high to induce renal injury,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0110">b) administering a pharmaceutically suitable fluorescent molecule to the test subject, wherein the total molecular weight of the molecule is &#x2264;15 kDa, preferably &#x2264;10 kDa</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0111">c) determining at least the development of the transcutaneous fluorescence (TF) for the test subject, and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0112">d) determining from the development of the TF determined in step c) the glomerular filtration rate and the degree of renal injury that has been induced in the test subject.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0103" num="0113">While a fluorescent molecule according to the second aspect cannot cross the GFB in a healthy subject, this is different for the fluorescent molecule according to the third aspect. Molecules with a molecular weight&#x2264;15 kDa can cross a fully functional glomerular filtration barrier. With a molecular weight&#x2264;15 kDa, preferably &#x2264;10 kDa the fluorescent molecule can pass and is readily excreted by the kidney. The decay in TF is therefore a direct measure for the GFR. The GFR however can be altered when renal injury occurs, for example where mechanical or chemical damage has been induced. In consequence, there is an altered development of the TF (e.g. decay in TF) for the fluorescent molecule, which again can be used as a readout for renal injury. Thus, the method provides means to determine the degree and/or stage of loss of renal filtration rate as well as means to assess the renal glomerular filtration function. This readout system can be used independently or in combination with one or both readout systems according to the first and second aspect of the current invention. Different fluorophores might be used to distinguish between the readout for the second and third aspect.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0114">The fluorescent molecule described for the third aspect of the current invention is a pharmaceutically suitable fluorescent molecule or a composition thereof.
