level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicle docking facilities, such as warehouses, typically include multiple vehicle docking stations that facilitate the movement of goods between the facility and a vehicle parked at the docking station. Each vehicle docking station can include docking equipment used to improve the safety and efficiency of moving goods between the facility and the vehicle. A vehicle docking station can include, for example, a vehicle restraint used to ensure that the vehicle does not move away from the docking station during loading and unloading, a dock door used to control access into and out of the warehouse, a dock leveler used to provide a bridge or ramp between the vehicle and the facility, a barrier gate to prevent cargo or personnel from falling out of the docking station when the dock door is open, and an inflatable shelter to provide cover between the vehicle and the facility during loading and unloading. Once the vehicle is restrained and the dock door is opened, the trailer door must be opened to access the cargo within the trailer. Trailer doors are typically roll-up type doors or swing-type doors. Roll-up type doors are manually opened to access the cargo within the trailer once the vehicle is restrained and the dock door is opened. Swing-type trailer doors require dock personnel to manually open the doors for loading and/or unloading the trailer prior to backing the vehicle up to the dock and restraining the vehicle.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are isometric and cross-sectional elevation views, respectively, illustrating an automated trailer door system configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D</figref> are isometric and plan views, respectively, illustrating a trailer power connection system configured in accordance with other embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> is a plan view illustrating a trailer power connection system configured in accordance with further embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> is a rear elevation view of a trailer illustrating components of a trailer power connection system configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are isometric and side elevation views, respectively, illustrating an automated trailer door system configured in accordance with other embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> are isometric, side elevation, and cross-sectional detail views, respectively, illustrating an automated trailer door system configured in accordance with further embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a conventional trailer door latch system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref> are perspective and cross-sectional elevation views, respectively, illustrating an automated trailer door latch system configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>D and <b>4</b>E</figref> are detail elevation views illustrating components of the automated trailer door latch system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> are flowcharts of loading dock operational steps configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The following disclosure describes various embodiments of powered trailer systems, including systems for automated opening and/or closing of trailer doors, e.g., while the trailer is at a loading dock, and systems for vehicle and/or trailer power delivery and charging.

Some embodiments can include components that can interface with one or more components associated with a loading dock LD (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E</figref>). Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, these figures are isometric and cross-sectional elevation views, respectively, illustrating the system <b>100</b> configured in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. The system <b>100</b> includes components associated with the trailer T that can automate the opening and/or closing of the trailer door TD in response to, e.g., a signal (.e.g., a wireless and/or wired signal) initiated by a tractor/trailer control system, a truck driver, from an operator at a loading dock, from a loading dock control system, etc. The system <b>100</b> includes a first guide track <b>110</b> and a second guide track <b>112</b>, having lower guide track portions <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>a</i>, respectively, in a generally vertical orientation for retaining the sides of the trailer door TD when the trailer door TD is in the closed position, and upper guide track portions <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>112</b><i>b</i>, respectively, in a generally horizontal orientation for retaining the sides of the trailer door TD when the trailer door TD is in the open position above the trailer internal space. In some embodiments, the upper track portions <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>support the trailer door TD in a horizontal position so that the trailer door TD does not tend to move from the open position toward the closed position without actuation by the system <b>100</b> or manual input. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments the trailer door TD can include a counterbalance having a shaft, spring, drum, cable, etc. to provide additional force to assist in opening the trailer door TD or to retain the trailer door TD in the closed position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> together, the system <b>100</b> further includes an elongate drive support <b>120</b> which can be operably coupled to either of the first and second guide tracks <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is shown with component <b>140</b> (representing a motor, as will be described below) omitted to better illustrate certain components of the system <b>100</b>. As an example, in the illustrated embodiment the drive support <b>120</b> is operably coupled to the upper guide track portion <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the first guide track <b>110</b>. More specifically, the drive support <b>120</b> can include an upper flange <b>121</b> that can be operably coupled to the upper guide track portion <b>110</b><i>b </i>by means of fasteners, welding, and/or other suitable attachment means (not shown). Although not shown in the Figures, in other embodiments, the drive support <b>120</b> can be operably coupled to one of the lower guide track portions <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>a</i>, a configuration in which the drive support <b>120</b> and the components of the system <b>100</b> described below would generally be rotated by 90&#xb0; to align with the lower guide track portions <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the illustrated embodiment, the drive support <b>120</b> is configured to rotatably support a drive shaft <b>122</b> extending therethrough (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). More specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, the drive support <b>120</b> has a semi-circular portion <b>123</b> that partially encloses the outer circumference of the drive shaft <b>122</b> therein, with an opening (e.g., a longitudinal slot <b>128</b> along the length of the drive support <b>120</b>) such that a lower portion of the outer surface of the drive shaft <b>122</b> is accessible external to the drive support <b>120</b> through the longitudinal slot <b>128</b>.

The engagement member <b>126</b> can be operably coupled to a carriage <b>134</b> configured to partially surround and slidingly engage the semi-circular portion <b>123</b> of the drive support <b>120</b> to maintain the engagement member <b>126</b> in sliding engagement with the drive shaft <b>122</b> during opening and closing of the trailer door TD. Translation of the carriage <b>134</b> along the drive support <b>120</b> can move the trailer door TD in the guide tracks <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> by means of a door arm <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the door arm <b>130</b> includes a first end portion having a first pin <b>131</b><i>a </i>pivotably coupling the first end portion to the carriage <b>134</b> and a second end portion having a second pin <b>13</b> lb pivotally coupling the second end portion to a door bracket <b>132</b> that is operably coupled to an uppermost door panel <b>111</b>. During opening or closing of the trailer door TD, the carriage <b>134</b> translates along the drive support <b>120</b> such that the door arm <b>130</b> moves the door within the guide tracks <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. The pivotable couplings of the door arm <b>130</b> to the door bracket <b>132</b> and the carriage <b>134</b> allow a range of rotational motion of the door arm <b>130</b> as the uppermost door panel <b>111</b> of the trailer door TD transitions from the lower guide track portions <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>a </i>to the upper guide track portions <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>112</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the drive shaft <b>122</b> operably rotates about its longitudinal axis by rotational input from a suitable motor <b>140</b> (e.g., an electric motor; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), either directly by an in-line coupling, or indirectly by a driven gear train, gearbox, chain, drivebelt, and/or other system. In the illustrated embodiment, the motor <b>140</b> is positioned toward an end (e.g., a distal end toward the front of the trailer relative to the driving direction) of the drive support <b>120</b> and includes an output shaft operably coupled to the drive shaft <b>122</b> with an in-line coupling (e.g., where the rotational axis of the output shaft of the motor <b>140</b> is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft <b>122</b>). As the output shaft of the motor <b>140</b> rotates in a first direction, it rotates the drive shaft <b>122</b> in the first direction to translate the carriage <b>134</b> axially along the drive support <b>120</b> to move the trailer door TD from, e.g., the closed position to the open position. Similarly, when the output shaft of the motor <b>140</b> rotates in a second direction opposite the first direction, it rotates the drive shaft <b>122</b> in the second direction to translate the carriage <b>134</b> axially along the drive support <b>120</b> to move the trailer door TD from the open position to the closed position. In these embodiments, the drive support <b>120</b>, drive shaft <b>122</b>, the motor <b>140</b>, and other components of the system <b>100</b> are shown mounted on only one of the first and second guide tracks <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, since a typical counter-balanced trailer door TD does not require a centrally mounted opener. Although not shown, in other embodiments, an output shaft of the motor <b>140</b> can be positioned at an angle (e.g., a right angle) relative to the drive shaft <b>122</b> and can be operably coupled to the drive shaft <b>122</b> by a bevel gear (e.g. a right-angle gearbox with intersecting axes bevel gears, etc.), and/or any other suitable system.

Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the flowchart <b>500</b> begins in block <b>502</b> when a truck presence sensor (e.g., a pressure sensor, optical sensor, etc.) senses the presence of a truck at a loading dock. The truck presence sensor can be positioned on the parking surface in front of the loading dock, on a loading dock door, a wall of the loading dock, or any other suitable surface. In response to detecting the presence of a trailer by the truck presence sensor, the loading dock control system, (e.g. the loading dock control system <b>160</b>, <b>260</b> or <b>360</b> described above), can send a signal to initiate operation of a trailer restraint in block <b>504</b> if a restraint is present. The trailer restraint can be any suitable restraint for preventing movement of the trailer during loading/unloading. Next, in block <b>506</b>, the loading dock control system sends a signal to a controller on the trailer (e.g., the controller <b>150</b>, <b>250</b> or <b>350</b> described above) to open the trailer door using any of the systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and/or <b>300</b>. In trailers having the system <b>400</b>, the loading dock control system may first send a signal to unlock the trailer door prior to opening the trailer door. The signal can be a wireless signal, or can be a wired signal through contacts on the trailer. Next, and block <b>508</b>, the loading dock control system verifies that the trailer door is open, e.g., by visual confirmation, a signal from the controller on the trailer, a signal from a door sensor, a signal from an AGV, etc. Once the loading dock control system verifies that the trailer door is open, in block <b>510</b>, an automated dock process may be initiated (e.g., turning on one or more lights, deploying a door seal, leveling the dock, loading/unloading the trailer, etc.). After the automated dock process concludes (as indicated by, e.g., input to the control system from an operator), in block <b>512</b>, the loading dock control system can send a signal to the controller on the trailer to close the trailer door. Next, in block <b>514</b>, the loading dock control system verifies that the trailer door is closed, e.g., by visual confirmation, a signal from the controller on the trailer, a signal from a door sensor, a signal from an AGV, etc. Next, in block <b>516</b>, the trailer restraint may be released such that the trailer can depart.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a loading dock operation flowchart <b>600</b> including operations of the powered trailer door systems <b>100</b>-<b>400</b> described herein. The flowchart <b>600</b> begins in block <b>602</b> when a truck presence sensor senses the presence of a truck at a loading dock. The truck presence sensor can be positioned on a loading dock door, a wall of the loading dock, or any other suitable surface. The presence of a trailer detected by the truck presence sensor can cause the loading dock control system to initiate engagement of a trailer restraint in block <b>604</b>, if a trailer restraint is present. The trailer restraint can be any suitable restraint for preventing movement of the trailer during loading/unloading. Next, in block <b>606</b>, the loading dock control system, e.g. as described above, sends a signal (e.g., a wireless signal) to call an AGV, and then in block <b>608</b>, sends a signal to the AGV that causes the AGV to send a signal (e.g., a wireless signal) to the trailer to open the trailer door using any of the systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and/or <b>300</b>. In trailers having the system <b>400</b>, the AGV may first send a signal to unlock the trailer door prior to opening the trailer door. The signal can be wireless, or can be a wired signal through contacts on the trailer. Next, and block <b>610</b>, the AGV verifies that the trailer door is open, e.g., by visual confirmation, a signal from the controller on the trailer, etc. and communicates the door status to the loading dock control system. Once the loading dock control system verifies that the trailer door is open, in block <b>612</b>, an automated dock process may be initiated (e.g., turning on one or more lights, deploying a door seal, leveling the dock, etc.). After the automated dock process concludes, in block <b>614</b>, the AGV can send a signal (e.g., a wireless signal) to the controller on the trailer to close the trailer door. Next, in block <b>616</b>, the loading dock control system verifies that the trailer door is closed, e.g., by visual confirmation, a signal from the controller on the trailer, an AGV, etc. Next, in block <b>618</b>, the trailer restraint may be released such that the trailer can depart.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a loading dock operation flowchart <b>700</b> including operations of the powered trailer door systems <b>100</b>-<b>400</b> described herein, where an identification system, such as the systems described in U.S. Provisional App. No. 63/284,501, filed Nov. 30, 2021, and titled TRAILER VALIDATION SYSTEMS, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, can be used with the flowchart <b>700</b>.

In block <b>708</b>, the load is directed to a loading dock and in block <b>710</b> the load arrives at the loading dock. Next, in optional block <b>712</b>, the load is verified, e.g., by any suitable load verification signal, including the identification system incorporated by reference herein. If the load is unverified, in block <b>726</b>, the loading dock control system selects load options, including rejecting the vehicle at block <b>724</b>, sending the vehicle to a different dock at block <b>728</b>, and locking operation of the loading dock at block <b>730</b>. Alternatively, if the load is verified, in block <b>714</b>, the loading dock operation is enabled. Next, in block <b>716</b>, a vehicle restraint can be applied to the trailer to prevent movement of the trailer during loading/unloading. If the vehicle restraint is not present, in block <b>732</b>, restraint options can be available to the loading dock control system, e.g., wheel chocks, manual restraint, etc. Once the restraint is verified, the loading dock control system queries the trailer door status in block <b>718</b>, e.g., whether the trailer door is open or closed, by visual confirmation, a signal from the controller on the trailer, an AGV, etc. If the trailer door is closed, the loading dock control system sends a signal to the trailer in block <b>720</b>, using any method described above, to open the trailer door using any of systems <b>100</b>-<b>400</b> described herein. If the trailer door is open at the query in status of block <b>718</b>, or after opening in block <b>720</b>, the automated dock process is initiated in block <b>722</b>.
