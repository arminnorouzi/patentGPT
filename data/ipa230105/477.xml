id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to auxiliary surgical support appliances for operating room tables and, in particular, a modular distractor apparatus, system, and method specially adapted therefor, and arrangements of patient-supporting surfaces for specific parts of the body, including knees, and upper or lower legs.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the advent of increasingly sophisticated surgeries for the knee, such as robotic and minimally-invasive surgeries, the requirements for precise bone and/or joint positioning are increasingly important to the overall success of the surgery and the patient's recovery and quality of life thereafter. A problem exists with conventional surgery systems in that the hardware and associated components lack the stability and distraction required by such surgeries. For example, surgical saws tend to cause the patient's limb to move as a bone is cut, especially when the structural rigidity of the support apparatus is inadequate. When the patient's limb moves and changes position mid-surgery, this presents a challenge for the surgeon who relies on precision tools to successfully conduct these advanced procedures without issue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such surgical limb-support systems present additional challenges. For example, such systems need to be easily sterilizable with components that are adapted to be placed and fit within conventional sterilizer systems. Also, these systems should provide the doctors and nurses who perform the surgery with a level of convenience suitable for use; such systems should therefore be adaptable to individual patient size, should at times allow for single-hand operation, and should free up the hands of nurses and support staff who would otherwise be required to hold objects for periods of time, such as the patient's open skin, during prolonged periods of the operation. Additionally, the number of parts and the complexity of the system present a challenge in that the amount of time required to assemble and/or disassemble the system directly affects important aspects of the overall procedure, such as time and cost.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For at least the reasons mentioned above, conventional surgery systems are subject to a variety of challenges.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it would therefore be functionally and economically advantageous to provide a distractor system, such as a knee positioner system that overcomes these challenges.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides an apparatus, system, and method for positioning, holding, and/or distracting the bones and associated ligaments and tissue of the knee during surgery.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may provide enhanced structurally stability and support of a patient's limb, which may provide stability on the order of millimeters, resulting in a better outcome for the patient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may be utilized, capable of tailoring the overall support system to the unique physical parameters of a particular patient and/or surgery.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system is presented, which provides ease of use for doctors and nurses to assemble, position, distract, and/or disassemble the system and components thereof during and throughout a surgery.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include a minimal number of parts and facilitated ease of sterilization, wherein the distractor system components are adapted to be placed and fit within conventional sterilizer systems, such as those having trays dimensioned 24&#x2033;&#xd7;11.5&#x2033;&#xd7;8&#x2033; (depth, width, and height, respectively).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include an adapter portion, configured to couple to different forms of carriage assemblies, base plates, and/or different OR table side rail configurations and associated support systems.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include an adapter portion configured to rotate to or from an orthonormal angle, with respect to the plane formed by the operating table surface, to position, hold and/or a patient's knee at said angle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include a static adapter portion adapted to couple to a positioner pad separate and irrespective of a dynamic distractor component.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include a distractor assembly having enhanced user capabilities, such as the incorporation of an adaptable release bracket.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include a distractor having a driver rod assembly with a support figured to provide superior coupling to a positioner pad, resulting in improved stability of the patient's limb during surgery.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include modular patient pad assemblies, which provide superior positioning, holding, and stability during surgery.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, a modular distractor system may include modular patient pad assemblies that provide superior coupling qualities at the pad-distractor interface, such that desirable positioning, holding, and stability may be obtained during surgery.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Non-limiting and non-exhaustive embodiments of the present disclosure are described with reference to the following drawings.

Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, adapter portion <b>110</b> may include an opening <b>118</b>, formed through at least a portion of the length thereof, i.e., formed from the first end <b>111</b> and extending downwardly toward the second end <b>116</b>. As will be further described below, the opening <b>118</b> may be configured to provide sufficient clearance for a driver rod <b>141</b> to pass through opening <b>118</b> so that, in operation, the distractor assembly <b>120</b> and distractor housing <b>130</b> can perform the function of raising and lowering which, in turn, performs the function of positioning, securely holding, and/or distracting the limb of the patient during surgery.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, a distractor assembly <b>120</b> may include components that fit within, and operably connect to, distractor housing <b>130</b>, in a manner that achieves the desired objective of raising, holding or lowering the position of a driver support <b>142</b> of driver assembly <b>140</b>, relative to the plane formed by the surface of the support and/or operating room table. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the distractor assembly <b>120</b> may comprise an extension bracket <b>121</b>, a release bracket <b>122</b>, one or more biasing elements such as a compression spring <b>123</b> for advancing the driver rod <b>141</b>, one or more biasing elements such as an extension spring <b>124</b> for selectively releasing the driver rod <b>141</b> from a fixed position, and a lever <b>125</b>. As illustrated in the accompanying description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, in operation the distractor assembly <b>120</b> achieves a desired effect of raising, holding, and/or lowering driver assembly <b>140</b> via operative communication with driver rod <b>141</b>. Driver rod <b>141</b> may be of uniform cross-sectional dimension, so that it is configured to pass through distractor housing <b>130</b>, and couple to the components comprising distractor assembly <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In operation, the surgeon may apply selective force to the lever <b>125</b> of modular distractor <b>100</b> to achieve a desirable effect. For example, in the assembled configuration demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, as specifically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an appropriate force may be applied along a contact portion <b>125</b><i>a </i>of lever <b>125</b>, causing level <b>125</b> to pivot about a pivot portion <b>125</b><i>b</i>. In an assembled configuration, lever <b>125</b> may operably couple to distractor housing <b>130</b> via a pivot pin <b>126</b>. The applied force thereby raises driver portion <b>125</b><i>c </i>that operably connects to change the angular orientation of the extension bracket <b>121</b> with respect to other components of the system, such as, for example, driver rod <b>141</b> and/or distractor housing <b>130</b>. Similarly, in the assembled configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an appropriate force may be applied along a contact release portion <b>122</b><i>c </i>of release bracket <b>122</b>, causing the same to pivot about a curved portion <b>122</b><i>b</i>. In effect, the applied force along contact release portion <b>122</b><i>c </i>changes the angular orientation of <b>122</b><i>a </i>with respect to other components of the system such as, for example, driver rod <b>141</b> and/or distractor housing <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The extension bracket <b>121</b> and the release bracket <b>122</b> each comprise openings configured to accept driver rod <b>141</b> along discrete locations of its length. When the extension bracket <b>121</b> and the release bracket <b>122</b> are disposed in a plane substantially normal, orthogonal and/or perpendicular to an axis formed by the length of the driver rod <b>141</b>, whereby each of the respective openings allow for uninhibited movement of the driver rod <b>141</b> therethrough. Equally, movement of the driver rod <b>141</b> is inhibiting by one or more edges of the openings in the extension bracket <b>121</b> and/or the release bracket <b>122</b> so as to operably couple to the driver rod <b>141</b> when either the extension bracket <b>121</b> or the release bracket <b>122</b> becomes disposed in a manner that is not substantially orthogonal to an axis of the driver rod <b>141</b>. The biasing elements of each of the compression and extension springs <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, respectively, operably apply forces on each of the extension bracket <b>121</b> and/or the release bracket <b>122</b> to facilitate movement actions of brackets <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, relative positioning of certain components comprising modular distractor <b>100</b> may be observed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows modular distractor <b>100</b> wherein driver support <b>142</b> is positioned at a first height, S<b>1</b>. First height S<b>1</b> represents a configuration where the height of driver assembly <b>140</b> may be sufficiently withdrawn to allow adequate clearance for the surgeon to install or otherwise position modular distractor <b>100</b>, in preparation for extending the same to achieve a holding or distracting position of the patient's limb. Here, neither extension bracket <b>121</b> nor release bracket <b>122</b> necessarily inhibit movement of driver assembly <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a force is applied along contact portion <b>125</b><i>a </i>in the direction indicated. Driver portion <b>125</b><i>c </i>then contacts a portion of extension bracket <b>121</b>, causing the same to change angular orientation. Edges of the opening formed by extension bracket <b>121</b> then operably communicate with driver rod <b>141</b>, causing driver support <b>142</b> to move by distance &#x394;<sub>1 </sub>to position S<b>2</b>, wherein modular distractor <b>100</b> is preloaded with a force F<sub>1</sub>. Force F<sub>1 </sub>acts generally normal to the surface formed by support top <b>142</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. In the preloaded position S<b>2</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, F<sub>1 </sub>acts in a downward direction, and is meant to represent the weight of the limb of the patient; however, the resultant force acting on modular distractor <b>100</b> may change depending on the height of driver support <b>142</b> when modular distractor <b>100</b> is under load, as may be affected by associated tensions and other external forces. Importantly, the motion of driver rod <b>141</b> caused by action of the lever <b>125</b> ensures that release bracket <b>122</b> decouples from driver rod <b>141</b>, so long as extension bracket <b>121</b> acts upon driver rod <b>141</b>. During this action, extension spring <b>124</b> acts upon release bracket <b>122</b> so that it assumes a substantially orthonormal position relative to the axis formed by the length of driver rod <b>141</b>. The process of pumping lever <b>125</b> may be repeated so that the desired holding and/or distracting position is achieved. Similarly, the level <b>125</b> may be only partially pumped, so that the desirable height is more finely-tuned.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, lever <b>125</b> reassumes the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, thus engaging release bracket <b>122</b> to maintain a position S<b>3</b> at a distance <b>43</b> while the modular distractor <b>100</b> remains under load F<b>1</b>. In this way, release bracket <b>122</b> provides a resistive, locking force of driver rod <b>141</b> sufficient to hold the modular distractor <b>100</b> at position S<sub>3</sub>. Notably, in this configuration extension bracket <b>121</b> becomes disengaged, or substantially orthonormal relative to the axis formed by the length of driver rod <b>141</b>, due to the force and positioning of compression spring <b>123</b>. In particular, compression spring <b>123</b> assures that extension bracket <b>121</b> reassumes its original position once level <b>125</b> is released, ensuring that bracket <b>121</b> disengages with driver rod <b>141</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, release bracket <b>122</b> is engaged by applying a force along the contact release portion <b>122</b><i>c </i>in the direction indicated. In this configuration, while modular distractor <b>100</b> remains under a force F<sub>1</sub>, driver assembly <b>140</b> is retracted from its height at position S<b>3</b> to a different location. As may be desirable at a certain stage of the operation, once the patient's limb has been maintained in a distracted position and the work completed at position S<b>2</b>, modular distractor <b>100</b> may be released so that the patient's limb can assume its natural position. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, both brackets <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> maintain substantially orthonormal orientations, thereby allowing free movement of driver rod <b>141</b> through driver housing <b>130</b> and driver assembly <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref> may be described in terms of method steps typically illustrative of that which may be desirable in a surgical application. In a first step <b>400</b>, modular distractor <b>100</b> may be configured to position driver support <b>142</b> at a height S<b>1</b>, corresponding to a sufficiently retracted position to install/assemble modular distractor <b>100</b> about a limb of a patient, in preparation for surgery. In a second step <b>401</b>, distractor module <b>100</b> may be pumped, by applying a force, in the direction indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, about contact portion <b>125</b><i>c</i>, resulting in an outward/upward movement of driver support <b>142</b> such that modular distractor <b>100</b> becomes subject to a force F<sub>1</sub>, located at a position S<b>1</b> at a distance &#x394;<sub>1</sub>. In a third step <b>402</b>, modular distractor <b>100</b> may be configured to maintain a position S<b>3</b> at a distance &#x394;<sub>2 </sub>(from S<b>2</b>) or a distance &#x394;<sub>3 </sub>(from S<b>1</b>), the position S<b>3</b> corresponding to a holding, supporting or distracting position of the patient limb. In a fourth step <b>403</b>, modular distractor <b>100</b> may be configured such that contact release portion <b>122</b><i>c </i>of release bracket <b>122</b> is depressed in the direction indicated, thereby releasing driver rod <b>141</b> from a holding position, resulting in a lowering, or contracting, of modular distractor <b>100</b> and of driver support <b>142</b> in particular.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>17</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment of the distractor housing <b>130</b> of the modular distractor <b>100</b>. In general, distractor housing <b>130</b> is configured to easily disassemble, sterilize, and reassemble the components coupled thereto, which may include the adapter portion <b>110</b>, the component comprising the distractor assembly <b>120</b> and the driver assembly <b>140</b>. The distractor housing <b>130</b> therefore provides a design having smooth transitions, such as chamfered and/or filleted edges that work to minimizes residual bacterial deposits that may accumulate due to the modular distractor <b>100</b> being within the sterile field of surgery. It should be observed that all components comprising modular distractor <b>100</b> employ similar design feature. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, distractor housing <b>130</b> therefore may comprise a distractor body <b>131</b> including first and second body cavity portions <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>, respectively. And as most easily seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, body cavity portions <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> provide for easy insertion and assembly of distractor assembly <b>120</b>, including compression spring <b>123</b>, extension spring <b>124</b>, extension bracket <b>121</b>, release bracket <b>122</b>, and driver rod <b>141</b>, which may be threaded therethrough. An indicator arrow shown on distractor body <b>131</b> may aid the user by illustrating a functional direction to ensure proper assembly of modular distractor <b>100</b> after sterilization, or in preparation for use.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As can be seen at various orientations throughout <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, additional openings within distractor housing <b>130</b> provide access to, and positioning of, other components of distractor assembly <b>120</b>.

Importantly, these features of lower opening <b>136</b> complement features of adapter portion <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. Shelf portion <b>117</b> may couple to the lower extent of distractor body <b>131</b> to help ensure cross-threading does not occur, and/or to provide additional stability to the coupled components <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, once assembled.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> illustrate the distractor housing <b>130</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>17</b></figref> also show at various locations a driver rod profile <b>139</b>, which may be configured to confine a driver rod <b>141</b> to a single degree of freedom when it is assembled within distractor housing <b>130</b>. Advantageously, driver rod <b>141</b> may take any shape, such as substantially square as shown, or cylindrical. In a cylindrical embodiment, distractor body <b>131</b> would employ cylindrical driver rod profiles <b>139</b> to constrain driver rod <b>141</b> to two degrees of freedom. In the embodiment shown, driver rod profile <b>139</b> may be partially embedded within upper opening <b>135</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>12</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, within the interstitial space separating first and second body cavity portions <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, and within lower opening <b>136</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b>, and <b>16</b>-<b>17</b></figref>.

Applying the principle of kinematic constraint, this arrangement accomplishes the precise number of contact points needed to allow the desired degree of freedom without over-constraining the driver assembly <b>140</b>, which minimizes the potential for structural rigidity issues to arise, due to, for instance, errors from manufacturing tolerances.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>22</b></figref>, certain aspects of the driver assembly <b>140</b> and positioner pad assembly <b>150</b> are shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows that driver assembly <b>140</b> may comprise driver rod <b>141</b> and driver support <b>142</b> rigidly affixed thereto.
