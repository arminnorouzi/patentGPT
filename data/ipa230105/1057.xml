Especially in cardiovascular diseases, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is currently the main treatment regimen. A drug eluting stent (DES) is still the first choice for PCI. An implantation of DES may prevent blood vessels from rebounding, and an anti-hyperplasia drug loaded on the DES can inhibit a hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells, prevent an intimal hyperplasia, and effectively reduce an incidence of in-stent restenosis. Since the &#x201c;Sequent Please&#x201d; of B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany, was launched in 2004, the drug coated balloon (DCB), as a new interventional treatment technology, has been confirmed by a number of clinical trials for its efficacy and safety in various coronary artery stenosis, small vessel disease, bifurcation disease, etc. The surface of the drug-coated balloon is uniformly coated with anti-hyperplasia drugs. After the drug-coated balloon is delivered to a lesion site, the drug-coated balloon releases the drug within a short expansion time (in a range from 30 s to 60 s) to inhibit the hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells. Due to the advantages of the drug-coated balloon, such as no implantation during intervention, no risk of thrombosis, and rapid treatment effect, the drug-coated balloon is getting more and more attention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, an amorphous drug coating is commonly used in the drug-loaded implantable medical device. However, a retention time of the drug released by the drug-loaded implantable medical device in the tissue is very short, so that it is difficult to effectively inhibit the hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells. Although an crystalline drug coating is capable of delaying the release and has an ideal retention time in the tissue, the existing crystalline drug coating has disadvantages that a crystal size is large, the drug is easily broken and dropped when being folded and pressed, and the crystalline drug coating is not easy to fall off the surface of balloon.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, a drug-loaded implantable medical device and a method for preparing the same are provided.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A drug-loaded implantable medical device includes a device body, a hydrophilic coating carried on the device body, and crystalline drug particles carried on the hydrophilic coating.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the hydrophilic coating includes a graft polymer containing photo-cross-linking groups.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the graft polymer containing photo-cross-linking groups is prepared by a graft reaction of a photo-cross-linking monomer and a first polymer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The photo-cross-linking monomer is at least one of an acrylate-based photo-cross-linking monomer and an acrylamide-based photo-cross-linking monomer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first polymer is a hydrophilic polymer with a side chain containing at least one repeating functional group of hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, and amino group.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the first polymer is selected from at least one of chitosan, dextran, hyaluronic acid, sodium alginate, polyacrylic acid, carbomer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, poly (N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide), polyarginine, polylysine, and polyaspartate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the photo-cross-linking monomer is selected from at least one of acrylate, acrylamide and methacrylate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the hydrophilic coating includes a block copolymer formed by a graft polymer containing photo-cross-linking groups and a second polymer.
