An AP functions as a standalone entity in some implementations and functions in cooperation with distribution hardware in other implementations. Distribution hardware may include a wireless switch used to manage APs and provide network-connectivity to wireless clients. A wireless domain may refer to a group of wireless switches that are configured to exchange relevant information, and using this information make informed decisions. A known device is a station (e.g., a wireless AP or client device) that is part of a network wireless installation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Trapeze Networks, Inc (Trapeze), uses a MOBILITY POINT&#x2122; (MP&#xae;) APs in a MOBILITY DOMAIN&#x2122; wireless domain. An MP&#xae; AP is coupled to a MOBILITY EXCHANGE&#xae; (MX&#xae;) wireless switch. Trapeze uses MOBILITY DOMAIN&#x2122; to refer to a collection of MX&#xae; switches. This collection of MX&#xae; switches shares RF environment and station association information. This information is used by the MX&#xae; switches to support features including by way of example but not limitation roaming, auto channel selection, rogue AP detection, intrusion detection and/or the launching of countermeasures. Some additional details regarding the Trapeze-specific implementation is provided by way of example but not limitation, including novel features that are discussed later in this application, in the provisional application to which this application claims priority.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a typical implementation, APs are coupled to a switch via a wire. Implementations that include untethered APs (UAPs), introduce additional configuration difficulties that are only recently being explored. This is an area that is ripe for experimentation and innovation because it has proven challenging to find a way to scale wireless domains using UAPs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These are but a subset of the problems and issues associated with wireless access point authentication, and are intended to characterize weaknesses in the prior art by way of example. The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification and a study of the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described and illustrated in conjunction with systems, tools, and methods that are meant to be exemplary and illustrative, not limiting in scope. In various embodiments, one or more of the above-described problems have been reduced or eliminated, while other embodiments are directed to other improvements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A technique for implementing an untethered access point (UAP) mesh involves enabling AP-local switching at one or more UAPs of the mesh. A system constructed according to the technique may include a wireless switch; an access point (AP) wire-coupled to the wireless switch; and a UAP mesh, wirelessly coupled to the AP, including a UAP with an AP-local switching engine embodied in a computer-readable medium. The system may or may not further include a wired backbone coupled to a wired network including the wireless switch. The UAP mesh may or may not be self-healing. A spanning-tree algorithm may or may not be embodied in a computer readable medium of the UAP mesh. The wireless switch may or may not include an authorization engine, embodied in a computer-readable medium, for acting in concert with an anchoring AP to authorize a downstream station. The AP-local switching engine may or may not make use of a station switching record (SSR) stored the UAP.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another system constructed according to the technique may include an untethered access point (UAP), including: a radio; a backhaul service set identifier (SSID) stored in a computer-readable medium; an anchor access point (AAP) selection engine embodied in a computer-readable medium. In operation, the AAP selection engine may use the radio to attempt to associate with the AAP if a beaconed backhaul SSID matches the stored backhaul SSID. The UAP may or may not further include a bootable image stored in a computer readable medium, wherein, in operation, the UAP boots up using the bootable image. The UAP may or may not use regulatory domain information to ensure the UAP is operating within regulatory limits before receiving a complete configuration. The AAP selection engine may or may not listen for a beacon from an AAP that includes the backhaul SSID. The AAP may or may not include a backhaul SSID stored in a computer-readable medium. The AAP may or may not include an authentication engine embodied in a computer-readable medium, wherein, in operation, the authentication engine works in concert with upstream components to authenticate the UAP. The AAP may or may not include a backhaul radio; a backhaul radio and service profile stored in a computer-readable medium; wherein, in operation, when the UAP is associated to the AAP, the backhaul radio sends messages from the UAP upstream using the backhaul radio and service profile. The AAP may or may not be configured to anchor the UAP and a limited number of additional UAPs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method according to the technique may include beaconing with a backhaul SSID; acting in concert with an upstream switch as an authenticator for a downstream station that responds to the beacon; providing limited local switching functionality for the downstream station. The method may or may not further include sending a station switching record (SSR) from the upstream switch to the downstream station; receiving the SSR from the downstream station; storing the SSR locally and sending the SSR upstream to a next upstream hop. The method may or may not further include receiving in an initial configuration the backhaul SSID; listening for a beacon with the backhaul SSID; attempting to associate with an anchoring AP that is beaconing with the backhaul SSID; if association is successful, receiving a station switching record (SSR) from the upstream switch, storing the SSR locally, and passing the SSR upstream.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The proposed system can offer, among other advantages, improved wireless domain scaling capabilities. This and other advantages of the techniques described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following descriptions and a study of the several figures of the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the figures.

Thus, the &#x201c;wireless&#x201d; switch could be thought of, depending upon the implementation, as a switch for wireless traffic to and/or from a wired network. The wireless switch <b>104</b> is not necessarily wirelessly connected to anything. Each of the APs <b>106</b> could be wire coupled to respective switches such that each switch is wire coupled to only a single AP. So, although the one or more APs <b>106</b> is depicted as a plurality in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that the number of APs per switch is implementation-and/or embodiment-specific. An AP and the wireless switch <b>104</b> could be combined into a single device. However, in this description, the functionality of an AP is differentiated from the functionality of a switch by acting as if the APs and the wireless switches are distinct devices.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The wireless switch <b>104</b> may or may not have all of the tools to manage wireless stations and the UAP mesh locally. For example, there may be additional management (e.g., AAA servers) further upstream from the wireless switch <b>104</b>. Since it is not critical where these services take place beyond the wireless switch <b>104</b>, for illustrative simplicity, it is assumed that the wireless switch <b>104</b> handles all of these functions, either locally or by utilizing upstream components. For this reasons, the figures (other than <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) do not depict components further upstream from the wireless switch <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Wireless data may include, by way of example but not limitation, station association data and RF environment data. The station and RF data is used by the wireless switches <b>104</b> to support features including, by way of example but not limitation, roaming, auto channel selection, rogue AP detection, intrusion detection and the launching of countermeasures. The wireless switch <b>104</b> may share wireless data with other wireless switches (not shown).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The wireless switch <b>104</b> controls the APs <b>106</b> (and the APs in the UAP mesh <b>108</b>). In an embodiment, the APs <b>106</b> include radio transmitters and receivers (e.g., transceivers) that are used to provide wireless network connectivity for users and station access to the functions of the wireless switch <b>104</b>. Within an IEEE 802.11 context, a station is any IEEE 802.11 entity or the equivalent in other related standards, and it may be roaming or stationary. It should be noted that this definition may include APs.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of the APs <b>106</b> anchors at least a portion of the UAP mesh <b>108</b> to the wired network. The APs <b>106</b> may be treated as border devices between the wireless switch <b>104</b> (or other upstream components of the system <b>100</b>) and the UAP mesh <b>108</b>. This enables more efficient use of wireless resources because proxy address resolution protocol (proxy ARP) may be used to enable the Aps <b>106</b> to answer ARP requests on behalf of a remote device (e.g., a UAP for which an AP serves as an anchor to the wireless switch <b>104</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the UAP mesh <b>108</b> is intended to depict a plurality of potentially discrete APs that do not have a wired connection to the wireless switch <b>104</b> or to the APs <b>106</b>. That is why the APs in the wireless mesh are referred to as &#x201c;untethered.&#x201d; Any station in the UAP mesh <b>108</b>, whether a UAP or some other wireless station, is anchored to the wireless switch <b>104</b> by the AP <b>106</b> and zero or more UAPs that make up a chain of nodes from the station to the AP <b>106</b>. An AP that is closer to the wireless switch <b>104</b> in the chain may be referred to as anchoring downstream stations. For any given station, the path from the station to the wireless switch <b>104</b> may be referred to as a spanning tree because the UAP mesh <b>108</b> should not allow loops for traffic passing between a station and the wireless switch <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When a UAP in the UAP mesh <b>108</b> is brought online, it will attempt to reach the wireless switch <b>104</b> through a path that is optimal. (Note: Although an optimal path is desired, it may or may not be accomplished in practice, depending upon the implemented algorithm and/or environmental factors). There are multiple metrics for measuring the distance of a UAP from one of the APs <b>106</b>. For example, the metric may be time. That is, the amount of time it takes for a packet to travel between the UAP and the AP anchoring the UAP. Although such a metric may work fine, it will typically vary depending upon environmental factors, such as traffic congestion or degraded received signal strength. For simplicity, the metric used herein is the number of hops between the UAP and the anchoring AP (AAP), with the understanding that this is but one of many potential metrics. Thus, if a UAP is one hop away from the AAP, the UAP may be referred to as a one-hop UAP. In general, a UAP may be referred to as an N-hop UAP where the UAP is N hops from the AAP.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Advantageously, UAPs of the UAP mesh <b>108</b> may include an AP-local switching engine embodied in a computer-readable medium. An AP-local switching engine may make use of a station switching record (SSR) to determine how to switch a given message unit (e.g., a packet, frame, datagram, etc.). This enables at least some traffic to be efficiently switched within the UAP mesh <b>108</b>. Moreover, advantageously, some traffic may be tunneled back to a switch, while other traffic is locally switched. Which traffic is tunneled back, and which traffic is locally switched, is an implementation-specific decision that becomes available by using the teachings described herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be appreciated in light of the description provided herein that although aspects of the invention are described relative to IEEE 802.11 standards, and that certain embodiments have particular features that are implemented within the 802.11 context, the invention itself is not limited to 802.11 networks and may generally be applied to any applicable wireless network; and to the extent that future technological enhancements might obscure the distinctions between wireless switches, APs, and/or stations, the invention is understood to include components providing the features of such switches, APs, and stations independently of how they are packaged, combined, or labeled.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an illustrative embodiment, the UAP mesh <b>108</b> is created from a spanning tree. Each station in the UAP mesh <b>108</b> attempts to reach the wireless switch <b>104</b> along an optimal path. Assuming the optimal path is measured in the number of hops to the wire, if a first station's traffic passes through a UAP and along a path from there to the wire, a second station's traffic that passes through the UAP will take the same path from there to the wire. Since all stations take the optimal path, the stations may be represented as edge nodes of a tree where the AP at the wire is the root node. Thus, the AP mesh acts as a spanning tree for each station. It may be noted that the spanning tree is greedy at each node, which naturally results in an efficient (perhaps even optimized) tree flow.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an example of a subtree <b>200</b> of a UAP mesh. The subtree <b>200</b> includes an anchor AP (AAP) <b>202</b>, and one or more UAPs <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>204</b>-N (referred to collectively as UAPs <b>204</b>). The path upstream from the AAP <b>202</b> to the switch may include no hops, if the AAP <b>202</b> is a (tethered) AP; one hop, if the AAP <b>202</b> is wirelessly coupled directly to a (tethered) AP, or a chain of UAP nodes; or multiple hops, if the path from the AAP <b>202</b> to the switch includes a chain of UAPs. The path downstream from the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> may include multiple jumps, as well. However, it should be noted that if the stations are not wirelessly coupled directly to the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b>, the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> is actually an AAP (i.e., the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> would be anchoring downstream UAPs).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the AAP <b>202</b> includes a backhaul radio <b>210</b> and memory <b>212</b>. The number of UAPs <b>204</b> that are anchored by the AAP <b>202</b> may be implementation- or embodiment-specific. For example, a particular installation may limit the number of UAPs <b>204</b> to, e.g., five.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The backhaul radio <b>210</b> may be a radio that is dedicated to transmitting data associated with the UAPs <b>204</b>. Whether the radio is dedicated to backhauling is an implementation-specific decision. Since there may be multiple radio and SSID configurations per radio-profile, the radio may be used to perform both the backhaul function and other, e.g., 802.11 services. However, it is expected that many customers who implement backhaul services will dedicate a radio to backhaul services because the backhaul link is an important one. In an illustrative embodiment, the backhaul radio <b>210</b> is capable of passive scan and active scan. However, it should be noted that in some implementations, best practice may advice against active scan. The channel and power settings are often hard configured so auto-tuning may not be available and may even be undesirable. The ability to change the backhaul channel and force all UAPs to do likewise without dropping any sessions would potentially make auto-tuning more viable. The AAP <b>202</b> may or may not include one or more radios (not shown) in addition to the backhaul radio <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The memory <b>212</b> includes a plurality of modules, some of which are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for illustrative purposes. A processor (not shown) is coupled to the memory <b>212</b> in a manner that is well-known in the relevant arts. The memory <b>212</b> is intended to represent any of a plurality of known or convenient computer-readable mediums, including non-volatile storage, RAM, flash memory, cache, etc. Any applicable computer-readable medium may be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the memory <b>212</b> includes a backhaul radio and service profile module <b>214</b>, a backhaul service set identifier (SSID) <b>216</b>, and an authentication engine <b>218</b>. The backhaul radio and service profile module <b>214</b> includes data to be used in association with the backhaul. The backhaul SSID <b>216</b> identifies the support network. The authentication engine <b>218</b> facilitates authentication of wireless stations (including UAPs). In an illustrative embodiment, the authentication engine <b>218</b> authenticates a station in concert with a switch or other upstream component. The station or upstream component may assist in the authentication &#x201c;on the fly&#x201d; when a wireless station attempts to associate with the AAP <b>202</b>, or in advance for a pre-authorized wireless station. In an embodiment that does not have (or has more limited) centralized management, the authentication engine <b>218</b> could even be configured to authenticate without the assistance of a switch or other upstream component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The AAP <b>202</b> may be configured to beacon the backhaul SSID <b>216</b>. The service profile is then associated to a radio profile and AP following known or convenient conventions. Since backhaul services will be applied to specific APs in at least one embodiment, general AP-configuration policies (such as auto-dap templates) that can apply to unspecific APs are not enabled in this embodiment. They may be enabled in other embodiments, however.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> includes a radio <b>220</b> and memory <b>222</b>.

The radio <b>220</b> may or may not be a dedicated backhaul radio. The value of making the radio <b>220</b> into a dedicated backhaul radio diminishes if the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> is at the edge of a UAP mesh (e.g., when there are no downstream UAPs), though the value may or may not be diminished to zero.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The memory <b>222</b> includes regulatory domain information <b>224</b>, a backhaul SSID <b>226</b>, a bootable image <b>228</b>, and an AAP selection engine <b>230</b>. The regulatory domain information <b>224</b> provides information to the UAP about allowed broadcast parameters for a given region. The CLI to preconfigure a DAP for untethered operation may include the SSID of the anchor AP and a preshared key (not shown). When the UAP is configured with the backhaul SSID <b>226</b>, the regulatory domain information <b>224</b> should probably be stored in, e.g., flash, as well (as shown). This prevents the UAP from operating outside of the regulatory limits before it receives its complete configuration from the switch. It must be clearly documented that when prestaging UAPs, the regulatory and antenna information is correct and reflects the actual deployment to avoid regulatory violations. The regulatory domain information may be updated with a running configuration.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The bootable image <b>228</b> enables the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> to be deployed with the same services as the AAP <b>202</b> (though performance could be adversely impacted by the radio link). When the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> is up and running, the boot configuration associated with the bootable image <b>228</b> may be changed. When the boot configuration is changed, the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> must be reset for the changes to take effect. It is not always desirable to allow the boot configuration to change. For example, it is possible for a UAP to find a switch running a software version that does not support untethered APs. When the UAP sees than an older version of software is trying to manage it, the UAP may choose to reboot so as to protect its untethered-capable running image. (This may further require that the anchor AP generate a log message when a radio link is created or destroyed so that link flapping can be identified and, hopefully, remedied.)</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The AAP selection engine <b>230</b> enables the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> to select an AAP from a plurality of potential AAPs. Any known or convenient algorithm may be implemented to choose an AAP. For example, the AAP may be selected by comparing relative signal strengths and choosing the strongest. Alternatively or in addition, each AAP could broadcast an estimated time to wire, or number of hops to wire, which the AAP selection engine <b>230</b> can use to choose an optimal AAP. In a non-limiting embodiment, the implemented algorithm is greedy at the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a non-limiting embodiment, if the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> is unable to associate with the AAP <b>202</b>, the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> may beacon an SOS signal, including its serial number. The beacon signal is (hopefully) received at an AP, and sent to the wired network for processing (e.g., at a wireless switch). If appropriate, the upstream component may provide the AAP <b>202</b> (or some other AP within range of the UAP <b>204</b>-<b>2</b>) with data and/or instructions to facilitate an association.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a flowchart <b>300</b> of an example of a method for linking a UAP to an AAP. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the flowchart <b>300</b> starts at module <b>302</b> where a UAP listens for a beacon with a correct SSID. To know whether an SSID is correct, the UAP must either have the SSID stored in memory, or be informed in some other manner. The UAP will associate to the AAP, at which point (or perhaps after authentication) the UAP will have layer 2 connectivity to the AAP. In order for the associated radio link to be established, the AAP acts as an anchor point and the UAP acts as a client device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the flowchart <b>300</b> continues to module <b>304</b> where the AAP acts as an authenticator in concert with a switch to authenticate the UAP. Implementation of this technique may be based on wpa_supplicant under a BSD license including minimum eap methods. Although wpa_supplicant and WPA-PSK may be used to authenticate, this is an implementation-specific choice; any known or convenient technique that works for the intended purpose may be used.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the flowchart <b>300</b> continues to module <b>306</b> where OAP operations are carried out.

At this point, the flowchart <b>300</b> ends, though if the OAP operations end, the flowchart <b>300</b> could resume at any point (i.e., module <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, or <b>306</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a diagram <b>400</b> illustrating a UAP linking to an existing wireless network. The diagram <b>400</b> includes a switch <b>402</b>, an AAP <b>404</b>, and a UAP <b>406</b>. The switch <b>402</b> may be similar to the wireless switch <b>104</b> (FIG. I). The break <b>408</b> is intended to represent the case where the AAP <b>404</b> is untethered so that there are additional nodes (e.g., a tethered AP) between the AAP <b>404</b> and the switch <b>402</b>. However, in an alternative, the AAP <b>404</b> may itself be a tethered AP wire connected to the switch <b>402</b>. The UAP <b>406</b> is initially not linked to the AAP <b>404</b>, but becomes linked as described below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The UAP <b>406</b> is 1) configured with a backhaul SSID. While this is not a strict requirement, it is a convenience for those who are responsible for installing or placing the UAP within a UAP mesh. Conceivably, the UAP could be configured to receive an SSID over the air or acquire an SSID in some other manner.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The UAP <b>406</b> is powered up and 2) listens for a beacon with a backhaul SSID. Again, this is not a strict requirement. It is believed to be more convenient to have the UAP <b>406</b> listen for a beacon than to have the UAP initiate a link prior to or instead of receiving a beacon. This is at least in part due to standard practice in 802.11 systems, though such a practice may not be prevalent or even desired in other wireless systems.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The AAP <b>404</b> 3) broadcasts a beacon with the backhaul SSID. The backhaul SSID may be preconfigured at the AAP <b>404</b> or could be received at the AAP <b>404</b> from the switch at boot time or after.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The UAP <b>406</b> 4) attempts to associate with the AAP <b>404</b> upon matching the broadcast backhaul SSID with the backhaul SSID stored locally. It may be noted that the backhaul SSID of the UAP <b>406</b> is assumed to be the same as that of the broadcast backhaul SSID. However, there may be other UAPs that are within range of the AAP <b>404</b> that have different backhaul SSIDs (perhaps associated with a different AAP). Also, a single AAP could conceivably have multiple backhaul radios, each associated with a different backhaul SSID, or even a single backhaul radio associated with multiple backhaul SSIDs.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The AAP <b>404</b> 5) authenticates the UAP <b>406</b> in concert with the switch <b>402</b>. The UAP <b>406</b> may be able to form a layer 2 connection with the AAP <b>404</b> when it associates, but the AAP <b>404</b> will likely not allow traffic to flow upstream until authentication is complete. While this is not a strict requirement, wireless resources are often relatively scarce, so, in an effort to conserve resources in the case where the UAP <b>406</b> is unable to be authenticated, it may be desirable to restrict traffic flow until authentication is complete.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The switch <b>402</b> 6) generates an SSR for the UAP <b>406</b>. Since the AAP <b>404</b> authenticates the UAP <b>406</b> in concert with the switch <b>402</b>, the switch <b>402</b> knows about the UAP <b>406</b>. So the switch <b>402</b> is capable of producing an SSR for the UAP <b>406</b>. In an embodiment, the SSR includes data associated with authorized stations and access control list (ACL) filters. An ACL refers to rules that typically detail service ports or the like that are available on a host or other layer 3 device, each with a list of hosts and/or networks permitted to use the service. ACLs can be configured to control upstream and downstream traffic. (In this context, they are similar to firewalls.) Typically, servers and routers have network ACLs, but in an illustrative embodiment, ACL rules are provided to APs. The SSR enables the UAP <b>406</b> to switch at least some traffic, thereby reducing the amount of traffic that has to be switched higher upstream. Advantageously, this pushes message filtering to the edges (or root) of the UAP mesh.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The switch <b>402</b> 7) forms a control channel <b>410</b> to the UAP <b>406</b>. It should be noted that the control channel <b>410</b> may simply be a virtual &#x201c;tunnel&#x201d; in that tables at each hop along the path to the UAP <b>406</b> identify the next hop. This is advantageous because it avoids flooding the UAP mesh, which is wasteful of wireless resources. It should be noted that the control channel <b>410</b> is not a &#x201c;tunnel&#x201d; in the traditional sense because a tunnel is used to carry user data, which is not necessarily the case here.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The switch <b>402</b> 8) sends the SSR to the UAP <b>406</b> via the control channel <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The AAP <b>404</b> 9) unicasts the SSR to the UAP <b>406</b>. In a non-limiting embodiment, this type of action actually occurs at each hop along the path. The SSR is &#x201c;unicast&#x201d; because the AAP <b>404</b> knows that the destination of the message is the UAP <b>406</b>, and any other UAPs (now shown) that are listening to the AAP <b>404</b> know the destination is not them or downstream from them.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The UAP <b>406</b> 10) receives the SSR and propagates the SSR upstream. That is, the SSR is stored at the UAP <b>406</b>, then sent to the next hop closer to the switch <b>402</b>. Traffic associated with the UAP <b>406</b> can travel upstream as the SSR is propagated.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The AAP <b>404</b> 11) receives the SSR and propagates the SSR upstream. This occurs at other nodes along the UAP chain up to and including the anchoring (tethered) AP.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an example of a system <b>500</b>, including a self-healing UAP mesh. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the system <b>500</b> includes a switch <b>502</b>, an AP <b>504</b>, UAPs <b>506</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>506</b>-<b>2</b> (referred to collectively as &#x201c;one-hop UAPs <b>506</b>&#x201d;), UAPs <b>508</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> (referred to collectively as &#x201c;two-hop UAPs <b>508</b>&#x201d;), UAPs <b>510</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> (referred to collectively as &#x201c;three-hop UAPs <b>510</b>&#x201d;), a UAP <b>512</b>, a station <b>520</b>, and a station <b>522</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Initially, it is assumed that each UAP is authenticated and has a valid SSR. The SSRs facilitate at least some switching capability within the UAP mesh. For example, if the station <b>520</b> sends a packet to the station <b>522</b>, the packet travels upstream to the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>1</b>, then to the UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b>. The UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b> knows that the destination (station <b>522</b>) is downstream. Accordingly, rather than sending the packet upstream to the switch <b>502</b>, the UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b> makes use of the limited data included in the SSR to send the packet downstream to the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b>, which sends the packet to the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b>, which sends the packet to the UAP <b>512</b>, which sends the packet to the station <b>522</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The UAP mesh is self-healing in that if a node goes down, only the affected UAPs need to update.

When the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> goes down, it causes several problems, including 1) the station <b>522</b> is no longer associated with a UAP that can forward messages to and from the station <b>522</b>; 2) the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> and other upstream nodes (e.g., the UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b>) have incorrect data.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Problem 1) can be remedied in the following manner.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">1.1) The UAP <b>512</b> detects a link failure between itself and the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> because, for the purpose of example, the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> is assumed to have gone down.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">1.2) The UAP <b>512</b> establishes a link with the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b>.

It may be noted that the UAP <b>512</b> may have multiple choices of UAPs, though in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, only the available UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b> is depicted. (Presumably, if one of the two-hop UAPs <b>508</b> were within range of the UAP <b>512</b>, the UAP <b>512</b> would not have been linked with the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b>, which is a three-hop UAP. Accordingly, it is assumed that only the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b> is in range of the UAP <b>512</b>.)</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">1.3) The UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b> sends a message to the switch <b>502</b>, alerting the switch <b>502</b> that a new SSR is needed because the station <b>522</b>-and any other stations downstream from UAP <b>512</b> (not shown)&#x2014;is now reachable via a new path.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">1.4) The switch <b>502</b> sends an SSR downstream to the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b>. Relevant data from the SSR is propagated at each node, either as the SSR is passed down or by propagation upstream from the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b>, as has been described previously. Depending upon the implementation and/or embodiment, since the UAP <b>512</b> already knows about each station associated with it, and can update upstream routing data locally, the UAP <b>512</b> need not necessarily receive the newly sent SSR because the downstream paths remain unbroken, and the upstream path is established through the link to the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It may be noted that part of problem 2 is already solved in addressing problem 1. Specifically, the UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b> has been updated correctly as the SSR is propagated at each node (if applicable). However, the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> still includes incorrect data. Problem 2 can be fully remedied in the following manner:</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">2.1) The UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> detects a link failure between itself and the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">2.2) The UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> waits for a timeout period. Waiting for a timeout period may be important for ensuring that the station <b>522</b> maintains connectivity with the switch <b>502</b>. Specifically, if the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> deletes the data associated with the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> (and therefore data associated with downstream nodes, including the UAP <b>512</b> and the station <b>522</b>), and sends the update upstream, upstream nodes will also delete the data. Eventually the update will reach the switch <b>502</b>, which will update records to show that stations downstream from the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b>, including the station <b>522</b>, are now disassociated. By waiting for a timeout period, the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b> can update appropriately, before any disassociation, to ensure continuous connectivity (and, e.g., a smooth handoff).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">2.3) The UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> deletes the data associated with the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> (necessarily including data associated with the station <b>522</b>). Since the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> waited for a timeout period, the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b> has presumably updated the switch <b>502</b>, and an SSR and/or other data has been propagated along the path between the switch <b>502</b> and the UAP <b>512</b>. Accordingly, the UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b>&#x2014;and, more generally, all APs on the path between the UAP <b>512</b> and the switch <b>502</b>&#x2014;will have current data. Therefore, it is not desirable for the update from the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> (deleting the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b> and nodes downstream from UAP <b>510</b>-<b>2</b>) to be implemented at any of the newly updated nodes because the update will or could (depending upon the implementation) delete good data. In an illustrative embodiment, sequence numbers for updates may be used. Specifically, the sequence number associated with the deletion of the data at the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> should be before the sequence number associated with the update at the UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b>. In this way, when the UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b> receives an update from the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>2</b> to delete data, the UAP <b>506</b>-<b>1</b> can check the sequence number of the update and, noticing that the sequence number is before the sequence number associated with the latest update, ignore the update. Advantageously, when a UAP notices that the sequence number comes before a most recent update, the UAP can drop the old update; all upstream nodes will have the correct data so the update need not be passed upstream.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">After the UAP <b>512</b> is linked back into the UAP mesh via the link <b>530</b>, the switching functionality of the mesh is also updated. So, if the station <b>520</b> sends a packet to the station <b>522</b>, the packet may be sent up to the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>1</b>, which recognizes that the station <b>522</b> is downstream. Then the UAP <b>508</b>-<b>1</b> sends the packet downstream to UAP <b>510</b>-<b>1</b>, which sends the packet to the UAP <b>512</b>, which sends the packet to the station <b>522</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein, an AP may refer to a standard (tethered) AP or to a UAP. Where a distinction should be drawn, an AP may be referred to as a &#x201c;(tethered) AP&#x201d; or a &#x201c;UAP,&#x201d; as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As used herein, the term &#x201c;embodiment&#x201d; means an embodiment that serves to illustrate by way of example but not limitation.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It will be appreciated to those skilled in the art that the preceding examples and embodiments are exemplary and not limiting to the scope of the present invention.
