Incomplete cleaning will affect surface qualities of key parts, and even lead to an oil pollution of a whole machine, which seriously affects the reliability, safety and service life of a product.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cleaning of heavy oil stains, paints, carbon deposits and rust on the surfaces of the parts is a technical problem in the industry: with a high viscosity, the heavy oil stain is composed of grease, sediment and wear debris, and accumulated in portions such as steps and pits which are difficult to be cleaned; the composition of the paint is complex, with a thickness of 0.05 to 0.15 mm and a high bonding strength with the matrix, so it is resistant to the conventional ultrasonic and jet cleaning; the carbon deposit is a complex colloidal carbon generated through a chemical reaction and an adhesion process when fuel oil is combusted, and it is an extremely hard mixture which is difficult to be dissolved by a solvent; and the rust is caused by a surface corrosion of a metal matrix, and a mechanical removal thereof can easily damage the surface qualities of the precision parts. In addition, in most cases, a pollution layer on a surface of a part appears in a form of mixture, which greatly increases the difficulty of cleaning. It is not easy to solve the problem just by a single cleaning method, while it is more difficult to clean pollution layers of inner holes and special-shaped surfaces. At present, the commonly used methods for removing the oil stains, paints, carbon deposits and rust usually adopt a plurality of combined procedures such as high-pressure water jet cleaning, steam cleaning, high-temperature roasting, sand blasting, shot blasting, chemical cleaning, manual grinding, etc. The procedures are complicated, and the production coordination is poor. In addition, the cleaning effect is poor and the cleaning efficiency is low for the multi-pollution layers, which can easily damage the matrix, and cause noise, dust and even chemical pollutions. It is clear that the traditional cleaning technology is far from meeting the requirement of cleaning the multi-pollution layers of the key parts.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided a workpiece cleaning device, comprising:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">a frame;

On the one hand, a surface cleanliness of the workpiece meets the assembly requirement by ultrasonic cleaning, and on the other hand, a very thin protective film is formed on the surface of the workpiece under the action of the anti-rust liquid, so that the workpiece can obtain an anti-rust effect, while the cleaning efficiency can be improved by properly adjusting the ultrasonic power and the cleaning temperature. The cleaned workpiece may be dried naturally or by a dry airflow.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In step a, the organic pollution layer is cleaned by adopting a special alkaline molten salt combination formula, and the first predetermined temperature for cleaning the workpiece should not be higher than 350&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In step b, before entering the first rinsing tank <b>5</b>, the workpiece should be cooled to about 150&#xb0; C. to prevent liquid droplets from splashing due to the high temperature of the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In step c, a weak acid or neutral de-rusting agent should be used for the de-rusting cleaning and the cleaning time should be strictly controlled, to prevent acid mist or an excessive corrosion during the cleaning and avoid a hydrogen embrittlement of the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In step d, clean water with low content of chlorine and oxygen, such as deionized water or purified water, should be used in the ultrasonic rinsing II tank, to prevent the surface of the workpiece from being corroded and oxidized after the cleaning.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In step e, an aqueous anti-rust agent should be used for fine cleaning and rust prevention, which will not contaminate the surface of the part and then keeps a perfect appearance of the workpiece, leaves no trace, and does not affect the accuracy. The anti-rust effect with different durations can be obtained by adjusting a dilution ratio of the anti-rust agent.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The following content illustrates an example of cleaning a guide sleeve of an articulated oil cylinder of a shield machine using the workpiece cleaning device of this embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a workpiece before the cleaning, surfaces and grooves of which have paints/oil stains and rust, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the workpiece after the cleaning):</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Before cleaning, there are oil stains and aged paint layers on the surfaces of the guide sleeve, while oil stains, rust and other pollution layers on the inner wall, grooves and threaded surfaces.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Firstly, an ultrasonic compound cleaning is carried out on the molten salt. After the molten salt is cleaned under a temperature of 300&#xb0; C. for about 10 min, no gas comes out from the molten salt cleaning tank <b>2</b>, which proves that the paints and oil stains have been completely removed. The workpiece is cooled to 150&#xb0; C. and rinsed in the first rinsing tank <b>5</b> for 1 min. Then, ultrasonic de-rusting is carried out in the de-rusting cleaning tank <b>6</b> with a weak acid de-rusting agent composed of organic acid for 3 min. Next, the workpiece is rinsed in the second rinsing tank <b>7</b> with deionized water for 1 min. The workpiece is anti-rust cleaned in the anti-rust cleaning tank <b>8</b> for 1 min, and then dried in the air.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">After the above cleaning, a good effect is achieved on the surfaces, grooves and threaded surfaces. A cleanliness test shows that a pollutant mass is 13.8 mg, which is far less than a cleanliness requirement (90 mg) of a hydraulic cylinder and then meets the assembly requirement. An anti-corrosion test shows that the anti-rust effect of the guide sleeve is 21 days at a dilution ratio of 1:30.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">To sum up, the cleaning device of this embodiment can realize integrated, efficient and environmentally-friendly cleaning of various pollution layers such as heavy oil stains, paints, carbon deposits and rust on the surfaces of the parts. The workpiece cleaning device of this embodiment has the following technical effects:</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">(1) The cleaning ability: it integrates the super decontamination capability of the molten salt cleaning, the ultrasonic cavitation impact and the vibration stirring; under the actions of special molten salt formula and de-rusting formula, it can quickly remove the organic and inorganic pollution layers such as heavy oil stains, paints, carbon deposits and rust on the surfaces, grooves, inner holes of the complex parts without damaging the matrixes of the parts.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">(2) The cleaning efficiency: the advantages of submerged ultrasonic cleaning are brought into full play, and the cleaning procedures are integrated into one device, so that the cleaning procedures are centralized and well-coordinated, which is convenient to realize the automatic cleaning of the multi-pollution layers.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">(3) The environmental protection requirement: the cleaning system has a cleaning agent circulation filtration device to improve the service life of the cleaning agent; and a centralized recovery and treatment device for the waste water and the waste gas, so that the cleaning process can be environment-friendly and pollution-free.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Those described above are just exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, rather than limitations thereto.
