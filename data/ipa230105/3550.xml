No. 62/953,652 filed Dec. 26, 2019, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter disclosed herein relates generally to devices, systems, and methods for measuring the angular position of a rotating system. More particularly, the subject matter disclosed herein relates to sensor systems that use Hall effect sensors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Non-contact sensors are useful for monitoring the position of moving components since they have few moving parts and thus generally exhibit high durability. An example of such a non-contact sensor is a Hall effect sensor, which can measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. A typical Hall effect sensor arrangement is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B</figref>. Such an arrangement includes a single magnet <b>10</b> carried by a magnet carrier <b>11</b>, the magnet <b>10</b> being polarized through the width of the magnet and a Hall effect sensor <b>12</b> that is spaced apart from the magnet <b>10</b> in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field of the magnet. The effectiveness of this kind of sensor arrangement relies on the magnet <b>10</b> producing a magnetic field with sufficient rough gain to ensure sensor functionality.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some configurations, however, such as where the sensor magnet <b>10</b> and the Hall effect sensor <b>12</b> are separated by a field of a magnetically-responsive medium <b>13</b>, the magnetic flux at the Hall effect sensor <b>12</b> is reduced. This reduction is illustrated in one exemplary configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Alternatively or in addition, in some configurations, the magnet carrier <b>11</b> or other structure surrounding the magnet <b>10</b> includes other magnetically-responsive materials such as steel, which likewise acts to concentrate the magnetic flux, resulting in a reduction in the magnetic flux experienced at the Hall effect sensor <b>12</b>, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. In any of these arrangements, a reduction in magnetic flux reduces the rough gain and thus the sensor magnetic performance. In addition, design limitations imposed by using magnetically-responsive material can further limit the performance of standard magnets provided or recommended by sensor manufacturers.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with this disclosure, devices for identifying the position of a movable component are provided.

In some embodiments, an arrangement of multiple magnets that exhibits polarization across the length of the magnet arrangement is used in place of a single magnet that is polarized across its width. In some embodiments, this magnet arrangement includes two permanent magnets placed side by side with reversed polarity to complete the magnetic circuit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one exemplary arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a sensor system, generally designated <b>100</b>, includes a first magnet <b>101</b> and a second magnet <b>105</b> arranged next to the first magnet <b>101</b>. The first magnet <b>101</b> is arranged with a first pole <b>102</b> oriented at least generally in a first direction D<b>1</b> and a second pole <b>103</b> oriented at least generally in a second direction D<b>2</b> substantially opposite from the first direction Dl. A second magnet <b>105</b> has a first pole <b>106</b> oriented at least generally in the second direction D<b>2</b>, wherein the first pole <b>106</b> of the second magnet <b>105</b> has a polarity that matches a polarity of the first pole <b>102</b> of the first magnet <b>101</b>. The second magnet <b>105</b> further has a second pole <b>107</b> that is oriented at least generally in the first direction D<b>1</b>, wherein the second pole <b>107</b> of the second magnet <b>105</b> has a polarity that matches a polarity of the second pole <b>103</b> of the first magnet <b>101</b>. This configuration of the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> in a side-by-side arrangement with reversed polarities creates an aggregate magnetic field that has a shape that is somewhat similar to that of a typical sensor magnet, but the magnetic field is more concentrated in the first direction D<b>1</b> and the second direction D<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the sensor system <b>100</b> provides improved performance of a sensor configuration similar to the conventional sensor arrangement discussed above. In the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> are carried together by a magnet carrier <b>110</b>, and a Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> is spaced apart from the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> in the first direction Dl. The magnet carrier <b>110</b> is movable with respect to the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> to at least a sensing position at which the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> are proximal to the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, such a sensing position is a position at which the magnet carrier <b>110</b> having the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> is proximal to the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> within a threshold at which the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> can be used to identify the relative position of the magnet carrier <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the first magnet and the second magnet <b>105</b> are positioned side-by-side in the magnet carrier <b>110</b> such that the magnets are substantially equidistant from the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> when in this proximal sensing position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The directional concentration of the magnetic field that results from the arrangement of the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> discussed above helps to ensure that the magnetic field at the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> has sufficient rough gain to ensure sensor functionality. This directional concentration of the magnetic field compensates for configurations that tend to cause deterioration of sensor functionality in conventional sensor systems. In some embodiments where a magnetically-responsive medium <b>130</b> is provided between the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> and the first and second magnets <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, because a directed magnetic field is produced by the arrangement of the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b>, the magnetically-responsive medium <b>130</b> does not significantly diminish the magnetic field directed toward the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b>, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, the presence of other magnetically-responsive materials on a side of the sensor system <b>100</b> opposing the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> shorts the lower poles, resulting in a higher flux concentration in the direction of the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b>, such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, this other magnetically-responsive material includes the magnet carrier <b>110</b> or one or more elements thereof being composed of steel.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the present subject matter provides particular utility for devices in which the sensor system <b>100</b> is associated with a rotating member that moves within a field of a magnetically-responsive medium. In one embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, a magnetically-responsive device generally designated <b>200</b> includes a shaft <b>210</b> to which a rotor <b>230</b> and the magnet carrier <b>110</b> are interconnected to restrain relative rotation therebetween. In some embodiments, a housing <b>240</b> is positioned substantially about the shaft <b>210</b>, the rotor <b>230</b>, and the magnet carrier <b>110</b>. The Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> is attached to or integrated within the housing <b>240</b>. In addition, one or more pole <b>242</b> is attached to or integrated within the housing <b>240</b>, and a magnetic field generator <b>245</b> associated with the pole <b>242</b> is spaced from the rotor <b>230</b> by a void <b>250</b>. A magnetically responsive medium <b>130</b>, such as a magnetically-responsive powder such as iron powder, is contained within and at least partially fills the void <b>150</b>, including within a space separating the magnet carrier <b>110</b> from the housing <b>240</b> and the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b>. In this arrangement, the magnetic field generator <b>145</b> is controllable to cause the magnetically-responsive medium <b>130</b> to align along the flux path within the void <b>150</b> and thereby cause a change in torsional resistance of the rotor <b>230</b> (and the shaft <b>210</b>).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a rotating system of this kind, the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> are rotatable in a plane, wherein the first direction D<b>1</b> with which the magnetic field of the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b> is aligned is substantially orthogonal to the plane of rotation. In this arrangement, the magnets are moved relative to the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> such that changes in the flux concentration directed toward the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> is recognized as a change in relative position between the elements. In some embodiments, this change in position includes a change in proximity between the magnets and the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b>, wherein the magnets are rotated to a sensing position once per rotation at which the magnets are proximal to the hall effect sensor <b>120</b>. Alternatively or in addition, in some embodiments, the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> detects a change in the angular orientation of the magnetic field produced by the magnets, and this angular orientation is correlated to the angular position of the magnets relative to the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b>. By using the sensor system <b>100</b> in any such configuration, the improved directionality of the magnetic field compensates for a reduced field strength at the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> caused by the magnetically-responsive medium shorting the magnetic flux path. In some embodiments, one or more of the shaft <b>210</b> or elements of the magnet carrier <b>110</b> comprise magnetically-responsive materials, such as steel, such that the poles opposing the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> are shorted, resulting in a further enhanced concentration in the direction of the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the sensor system <b>100</b> includes multiple Hall effect sensors <b>120</b>. Because the present subject matter provides improved sensor functionality by increasing the directionality of the magnetic field rather than by simply increasing the strength of the magnets, the sensor system <b>100</b> is configured so as to not saturate the Hall effect sensor <b>120</b> that is proximal to the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, this directional flux concentration further allows for better differentiation among the magnetic fields experienced at different relative positions of the first magnet <b>101</b> and the second magnet <b>105</b>, which allows multiple Hall effect sensors <b>120</b> to more precisely discern the relative position of the rotating elements. In some embodiments, a first Hall effect sensor <b>120</b><i>a </i>and a second Hall effect sensor <b>120</b><i>b </i>are positioned at different relative distances with respect to first magnet <b>101</b> and second magnet <b>105</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in some embodiments, first Hall effect sensor <b>120</b><i>a </i>is positioned on a side of a printed circuit board <b>125</b> that faces towards first magnet <b>101</b> and second magnet <b>105</b>, whereas second Hall effect sensor <b>120</b><i>b </i>is positioned on an opposing side of printed circuit board <b>125</b> that faces away from first magnet <b>101</b> and second magnet <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present subject matter can be embodied in other forms without departure from the spirit and essential characteristics thereof. The embodiments described therefore are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. Although the present subject matter has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments that are apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are also within the scope of the present subject matter.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
