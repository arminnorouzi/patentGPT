The casing usually has a base wall and a side wall defining an open cavity that can contain the initial product, for example ground coffee or tea, from which the final product, for example the beverage, is obtained.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A flanged edge extends radially from the side wall and is arranged around the open cavity, on the opposite side with respect to the base wall. The cavity is hermetically closed by a covering element, fixed to the flanged edge, so as to seal the initial product inside the container.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The base wall of the capsule can have an opening delimited by an edge region to which a closing element can be fixed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The base wall of the capsule can also have a central region, and a groove, interposed between the edge region and the central region. The central region and the edge region can extend on respective planes which are offset with respect to each other along a longitudinal axis of the capsule and, in this case, the closing element can be fixed to the edge region and to the central region on different planes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The capsule must be pierceable to allow the introduction of liquid under pressure, typically water, and the delivery of the coffee beverage obtained.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, the capsule can be used in a dispensing machine in which the closing element is pierceable by an injection device of the dispensing machine, which can have piercing blades shaped so to be housed in the groove, and wherein the covering element is pierceable by an extraction device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Both the covering element and the closing element are produced by means of a pierceable sheet element, so that the capsule can be used with great flexibility of use in the dispensing machines of interest.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Cutting off and joining apparatuses are known in order to produce the capsule, that is, to fix the covering element to the base wall and to fix the covering element to the flanged edge and which are configured to cut off the sheet element from a sheet material and subsequently to join the cut off element to the respective wall to which it is to be applied.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The sheet material is usually fed by a web wound on a reel and is flexible in the sense that it is a thin film, for example of a compostable material or of aluminium.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The apparatus may comprise an operating unit comprising a joining device and a cutting device, the cutting edge of which surrounds the joining device. In particular, the joining device and the cutting device can be tubular and can be arranged coaxial with respect to a movement axis with respect to which the operating unit and the container can move between a spaced condition, in which the sheet material is interposed therebetween and is spaced therefrom, and a joined condition, in which the joining device is configured to join the sheet material to the container.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cutting device can be configured to translate together with the joining device along the movement axis and to translate also with respect to the joining device with respect to this axis.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a first step, the operating unit and the container can be in a spaced condition, in order to be able to interpose the sheet material therebetween.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a second step, the cutting device can be advanced through the sheet material to cause the cutting edge to cut the sheet element. At the end of the cut, the cut off sheet element remains blocked inside the cutting device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a third step, the joining device can be advanced to accompany the cut element by guiding it until it engages with the wall of interest to which it is to be joined. The joining device can subsequently join the cut element, for example, by heat sealing or by ultrasonic welding.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The join of the sheet element to the container by means of the apparatus and the method described above can be imprecise if the sheet element, retained inside the tubular cutting device, does not remain in the ideal position but moves, given the flexibility and the consistency of the sheet material itself. If the sheet element is joined imprecisely to the container wall, the resulting container is defective and must be discarded as it cannot be used.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Cutting off and joining apparatuses forming part of the state of the art are known and are cited hereinafter by way of example.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Document US 2004/206048 shows an apparatus for sealing containers which comprises a welding head for welding a peripheral edge portion of a lid to an internal surface of a tapered body of a container. The welding head is provided with a face that can be inserted inside said internal surface.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Document CN 108454973 discloses a film processing method and apparatus comprising pressing, cutting and welding in which the apparatus comprises a punching and welding device comprising a punching tool and a heated head, wherein the heated head is installed in a movable

<b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>show an apparatus <b>1</b> for cutting off and joining a sheet element <b>2</b> to a container <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the apparatus <b>1</b> is configured to cut off and join a sheet element <b>2</b>, as a closing element, to a base wall <b>301</b> of a casing of a container <b>3</b> such as a capsule for beverages, as well as to cut off and join a sheet element <b>2</b>, such as a covering element, to a flanged edge <b>305</b> of the casing of the capsule <b>3</b>, to which reference will be made without losing generality.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A capsule for beverages is, in fact, a disposable and single-dose container <b>3</b> comprising the casing in the shape of a glass or cup. The casing has the base wall <b>301</b> and a side wall <b>306</b> defining a cavity <b>307</b> which can contain an initial product, not illustrated, for example ground coffee or tea, from which to obtain a final product, not illustrated, by introducing a liquid under pressure, for example water, into the capsule <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The flanged edge <b>305</b> extends radially from the side wall <b>306</b> and is arranged around the cavity <b>307</b>, on the opposite side with respect to the base wall <b>301</b>. The cavity <b>307</b> can be hermetically closed by a further element, not illustrated, which is the covering element, which can be fixed to the flanged edge <b>305</b>, so as to seal the initial product inside the container <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The base wall <b>301</b> of the capsule <b>3</b> can have an edge region <b>302</b> to which the closing element can be fixed to seal the base wall <b>301</b> of the capsule <b>3</b> itself, which can delimit an inner region <b>303</b>, which can be a central opening, not illustrated.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The apparatus <b>1</b> comprises an operating unit <b>4</b> which in turn comprises a cutting device <b>401</b> and a joining device <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cutting device <b>401</b> is configured to cut the sheet element <b>2</b> from a sheet material <b>5</b>, the joining device <b>402</b> is configured to join the sheet element <b>2</b> to the container <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, the sheet material <b>5</b> is a continuous web (not illustrated) which is unwound from a reel (not illustrated). However, it is specified that the sheet material <b>5</b> could also be a segment of continuous web previously cut which is fed already cut into segments to the apparatus <b>1</b>, between the operating unit <b>4</b> and the container <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Sheet material <b>5</b> means a flexible film, with a thickness comprised between 0.02 mm and 0.25 mm, for example equal to 0.05 mm, preferably made of aluminium, and/or of a compostable material, for example PLA, and/or or of a biodegradable and/or compostable material other than PLA, and/or paper.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The cutting device <b>401</b> comprises a cutting edge <b>403</b> which surrounds the joining device <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The operating unit <b>4</b> and the container <b>3</b> are movable with respect to one another along a movement axis Z between:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0053">a spaced condition, in which the sheet material <b>5</b> can be interposed between the operating unit <b>4</b> and the container <b>3</b> and is, in particular, spaced therefrom, and</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0054">a joined condition, in which the joining device <b>402</b> is configured to join the sheet material <b>5</b> to the container <b>3</b>.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">The apparatus <b>1</b> further comprises a retaining device <b>6</b>, configured to retain the sheet material <b>5</b> during the joining and the cut.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">In the joined condition, the cutting device <b>401</b> is configured to remain fixed relative to the joining device <b>402</b> and the retaining device <b>6</b> is configured to move along the Z axis between a tensioning position and a cutting position, the sheet element <b>2</b> being cut on the cutting edge <b>403</b> from the sheet material <b>5</b> during the movement of the retaining device <b>6</b> from the tensioning position to the cutting position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">Thanks to the presence of the retaining device <b>6</b>, which is movable between the tensioning position and the cutting position, the cutting device <b>401</b> and the joining device <b>402</b> can remain fixed with respect to one another in the joined condition not only during the joining of the sheet material <b>5</b> to the container <b>3</b>, for example to the base wall <b>301</b>, but also during the cut of the sheet element <b>2</b> from the sheet material <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">The joining time is therefore increased and, advantageously, by increasing the joining time, also the stability and quality of the join between the sheet element <b>2</b> and the container <b>3</b>, for example between the sheet element <b>2</b> and the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b>, is increased.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">It is added that cutting off is advantageously carried out after joining, when the sheet material <b>5</b> has already been joined to the container <b>3</b> and this increases the quality of the cutting off itself.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">The joining device <b>402</b> can be, for example, a heat-sealing or ultrasonic welding device.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">In the case of a heat sealing device, by increasing the joining time, it is possible to adjust the heat sealing device to a lower temperature with a consequent improvement of the stability of the weld itself.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">In addition, thanks to the fact that the cutting device <b>401</b> is fixed and not movable relative to the joining device <b>402</b>, the container <b>3</b> is not damaged during the separation of the sheet element <b>2</b> from the sheet material <b>5</b> since, when the operating unit <b>4</b> and the container <b>3</b> are in the joined condition, the cutting edge <b>403</b> is kept at a distance from the container <b>3</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">Along the movement axis Z, in the joined condition a joined position is defined in which the sheet material <b>5</b> is joined to the container <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">It should be noted that the movement axis Z is also an axis of symmetry for container <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">With respect to the joined position, the tensioning position is arranged along the movement axis Z on the side of the container <b>3</b>, the sheet material <b>5</b> being initially moved away from the cutting edge <b>403</b> towards the container <b>3</b> by the retaining device <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">Thanks to this, the sheet material <b>5</b> is not damaged by the presence of the cutting device <b>401</b>, since the cutting edge <b>403</b> is kept at a distance also from the sheet material <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0067">As is evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the retaining device <b>6</b> in the tensioning position is configured to wrap the sheet material <b>5</b> about the base wall <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0068">If, in a manner not illustrated, the apparatus <b>1</b> is configured to cut off and join the sheet element <b>2</b> to a flanged edge <b>305</b> of the casing of the capsule <b>3</b> to form the covering element, then the retaining device <b>6</b> in the retaining position is configured to wrap the sheet material <b>5</b> about said flanged edge <b>305</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0069">Therefore, with respect to the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b>, the tensioning position is arranged along the axis Z beyond the base wall <b>301</b>, on the side of the container <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">If, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is the operating unit <b>4</b> that moves towards the container <b>3</b>, which is kept stationary, the joined position corresponds, along the axis Z, to the position of the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b>. However, this is not necessary, as we will see later.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0071">Advantageously, during the wrapping about the base wall <b>301</b>, the retaining device <b>6</b> is able to put the sheet material <b>5</b> under tension to prevent creases from being created which would damage, as we will see later, the joining of the sheet material <b>5</b> to the base wall <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0072">With respect to the joined position, the cutting position is arranged along the axis Z on the side of the operating unit <b>4</b>. It should therefore be noted that the joined position is interposed between the tensioning position and the cutting position. In this way, the retaining device <b>6</b> can move starting from the side of the container <b>3</b> towards the operating unit <b>4</b>, to cause the sheet material <b>5</b>, initially moved away from the cutting edge <b>403</b>, to intercept the latter to be cut.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0073">If, for example, the movement axis Z is vertical and the operating unit <b>4</b> is arranged below the container <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>10</b></figref>, the retaining device <b>6</b> puts the sheet material <b>5</b> under tension in the tensioning position which is far higher than the joined position and lowers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) to the cutting position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to cut the sheet material <b>5</b>, since the cutting position is far lower than the joined position and the retaining position.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074">It is specified that what has been said previously may remain valid even if, according to a variant not shown, the operating unit <b>4</b> is arranged above the container, or, according to another variant not shown, the movement axis Z is not vertical but, for example, is horizontal.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the retaining device <b>6</b> is configured to move into the tensioning position from a non-operating position, in which the sheet material <b>5</b> is retained interposed between the operating unit <b>4</b> and the container <b>3</b> arranged in the spaced condition, before the operating unit <b>4</b> and/or the container <b>3</b> move into the joined condition.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">In other words, the retaining device <b>6</b> is configured to move into the tensioning position in a preparation step that precedes the joining step, in order to wrap the sheet material <b>5</b> about the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b> and to put the sheet material <b>5</b> under tension.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">It should be noted that the cutting device <b>401</b> and the joining device <b>402</b> are configured to move solidly between the spaced condition and the joined condition.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">In other words, the cutting device <b>401</b> and the joining device <b>402</b> can be fixed to each other and move solidly. Alternatively, the cutting device <b>401</b> and the joining device <b>402</b> can be movable between them independently but in such a way as to move solidly so that, in the joined condition, they are solidly fixed together.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">For this purpose, the apparatus <b>1</b> can comprise a movement unit, not illustrated, which can comprise respective movement devices configured to move the cutting device <b>401</b> and the joining device <b>402</b> solidly between them, or to move independently but solidly respectively the cutting device <b>401</b> and the joining device <b>402</b> as previously mentioned.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">According to an alternative version, not shown, the apparatus <b>1</b> can also comprise an abutment device, for example a spindle, which can be configured to be arranged inside the container <b>3</b>. The abutment device can comprise an abutment head configured to be housed in the cavity <b>307</b> so as to engage the side wall <b>306</b> and the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b>, retaining the container <b>3</b> in the joined condition.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">In other words, the abutment head can be configured to provide an abutment support to the joining device <b>402</b>, pushing the base wall <b>301</b> towards the joining device <b>402</b> in the joined condition when the sheet material <b>5</b> is interposed therebetween, to further improve the joining of the sheet material <b>5</b> to the base wall <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">According to a variant not shown, it is the operating unit <b>4</b> that remains stationary and it is the container <b>3</b> that moves towards the operating unit <b>4</b>, supported and retained by the abutment device. In this case, the joined position corresponds, along the axis Z, to the position of a head end <b>404</b> of the joining device.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">The apparatus can comprise a further movement device configured to move the abutment device, when the latter retains the container <b>3</b>, between the spaced condition and the joined condition.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">The apparatus <b>1</b> can comprise another movement device for moving the retaining device <b>6</b> between the non-operating position, the tensioning position and the cutting position described above.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">If it is the operating unit <b>4</b> that remains stationary and it is the container <b>3</b> that moves towards it in the joined condition, the tensioning device <b>6</b> is configured to move into the tensioning position in the preparation step described above, in order to wrap the sheet material <b>5</b> about the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b> and put it under tension.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">Subsequently, the retaining device <b>6</b>, arranged in the tensioning position, is configured to move solidly with the container <b>3</b>, retained and moved by the abutment device, so that the sheet material <b>5</b> wrapped about the base wall <b>301</b> can contact the joining device <b>402</b> in the joined condition.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0087">In this case, the further movement device of the abutment device and the other movement device of the retaining device <b>6</b> are configured to move the container <b>3</b> and the retaining device <b>6</b>, respectively, solidly between them.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0088">According to a further variant, not shown, the operating unit <b>4</b> and the container <b>3</b> can both be movable from the spaced condition to the joined condition, without any of them remaining stationary. In this case, the movement unit of the operating unit <b>4</b>, the further movement device of the abutment device and the other movement device of the retaining device <b>6</b> are configured so as to coordinate the different movements.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0089">The retaining device <b>6</b> comprises two plates <b>601</b>, <b>602</b> surrounding the operating unit <b>4</b> and the container <b>3</b>.

The head end <b>404</b> comprises an outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; for example annular, and an inner zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; for example circular, which is surrounded by the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; and is recessed with respect to the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0097">The outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032;, for example planar, is configured to join the sheet material <b>5</b> to a corresponding edge region <b>302</b> of the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b>, which lies on a plane.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0098">This plane can be transverse to the movement axis Z, for example perpendicular.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0099">In the joined condition, the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; is configured to abut against said plane and define, along the axis Z, the joined position.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0100">The cutting edge <b>403</b> is substantially coplanar with respect to the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0101">In other words, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>, the cutting edge <b>403</b> can project from the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; by a minimum height which is at least equal to the thickness of the sheet material <b>5</b> which is to be cut. Since the thickness of the sheet material can also be, as mentioned above, a few hundredths of a mm, i.e. equal to 0.05 mm, the cutting edge <b>403</b> can project from the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; by a minimum height, for example equal to 0.05 mm, which does not interfere with the side wall <b>306</b> on which the sheet material <b>5</b> is to be joined.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0102">However, according to a version not shown, the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; can project with respect to the cutting edge <b>403</b>.

In fact, when the retaining device <b>6</b> moves from the side of the container <b>3</b> towards the operating unit <b>4</b> into the cutting position, the sheet material <b>5</b> is capable of equally intercepting the cutting edge <b>403</b> to cut the sheet element <b>2</b> from the sheet material <b>5</b>, even if the cutting edge <b>403</b> is further set back with respect to the outer zone <b>404</b>&#x2032; by a respective further suitable height.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0103">The inner zone <b>404</b>&#x2033; is shaped in such a way as to ensure that, in the inner zone <b>404</b>&#x2033; the sheet material <b>5</b> is not joined to the base wall <b>301</b> of the container <b>3</b> if joining in the corresponding inner region <b>303</b> is to be avoided since the opening described above may for example be present.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0104">In the case where the joining device <b>402</b> is a heat sealing device, the head end <b>404</b> of the cylindrical body <b>402</b><i>a </i>is configured to be heated.
