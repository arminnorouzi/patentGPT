The transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are gate insulated field effect transistors, more commonly referred to as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET), or MOS transistors. The transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are transistors of the same type. According to one example, the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are P-channel MOS transistors, also known as PMOS transistors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are PMOS transistors. According to one variant, the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> can be N-channel MOS transistors, or NMOS transistors; the person skilled in the art will know how to adapt the device connections in this case.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are arranged head-to-tail and are current mirrored. In other words, the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> have their gates linked, preferably connected or interconnected, to an interconnection node A. In addition, the transistor <b>101</b> has its gate linked, preferably connected or interconnected, to one of its conduction terminals. The transistor <b>101</b> is said to be diode connected. More particularly, when the transistor <b>101</b> is a PMOS-type transistor, the transistor <b>101</b> has its gate linked, preferably connected or interconnected, to its drain.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The transistor <b>101</b> further has one of its conduction terminals interconnected to the same conduction terminal of the transistor <b>102</b>. More particularly, when the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are PMOS-type transistors, the sources of the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are interconnected. The interconnection node of the conduction terminals of the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> is denoted VDD. According to one example, the interconnection node VDD receives a supply potential VDD, such as a potential that is higher than the ground.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At its conduction terminal, connected to its gate, i.e. its drain, the transistor <b>101</b> receives a current I, to be copied. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the current I is supplied by a current source <b>103</b>, for example, but in practice the drain of the transistor <b>101</b> can receive the current I from any electronic device node. Conventionally, the current I flows from the drain of the transistor <b>101</b> to the current source <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The transistor <b>102</b> provides a copied current I&#x2032; at its free conduction terminal, i.e. its drain in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The current I&#x2032; flows from the drain of the transistor <b>102</b> to an output node S of the current mirror <b>100</b>. Theoretically, the current I&#x2032; is proportional to the current I, with a proportionality coefficient M defined by the ratio of the gate widths and gate lengths of the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. If the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are identical, then theoretically the current I&#x2032; is equal to the current I. However, in practice, the current I&#x2032; additionally depends on the gate current IG of the transistor <b>101</b>, according to the following relationship:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>I&#x2032;=M</i>*(<i>I&#x2212;IG</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">It may be that the gate current IG has an order of magnitude that is non-negligible in relation to or even comparable to the current I, and thus causes a resulting loss of current at the current mirror output. The miniaturization of transistors tends to increase the occurrence of this phenomenon. Indeed, the smaller a transistor is, the thinner its gate oxide layer is, and the more likely it is to let electrons pass through, by tunneling effect. This can happen for transistors with a gate length of the order of 3 nm, 5 nm, 7 nm, or even 16 nm, and of a relatively small gate thickness, i.e. a thickness of between 1 nm and 1 mm. The following embodiments are intended to overcome this problem.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an electrical diagram of one embodiment of an electronic device <b>200</b>, schematically and in block form.

The gate width-to-length ratio of the transistors <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> is denoted N. According to one example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the transistors <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are PMOS transistors. In a variant, the transistors <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> may be NMOS transistors, and the person skilled in the art will know how to adapt the connections of the current mirror <b>200</b> in this case.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">The transistors <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are arranged like the transistors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the current mirror <b>100</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
