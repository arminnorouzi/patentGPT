Since a wireless charging transmitter transmits energy in the form of a magnetic field, the energy of the magnetic field needs to be converted to electric energy using a wireless charging receiver. For high efficiency, coils of the wireless charging receiver are capable of operating at an operating voltage reaching 20 V to reduce power consumption of resistors in the coils. However, a maximum operating voltage of a single battery is less than 5 V. For a minimum power loss during charging of the battery, a high-efficient DC/DC conversion is needed to lower the output voltage of the wireless charging receiver to 5 V or even lower. A charge pump-based DC/DC converter is a main topological structure for achieving such voltage conversion. Under a 2:1 voltage drop ratio, the efficiency may reach 98%.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For a single-battery power supply system, two charge pump-based DC/DC converters need to be cascaded (first 4:2 and then 2:1), to lower the output voltage (reaching 20 V) of the wireless charging receiver to the voltage (5 V) of the single battery. Therefore, three integrated circuit chips are used in front of the battery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In practice, the wireless charging receiver and the high-voltage 4:2 charge pump are generally placed together to be proximal to the coils of the wireless charging receiver, and the low-voltage 2:1 charge pump is placed to be proximal to a battery connector. This is because an output current of the 2:1 charge pump is four times an output current of the wireless charging receiver. A device with such high output current needs to be placed to be proximal to the load thereof, to reduce power consumption of the resistors in a PCB as much as possible. In a smart phone system, configuration of such components allows the wireless charging receiver and the high-voltage charge pump to be integrated in a single device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional buck and rectification scheme in a wireless charging receiver is generally as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, although the wireless charging receiver and the charge pump are integrated, the two parts of circuitry operate independently. The characteristic lies in that output of the wireless charging receiver circuit and input of the charge pump buck circuit respectively filter the V<sub>rect </sub>and V<sub>PMID </sub>based on C<sub>RECT </sub>and C<sub>PMID </sub>to achieve the purpose of approaching a voltage source, such that the two parts of circuitry are cascaded but capable of relatively independently operating.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in some applications that impose a stricter requirement on output ripples, capacitances of filter capacitors C<sub>RECT</sub>, C<sub>PMID </sub>and C<sub>OUT </sub>(including the input capacitance of a latter-stage circuit) in the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are often far greater than those of C<sub>FLY1 </sub>or C<sub>FLY2</sub>. In this case, during the process of charging the capacitor C<sub>FLY1 </sub>or C<sub>FLY2</sub>, due to the very uneven current distribution, a lot of additional charge transfer loss may be caused, thereby resulting in that power conversion efficiency is not optimal. In some applications which are sensitive to the number of peripheral devices and an occupied board area, the output filter capacitor C<sub>OUT</sub>, capacitances of the input filter capacitors C<sub>REC</sub>T and C<sub>PMID </sub>tend to be close to that of C<sub>FLY1 </sub>or C<sub>FLY2 </sub>even less than that of C<sub>FLY1 </sub>or C<sub>FLY2</sub>. In this case, the output ripples of the rectifier may be transparently transmitted to the charge pump circuit, such that the two parts cannot be fully decoupled to operate, resulting in a reduction in power conversion efficiency. In addition, since the traditional system control scheme adopts a charge pump operating frequency that is not related to a coil current frequency, the operations of the rectifier and the charge pump fail to be coordinated to optimize the power conversion efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure are intended to provide a buck and rectifier circuit, a wireless charging receiver chip, and a wireless charging receiver that are capable of improving power conversion efficiency during wireless charging.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above objects, in one aspect, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a buck and rectifier circuit.
