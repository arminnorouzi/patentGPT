Some of these synovial joints are particularly stabilized by soft tissue structures such as the elbow joint, the knee joint, the ankle joint (talocrural joint), and the wrist joint. With the exception of the knee joint, a replacement of these joints with a joint replacement is a less common surgical procedure than the replacement of the oldest type of artificial joint replacement, i. e. the hip prosthesis. One reason for this may well be that these joints have a rather complex configuration, which makes the design of an artificial joint replacement as well as the surgical procedure to implant such a replacement more challenging.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, the elbow joint is essentially a hinge joint, it involves three long bones, namely the humerus, the radius and the ulna. Every one of these bones interacts with the other two bones via a synovial joint. The humeroulnar joint and the humeroradial joint together form the elbow joint.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, the proximal radioulnar joint as the third joint enables pronation and supination of the hand. These are rotational movements that occur when the distal end of the radius moves over the distal end of the ulna, i. e. when the forearm rotates about its longitudinal axis. Although the proximal radioulnar joint is not considered as being part of the elbow joint in an anatomical sense, it is close enough to the elbow joint to be potentially affected during implantation of a joint replacement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a replacement of the elbow joint or any of the other joints listed above is, for example, considered in severe cases of arthritis. The pain felt due to arthritis in these joints results in a significant impact on the life of a patient, which may be explained by the frequent movements of the arms and the necessity of these movements during everyday life. Here, the replacement of the affected joint generally offers the prospect of a pain-free life after surgery.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are several techniques available to replace a native joint, such as a surface replacement or a total joint replacement. In the former case, the damaged cartilage surface is replaced by an artificial surface. With this technique, the joint surfaces remain separate, which requires to keep the ligaments surrounding and supporting the joint as intact as possible in order to prevent the partly replaced joint from becoming unstable after surgery. Nonetheless, in practice, it turned out that keeping the ligaments intact to such a degree is rather hard so that a common problem with this type of replacement is a luxation of the joint after surgery.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These problems in terms of stability also occur with total joint replacements that are not mechanically linked. This type of prosthesis replaces the ends of the bones facing each other, where the native joint is normally located, with implant components.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For this reason, in particular the elbow joint is often replaced with a total elbow replacement that is mechanically connected. Such a total elbow replacement has the form of a connected hinge joint and is attached on one side to the humerus and on the other side to the ulna. As a result, the humeroradial joint is resected but not replaced since the hinge joint of a total elbow replacement for most joint replacements only involves the humeroulnar joint. Although this design prevents luxation from occurring, this type of replacement has been shown to be subject to a significant amount of wear. It is believed that this is a result of the difference between the kinematics of the total elbow replacement and the native elbow joint and an insufficient adaptation of a patient's body to this difference.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Similar to the elbow joint, the other above-noted joints have a dominant rotational degree of freedom with a large range of motion but also allow for a rotation to a less degree in another direction such as a varus-valgus movement. For the reasons described above in relation to the elbow replacement, it is believed that replacing these joints with mechanically connected total replacements likewise increases stress and wear on their components.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In answer to this, less strict hinge joints have been developed as total elbow replacements that offer more leeway in their movability.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The prior art document U.S. Pat. No. 10,195,040 B2 discloses an elbow prosthesis including a humeral component having a yoke and an ulnar component allowing a flexural movement of the forearm, i.e. a pivotal movement, while at the same time gives leeway so as to allow a varus-valgus movement. This varus-valgus range of motion, however, renders the disclosed prosthesis less stable and prone to wear. More specifically, the joint surfaces are loosely connected to each other, i. e. they form a wobbly joint, in order to increase the joint's range of motion to include a varus-valgus movement.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. 2016/0338839 A1 discloses a prosthetic elbow joint providing for pivotal movement while at the same time providing varus-valgus movement, however, the disclosed device has the downside of free play between the ulnar and humeral component. Although this play allows for said varus-valgus movement, this play results in a wobbly or sloppy hinge with partial contact between the joint surfaces. Such a joint has a designed instability and shows an increased amount of wear.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, more excessive wear and problems of loosening than with hip joint replacements are still being observed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is, in view of the prior art, an object of the present invention to provide a system or mechanism for the replacement of particularly the above-noted synovial joints, which allows for a rotation in the dominant rotational direction while at the same time provides sufficient stability and reduces wear and stress. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a system or mechanism for the replacement of such a joint that allows for an easy assembly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This problem is solved by a joint prosthesis according to claim <b>1</b> and a method of assembly of the claimed joint prosthesis in accordance with claims <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>. The dependent claims relate to advantageous embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A joint prosthesis according to the present invention comprises a first component and a second component being connected via a ball-and-socket-joint, wherein the first component comprises two outward (i. e. convex) spherical sections, at least one of the spherical sections having a projection. The ball-and-socket-joint comprises two gliding blocks each having an inward (i. e. concave) spherical section and at least one of the gliding blocks comprising a hole, the gliding blocks being attached to the second component, and the outward spherical sections are in gliding engagement with the inward spherical sections of the gliding blocks so that the first component is movably attached to the second component and the projection is inserted into one of the holes of the gliding blocks, so as to limit the mobility of the ball-and-socket-joint.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This joint prosthesis allows for flexural, i.e. pivotal movement, while at the same time provides a defined varus-valgus movement. The spherical sections of the first component and the gliding blocks allow for an increased contact surface of the moving parts, because with the spherical sections larger surfaces of the joint remain in contact during the varus-valgus movement. Thereby, stresses and wear are reduced and stability is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present context, the term &#x201c;outward spherical section&#x201d; means a spherical section bulging outwardly from the component to which the outward spherical section is attached. In other words, such an outward spherical section is convex.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;inward spherical section&#x201d; relates to a spherical section that in contrast to the outward bulging spherical section is formed as a concavity or depression in the corresponding component. In other words, such an inward spherical section is concave.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hole of a gliding block may be a fully or partially penetrating hole. Preferably, the hole is cylindrical.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term gliding engagement relates to an engagement of a joint surface of the first component with a corresponding joint surface of the second component's gliding blocks, which allows for the first component to be moved relative to the second component while at the same time being in contact with the gliding blocks. Further, the joint surfaces are engaged to a degree that they do not separate. In other words, they mechanically connect the first component and the second component. This mechanical connection substantially prevents a translation but allows for a rotation between these components.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Limitation of the mobility of the ball-and-socket-joint by the projection in the present case relates to the varus-valgus movement and the rotation of the first component about a second pivotal axis in these directions. The projections do not limit the dominant or major pivotal or flexural movement of the joint about a first pivotal axis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In conventional joint prostheses allowing for a varus-valgus movement, the contact surface of the moving parts is greatly reduced as the contact portions of the first component being at the maximum varus position are in front of the pivotal axis of the joint on one side of the joint and behind the rotational axis on an opposing side of the joint. When considering the maximum valgus position this configuration switches and the contact portions of the first component are behind the pivotal axis of the joint on the one side of the joint and in front of the rotational axis on said opposing side of the joint.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention allows to provide a gliding contact of the first component around the rotational axis (first pivotal axis of the joint) because the spherical sections remain in gliding engagement and the contact of the moving parts of the joint prosthesis do basically not change during a varus-valgus movement.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The at least one projection inserted into the gliding block allows for a well-defined limitation of the varus-valgus movement and, thus, provides a limit to the rotation of the varus-valgus movement of the first component independent of the pivotal position of the joint about the first pivotal axis. By providing such a movement, the wear of the joint can be reduced whereas the engagement and the limitation of the varus-valgus movement prevents the unstable characteristics of a wobbly joint.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is preferred that the projection has a conical shape with the end of the conical projection away from the spherical section being smaller in circumference than the end of the conical projection at the spherical section. In other words, the projection tapers in its direction of extension from the spherical section.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">By forming the projection in a conical shape, the contact surface within the gliding block is enhanced so that load peaks are reduced as the varus-valgus movement is approaching its maximum deflection. In particular, the conical projection at maximum deflection is in line contact with the hole of the gliding block. Preferably, the hole is cylindrical. Further, the projection and hole are generally rotational symmetric. Accordingly, the varus-valgus movement can be performed independent of the elbow's flexion.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is further preferred that the second one of the two outward spherical sections has a second projection and the second of the two gliding blocks also comprises a hole into which hole the second projection is inserted. Preferably, the second projection has a conical shape with the end of the conical projection away from the spherical sections being smaller in circumference than the end of the conical projections at the spherical section, i. e. tapering when extending outwards. This also allows to reduce load peaks as the prosthesis approaches its maximum varus-valgus movement.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second component may comprise two mounting recesses into which the two gliding blocks are inserted and are attached to, respectively. By providing two mounting recesses for inserting the gliding blocks, the assembly is simplified and requires less space while at the same time the gliding blocks are arranged so as to provide a well-defined support for the first component.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the gliding blocks are secured with a screw in the mounting recesses. Alternatively, the gliding blocks may be secured to the second component using a form-fit and, in particular, a snap-fit. These configurations allow securing the gliding blocks in an easy fashion while at the same time allowing for both easy assembly and disassembly of the prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The mounting recesses may comprise a projection to prevent a rotational movement of the gliding blocks. Preventing a rotational movement of the gliding blocks within the mounting recesses allows aligning the gliding blocks upon assembly to further facilitate assembly of the prosthesis. At the same time this allows for a defined alignment of the mounting recess and the gliding block.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is further preferred that the mounting recesses comprise an insertion stop to limit insertion of the gliding blocks into the mounting recesses, the means preferably being a step or a pin. By providing such an insertion stop to limit insertion of the gliding blocks into the mounting recesses, the assembly is further simplified. Additionally, the degree of engagement of the outward spherical sections with the inward spherical sections can be precisely set in advance by adjusting the depth of insertion of the gliding blocks. Thereby the force applied to the first component by the gliding blocks can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the first component comprises a bone member and a joint member so that the first component can be adjusted to the size of the bone of the patient, thereby providing for better adjustment and anchorage of the prosthesis to the adjacent bone.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the two outward spherical sections of the first component are arranged so that they form a spherical convex joint surface. Likewise, the two inward spherical sections of the gliding blocks of the second component are preferably arranged so that they form a spherical concave joint surface. The spherical convex joint surface and the spherical concave joint surface correspond to each other in order to form the ball-and-socket-joint. This enhances the stability and durability of the prosthesis while at the same time reduces wear.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the second component comprises one or two cut-out portions through which the at least one projection of the first component can be inserted at the time of assembly. By comprising cut out portions, the first component can be inserted into the second component without the necessity of a tilting movement, thereby further facilitating assembly of the joint prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The diameter of curvature of the outward spherical sections and the diameter of the curvature of the inward spherical sections may preferably substantially be equal. This allows to enhance the contact between the first component and the gliding blocks.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the joint member of the first component of the joint prosthesis may be formed as one member with the outward spherical sections and the at least one projection, so as to form one unitary part. This facilitates assembly of and provides strength to the joint prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The joint prosthesis is preferably an elbow joint prosthesis, in particular with the first component being an ulnar component and the second component being a humeral component.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a different aspect of the present invention, a method of assembly for a joint prosthesis is provided comprising introduction of the first component into the second component and subsequently movably fixing the first component by inserting the gliding blocks. After insertion of the gliding blocked, the first component and second component basically prevent translation but allow rotation in relation to each other.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the method of assembly further comprises securing the gliding blocks in the second component via one or more screws.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further features and advantages of the invention are explained in the following description of preferred embodiments and are illustrated in the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The following figures illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention.

Each mounting recess <b>30</b> may comprise an insertion stop such as a step <b>34</b> or any of the other features described further below for limiting insertion of a gliding block <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Transverse to the mounting recess <b>30</b>, the second component <b>10</b> may include a through hole <b>36</b> in which a screw can be inserted upon assembly for securing the gliding block <b>16</b> within the mounting recess <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, an indexing structure for preventing a rotation of the guiding blocks <b>16</b> arranged in the mounting recesses <b>30</b>. For example, a projection <b>32</b> for engaging a corresponding recess (not shown) of the gliding block <b>16</b> may be provided for hindering the rotation of the gliding block <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the illustrated embodiment, each mounting recess <b>30</b> comprises a step <b>34</b>. The step acts as an abutment surface for the gliding blocks <b>16</b>, once they are inserted into the mounting recess <b>30</b> of each branch from the outside towards the inside of the joint prosthesis <b>1</b>. In other words, the gliding blocks <b>16</b> can be pushed into the mounting recess <b>30</b> until the gliding blocks <b>16</b> abut against said step <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the illustrated embodiment shows a step <b>34</b> in the mounting recesses <b>30</b> of the second component <b>10</b>, alternative means to limit insertion of the gliding blocks <b>16</b> are conceivable. For example, instead of a step <b>34</b> a protrusion or a pin limiting insertion of the gliding block <b>16</b> may be used.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As yet another alternative, the gliding blocks may comprise a protrusion or the like and the second component <b>10</b> may comprise a kerf, groove or cut-out portion so that insertion of the gliding blocks <b>16</b> is limited when the projection of the gliding block <b>16</b> reaches the end of the groove, cut-out portion or kerf.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As mentioned above, each mounting recess <b>30</b> may further comprise a projection <b>32</b> for preventing a rotation of the gliding blocks <b>16</b>. Accordingly, the gliding blocks <b>16</b> comprise a recess <b>58</b> or groove, which engages the projection <b>32</b> upon insertion of the gliding block <b>16</b> into the mounting recess <b>30</b> of the second component <b>10</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to said configuration and alternatively the gliding block <b>16</b> may comprise a projection while the second component <b>10</b> comprises a corresponding recess.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">To facilitate the insertion of the first component <b>12</b> and specifically the joint member <b>12</b>B thereof into the second component <b>10</b>, cut-out portions <b>38</b> are preferably formed in each of the mounting recesses <b>30</b>. This facilitates insertion of the joint member <b>12</b>B of the first component <b>12</b> and in particular projections <b>44</b> of this component described in more detail below into the second component <b>10</b> since the cut-out portions <b>38</b> at least reduce the necessity of having to rotate or twist the first component <b>12</b> during assembly.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first component <b>12</b> comprises a bone member <b>12</b>A and a joint member <b>12</b>B. The joint member <b>12</b>B comprises outward spherical sections <b>42</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show spherical sections <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B both of which spherical sections <b>42</b> also comprise a projection <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B, respectively. The projections <b>44</b> define a first pivotal axis of the first component <b>12</b> for the dominant degree of freedom in terms of range of motion.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the illustrated embodiment, the two projections <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B have a conical shape with the circumference of the projections <b>44</b> being reduced the further the projection is away from the spherical sections <b>42</b>. The present invention is, however, not limited to conically shaped projections and any shape of projection is conceivable, as long as the projection can limit the range of motion of the joint, as will be further explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The joint member <b>12</b>B of the first component <b>12</b> preferably comprises an interface part for engaging the bone member <b>12</b>A. In the illustrated embodiment, this interface is configured as hole <b>40</b> for inserting a corresponding interface part of the bone member <b>12</b>A, the interface part of the bone member <b>12</b>A being preferably formed as a protrusion. The interface between the bond member <b>12</b>A and the joint member <b>12</b>B is preferable configured as a conical connection. As already described above, the configuration of the bone members of the joint prosthesis <b>1</b> depends on the bone tissue the bone member is to be anchored to. For example, for an adjacent long bone, a bone member is preferably anchored using an implant stem such as the implant stem of the bone member <b>12</b>A illustrated in the figures. For smaller bones other structures may be used such as fins, pins, or screws.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the outward (i. e. convex) spherical sections <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B are extending in opposite directions and are symmetrical in relation to a plane C so as to form a convex spherical joint surface. This joint surface is configured to interact with a concave spherical joint surface formed by the inward spherical sections <b>52</b> of the gliding block via a surface contact. They are preferably formed as an integral part of the joint member <b>12</b>B. The spherical joint surface of the outward spherical sections <b>42</b> enhances the stability and reduces wear of the joint prosthesis <b>1</b> as it provides for a varus-valgus movement about a second pivotal axis of the joint while substantially keeping a surface contact area. In other words, this configuration allows for a rotation about the first and second pivotal axes without a substantial change of the size of the surface contact area. Rotation about the first pivotal axis of the first component <b>12</b> allows for a range of motion of the joint in flexion-extension (e. g. for an elbow joint in a range of 0&#xb0; to 160&#xb0;). Rotation about the second pivotal axis of the first component <b>12</b> allows for a smaller range of motion in varus-valgus (e. g. approximately &#xb1;5&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> show a three-dimensional view of a gliding block <b>16</b>. The gliding block <b>16</b> comprises an inward (i. e. concave) spherical section <b>52</b> and a hole <b>50</b> formed in the center of the inward spherical section <b>52</b>. Upon assembly, a projection <b>44</b> is inserted into hole <b>50</b>. While the present embodiment comprises two projections <b>44</b> that are inserted into holes <b>50</b> of the gliding blocks, respectively, the invention is not limited thereto, and the presence of only one projection to limit the range of motion may suffice. When being mounted to the joint member <b>12</b>B, the inward spherical sections <b>52</b> of the gliding blocks form a concave spherical joint surface.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The gliding block <b>16</b> further comprises a step <b>55</b>, which engages step <b>34</b> of mounting recess <b>30</b> upon insertion into the second component <b>10</b>. Gliding block <b>16</b> further comprises a threaded hole <b>5</b>, in which a screw <b>18</b> can be inserted to secure the gliding block <b>16</b> in the mounting recess <b>30</b> of the second component <b>10</b>. Gliding block <b>16</b> also comprises a recess <b>58</b>, which cooperates with projection <b>32</b> of the mounting recess <b>30</b> for preventing rotation of the gliding block <b>16</b> within the mounting recess <b>30</b> of the second component <b>10</b> and providing guidance during assembly. Insertion of the gliding block <b>16</b> is preferably facilitated by the opening of recess <b>58</b> being chamfered. Preventing rotation of the gliding block <b>16</b> also facilitates the insertion of screw <b>18</b> through hole <b>36</b> of the joint member of the second component <b>10</b> and into the threaded hole <b>56</b>. More specifically, the illustrated configuration assists in aligning holes <b>36</b> and <b>56</b> upon insertion of gliding block <b>16</b> into mounting recess <b>30</b> due to the cooperation of recess <b>58</b> and projection <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view showing the concave joint surface of the inward spherical sections <b>52</b> of the two gliding blocks <b>16</b> in contact with the convex joint surface of the outward spherical sections <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B of the joint member <b>12</b>B. A similar configuration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, where the gliding blocks <b>16</b> are depicted in a transparent configuration for the detailed description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> further down below.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is also a perspective view of two gliding blocks <b>16</b> being in engagement with the joint member <b>12</b>B of the first component <b>12</b>. In addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the second component <b>10</b> is shown and the gliding blocks <b>16</b> are located in the mounting recesses <b>30</b> of this component. One of the gliding blocks <b>16</b> is already secured via a screw <b>18</b> to the second component <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the following, the varus-valgus movement of the first component <b>12</b> will be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>. As described above, the outward spherical sections <b>42</b> of the first component <b>12</b> are configured to be in engagement (i. e. in contact) with the inward spherical sections <b>52</b> of the gliding blocks <b>16</b>. Two projections <b>44</b> are inserted into two holes <b>50</b> of the gliding blocks <b>16</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the hole <b>50</b> is preferably cylindrical.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The hole <b>50</b> of a gliding block <b>16</b> and the projection <b>44</b> extending centrally from the outward spherical section <b>42</b> of the first component <b>12</b> are formed so that they are not in contact between a neutral position (i. e. the longitudinal axis of the projection <b>44</b> is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the hole <b>50</b>) and up to but excluding a maximum deflection of a varus-valgus movement. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates, at maximum deflection the outer surface of the projection <b>44</b> is in contact with (abuts) the inner surface of the hole <b>50</b>. In other words, the interaction between the projection <b>44</b> and the hole <b>50</b> acts as a stop for limiting the varus-valgus movement of the joint prosthesis <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows the varus-valgus movement of the first component <b>12</b> about the second pivotal axis, wherein the center configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows the first component <b>12</b> in a neutral position. Preferably, the projections <b>44</b> are substantially centered within holes <b>50</b> of the gliding blocks in said neutral position. The left and right configurations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> show the limits of the varus-valgus movement of the joint.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As explained above, the projections <b>44</b> serve to limit the varus-valgus movement of the first component <b>12</b>. This limitation of the range of motion of the joint can be adjusted by adjusting the ratio of the diameter of the hole <b>50</b> of the gliding block <b>16</b> to the diameter of projections <b>44</b>. The smaller the projections are in diameter in comparison to the diameter of hole <b>50</b>, the more movement, i.e. range of motion in varus-valgus direction and rotation of the first component <b>12</b> is possible. In contrast, when the diameter of holes <b>50</b> of gliding blocks <b>16</b> and projections <b>44</b> are almost the same (i. e. they still allow a rotation about the first pivotal axis), hardly any movement is possible.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">More specifically, the base of the conical projection <b>44</b> is preferably circular and has a smaller diameter than the diameter of the cylindrical hole <b>50</b>. This allows for a rotation about the center of the outward spherical sections <b>42</b>, i. e. the varus-valgus movement.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Limiting the range of motion via a projection <b>44</b> and a hole <b>50</b> is advantageous since it defines a limitation for the varus-valgus movement and distributes the abutment force more evenly. Further, allowing a defined amount of varus-valgus movement allows for a better adaptation to the kinematics of a patient's body, which in turn reduces wear of the joint, and at the same time provides predictable behavior of the joint (i. e. it prevents slackness of the joint).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is beneficial to form the gliding blocks <b>16</b> out of UHMWPE and in particular X-Linked PE and/or Vitamin-E X-Linked PE. These materials have excellent properties for absorbing peak forces (e. g. when reaching the limits of the varus-valgus movement) and have advantageous wear characteristics. These materials have also proven to have the gliding performance needed for artificial joints.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is particularly preferred to form the projections <b>44</b> with a conical shape so that the contact surface between the inner surface of hole <b>50</b> and the outer surface of projections <b>44</b> is basically established by a line contact.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Although it is particularly preferred that a conical projection <b>44</b> interacts with a cylindrical hole <b>50</b>, other configurations may be implemented for establishing a line contact at maximum deflection of the varus-valgus movement. For example, the hole <b>50</b> may be conical and the projection <b>44</b> may be cylindrical. It is also possible that both the hole <b>50</b> and the projection <b>44</b> have a conical shape.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The projection <b>44</b> and the hole <b>50</b> are configured to allow for a rotation about the center of the outward spherical sections <b>42</b> enabling a varus-valgus movement of the joint prosthesis <b>1</b>. This is possible due to an increasing gap between the inner circumference of the hole <b>50</b> and the outer circumference of the projection <b>44</b> (for example in the neutral position in relation to each other), wherein the gap increases in a direction away from the center of the outward spherical sections <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A to <b>8</b>C</figref>, the assembly of the joint prosthesis <b>1</b> will be explained. The first component <b>12</b> comprising the bone member <b>12</b>A and the joint member <b>12</b>B is inserted into the second component <b>10</b>, i. e. into the yoke of the second component <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the projections <b>44</b> of the joint member <b>12</b>B comprising the outward spherical sections <b>42</b> are inserted through cut-out portions for arranging the first component <b>12</b> between the two branches of the second component <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">After insertion of the first component <b>12</b> into the second component <b>10</b>, gliding blocks <b>16</b> are inserted into mounting recesses <b>30</b> of the second component <b>10</b> so as to engage with the outward spherical sections <b>42</b>A and <b>42</b>B as described above.
