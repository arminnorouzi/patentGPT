The watchlist of a user can include the list of assets that are curated based on information associated with the user's social network.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0088">At operation <b>1830</b>, the processing logic identifies, in response to an action by one or more of the set of users in the social network, information relating to an asset associated with the watchlist. In an embodiment, the information can include metadata associated with the asset (e.g., metadata collected from one or more metadata sources), a rating associated with the asset, a comment associated with the asset, a review associated with the asset, an indication associated with the asset, a recommendation associated with the asset, etc. In an embodiment, the information relating to the asset can be captured in response to an action executed by a user in the social network via one or more interfaces of the social network-based content curation system.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0089">At operation <b>1840</b>, the processing logic generates an update to at least a portion of the graph, where the update includes information relating to the asset associated with the watchlist. In an embodiment, having identified the update to the watchlist in view of the action by a member of the user's social network, the processing logic updates the user's graph in the graph database. In an embodiment, the watchlist represented by the graph of the user is updated to include the update including the information associated with the asset (e.g., a comment about the asset, a recommendation relating to the asset, an indication relating to the asset, etc.). For example, if the update includes a post associated with a first asset (e.g., a TV show) from a first friend in the social network, the watchlist for the user is updated to include the post information.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0090">At operation <b>1850</b>, the processing logic causes, via a user system associated with the user, a generation of an interface including at least a portion of the watchlist including the update. In an embodiment, the user system can be any device (e.g., a mobile device, a television, etc.) that is associated with the user. In an embodiment, the user system can be associated with the user by way of a login procedure using an application corresponding to the social network-based content curation system (e.g., a mobile application installed on a mobile device or an on-screen application associated with a television-related device such as a smart TV, IoT device, etc.).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0091">In an embodiment, the interface associated with the application can include at least a portion of the watchlist including the update. For example, the interface can display the asset and the corresponding update to enable the provisioning of the social network-based information concerning the asset to be displayed to the user.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0092">According to embodiments, further features and functions associated with managing a social network-based watchlist on behalf of a user can be executed in connection with the process <b>1800</b>, as described in detail above. For example, in an embodiment, the update can include the addition of an asset (e.g., a TV show, a movie, etc.) to the watchlist associated with the user. In response to the addition of the asset, a link can be established between the asset in the graph of the user stored in the graph database and a metadata repository to enable the provisioning of updated information relating to the asset via the user's watchlist.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0093">In an embodiment, the watchlist can be checked or reviewed by the user via one or more interfaces of an application associated with the social network-based content curation system (e.g., a mobile application or an on-screen application). In an embodiment, the user can view the updated watchlist including a listing of assets and related information (e.g., posts relating to the one or more assets, comments relating to the one or more assets, metadata associated with the one or more assets, etc.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0094">In an embodiment, the assets included within the watchlist can be ranked or ordered in accordance with one or more heuristics. In an embodiment, the user can interact with an asset listed in the watchlist to enable the selection of the asset for viewing. In an embodiment, in response to the interaction with the asset via the watchlist, a corresponding content provider service (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, etc.) can be launched via the user system. The content provider service can be directed to a location associated with the selected asset, to enable the user to interact with the asset in the content provider service (e.g., play the selected asset, review data associated with the data, etc.).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0095">According to embodiments, the user-personalized watchlist (e.g., a listing of assets) and actions relating to the watchlist (e.g., comments, posts, recommendations, etc.) can be arranged in a feed configuration (e.g., in a newsfeed-type arrangement) for display via an interface of a user system. In an embodiment, the user-personalized feed includes an ordered listing of the watchlist and actions and activities of the members of the user's social network.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates an example computer system <b>1900</b> operating in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.
