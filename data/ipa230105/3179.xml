In particular, the evaporated fuel processing device is configured to adsorb the evaporated fuel in a canister and to desorb the adsorbed evaporated fuel, thereby introducing (purging) the desorbed evaporated fuel into the engine. Such an evaporated fuel processing device typically includes a vapor conduit communicating between the fuel tank and the canister, a shut-off valve (which may be referred to as a flow control valve) configured to open and close the vapor conduit, and a float valve configured to prevent fuel contained in the fuel tank from flowing into the vapor conduit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The shut-off valve may include a casing including a fluid-flow channel, a valve seat disposed in the fluid-flow channel and having a valve hole, an electric motor disposed in the casing, and a valve body disposed in the casing and configured to be axially moved toward and away from the valve seat. The valve body is configured such that a lift distance (stroke) thereof may be controlled by the electric motor via a feed screw mechanism, thereby opening and closing the valve hole of the valve seat. Thus, the valve hole of the valve body is controllably opened and closed by controlling the lift distance of the valve body. That is, an opening area or effective flow passage area of the fluid-flow channel (i.e., a flow rate of the evaporated fuel flowing through the fluid-flow channel) is controlled only by controlling the lift distance of the valve body. Therefore, the shut-off valve exhibits linear characteristics in which the flow rate of the evaporated fuel flowing through the fluid-flow channel is linearly or proportionally changed with respect to the lift distance of the valve body.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, when a refueling operation is performed, a depressurizing operation of the fuel tank is performed prior to start of the refueling operation. That is, the shut-off valve is opened so as to reduce a tank inner pressure of the fuel tank before a filler cap attached to a filler pipe of the fuel tank is removed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a flow control valve includes a housing including a fluid-flow channel, a valve seat positioned in the fluid-flow channel and including a valve hole, an electric motor disposed in the housing, and a valve body configured to be axially moved toward and away from the valve seat by the electric motor via a feed screw mechanism. The valve body includes a straight projecting portion. The projecting portion is positioned in the valve hole in an initial valve body lifting range in which a lift distance of the valve body relative to the valve seat is not greater than a predetermined lift distance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the aspect, a flow rate of fluids flowing through the fluid-flow channel may be prevented from increasing in a portion of the initial valve body lifting range. That is, the flow rate of the fluids flowing through the fluid-flow channel may be strictly controlled in the initial valve body lifting range of the valve body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, in another aspect of the present disclosure, an evaporated fuel processing device configured to process evaporated fuel generated in a fuel tank of a vehicle equipped with an internal-combustion engine may include a canister configured to adsorb and desorb the evaporated fuel, a vapor conduit connecting the canister and the fuel tank, a flow control valve configured to open and close the vapor conduit, and a float valve configured to prevent fuel in the fuel tank from flowing into the vapor conduit. The flow control valve comprises a housing including a fluid-flow channel, a valve seat positioned in the fluid-flow channel and including a valve hole, an electric motor disposed in the housing, and a valve body configured to be axially moved toward and away from the valve seat by the electric motor via a feed screw mechanism.

That is, a shut-off valve is opened so as to reduce a tank inner pressure of the fuel tank before a filler cap attached to a filler pipe of the fuel tank is removed. However, in a conventional shut-off valve, if the shut-off valve is quickly opened, evaporated fuel within the fuel tank may swiftly flow into the vapor conduit, thereby producing a large dynamic pressure within the vapor conduit. The float valve may be closed in response to the dynamic pressure. However, if the float valve is closed during the depressurizing operation of the fuel tank, such a depressurizing operation cannot be performed smoothly. Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved shut-off valve (i.e., flow control valve) and an improved evaporated fuel processing device including such an improved shut-off valve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following, a detailed representative embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>. This embodiment is directed to a shut-off valve or flow control valve and an evaporated fuel processing device including the shut-off valve, which may be used in an engine system of a vehicle (automobile).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the evaporated fuel processing device (labeled with a reference numeral <b>12</b>) is included in an engine system (labeled with a reference numeral <b>10</b>) of the vehicle. The engine system <b>10</b> includes an engine (internal-combustion engine) <b>14</b> and a fuel tank <b>15</b> that stores fuel to be fed to the engine <b>14</b>. The fuel tank <b>15</b> has a filler pipe <b>16</b> connected thereto. The filler pipe <b>16</b> has an enlarged filler pipe opening formed on an upper end thereof. The filler pipe opening is equipped with a detachable filler cap <b>17</b>. Further, the upper end of the filler pipe <b>16</b> is in fluid communication with a gas phase in the fuel tank <b>15</b> via a breather pipe <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the fuel tank <b>15</b> is provided with a fuel-feeding device <b>19</b> disposed therein. The fuel-feeding device <b>19</b> includes a fuel pump <b>20</b> configured to suck up the fuel stored in the fuel tank <b>15</b> and to pressurize and discharge the fuel, a fuel sender gauge <b>21</b> configured to detect a fuel level in the fuel tank <b>15</b>, and a tank inner pressure sensor <b>22</b> configured to detect the pressure within the fuel tank <b>15</b> as a relative pressure relative to an atmospheric pressure. The fuel sucked up from the fuel tank <b>15</b> by the fuel pump <b>20</b> is fed to the engine <b>14</b>, in particular, to a delivery pipe <b>26</b> having injectors <b>25</b> corresponding to combustion chambers of the engine <b>14</b>. The fuel is then injected into an induction conduit <b>27</b> by the injectors <b>25</b>. Further, the induction conduit <b>27</b> is provided with an air cleaner <b>28</b>, an air flow meter <b>29</b>, and a throttle valve <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the evaporated fuel processing device <b>12</b> includes a vapor conduit <b>31</b>, a purge conduit <b>32</b>, and a canister <b>34</b>. The canister <b>34</b> is in fluid communication with the gas phase in the fuel tank <b>15</b> via the vapor conduit <b>31</b>. The canister <b>34</b> is in fluid communication with the induction conduit <b>27</b> via the purge conduit <b>32</b>. The canister <b>34</b> is filled with activated carbon (not shown), which functions as a fuel vapor adsorbing material. The evaporated fuel generated in the fuel tank <b>15</b> is introduced into the canister <b>34</b> via the vapor conduit <b>31</b> and is then adsorbed by the adsorbing material (the activated carbon).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the vapor conduit <b>31</b> is provided with an ORVR (On Board Refueling Vapor Recovery) valve <b>35</b> and a cut off valve <b>36</b> that are attached to an upstream end thereof. The upstream end of the vapor conduit <b>31</b> is introduced into the fuel tank <b>15</b> in such a manner that the ORVR valve <b>35</b> and the cut off valve <b>36</b> are positioned in the gas phase in the fuel tank <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The ORVR valve <b>35</b> is a full tank fuel level limiting valve device having a float <b>35</b><i>a </i>configured to open and close due to a buoyancy force of the fuel in the fuel tank <b>15</b>. The ORVR valve <b>35</b> is configured such that the float <b>35</b><i>a </i>closes a passage leading into the vapor conduit <b>31</b> when a fuel level of the fuel tank <b>15</b> reaches a full tank fuel level, thereby preventing the fuel in the fuel tank <b>15</b> from flowing into the vapor conduit <b>31</b>. When the ORVR valve <b>35</b> is closed during refueling, the refueling operation is eventually stopped due to an automatic stop mechanism of a fuel filling nozzle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cut off valve <b>36</b> has a float <b>36</b><i>a </i>configured to open and close due to a buoyancy force of the fuel in the fuel tank <b>15</b>. The cut off valve <b>36</b> is configured such that the float <b>36</b><i>a </i>closes the passage leading into the vapor conduit <b>31</b> when the fuel level of the fuel tank <b>15</b> reaches a predetermined level (e.g., when the fuel tank <b>15</b> is inclined at an angle greater than a predetermined angle by a rollover accident of the vehicle), thereby preventing the fuel in the fuel tank <b>15</b> from flowing into the vapor conduit <b>31</b>. Further, the cut off valve <b>36</b> is positioned at a vertical position or level higher than the ORVR valve <b>35</b>. The cut off valve <b>36</b> and the ORVR valve <b>35</b> may each be referred to as a float valve.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the vapor conduit <b>31</b> is provided with a shut-off valve <b>38</b>. The shut-off valve <b>38</b> is a motor-operated valve including a stepping motor. The shut-off valve <b>38</b> is configured to control an axial movement or stroke of a valve body thereof, thereby controlling a lift amount or distance of the valve body (i.e., a valve opening degree). The shut-off valve <b>38</b> will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the purge conduit <b>32</b> is provided with a purge valve <b>40</b>. The purge valve <b>40</b> is a motor-operated valve including a stepping motor. The purge valve <b>40</b> is configured to control a stroke of a valve body thereof, thereby controlling the degree of valve opening. Alternatively, the purge valve <b>40</b> may be a solenoid valve including an electromagnetic solenoid configured to be closed in a non-energized condition and to be opened in an energized condition.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the canister <b>34</b> is provided with a selector valve <b>41</b> and an atmospheric conduit <b>42</b> extends from the selector valve <b>41</b>. The selector valve <b>41</b> is a solenoid valve including an electromagnetic solenoid configured to be closed in a non-energized condition and to be opened in an energized condition. The atmospheric conduit <b>42</b> is open to the atmosphere and is provided with an air filter <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the shut-off valve <b>38</b>, the purge valve <b>40</b>, and the selector valve <b>41</b> are electrically connected to an ECU (engine control unit) <b>45</b>. The ECU <b>45</b> is electrically connected to a tank inner pressure sensor <b>22</b>, a lid switch <b>46</b>, a lid opener <b>47</b>, and a display device <b>49</b>. The lid opener <b>47</b> is a locking device attached to a vehicle body (not shown) and configured to lock or unlock a lid <b>48</b> for covering the filler pipe opening equipped with the filler cap <b>17</b>. Further, the lid opener <b>47</b> is connected to a manual lid opening and closing device (not shown) that is configured to manually open or close the lid <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the lid switch <b>46</b> is manipulated to open the lid <b>48</b>, a corresponding signal is sent to the ECU <b>45</b>. Consequently, the lid opener <b>47</b> can be activated based on the signal from the ECU <b>45</b>, so as to unlock the lid <b>48</b>. Further, the lid opener <b>47</b> may also be activated when the lid <b>48</b> is opened by manipulating the manual lid opening and closing device. The ECU <b>45</b> may also be referred to herein as a control device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Before describing the shut-off valve <b>38</b>, a basic operation of the evaporated fuel processing device <b>12</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a condition in which the vehicle is parked (i.e., the engine <b>14</b> is stopped), the shut-off valve <b>38</b>, the purge valve <b>40</b>, and the selector valve <b>41</b> are in a closed condition. Because the shut-off valve <b>38</b> is closed, the evaporated fuel in the fuel tank <b>15</b> is prevented from flowing into the canister <b>34</b>. Conversely, air in the canister is prevented from flowing into the fuel tank <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a condition in which the vehicle is moving, the ECU <b>45</b> performs an operation to purge the evaporated fuel adsorbed in the canister <b>34</b> provided that predetermined purging conditions are met. In such a purging operation, the purge valve <b>40</b> is controlled while the selector valve <b>41</b> is kept in an open condition. When the purge valve <b>40</b> is opened, a manifold vacuum pressure of the engine <b>14</b> is applied to the canister <b>34</b> via the purge conduit <b>32</b>. As a result, the evaporated fuel in the canister <b>34</b> is purged into the induction conduit <b>27</b> with air inhaled through the atmospheric conduit <b>42</b>, so as to be combusted in the engine <b>14</b>. Further, the ECU <b>45</b> may hold the shut-off valve <b>38</b> in an open condition only for a period of time during a purging operation, thereby holding the inner pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> close to atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a condition in which the vehicle is stopped, when the lid switch <b>46</b> is manipulated for performing a refueling operation, the shut-off valve <b>38</b> is opened by the ECU <b>45</b>. At this time, if the tank inner pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is greater than atmospheric pressure, the evaporated fuel in the fuel tank <b>15</b> can be introduced into the canister <b>34</b> through the vapor conduit <b>31</b> at the same time when the shut-off valve <b>38</b> is opened, so as to be adsorbed by the adsorbing material in the canister <b>34</b>. Thus, the evaporated fuel is prevented from being released to the atmosphere. Consequently, the inner pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> can be reduced to a pressure close to atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the inner pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is reduced to a pressure close to atmospheric pressure, the ECU <b>45</b> sends the signal for unlocking the lid <b>48</b> to the lid opener <b>47</b>. The lid opener <b>47</b> may be activated based on the signal from the ECU <b>45</b>, so as to unlock the lid <b>48</b>. As a result, the lid <b>48</b> is placed in a condition in which it can be opened. In this condition, the filler cap <b>17</b> is removed after the lid <b>48</b> is opened, so that the refueling operation can be performed.

Further, an axial length of the housing <b>52</b> may slightly change in response to changes in temperatures. For example, the length of the housing <b>52</b> may be increased due to thermal expansion.

As a result, the guide member <b>56</b> may move upward relative to the valve seat <b>67</b>. However, the valve body <b>58</b> is prevented from moving due to the spring force of the valve spring <b>60</b>. Thus, the valve body <b>58</b> may be reliably seated on the valve seat <b>67</b>. To the contrary, the length of the housing <b>52</b> may be reduced due to thermal contraction. In such a case, the distance (interval) between the electric motor <b>54</b> and the valve seat <b>67</b> may be reduced. As a result, the guide member <b>56</b> may move downward toward the valve seat <b>67</b>.

As a result, the sealing portion <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the sealing member <b>90</b> attached to the valve body <b>58</b> is gradually spaced apart from the valve seat <b>67</b>.

In particular, a flow rate of the fluids flowing through the fluid-flow channel <b>65</b> may linearly increase with respect to the lift distance of the valve body <b>58</b>.

This means that the flow rate of the fluids flowing through the fluid-flow channel <b>65</b> are strictly controlled.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The shut-off valve <b>38</b> is configured such that the hollow portion <b>93</b> is formed in the valve closed condition. The hollow portion <b>93</b> is in fluid communication with the annular space <b>102</b> formed between the valve hole <b>68</b> of the valve seat <b>67</b> and the hollow cylindrical projecting portion <b>89</b>. As a result, a flow rate control of the fluids by the first squeezing portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>can be smoothly and definitely changed to a flow rate control of the fluids by the second squeezing portion <b>102</b><i>a</i>. This may reduce fluctuation in the flow rate of the fluids.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The shut-off valve <b>38</b> includes the guide member <b>56</b> configured to be axially moved by the feed screw mechanism <b>83</b>, the coupling mechanisms <b>95</b> configured to couple or decouple the guide member <b>56</b> and the valve body <b>58</b>, and the valve spring <b>60</b> configured to vertically bias the guide member <b>56</b> and the valve body <b>58</b> axially apart. Therefore, even if a distance between the electric motor <b>54</b> and the valve seat <b>67</b> is changed due to change of dimension of the housing <b>52</b> with temperature change, such a change can be absorbed by relative displacement of the guide member <b>56</b> and the valve body <b>58</b>. This may reduce failure of a sealing performance of the valve body <b>58</b> or malfunction of the valve body <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, according to the evaporated fuel processing device <b>12</b> including the shut-off valve <b>38</b>, when the shut-off valve <b>38</b> is opened in order to reduce the tank inner pressure of the fuel tank <b>15</b> (i.e., in order to perform a depressurizing operation of the fuel tank <b>15</b>) before the filler cap<b>17</b> is removed, the evaporated fuel within the fuel tank <b>15</b> may be prevented from swiftly flowing into the vapor conduit <b>31</b>, thereby preventing a large dynamic pressure from being generated within the vapor conduit <b>31</b>. As a result, the ORVR valve <b>35</b> and the cut off valve <b>36</b> are prevented from being closed due to the dynamic pressure. Thus, the depressurizing operation of the fuel tank <b>15</b> can be smoothly performed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Naturally, various changes and modifications may be made to the embodiment of the shut-off valve <b>38</b> disclosed herein. For example, the shut-off valve <b>38</b> may be applied to various devices other than the evaporated fuel processing device <b>12</b>. Further, the guide member <b>56</b> may be omitted. The electric motor <b>54</b> may be an electric motor including a feed screw mechanism therein and having an (nonrotatable) output shaft that is connected to the feed screw mechanism. In such a case, the output shaft may be integrally connected to the guide member <b>56</b>. Further, the hollow cylindrical projecting portion <b>89</b> formed on the valve body <b>58</b> may be replaced with a rectangular hollow cylindrical projecting portion or a solid cylindrical projecting portion. Further, the tapered chamfered portion <b>89</b><i>a </i>formed in the hollow cylindrical projecting portion <b>89</b> may be omitted as necessary.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A representative example of the present disclosure has been described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.
