Each processing unit may perform a similar compression operation. The processing unit may be referred to as a coding tree unit (CTU) or a largest coding unit (LCU). Finer division can be further performed on the CTU, to obtain one or more basic coding units (CUs). The CU is the most basic element in a coding process. Some concepts involved in encoding the CU are described below:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Predictive coding: The predictive coding includes modes such as intra prediction and inter prediction. After an original video signal is predicted by using a selected reconstructed video signal, a residual video signal is obtained. The encoder side needs to determine which predictive coding mode to select for the current CU, and inform the decoder side. Intra prediction: A predicted signal comes from a region in a same image that has been encoded and reconstructed. Inter prediction means that a predicted signal comes from another image (referred to as a reference image) that has been encoded and that is different from a current image.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Transform &#x26; Quantization: A residual video signal is transformed into a transform domain through a transform operation such as discrete fourier transform (DFT) or discrete cosine transform (DCT), and is referred to as a transform coefficient. A lossy quantization operation is performed on the transform coefficient, to lose some information, so that the quantized signal is beneficial to a compressed expression. In some video encoding standards, there may be more than one transform mode to select from. Therefore, the encoder side also needs to select one of the more than one transform mode for a current CU, and inform the decoder side. The fineness of quantization usually depends on a quantization parameter (QP). A larger value of the QP represents that coefficients within a larger range will be quantized as a same output, and therefore, may usually bring a larger distortion and a lower bit rate. Conversely, a smaller value of the QP represents that coefficients within a smaller range will be quantized as a same output, and therefore, may usually bring a smaller distortion while corresponding to a higher bit rate.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Entropy coding or statistical coding: Statistical compression coding is performed quantized transform domain signals according to frequencies of occurrence of values, and finally, a binarized (0 or 1) compressed bitstream is outputted. In addition, entropy coding also needs to be performed other information, such as a selected encoding mode and a motion vector, generated through encoding, to reduce a bit rate. Statistical coding is a lossless coding mode that can effectively reduce a bit rate required for expressing a same signal. Common statistical coding modes include Variable Length Coding (VLC) or Content Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Loop filtering: Operations of inverse quantization, inverse transform, and prediction compensation are performed on a signal that has been encoded, to obtain a reconstructed image. Compared with an original image, the reconstructed image has some information different from that of the original image due to impact of quantization. That is, the reconstructed image may generate a distortion. Therefore, a filtering operation may be performed on the reconstructed image. For example, a filter, such as a deblocking filter (DB), a sample adaptive offset (SAO) filter, or an adaptive loop filter (ALF), can effectively reduce a degree of distortion generated by quantization. Because the filtered reconstructed image is used as a reference for subsequently encoding an image and is used for predicting a future image signal, the foregoing filtering operation is also referred to as loop filtering, that is, a filtering operation in an encoding loop.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a basic flowchart of a video encoding process. In this procedure, descriptions are provided by using intra prediction as an example. A different operation is performed on an original image signal s<sub>k</sub>[x,y] and a predicted image signal &#x15d;<sub>k</sub>[x,y], to obtain a residual signal u<sub>k</sub>[x,y]. After the residual signal u<sub>k</sub>[x,y] is transformed and quantized, a quantization coefficient is obtained. On the one hand, an encoded bitstream is obtained through entropy coding on the quantization coefficient, and on the other hand, a reconstructed residual signal u&#x2032;<sub>k</sub>[x,y] is obtained through quantization and inverse transform processing on the quantization coefficient. The predicted image signal s<sub>k</sub>[x,y] and the reconstructed residual signal u&#x2032;<sub>k</sub>[x,y] are superimposed to generate an image signal s<sub>k</sub>*[x,y]. On the one hand, the image signal s<sub>k</sub>*[x,y] is inputted to an intra mode decision module and an intra prediction module intra prediction processing, and on the other hand, a reconstructed image signal s&#x2032;<sub>k</sub>[x,y] is outputted through loop filtering. The reconstructed image signal s&#x2032;<sub>k</sub>[x,y] may be used as a reference image of a next frame for motion estimation and motion compensation prediction. Then, a predicted image signal &#x15d;<sub>k</sub>[x,y] of the next frame is obtained based on a result s&#x2032;<sub>r</sub>[x+m<sub>x</sub>, y+m<sub>y</sub>] of the motion compensation prediction and an intra prediction result f(s<sub>k</sub>*[x,y]), and the foregoing procedure is continuously repeated until the encoding is completed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, because non-zero coefficients of residual signals in a quantization coefficient block that has been transformed and quantized have a relatively high probability of concentrating in the left and upper regions of the block, while coefficients in the right and lower regions of the block are usually 0, an SRCC technology is introduced. A size SRx&#xd7;SRy of an upper left region of the non-zero coefficients included in each quantization coefficient block (of which a size is W&#xd7;H) can be marked by using the SRCC technology. SRx is a horizontal coordinate of the rightmost non-zero coefficient in the quantization coefficient block, and SRy is a vertical coordinate of the lowermost non-zero coefficient in the quantization coefficient block. In addition, 1&#x2264;SRx&#x2264;W, 1&#x2264;SRy&#x2264;H, and coefficients outside the region are all 0. In the SRCC technology, (SRx, SRy) are used to determine a quantization coefficient region that needs to be scanned in a quantization coefficient block. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, only quantization coefficients within the scan region marked by (SRx, SRy) needs to be encoded. A scanning order of the encoding is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, may be reverse zigzag scanning from the lower right corner to the upper left corner.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Based on the above encoding process, for each CU on the decoder side, after a compressed bitstream (that is, a bitstream) is obtained, entropy decoding is performed to obtain various mode information and quantization coefficients. Then, inverse quantization and inverse transform are performed on the quantization coefficients, to obtain a residual signal. On the other hand, a predicted signal corresponding to the CU may be obtained according to the known encoding mode information, and a reconstructed signal can be obtained by adding the residual signal and the predicted signal. Operations, such as loop filtering, may be further performed on the reconstructed signal, to generate a final output signal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the foregoing encoding and decoding procedures, the residual signal is transformed to concentrate energy of the residual signal in less low-frequency coefficients, that is, most coefficient values are small. Then, after passing a subsequent quantization module, smaller coefficient values become zero values, which greatly reduces the costs of encoding the residual signal. However, due to the diversity of residual distribution, a single DCT transform cannot adapt to all residual characteristics. Therefore, transform kernels, such as DST7 and DCT8, are introduced into the transform processing process, and a horizontal transform and a vertical transform can be performed on the residual signal by using different transform kernels. Using the adaptive multiple core transform (AMT) technology as an example, the following transform combinations may be selected for transforming a residual signal: (DCT2, DCT2), (DCT8, DCT8), (DCT8, DST7), (DST7, DCT8), and (DST7, DST7).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Which transform combination is specifically selected for the residual signal needs to be decided on the encoder side by using rate&#x2014;distortion optimization (RDO). Although the adaptability of the transform matrix combination to the residual block is improved, because an index of a transform kernel needs to be encoded for each coding unit, the encoding efficiency is relatively low.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To resolve the foregoing problems, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide implicitly indicating a transform matrix combination corresponding to a code block by using quantization coefficients in a quantization coefficient block, which can further reduce bits occupied by a transform matrix index, effectively improving the video encoding efficiency.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Implementation details of the technical solutions of the embodiments of the present disclosure are specifically described below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of a video decoding method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Each video image frame can be further divided into slices, and a slice can be further divided into a series of LCUs (or CTUs). The LCU includes a plurality of CUs. The video image frame is encoded by using a block as a unit. In some new video encoding standards. For example, in the H.264 standard, there are macroblocks (MBs). The macroblock can be further divided into a plurality of prediction blocks used for predictive coding. In the HEVC standard, basic concepts, such as the coding unit (CU), the prediction unit (PU), and the transform unit (TU), are used to divide a variety of block units in terms of function, and adopt a novel tree-based structure for description. For example, the CU can be divided into smaller CUs according to the quadtree, and the smaller CU can be further divided, to form a quadtree structure.
