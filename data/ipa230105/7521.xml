For ease of description, services with the high requirements are referred to as hot-spot services, and users of these services are referred to as hot-spot users. To satisfy a high-level requirement of a hot-spot user, one promising solution is to dynamically increase available beams that reach the hot-spot user, where a serving cell dynamically activate a secondary device (for example, a panel or a Large Intelligent Surface (LIS)), so as to increase available beams for the hot-spot user, thereby satisfying high-level requirement of a hot-spot service.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">LIS is a recently emerged device including a number of periodically arranged man-made material units. LIS can change electric and magnetic properties of the surfaces dynamically/semi-statically to affect reflection/refraction of electromagnetic waves that are incident upon LIS. LIS can control reflected waves/refracted waves of electromagnetic waves to implement functions such as beam scanning/beam forming.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Coverage of an LIS-based hot-spot service is enhanced, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic topology diagram of LIS-based coverage enhancement. When there is no hot-spot user in a cell, an LIS node may be in an off state, and a base station uses beams transmitted from the base station to serve users in the serving cell. When there is a hot-spot service, the base station cannot satisfy the high-level requirement of the hot-spot service by using the beams of the base station, so that the LIS node is activated by the base station, and one specific beam of the base station is directed to the LIS node. The LIS node reflects an incident signal from the base station according to a specific rule, and then there are different reflected beams for reflected signals. The hot-spot user receives the beams transmitted from the base station and/or the reflected beams from the LIS node to serve the purpose of hot-spot coverage.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Based on user distribution and service traffic in a cell, a network device needs to adjust a quantity of beams that are to be measured in the cell, to ensure user coverage quality and control measurement complexity and energy consumption. In an existing protocol, measurement and selection of a beam in a fixed beam set are described in a beam management procedure. For a beam set having a dynamic increase or change, all parameters for beam detection need to be re-configured according to the original procedure, leading to low configuration efficiency.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, a Synchronization Signal and PBCH block (SSB) may be used for Radio link monitoring (RLM) measurement on bands in FR2 and can support a maximum of eight beams to be measured. If the base station uses a new secondary device, there will be a larger quantity of candidate beams that may exceed an upper quantity limit of beams to be measured. When the secondary device is enabled, a set of beams for user measurement may have a change. The network device needs to replace several beams in a set of candidate beams with beams from the secondary device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For another example, in a Radio Resource Management (RRM) procedure, a terminal needs to obtain a status of an SSB beam of a neighboring cell to perform RRM measurement. For SSB RRM measurement results, it should be ensured that measurement results with a same SSB index are combined, and the index indicates a beam quality Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) of the SSB beam. There is the same requirement in the measurement of Synchronization Signal Reference Signal Received Quality (SS-RSRQ) and a Synchronization Signal Signal to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SS-SINR). A system performs layer 1 (L1)/layer 3 (L3) filtering based on results of a plurality of times of SSB measurement to determine quality of the neighboring cell. If an SSB beam configuration of the neighboring cell changes, filtering of an RRM measurement result cannot indicate SSB quality of the neighboring cell.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present disclosure provides a measurement configuration method, a terminal, and a network side device, to solve a problem that when there is an instant change of available beams in a cell, original beam measurement data and a terminal configuration cannot be used again due to a change of beam set resources configured for the cell, while beam measurement re-configuration will take a long time, and efficiency of terminal measurement is affected.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a measurement configuration method, performed by a terminal. The method includes:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Step <b>201</b>: receiving indication information transmitted by a first network side device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be noted that the indication information is used to indicate a signal that changes in a target cell.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Step <b>202</b>: performing measurement and/or synchronization based on the signal that changes.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">the target cell includes a serving cell and/or a neighboring cell, and the signal that changes includes at least one of a reference signal or a synchronization signal.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other words, when a signal in the serving cell and/or the neighboring cell changes, the terminal performs a subsequent operation based on a changed signal, and there is no need to re-configure a signal.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted herein that the performing measurement based on the signal that changes mentioned in this embodiment of the present disclosure mainly means that a reference signal or a synchronization signal block that changes is used for channel measurement; and the performing synchronization based on the signal that changes mainly means that a synchronization signal that changes is used for synchronization. It should further be noted that the terminal may further perform time-frequency tracking or neighboring cell measurement based on the synchronization signal that changes.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">After the terminal performs measurement based on the reference signal that changes, the terminal further needs to report a measurement result.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the indication information includes a first association relationship between a first signal set and a second signal set that are of the target cell.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">the first signal set is a set of reference signals and/or synchronization signals after a change in the target cell, and the second signal set is a set of reference signals and/or synchronization signals before the change in the target cell.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A signal in the first signal set includes a signal for channel measurement after a signal change in the target cell, and a signal in the second signal set includes a signal for channel measurement before a signal change in the target cell.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be noted that, because one beam corresponds to at least one reference signal or synchronization signal, that is, beam signal quality is determined by measuring signal quality of a corresponding reference signal, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the first signal set may also be referred to as a first beam set, and the second signal set may also be referred to as a second signal set.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be noted that the serving cell is a serving cell of the terminal, and the neighboring cell is a cell that is other than the serving cell of the terminal and whose reference signal can be detected by the terminal.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should further be noted that the first network side device may transmit the indication information through system information or a paging message. The system information may be Master Information Block (MIB), System Information Block <b>1</b> (SIB <b>1</b>), or the like.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted that the synchronization signal includes a synchronization signal block; and the reference signal includes at least one of Channel State Information-Reference Signal (CSI-RS), Tracking Reference Signal (TRS), or Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first association relationship includes at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A11: First indication information of the target cell, where the first indication information indicates a first signal in the first signal set, and the first signal is a signal that exists after a change in the target cell but not before the change.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be noted that the first indication information indicates a new signal.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To make clear specific information about the new signal, the first indication information may include at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A111: a period of transmitting the first signal;</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A112: Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) of the first signal;</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A113: a frequency domain resource for the first signal;</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A114: a time domain resource for the first signal; or</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A115: a configuration parameter of a message for reporting a channel measurement result of the first signal.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be noted that the configuration parameter may mean a reporting resource, a reporting period, a reporting moment, and the like of a channel measurement result reporting message.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A12: Second indication information of the target cell, where the second indication information indicates a second signal in the second signal set, and the second signal is a signal that exists before a change in the target cell but not after the change.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be noted that the second indication information indicates a reduced signal (that is, a signal that is not to be transmitted). In this case, to reduce signaling overheads of the second indication information, the second indication information may only indicate identity information, for example, a signal index, of the reduced signal.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A13: Third indication information of the target cell, where the third indication information indicates a third signal in the first signal set and a fourth signal in the second signal set, and the third signal and the fourth signal are signals that exist before and after a change in the target cell.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that the signals that exist before and after a change in the target cell are signals with a space-energy distribution that stays unchanged for signal transmission. The third indication information indicates a Quasi co-location (QCL) relationship between the fourth signal and the third signal. For example, the third indication information may indicate identity information of a signal that remains unchanged before a change and identity information, for example, a signal index, of the signal after the change. For example, the third indication information may indicate whether a time and frequency domain resource parameter of a synchronization signal or reference signal corresponding to the signal that remains unchanged has changed, or may indicate a configuration of the time and frequency domain resource parameter of the synchronization signal or reference signal corresponding to the signal that remains unchanged.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, to ensure that the terminal performs signal detection accurately, after the receiving indication information transmitted by a first network side device, the method according to this embodiment of the present disclosure further includes one of the following:</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">B11: determining, based on an indication of a signal change moment in the indication information, a moment when a signal changes.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be noted that, in this case, the indication of the signal change moment is carried in the indication information transmitted by the first network side device, and the indication is used by the terminal to determine the moment when the signal changes.
