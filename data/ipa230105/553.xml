The optical fiber can guide light along a desired path by passing light into the core using total reflection of light at an interface between the core and the cladding.

Therefore, in hair cutting device <b>1</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment, a decrease in light utilization efficiency is suppressed by separating light irradiator <b>40</b> from base <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In particular, in the present exemplary embodiment, a region of adhesive member <b>52</b> interposed between base <b>51</b> and optical waveguide <b>4</b> has thickness D<b>1</b> more than or equal to the wavelength of the light passing through optical waveguide <b>4</b>. Thickness D<b>1</b> of the region of adhesive member <b>52</b> interposed between base <b>51</b> and optical waveguide <b>4</b> means the shortest distance between base <b>51</b> and optical waveguide <b>4</b> opposing each other across adhesive member <b>52</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.

However, when the thickness of adhesive member <b>52</b> interposed between base <b>51</b> and optical waveguide <b>4</b> is small (thin), light may leak to base <b>51</b> due to light (evanescent wave) seeping out to adhesive member <b>52</b> from the interface between optical waveguide <b>4</b> (core <b>41</b>) and adhesive member <b>52</b>. Such an evanescent wave is generated in a range of about one wavelength of light from the interface.

At this time, light irradiator <b>40</b> directly irradiates skin <b>92</b> with second irradiation light Op<b>2</b>, and bump <b>922</b> is mainly irradiated with second irradiation light Op<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">(2.6) Control Circuit</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Next, the configuration of control circuit <b>6</b> of hair cutting system <b>10</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, control circuit <b>6</b> is electrically connected to light source <b>21</b>, battery <b>23</b>, fan <b>24</b>, operation unit <b>26</b>, and the like.

Furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, at least at the time of cutting hair <b>91</b>, the power density of the light passing through optical waveguide <b>4</b> is more than or equal to 50 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, first irradiation light Op<b>1</b> with which light irradiator <b>40</b> irradiates hair <b>91</b> can also have a power density (more than or equal to 50 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) sufficient for cutting hair <b>91</b>.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">In addition, in the present exemplary embodiment, as described above, when the operation mode of light source <b>21</b> is the second mode in which cutting of hair <b>91</b> is prioritized, the time length of light emission period T<b>1</b> of light source <b>21</b> becomes more than or equal to 1/100 seconds. Therefore, for example, in one light emission period T<b>1</b>, hair cutting device <b>1</b> can irradiate hair <b>91</b> with first irradiation light Op<b>1</b> having sufficient energy to cut hair <b>91</b>. Therefore, according to hair cutting device <b>1</b> and hair cutting system <b>10</b> of the present exemplary embodiment, hair <b>91</b> can be cut in a relatively short time. Therefore, according to hair cutting device <b>1</b> and hair cutting system <b>10</b> of the present exemplary embodiment, hair <b>91</b> is less likely to be entangled or caught, and smooth cutting of hair <b>91</b> is easily achieved.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Furthermore, since hair cutting device <b>1</b> and hair cutting system <b>10</b> can cut hair <b>91</b> in a relatively short time. Therefore, hair cutting device <b>1</b> is less likely to stay at one location, and the same location of skin <b>92</b> is less likely to be irradiated with light for a long time. Therefore, skin <b>92</b> is less likely to be damaged.

Therefore, hair cutting device <b>1</b> can appropriately suppress the energy of second irradiation light Op<b>2</b> with which skin <b>92</b> is irradiated to be small in one light emission period T<b>1</b>, for example. Specifically, assuming that the power density of the light passing through optical waveguide <b>4</b> is 50 kW/cm<sup>2 </sup>and that the time length of one light emission period T<b>1</b> is 1/10000 seconds, the energy of second irradiation light Op<b>2</b> per unit area is suppressed to 5 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>at the maximum.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Therefore, according to hair cutting device <b>1</b> and hair cutting system <b>10</b> of the present exemplary embodiment, not only cutting of hair <b>91</b> but also a secondary function such as an action on skin <b>92</b> can be expected.

Uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> including a large number of fine recesses and projections are formed by embossing, for example.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Such uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> are formed of a large number of recesses and projections, and have a pattern (irregularity shape) such as a satin, a wrinkle pattern (emboss), a wood grain, a rock grain, a sand grain, or a geometric pattern as a whole.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">The size of such fine recesses and projections can be expressed by the surface roughness of uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, i.e., the shape of the recesses and projections is reflected on the roughness curve among the contour curves of uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>. Therefore, the size of the recesses and projections on uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> corresponds to calculated average roughness (Ra) of uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>. Therefore, calculated average roughness (Ra) of the inner periphery (uneven surface R<b>2</b>) of the groove (positioner <b>53</b>) is larger than calculated average roughness (Ra) of a region other than the groove (positioner <b>53</b>) in side face <b>512</b> of base <b>51</b>. In other words, the region of base <b>51</b> that comes into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b> is a face that is rougher than the region of base <b>51</b> that does not come into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b>. Similarly, calculated average roughness (Ra) of the outer periphery (uneven surface R<b>1</b>) of cladding <b>42</b> is larger than calculated average roughness (Ra) of the outer periphery of core <b>41</b>. In other words, the regions of optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B that come into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b> are faces that are rougher than the regions of optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B that do not come into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> of optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B may be achieved by a layer of an inorganic member or an organic member including at least one of a plurality of recesses and a plurality of projections formed on the outer periphery of cladding <b>42</b>. Alternatively, uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> of optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B may be achieved by a layer of an inorganic member or an organic member including at least one of a plurality of recesses and a plurality of projections formed on the outer periphery of core <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">Thus, since the region of at least one of base <b>51</b> and optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B that comes into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b> has uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, the adhesive power (adhesion) of adhesive member <b>52</b> between base <b>51</b> and optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B is improved by the anchor effect. As a result, it is easy to improve the durability of the holding structure of optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B with holding member <b>5</b>. Here, an example has been described in which the regions of both base <b>51</b> and optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B that come into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b> have uneven surfaces R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, but the region of only one of base <b>51</b> and optical waveguides <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B that comes into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b> may have an uneven surface. Furthermore, even in an aspect other than the first modification (e.g., the first exemplary embodiment or a modification other than the first modification of the first exemplary embodiment), it is possible to adopt a configuration in which a region of at least one of base <b>51</b> and optical waveguide <b>4</b> that comes into contact with adhesive member <b>52</b> has an uneven surface.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">As in hair cutting device <b>1</b> according to the first modification, when a part of light irradiator <b>40</b> (core <b>41</b>) is exposed from cladding <b>42</b>, adhesive member <b>52</b> only needs to bond cladding <b>42</b> with base <b>51</b>, and does not come into direct contact with light irradiator <b>40</b> (core <b>41</b>). Therefore, the refractive index of adhesive member <b>52</b> does not need to be equal to the refractive index of cladding <b>42</b> or equal to or less than the refractive index of cladding <b>42</b>, and can be appropriately set regardless of the refractive index of cladding <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">(4.2) Second Modification</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">Hair cutting device <b>1</b> according to a second modification of the first exemplary embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>F</figref>.
