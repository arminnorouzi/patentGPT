INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to medical systems, and in particular, but not exclusively to, mapping.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A variety of devices and methods for intracardiac ultrasonic imaging are known in the art. For example, Biosense Webster Inc. (Irvine, Calif.) offers the CartoSound&#x2122; system and SoundStar&#x2122; catheter for producing 3D ultrasound images in real time. The SoundStar&#x2122; catheter, which is inserted through the vascular system into the heart, contains a position sensor and a phased array of ultrasound transducers. The CartoSound&#x2122; system processes the signals from the position sensor and the ultrasound transducers to generate 3D images of the heart chambers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Several methods are known in the art for non-contact reconstruction of the endocardial surface using intracardial ultrasonic imaging. For example, PCT International Publication WO 00/19908 describes a steerable transducer array for intracardial ultrasonic imaging. The array forms an ultrasonic beam, which is steered in a desired direction by an active aperture.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,269 describes an acoustic imaging system based on an ultrasound device that is incorporated into a catheter. The ultrasound device directs ultrasonic signals toward an internal structure in the heart to create an ultrasonic image.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As another example, PCT International Publication WO 99/55233 describes a method for delineating a 3-D surface of a patient's heart. A 3-D mesh model is developed using training data, to serve as an archetypal shape for a population of patient hearts. Multiple ultrasound images of the patient's heart are taken in different image planes. Anatomical locations are manually identified in each of the images. The mesh model is rigidly aligned with the images in respect to the predefined anatomical locations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This sort of manual assistance in delineating contours is common in methods for 3D reconstruction based on ultrasound images. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0241445 describes a method for modeling of an anatomical structure, in which a plurality of ultrasonic images of the anatomical structure are acquired using an ultrasonic sensor, at a respective plurality of spatial positions of the ultrasonic sensor. Location and orientation coordinates of the ultrasonic sensor are measured at each of the plurality of spatial positions. Contours-of-interest that refer to features of the anatomical structure are marked in one or more of the ultrasonic images. A three-dimensional (3D) model of the anatomical structure is constructed, based on the contours-of-interest and on the measured location and orientation coordinates.</p><heading id="h-0003"

level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As previously mentioned, the SoundStar&#x2122; catheter, which is inserted through the vascular system into the heart, contains a position sensor and a phased array of ultrasound transducers to collect images of the heart. The CartoSound&#x2122; system processes the signals from the position sensor and the ultrasound transducers to generate 3D images of the heart chambers.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Ultrasound may provide real-time imaging without the disadvantages of fluoroscopy. The SoundStar&#x2122; catheter also has the advantage of being inserted into one of the cardiac chambers (e.g., right atrium) and can map all the chambers of the heart. During structural heart procedures, left atrial appendage closure procedures and electrophysiological (EP) cases, a physician may use real time ultrasound images to maneuver a catheter in the heart and image heart structures. However, ultrasound images are not straightforward to understand especially for an inexperienced user. Identifying the anatomical structures on an ultrasound image requires experience.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the present invention solve the above problems by annotating 2D ultrasound images with 2D indications of anatomical structures previously added to a 3D anatomical map thereby making the ultrasound images easier to understand. Three-dimensional indications of 3D anatomical structures may be added to a 3D anatomical map either manually by the physician, or automatically using an auto-segmentation method. For example, structures such as right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) and right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) may be indicated on the 3D anatomical map. As the 3D anatomical map is easier to understand than 2D ultrasound images, it is easier to add the indications of the 3D anatomical structures to the 3D anatomical map. For a given 2D ultrasound image, one or more 2D indications of anatomical structures may be added to that 2D ultrasound image based on how that 2D ultrasound image intersects with the 3D anatomical structure(s) in 3D coordinate space in which the ultrasound images were captured. In other words, the 3D anatomical structures are projected onto corresponding 2D ultrasound images as 2D indications of anatomical structures thereby making the ultrasound images easier to understand and useful during procedures. The 2D indications may include borders (e.g., colored borders to match the colors used for the 3D indication of the different anatomical structures shown on the 3D anatomical map) and/or textual labels, e.g., RIPV or RSPV.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">System Description</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, which schematically illustrate a catheter-based ultrasound imaging system <b>20</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a pictorial illustration of the overall system, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the distal end of a probe, such as a catheter <b>28</b>, that is used in the system. This system and catheter are shown here by way of illustration, to assist in understanding the methods of ultrasound-based 3D mapping that are described further below. These methods, however, are not limited to catheter-based ultrasonic sensing and may similarly be applied, mutatis mutandis, using 2D or 3D ultrasound images acquired by other types of probes, both intra- and extra-corporeal. Furthermore, these methods may be used in mapping of other anatomical cavities, not only in the heart.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an operator <b>22</b>, such as a physician, inserts catheter <b>28</b> into the body of a patient <b>26</b>, so that the distal end of the catheter passes through the vascular system into the patient's heart <b>24</b>. The catheter is connected at its proximal end to a console <b>34</b>, which typically comprises a processor <b>38</b> with suitable signal processing and user interface circuits. This processor <b>38</b> receives and processes signals from catheter <b>28</b>, as described hereinbelow. Processor <b>38</b> may comprise a general-purpose computer processor, which is programmed in software to carry out the functions that are described herein. This software may be downloaded to the processor in electronic form, over a network, for example. Alternatively, or additionally, the software may be stored on tangible computer-readable storage media, such as optical, magnetic, or electronic memory media. Further additionally or alternatively, at least some of the functions of the processor may be carried out by a digital signal processor (DSP) or by dedicated or programmable hardware logic circuits.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Typically, console <b>34</b> also enables a user to observe and regulate the functions of catheter <b>28</b> and to view and edit images that are formed using the catheter. For these purposes, the console comprises a display <b>40</b> and a user interface <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the distal end of catheter <b>28</b> comprises an ultrasound imaging device (or probe) <b>50</b>, which is used to produce ultrasound images of the inside of the body. Device <b>50</b> typically comprises a phased array of transducers <b>52</b>, which is operated, as is known in the art, so as to capture a two-dimensional (2D) &#x201c;fan&#x201d; image in the plane of the scanning ultrasonic beam (referred to herein as the &#x201c;beam plane&#x201d; or &#x201c;image plane&#x201d;), which contains the longitudinal axis of the catheter <b>28</b>. The transducers <b>52</b> receive ultrasonic waves that are reflected from objects in the beam plane and output signals in response to the reflected waves. Typically, these signals are conveyed by wires <b>56</b> running through catheter <b>28</b> to console <b>34</b>, which processes the signals in order to form and display ultrasound images and 3D maps, as described hereinbelow.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The distal end of catheter <b>28</b> further comprises a position sensor <b>54</b>, which generates signals that indicate the position (location and orientation including roll) of the catheter within the body. Based on these position signals, console <b>34</b> determines the location and orientation of each fan image captured by imaging device <b>50</b>. Processor <b>38</b> is thus able to determine the coordinates of objects appearing in the fan image, as well as to register and combine multiple 2D images captured at different catheter positions.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the pictured embodiment, system <b>20</b> uses magnetic position sensing to determine position coordinates of the distal end of catheter <b>28</b> inside heart <b>24</b>. To determine the position coordinates, a driver circuit <b>36</b> in console <b>34</b> drives field generators <b>30</b> to generate magnetic fields within the body of patient <b>26</b>. Typically, field generators <b>30</b> comprise coils, which are placed below the patient's torso at known positions external to the body. These coils generate magnetic fields in a predefined working volume that contains heart <b>24</b>. Sensor <b>54</b>, which may comprise, for example, a magnetic position sensor including one or more coils within the distal end of catheter <b>28</b>, generates electrical signals in response to these magnetic fields. Processor <b>38</b> processes these signals in order to determine the position (location and orientation) coordinates of the distal end of catheter <b>28</b>. Console <b>34</b> may use the coordinates in driving display <b>40</b> to show the location and status of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">This method of position sensing and processing is implemented in the CARTO&#xae; 3 system produced by Biosense Webster Inc. This sort of magnetic position sensing is described in detail, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,266,551. Other systems that combine ultrasonic imaging with magnetic position sensing are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,690,963, 6,716,166 and 6,773,402.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Alternatively, or additionally, system <b>20</b> may comprise an automated mechanism (not shown) for maneuvering and operating catheter <b>28</b> within the body of patient <b>26</b>. In such embodiments, processor <b>38</b> generates a control input for controlling the motion of the catheter based on the signals provided by the position sensing system.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a particular system configuration, other system configurations may be used in alternative embodiments of the present invention. For example, the methods described hereinbelow may be applied using position transducers of other types, such as impedance-based or ultrasonic position sensors. The term &#x201c;position transducer&#x201d; as used herein refers to an element mounted on or in catheter <b>28</b> that causes console <b>34</b> to receive signals indicative of the coordinates of the element. The position transducer may thus comprise a receiver in the catheter, such as sensor <b>54</b>, which generates a position signal to the control unit based on energy received by the transducer; or it may comprise a transmitter, emitting energy that is sensed by a receiver external to the probe. Furthermore, the methods described hereinbelow may similarly be applied in mapping and imaging applications using not only catheters, but also probes of other types, both in the heart and in other body organs and regions, as well as ultrasound probes external to the body.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which is a schematic representation of an ultrasound image <b>60</b> captured by catheter <b>28</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The image has the form of a 2D fan, with its vertex at imaging device <b>50</b>. As noted above, console <b>34</b> can determine the location of the vertex and the orientation of the fan in 3D space based on the signals received from position sensor <b>54</b>. Dark areas <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> in the image correspond to areas, such as the heart chambers, that are filled with blood and therefore have low reflectance. Brighter areas generally represent tissue, such as the internal and external heart walls.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted earlier, operator <b>22</b> may manipulate catheter <b>28</b> inside heart <b>24</b> to capture images from different locations and at different orientations. The reflections that make up the images may originate not only from the heart chamber in which the distal end of the catheter <b>28</b> is located, but also from other heart chambers and anatomical structures. Thus, for example, catheter <b>28</b> may be inserted into the right atrium (which is relatively easy to access via the vena cava) and may capture images from the right atrium of the left atrium and possibly the ventricles.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for fast anatomical mapping using ultrasound images, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At each iteration of the method, sensor <b>50</b> acquires a 2D ultrasound fan image, having the general form of image <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), at an image acquisition step (block <b>70</b>). Image acquisition may be gated to a certain annotation point in the heart cycle (such as systole or diastole), using an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor for synchronization, for example, or the images may alternatively be acquired continuously, without gating. Processor <b>38</b> identifies the inside of the heart chamber of interest (the blood pool area) in each 2D image acquired by the ultrasound catheter, at a cavity identification step (block <b>72</b>). These &#x201c;dark,&#x201d; low-reflectance areas may be identified, for example, by applying a threshold to the gray scale levels of the ultrasound image. The threshold may be set automatically or manually. Any suitable method known in the art may be used to choose the threshold automatically, such as the Otsu method, in which the threshold is chosen based on clustering of the pixel gray-scale values.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternatively, other ultrasound imaging modes may be used in image capture at the step of block <b>70</b>, and the method used to identify the cavity at the step of block <b>72</b> may be adapted accordingly. For example, the 2D images may be acquired using Doppler imaging techniques, such as Color Doppler, Power Doppler or Tissue Imaging Doppler, as are known in the art. Such techniques use image color (commonly referred to as pseudo-color) to represent flow. In Color Doppler, areas of blood flow are colored in the image, while areas of tissue are not. In this case, pixels having a color value above a certain threshold may be identified as belonging to the blood pool area at the step of block <b>72</b>. On the other hand, in Tissue Imaging Doppler, areas of tissue are colored while blood is not, so that pixels having a color value below a certain threshold will be identified as belonging to the blood pool area.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Whichever imaging modality is used, processor <b>38</b> applies the threshold to transform the 2D grayscale or color image into a binary image, at a binarization step (block <b>74</b>). In the binary image, pixels with the value &#x2018;0&#x2019; are classified as belonging to areas of blood, while pixels with the value &#x2018;1&#x2019; belong to tissue. Other image processing operations may be applied in order to improve the precision of separation between blood and tissue separation. For example, morphological erosion and dilation may be applied in succession to remove small dark areas, which may have been misidentified as blood pool areas, within tissue regions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Processor <b>38</b> finds the vertex location and the orientation of the captured 2D image, at an image registration step (block <b>76</b>). As noted above, the processor may compute the location and orientation coordinates on the basis of the signals output by position sensor <b>54</b>. Given the vertex position and image orientation, the processor <b>38</b> can calculate the 3D coordinates of every pixel in the binarized image in the fixed 3D reference frame (defining a 3D coordinate space) of field generators <b>30</b>, and thus registers the 2D image pixels in the 3D volume.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">After capturing each 2D image, the operator moves the catheter tip in the heart, and the above 2D image capture and processing steps are repeated until the processor has collected a sufficient number of binary pixel values within the volume of interest, at a capture completion step (block <b>78</b>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Processor <b>38</b> collects the pixels with value &#x2018;0&#x2019; (blood) and finds the outer surface bounding these pixels, at a surface reconstruction step (block <b>80</b>). The outer surface bounding the blood pool in a heart chamber is the inner surface of the heart wall surrounding that chamber. Thus, by finding the bounding outer surface of the blood pool the processor has, in effect, constructed a 3D anatomical map of the chamber in question. Optionally, the processor may continue acquiring 2D images while reconstructing the 3D surface and may thus refine the map progressively.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Using the blood pool in the 3D domain as the basis for surface reconstruction has the advantage of offering a fast, efficient way to overcome the problem of image segmentation. Various algorithms may be used to reconstruct the outer surface of a volume based on a collection of interior points of this sort. For example, processor <b>38</b> may apply the ball-pivoting algorithm that is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,968,299. This algorithm computes a triangle mesh interpolating a given point cloud by &#x201c;rolling&#x201d; a ball of a certain radius over the point cloud. The vertices of the triangles that are found in this way define the outer surface of the cloud.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">To reduce the computational load, not all the &#x2018;0&#x2019; pixels are necessarily used in building the model, and processor <b>38</b> may apply different resolution levels in different areas. The above-mentioned ball-pivoting algorithm may be adapted for this sort of variable-resolution mapping by using different ball radii in different regions of the map. High resolution is typically needed only in the blood-tissue interface area (along the edge of the blood pool). This area can be identified automatically or manually in the binary images. The processor <b>38</b> then performs high-resolution reconstruction only near the tissue boundary, and uses low resolution elsewhere. In other words, the processor <b>38</b> uses fewer pixels from the 2D images in areas far from the tissue, and more pixels in the area of the tissue interface (typically within a thickness on the order of 1 mm).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">After processor <b>38</b> has reconstructed and displayed the 3D anatomical map in the manner described above, a user may apply image editing tools, via user interface <b>42</b>, for example, to cut and/or morph the model in order to correct artifacts and remove features that are not of interest. In some embodiments, the user may add indications of anatomical structures such as the right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) and the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) to the 3D anatomical map.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic representation of a 3D anatomical map <b>90</b> of a heart chamber, of a type that may be produced by the above method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The map in this case shows the right atrium of the heart, including parts of the pulmonary veins. This sort of map may be used for various purposes, such as serving as a starting point for an electro-anatomical map (of the type produced by the above-mentioned CARTO 3 system) or for segmentation of a full 3D ultrasonic or tomographic image.
