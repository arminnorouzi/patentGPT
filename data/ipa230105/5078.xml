The same or similar reference numerals throughout the specification refer to the same or similar elements or elements having the same or similar functions. Embodiments described herein with reference to drawings are explanatory, serve to explain the disclosure, and are not construed to limit embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The following describes a method and an apparatus for processing social information, and an electronic device according to the embodiments of the disclosure with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a method for processing social information according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The method may be executed by an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At <b>101</b>, social information sent by an interaction object is obtained.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The interaction object refers to a user who has interaction needs, such as fans and friends of an anchor, and the like. The content of the social information is different, and the type of the corresponding content is different. The social information may be specifically divided to be in a chat type and in a gift type. The chat type corresponds to a text message, for example. The gift type corresponds to a virtual gift rather than the text, for example.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At <b>102</b>, it is determined whether a reply control is displayed based on the social information.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">There is at least one reply control, which is generated based on historical reply information in response to giving a gift and/or set by default. The content of the reply control may be text, such as thank you, love you, or may be an expression, such as a smiling face, or may be a dynamic expression. As such, it achieves that the reply information is set based on habits and likes of the users.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this embodiment, it is determined whether the reply control is displayed based on the type of the social information. In particular, when the content type of the social information is a gift type, it is determined the reply control is displayed. In other words, the interaction object sends a gift to a favorite object, such as a blogger or an anchor, a gift-based reply control needs to be displayed. When the content type of the social information is a chat type, it is determined the reply control does not need to be displayed. In other words, the interaction object sends a text message to the favorite object, the reply control does not need to be displayed and only a message list needs to displayed. As such, it achieves that the corresponding list is displayed based on different social information, thus improving the pertinence of information display, being convenient to remind users that they can reply as soon as possible when they get gifts, and improving the interaction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At <b>103</b>, in response to determining that the reply control is displayed, the social information and the reply control are displayed in a message list.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this embodiment, the message list may be a message list in an application program, a message list in an applet or a message list on a web end, which is not limited in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Specifically, when the content type of the social information is the gift type, it is determined that the reply control is displayed, so as to display a thumbnail of the given gift and the reply control in the message list.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, in practical applications, there may be more than one piece of social information sent by the interactive object obtained in the above steps, and the content types of social information may also be different. Therefore, the priority of different types of social information may be set and displayed in different ways in the message list based on the priority of different social information obtained.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Specifically, when it is determined the reply control is displayed, a display priority is determined based on the content type of social information. The display priority of the gift type is higher than that of the chat type. According to the display priority, the social information and reply control are displayed in the message list.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The following scenarios are used for specific description.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a scenario, when the content type of the social message sent by the interaction object is obtained as a chat type first, only the interaction message in the chat type may be displayed in the message list. When the content type of another social message received is a gift type, the social message in the chat type may be hidden in the message list while the social message in the gift type and the corresponding reply control are displayed, since the display priority of the interaction message in the gift type is higher than that of the interaction message in the chat type.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another scenario, when the content type of the social message sent by the interaction object is obtained as a gift type first, the social message in the gift type and the corresponding reply control are displayed in the message list. When the content type of another social message received is a chat type, displaying the social message in the gift type and the corresponding reply control are continued while the latest received social message in the chat type is not displayed in the message list, since the display priority of the interaction message in the gift type is higher than that of the interaction message in the chat type. Only social messages in the chat type are counted, and a total number of the social messages in the chat type is displayed in the message list. For example, one message is unread, or two messages are unread, etc., in order to facilitate the users to understand the number of unread social messages in the chat type, so that users may determine whether to view them, thus improving the flexibility.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In yet another scenario, when the content types of the social messages successively sent by the interaction object are obtained as gift types, only the latest received social message in the gift type and the corresponding reply control are displayed according to a time sequence of obtaining the social messages in the gift type, so as to realize a display of the latest social message.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, in this embodiment, the display priority is determined based on the content type of the social information, a priority display of social information in the gift type is ensured so that a quick reply may be made in response to obtaining a gift sent by an interaction user. Through the quick reply, the interactivity is increased, and interaction enthusiasm and positivity of the interactive user are improved.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At <b>104</b>, in response to a user operation of the reply control, reply information is sent to the interaction object.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, the reply information is sent to the interaction object in response to the user operation of the reply control displayed. For example, the content corresponding to the replay control is the text &#x201c;thanks&#x201d; or a smiling face. When the user selects a replay control corresponding to the text &#x201c;thanks&#x201d;, the reply information sent to the interaction object is the text &#x201c;thanks&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the method for processing social information according to the embodiment, the social information sent by the interaction object is obtained; it is determined whether the reply control is displayed based on the social information; in response to determining that the reply control is displayed, the social information and the reply control are displayed in the message list; and in response to the user operation of the reply control, the reply information is sent to the interaction object. By a special display of both the social information and the reply control in the message list, quick replies that meet the needs of users are provided, thus improving the timeliness of information interaction and increasing platform stickiness.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Based on the above embodiment, an embodiment of the disclosure provides a possible implementation of another method for processing social information.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At <b>201</b>, social information sent by an interaction object is obtained.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In practical applications, there may be a plurality of social information sent by the interaction object obtained, and the type of social information may also be different. In this embodiment, the type of social information sent by the interaction object firstly obtained is a gift type.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At <b>202</b>, it is determined whether a reply control is displayed based on the social information.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Specifically, the social information in the gift type needs to display a reply control. Therefore, according to the obtained social information as the social information in the gift type, it is determined that the social information in the gift type and the reply control are displayed in the message list.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At <b>203</b>, in response to determining that the reply control is displayed, an information display area of the interaction object is enlarged in the message list, a thumbnail of the social information and the reply control are displayed in the enlarged information display area.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is the 1<sup>st </sup>schematic diagram of displaying a message list of social information according to the embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the message list is a list of private messages between fans and the anchor in a live broadcasting application. The message list shows different interaction objects and social information sent by different interaction objects. The order of different users in the message list is usually arranged from top to bottom according to a time sequence of social information obtained. However, in this disclosure, since the priority of social information in the gift type is higher, the social message in the gift type sent by an interaction user and the corresponding interaction user are ranked higher. Therefore, the social information sent by the first user in the list (Nicky's FAM) is the latest social information obtained, and the type of social information is a gift type at the same time. Take this user as an example and this user is hereinafter referred to as the user N for ease of explanation. The social information sent by the user N is in the gift type, that is, the gift given by the user N is obtained as a pizza. In order to facilitate the display, an information display area of the interaction object is enlarged in the message list, such as the area A indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and in the enlarged information display area, a thumbnail (i.e., a pizza) of the social information is displayed, and reply controls (i.e., a control whose reply content is &#x201c;Thank&#x201d; and two reply controls corresponding to different expressions) are displayed. By enlarging the display area, it is convenient to display the obtained gifts, so as to remind users to reply in time and improve the efficiency of interaction.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At <b>204</b>, social information subsequently sent by the interaction object is obtained.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In practical applications, before the user selects the reply control, the interaction object may continue to send social information, and the content type of social information may be a gift type or a chat type.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At <b>205</b>, it is judged whether the subsequently-sent social information is in a chat type. If so, the step at <b>206</b> is performed, if no, the step at <b>207</b> is performed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At <b>206</b>, displaying a thumbnail of the gift given in the social information is continued.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Specifically, it is judged whether the social information sent by the interaction object is in the chat type. If it is in the chat type, displaying the thumbnail of the gift given in the social information is continued when it is determined that the subsequently-sent social information is in a chat type, since the display priority of the social message in the chat type is lower than that of the social message in the gift type. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the interaction object sends social information in the chat type again, displaying the gift pizza is continued in the enlarged information display area, i.e. the area indicated by A, and the reply control of the object is also displayed. However, in the information display area indicated by A, the number of social messages in the chat type is counted. That is, each time a chat type of social information is added, the cumulative count is increased by 1. In other words, the cumulative number (indicated by B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the obtained social messages in the chat type sent by the interaction object N is 2, meaning that the cumulative obtained social messages in the chat type sent by the interaction object N is 2, so as to remind the user of the chat information to be read. At the same time, the priority display of gift giving and reply information and the priority display of a thumbnail of the latest gift are carried out based on the priority of the set social information in the gift type and in the chat type, which improves the pertinence of information display, meets the interaction needs, and improves the efficiency of targeted information reply.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At <b>207</b>, the displayed thumbnail is updated to a thumbnail of a gift in the subsequently-sent social information.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, when the social information subsequently sent by the interaction object is in a gift type, the displayed thumbnail is updated to the thumbnail of the gift in the subsequently-sent social information. In other words, when the interaction object N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> sends another social information which is still in a gift type, for example, the corresponding gift is a watermelon, the thumbnail of the gift (i.e., pizza) displayed in the information display area indicated by A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, is updated to the thumbnail of the latest received gift (i.e., watermelon), and the reply control is displayed accordingly.
