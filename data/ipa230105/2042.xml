unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are provided with a plurality of motors, each with a rotor attached. Rotating the rotors with the motors produces lift for the UAV. The speed (and, in some UAVs, the angle) of the motors can be individually controlled, to maneuver the UAV, providing yaw, pitch and roll control.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">UAVs which create lift by &#x2018;flapping&#x2019; a set of wings, rather than rotating a set of rotors, have been developed. Such a UAV <b>1</b> is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The spar <b>3</b> of each wing <b>2</b> may be connected to an actuator, such as a rotary drive unit (e.g. a motor) on the UAV, which is configured/driven to oscillate the wing <b>2</b> back and forth, preferably (but not essentially) within a substantially horizontal plane. A wing panel <b>4</b> extends below the spar <b>3</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the wing panel <b>4</b> can rotate about an axis substantially coaxial with the spar <b>3</b>. Preferably, the wing panel <b>4</b> is connected to the spar <b>3</b>, and the spar <b>3</b> is journaled with respect to the actuator. The wing panel <b>4</b> presents a wing surface.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The angle of attack &#x3b1; of the wing surface <b>4</b> is set to provide lift as the wing <b>2</b> is driven through the air (denoted by the arrows in Figures a) and b)) with an angle of attack &#x3b1; during each stroke of the wing <b>2</b>. For each stroke, the spar <b>3</b> of the wing <b>2</b> acts as the leading edge. Although the magnitude of the angle of attack &#x3b1; may be substantially the same for each stroke, they are in opposing directions. Therefore, after the end of each stroke, the wing <b>2</b> needs to rotate so as to have the required angle of attack for the return stroke. The angle &#x3b8; through which the wing <b>2</b> must rotate may be calculated as:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b8;=180&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0006" num="0000">wherein &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>is the angle of attack in the first direction, and &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>is the angle of attack in the second (opposing) direction. For example, when &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>are both equal to 10&#xb0;, the wing <b>3</b> must rotate through 160&#xb0; when transitioning from one stroke to the next. It will be appreciated that when the angle of attack &#x3b1; is low, the wing <b>2</b> must rotate through a high angle &#x3b8; when transitioning from one stroke to the next. The angle &#x3b8; is the operational angular range of the wing <b>2</b>. The wing may be mechanically limited only to rotate within the operational angular range &#x3b8;. The angle of attack &#x3b1; may be different in each direction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">There may be no active control of the angle of the wing <b>2</b> during a stroke. The angle of the wing <b>2</b> is a consequence of the movement of air over the wing surface <b>4</b>, as the wing <b>2</b> is driven through a stroke by the actuator. Consequently, when the wing needs to transition from one stroke to the next, the wing may not rotate towards the required angle of attack until there is sufficient air moving over the wing surface to cause the wing to rotate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">The rate of rotation of the wing <b>2</b> between strokes affects the amount of lift generated during the stroke. If the rate of rotation is slow, then a higher percentage of the total stroke time is taken up with rotating the wing <b>2</b> and a lower percentage of the total stroke time is taken up with the wing <b>2</b> being set at the required angle of attack &#x3b1;, generating lift.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">The various phases that a flapping wing <b>2</b> goes through are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. It will be appreciated that the time spent in the power strokes should be maximised, and the time spent rotating the wing <b>2</b> (referred to as &#x2018;reduced effect zone&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) should be minimised.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">The present invention seeks to address at least one of the above problems.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention provides a wing comprising a wing panel having a first longitudinal edge and a second longitudinal edge, the wing panel defining a wing surface between the first and second longitudinal edges, wherein the wing is configured such that, in use, either the first or second longitudinal edge may define a leading edge of the wing to generate lift.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">In at least one embodiment, the wing panel is substantially symmetrical.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">In at least one embodiment, the wing panel is symmetrical about a line of symmetry which is substantially equidistant from the first and second longitudinal edges.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">In at least one embodiment, the wing panel is substantially planar.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">In at least one embodiment, the wing panel is substantially non-planar.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">In at least one embodiment, the wing panel comprises a first spar and a second spar and a membrane extending between the first and second spars, wherein the first and second spars define said first and second longitudinal edges respectively.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">In at least one embodiment, the wing panel is flexible.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">In at least one embodiment, the first longitudinal edge is non-parallel to the second longitudinal edge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">There is also provided a wing mounting, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">a base;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">a wing bracket pivotally mounted to the base, configured to rotate relative to the base about a tilt axis within an angular tilt range;

The thickness of the wing panel <b>24</b> at the first longitudinal edge <b>5</b> and the second longitudinal edge <b>6</b> may be thicker than the thickness of the wing panel at a point between the first longitudinal edge <b>5</b> and second longitudinal edge <b>6</b>. The surface area of the top surface of the wing panel <b>24</b> may be greater than the surface area of the lower surface of the wing panel <b>24</b>. The mean camber line of the wing panel <b>24</b> may be non-planar. Consequently, the wing panel <b>24</b> may act as an aerofoil.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">The planar wing <b>20</b> is secured to the wing bracket <b>25</b> such that the plane of the wing panel <b>24</b> is substantially parallel to, but offset from, the tilt axis <b>27</b>. That is to say that the tilt axis <b>27</b> does not pass through the plane of the wing <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">The wing bracket <b>25</b> further comprises an anvil section <b>28</b>, the underside of which provides one or more engaging surfaces <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The wing bracket <b>25</b> is constrained to rotate within an operational angular tilt range &#x3b8; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) by the mechanical stops <b>16</b>. During a stroke, as the wing <b>20</b> is moved through the air by the base <b>11</b> rotating about the stroke axis <b>13</b>, the movement of the air over the wing surface of the wing panel <b>24</b> causes the wing bracket <b>25</b> to rotate about the wrist axis <b>27</b>. This is because the wing panel <b>24</b> is offset from the wrist axis <b>27</b>. The air acting on the wing surface imparts a force on the wing panel <b>24</b>, which creates a moment arm about the wrist axis <b>27</b>, causing it to rotate.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">When the wing bracket <b>25</b> rotates to a maximum extent in one direction (setting the wing <b>20</b> to a first angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>), further rotation of the wing <b>2</b> is prevented by the engaging surface <b>29</b> of the anvil <b>28</b> abutting the mechanical stop <b>16</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">When the wing <b>20</b> reaches the extent of the stroke, and decelerates, the air passing over the wing panel <b>24</b> reduces. At the same time, the inertia of the moving wing bracket <b>25</b> causes the wing bracket <b>25</b> to rotate about the wrist axis <b>27</b>. The wing bracket <b>25</b> may continue to rotate about the wrist axis until the other engaging surface <b>29</b> of the anvil <b>28</b> abuts the other mechanical stop <b>16</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>). At this point, the base <b>11</b> may start to rotate about the stroke axis <b>13</b> in the opposing direction, with the wing <b>20</b> set at a second angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">During the transition between the first &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and second &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>angles of attack, the wing panel <b>24</b> may momentarily be arranged substantially horizontally.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">The anvil <b>28</b> and mechanical stop <b>16</b> arrangement effectively maintains the required angle of attack &#x3b1; during each stroke. The anvil and/or mechanical stops <b>16</b> may be configured to set the required angle of attack of the wing <b>20</b> in each direction.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">It will be noted that, to transition from the first configuration where the wing panel <b>24</b> has a first angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and the second configuration where the wing panel <b>24</b> has a second angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>, the wing bracket <b>25</b> must rotate about the wrist axis <b>27</b> by an angle &#x3b8; which is substantially equal to the sum of the first angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and the second angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">This contrasts to the arrangement schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, where the wing <b>2</b> must rotate through an angle equal to (180&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>+&#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>). Accordingly, with the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, where the respective angles of attack are low (shallow), the wing bracket <b>25</b> must rotate through a relatively large angle between the first and second configurations of the wing. The shallower the angles of attack, the greater then angle through which the wing bracket <b>25</b> must rotate.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">By comparison, with the wing mounting <b>10</b> embodying the present invention, the wing bracket <b>25</b> only needs to rotate through an angle substantially equal to the sum of the first angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and the second angle of attack &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>. Conveniently, this allows the wing <b>20</b> to transition between the first and second configurations far more quickly than with the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. By contrast to that arrangement, the angle through which the wing mounting <b>10</b> embodying the present invention must rotate between the first and second configurations reduces as the respective angles of attack reduce.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">This conveniently reduces the time the wing <b>20</b> is in the reduced effect zone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and maximises the effective stroke zone.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">The wing <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>6</b></figref> is substantially planar, having substantially straight/linear longitudinal edges.
