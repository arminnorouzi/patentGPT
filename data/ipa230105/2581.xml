The blowing agents or the gaseous reaction products are entrapped in the closed cells of the PU foam. They are chosen such that they have a lower thermal conductivity than the main components of air. E.g. in a closed-cell rigid PU foam prepared with water as chemical and cyclopentane as physical blowing agent the main components present in the closed cells are CO<sub>2 </sub>and cyclopentane. These compounds have lower thermal conductivities than nitrogen and oxygen and their presence in the closed cells improves the heat insulation properties of the PU foam. Unfortunately, these insulation gases and in particular CO<sub>2 </sub>tend to diffuse out of the PU foam as well as oxygen and nitrogen from the surrounding air tend to diffuse into the PU foam, the exchange of the gases results in an increasing thermal conductivity of the PU foam.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another problem arises from the possible chemical degradation of the plastic materials like HIPS (high impact modified polystyrene) used for the manufacture of certain parts of the insulated applications like the interior lining of refrigerators, if compounds like hydrofluorochlorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons or hydrocarbons are used as blowing agents in the foaming process and diffuse out of the insulating foam into the plastic material. Especially the diffusion of certain hydrofluorochlorocarbons into the plastic inner liner lead to embrittlement and crack formation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, in case the insulating foam is sensitive to water, the diffusion of water into the insulating foam may also deteriorate the insulating capacities of the foam.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These aging effects are already known, and several measures are described in the prior art to reduce these effects e.g. for refrigerators and insulated pipes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,174 relates to a liner construction for a refrigeration apparatus cabinet comprising an outer wall usually made of metal, an inner liner of the cabinet which is usually made of plastics like HIPS or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer), an insulating foam and a laminate provided between the insulating foam and the inner plastic liner. The laminate contains a barrier film layer for preventing hydrochlorofluorocarbon blowing agents contained within the insulating foam from diffusing into the inner plastic liner. The diffusion layer may be made of different polymers like EVOH (ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer), Saran (polyvinylidene chloride), Nylon (polyamide), and PET (polyethylene terephthalate).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 10 2007011138 B4 discloses a refrigerator comprising a thermal insulating foam at least one layer preventing the diffusion of gas or water from or into the insulating foam. The gas diffusion inhibiting layer can be made of EVOH, the water barrier can be made of polyethylene or polyamide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">DE 10 2009027074 B4 describes a refrigerator with an outer wall comprising a thermal insulating foam, a plastic carrier layer and a gas diffusion barrier layer located between the foam and the plastic layer for inhibiting the diffusion of vapor from the surrounding air into the foam and the diffusion of gases out of the foam. The gas diffusion barrier layer may be an aluminum layer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO 2019/007829 discloses the use of a mixture of polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified resin and polystyrene based material for manufacturing the inner plastic liner of a refrigerator having improved resistance against chemical degradation caused by the diffusion of blowing agents like cyclopentane from the insulating polyurethane foam into the inner plastic liner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">US 2016/0363251 describes a double-wall pipe including an insulating foam and a gas permeation barrier layer made of polyethylene terephthalate for inhibiting the gas exchange between the insulating foam and the outer environment of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Nevertheless, there is still the need for further improvements of the long-term properties of insulating foams, in particular of polyurethane foams, which should preferably be easy to implement.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, the insulated articles should withstand low temperatures which may for example occur during the transportation of the goods to the seller or customer in winter or in regions of harsh temperature conditions. At the same time the insulated articles offer good performance at elevated temperatures, which may for instance occur during transportation of the respective goods in summer or in regions of hot temperature conditions. Furthermore, these properties are requested in particular for hot media applications, such as piping or water heater applications.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It was therefore an objective of the present invention to provide thermal insulating elements with improved long-term properties, good stability both chemically and mechanically and simple production.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, this object is achieved by a thermal insulation element comprising a closed-cell, rigid polyurethane foam which is at least partially covered by a layer system comprising at least one layer formed by a polybutylene terephthalate composition. Surprisingly, the use of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) in a layer surrounding the polyurethane foam leads to an improved long-term stability of the insulation capacities of the thermal insulation element and improved properties after exposition to low temperatures. Depending on the specific application the PBT may be used a gas diffusion barrier layer in addition to existing structural elements of the respective application, but it is also possible to use PBT in structural elements of the specific application instead of materials used so far, e.g. use PBT instead of HIPS as material for the inner lining of a refrigerator or instead of PET as material for the outer wall of an insulated double-walled pipe.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, this object is achieved by a cooling device, such as a refrigerator; a heat storage system; a water heater; a battery system; an insulation panel or board for buildings, trucks and trailers, window frames, doors, or garage doors; an insulated pipe; a mobile transport system; or an insulated transport box comprising said thermal insulation element, as well as by a process for producing such elements. This object is also achieved by the use of polybutylene terephthalate as gas diffusion barrier for closed-cell rigid polyurethane foams.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inventive thermal insulation elements comprising a closed-cell, rigid polyurethane foam which is at least partially covered by a layer system comprising at least one layer formed by a polybutylene terephthalate composition show surprisingly lower heat conductivities after storage, i.e. better long-term stability than thermal insulation elements wherein the PBT layer is replaced by conventional facing materials like HIPS or even more advanced materials, such as a PET layer. These elements and the articles comprising them also show improved resistance to low temperature exposure and at least the same properties at elevated temperatures. Moreover, these elements offer improved mechanical resistance towards cell gases as part of the foams, like hydrofluorochlorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons and hydrocarbons and tend not to lead to embrittlement.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following the invention is described in detail.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The thermal insulation element comprises at least one layer formed by a polybutylene terephthalate composition, which covers the insulating foam at least partially. The polybutylene terephthalate composition is hereinafter also referred to as PBT composition. This PBT composition may be made of polybutylene terephthalate or by a blend of polybutylene terephthalate and one or more furthers polymers, wherein the polybutylene terephthalate containing phase forms the continuous phase. The PBT and the PBT containing composition may contain usual polymer additives and fillers like flame retardants, stabilizers, plasticizers, nucleating agents, glass fibers and/or mineral fillers, provided PBT is the matrix polymer which forms the continuous matrix of the PBT composition. In this matrix, the other ingredients are included, e.g. in case of immiscible polymers or fillers in finely dispersed form.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably the polybutylene terephthalate composition comprises at least 30 wt.-% polybutylene terephthalate, based on the total weight of the polybutylene terephthalate composition, more preferred at least 50 wt.-%, even more preferred at least 60 wt.-%, most preferred at least 65 wt.-% and in particular preferred at least 75 wt.-% polybutylene terephthalate, based on the total weight of the PBT composition.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferred PBT to be used has a viscosity number in the range of from 80 to 200 mL/g, preferably from 90 to 190 mL/g, measured in 0.5 wt % solution in a phenol/o-dichlorobenzene mixture (weight ratio 1:1) at 25&#xb0; C. in accordance with ISO 1628 valid in 2012.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The PBT preferably has a terminal carboxy group content of up to 100 meq/kg of polyester, preferably up to 40 meq/kg of polyester and in particular up to 30 meq/kg of polyester. Polyesters of this type can by way of example be produced by the process of DE-A 44 01 055. Terminal carboxy group content is usually determined by titration methods (e.g. potentiometry).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Particularly preferred PBTs are produced with Ti catalysts. Residual Ti content of these after the polymerization process is preferably less than 250 ppm, more preferably less 200 ppm, particularly less than 150 ppm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The polybutylene terephthalate composition may comprise at least one additional polymer. The additional polymer may be selected from thermoplastic polymers. Preferably the PBT composition comprises at least one additional polymer selected from thermoplastic polymers having a lower melting point (or Tg in case of amorphous polymers) than PBT. Polybutylene terephthalate is a thermoplastic engineering having a melting point of 222 to 225&#xb0; C., typically 223&#xb0; C. By adding a lower-melting thermoplastic polymer into the PBT composition the temperature window in which thermoforming of PBT can be performed can be broadened. This has the ad-vantage, that the PBT composition may be processed easily by thermoforming like the polymers/polymer blends used so far in thermal insulating devices such as HIPS and PET. All thermoplastic polymers having a lower melting point (or Tg in case of amorphous polymers) than PBT can be employed. However, it is preferred that the thermoplastic polymer can be easily dispersed in the PBT matrix and remains dispersed in the PBT matrix without showing large-scale phase separation during the thermoforming process. Thus, thermoplastic polymers are preferred which are chemically similar to PBT.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably the at least one additional thermoplastic polymer has a melting point below 220&#xb0; C., more preferred below 200&#xb0; C., even more preferred below 180&#xb0; C., and most preferred below 160&#xb0; C. The melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 20&#xb0; C./min, according to ISO 11357&#x2212;1/&#x2212;3 valid in 2019.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The at least one additional polymer is preferably selected from the group of thermoplastic polymers consisting of polyesters based on aliphatic and/or aromatic dicarboxylic acids and on aliphatic dihydroxy compounds; thermoplastic elastomers; copolymers of acrylic ester, styrene and acrylonitrile; polylactic acid; polypropylene; polyethylene, and mixtures thereof. More preferred the polybutylene terephthalate composition comprises at least one additional polymer selected from polyester based on aliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids and on aliphatic dihydroxy compounds.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The amount of the thermoplastic polymer is preferably 5 to 40 wt %, more preferably 10 to 30 wt %, most preferably 15 to 25 wt %, based on the total amount of polybutylene terephthalate composition, which is 100 wt %.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferred Polybutylene Terephthalate Compositions Comprise</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">a) 50 to 95 wt % of polybutylene terephthalate as component A,</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">b) 5 to 50 wt % of at least one additional polymer as component B,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">c) 0 to 30 wt % of mineral filler as component C, and</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">d) 0 to 20 wt % of further additives as component D,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">based on the total weight of the polybutylene terephthalate composition</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further ingredients of the PBT compositions can be mineral fillers and further additives.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">If a mineral filler is present, it is preferably present at 5 to 30 wt %. The upper limit of component A is then reduced to 90 wt %, so that the sum of wt % does not exceed 100 wt %. If a mineral filler is present, the amount is more preferably 7 to 15 wt %, most preferably 8 to 12 wt %, for example approximately 10 wt %, the upper limit of component A being reduced accordingly.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Component B is preferably employed in an amount of from 10 to 30 wt %, more preferably 15 to 25 wt %.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The amount of further additives is 0 to 20 wt %, more preferably 0 to 10 wt %, most preferably 0 to 5 wt %.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The amount of component A consequently is preferably 50 to 83 wt %, most preferably 50 to 77 wt %.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">If further additives are present, their minimum amount is preferably 0.1 wt %, more preferably 0.3 wt %. The upper limit of component A is reduced in this case by 0.1 wt % or preferably 0.3 wt %, so that the total of components A to D is 100 wt %.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By adding mineral fillers, an accurate reproduction of surface detail can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In principle, any of the polyesters based on aliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids and on aliphatic dihydroxy compounds, known as semi-aromatic polyesters, may be used as component B for preparation of the PBT compositions. Mixtures of two or more of these polyesters are of course also suitable as component B.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the invention, the term &#x201c;semiaromatic polyesters&#x201d; is also intended to include polyester derivatives, such as polyetheresters, polyesteramides, or polyetheresteramides. Among the suitable semiaromatic polyesters are linear non-chain-extended polyesters (WO 92/09654). Preference is given to chain-extended and/or branched semiaromatic polyesters. The latter are disclosed in the specifications of WO 96/15173-15176, WO 21689-21692, WO 25446, WO 25448, WO 98/12242, expressly incorporated herein by way of reference. Mixtures of different semiaromatic polyesters may also be used. In particular, the term semiaromatic polyesters is intended to mean products such as Ecoflex&#xae; (BASF SE) and Eastar&#xa9; Bio (Novamont).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Detailed information about PBT compositions containing at least one further thermoplastic polymer which are in particular suited to be used in the present invention are provided in the not yet published European patent application with application Ser. No. 19/168,782.1, which is expressly incorporated herein by way of reference.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The thickness of the polybutylene terephthalate layer comprised in the layer system may vary widely and depends on whether the polybutylene terephthalate layer is only or mainly used as gas diffusion barrier layer or whether it should also fulfill additional purposes like imparting mechanical or chemical stability. The polybutylene terephthalate layer has usually a thickness of from 0.005 to 500 mm, preferably of from 0.006 to 100 mm, more preferred of from 0.007 to 50 mm, even more preferred of 0.008 to 25 mm and in particular preferred of from 0.01 to 5 mm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The layer system may consist of one layer formed by a polybutylene terephthalate composition or the layer system may comprise one, two or more layers in addition to the at least one layer formed by a polybutylene terephthalate composition.

The polymer layer may be chosen from HIPS, ABS, polyolefins like PE (polyethylene) and/or PP (polypropylene), polyesters like PLA (polylactide acid) and PBAT (polybutylenadipate terephthalate), and polyamides like PA 6 and PA 66. These polymers may of course contain further additives usually used for polymers liked plasticizers, flame retardants, stabilizer etc. A second layer may be added e.g. for decorative purposes, to enhance the chemical and/or mechanical stability or to allow the use of cost-efficient materials in addition to smaller amounts of PBT. The presence of a second layer is in particular useful in case the polybutylene terephthalate layer is mainly or only used as gas diffusion barrier.

The resulting specimens with a thickness of 50 mm are stored at a temperature T<sub>a </sub>in a range between 21&#xb0; C. and 24&#xb0; C. or at a temperature T<sub>b </sub>of 70&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0123">Thermal conductivity were measured over time.

In this case, 900 g*100 g of material are inserted into the PE bag (diameter * 30 cm). If no processing by machine is possible (e.g. on account of inhomogeneities in the polyol component), the cream time, setting time and free foam density were determined by means of a beaker test by means of manual foaming. The components in this case are adjusted to a temperature of 20&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; C. The polyol component was initially charged in the corresponding paper cup, the isocyanate component was weighed in and the reaction mixture was stirred. The stopwatch is started at the beginning of stirring. The cream time is defined here as the period of time between the beginning of stirring and the start of volume expansion of the reaction mixture by means of foam formation. The setting time (fiber time) corresponds to the time from the beginning of mixing up to the time in the reaction process at which threads can be pulled out from the foam composition using a glass bar. In order to ascertain the free rise density in a cup test, the foam head is cut off after the foam has cured. The cut is made perpendicularly to the rise direction on the edge of the testing cup, with the result that the foam cutting face and the upper edge of the testing cup lie in one plane. The content of the cup is weighed and the free rise density is calculated.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0125">Table 1 shows the data for the production of the PUR used and table 2 shows the measurement results for the rigid PU foams produced therefrom (degree of overpacking OP of the molded foams: 17.5%).
