With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the multi-view vision inspection system <b>100</b> further includes a conveying mechanism <b>5</b>, where one end of the conveying mechanism <b>5</b> is located outside the darkroom <b>1</b>, the other end of the conveying mechanism <b>5</b> extends into the darkroom <b>1</b>, the conveying mechanism <b>5</b> is used for conveying the workpiece to be inspected into the darkroom <b>1</b>, and the conveying mechanism <b>5</b> is spaced from the inner frame <b>2</b>. Thus, inspection precision may be guaranteed by separating the plurality of cameras from the conveying mechanism <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">Optionally, the inner frame <b>2</b> is of a frame structure made of square steel, and the plurality of first cameras, the plurality of second cameras and the plurality of third cameras are each rotatably arranged on the inner frame <b>2</b>. For example, the plurality of cameras may be mounted on the inner frame <b>2</b>, thereby conveniently and flexibly adjusting mounting positions of the cameras and reducing weight of the whole multi-view vision inspection system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">According to a further embodiment of the present disclosure, the multi-view vision inspection system further includes: a projection spotlight, where the projection spotlight is arranged on the inner frame <b>2</b>.

For example, the inner frame <b>2</b> may be of the frame structure built by square steel having kidney-shaped holes at four sides, a main body of the inner frame <b>2</b> is welded into a whole, a cross beam for conveniently mounting light sources, etc. may be arranged in a middle of the inner frame, inclined struts for improving rigidity of the inner frame <b>2</b> may be arranged at a periphery of the inner frame, and the shockproof foot cups <b>21</b> are arranged at a bottom of the inner frame. The inner frame <b>2</b> is not connected to the darkroom <b>1</b>, thereby effectively isolating interference of the darkroom <b>1</b> to an internal structure, and facilitating flexible mounting of the light sources, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, both a top wall and a bottom wall of the darkroom are diffusively reflective surfaces. A plurality of light sources are arranged in the darkroom, and includes a plurality of first light sources <b>31</b> and a plurality of second light sources <b>32</b>, where the plurality of first light sources <b>31</b> are all arranged on an upper portion of the interior of the darkroom <b>1</b> and face the top wall of the darkroom <b>1</b>, the plurality of first light sources <b>31</b> are arranged spaced from one another in the circumferential direction of the darkroom <b>1</b>, the plurality of second light sources <b>32</b> are all arranged on a lower portion of the interior of the darkroom <b>1</b> and face the bottom wall of the darkroom <b>1</b>, and the plurality of second light sources <b>32</b> are arranged spaced from one another in the circumferential direction of the darkroom <b>1</b>. For example, the six first light sources <b>31</b> and the six second light sources <b>32</b> may be arranged at a periphery of the interior of the darkroom <b>1</b>, the six first light sources <b>31</b> are arranged on the upper portion of the darkroom <b>1</b>, and the six second light sources <b>32</b> are arranged on the lower portion of the interior of the darkroom <b>1</b>, so as to illuminate a placement area of the workpiece to be inspected.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">The first light sources <b>31</b> on the upper portion obliquely irradiate the top wall of the darkroom <b>1</b>, the light sources <b>32</b> on the lower portion obliquely irradiate the bottom wall of the darkroom <b>1</b>, and the top wall and the bottom wall of the darkroom <b>1</b> are diffusively reflective surfaces such that incident light with high directivity of the first light sources <b>31</b> and the second light sources <b>32</b> may be changed into uniform and soft reflected light pointing to the periphery, and therefore, the workpiece to be inspected is uniformly illuminated, and by means of such the manner, most of positions of the workpiece to be inspected may be effectively imaged. Therefore, the situation of non-uniform light reflection and illumination of the workpiece to be inspected may be effectively avoided, visual imaging quality of the workpiece to be inspected, is improved, and the multi-view vision inspection system is particularly suitable for large-size workpieces.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">Optionally, frosted stickers are attached to the top wall and the bottom wall of the darkroom <b>1</b> respectively. For example, the top wall and the bottom wall of the darkroom <b>1</b> may be pasted with light color diffusively reflective stickers, for example, light gray diffusively reflective stickers, respectively, surfaces of the stickers may be frosted, and when the first light sources <b>31</b> and the second light sources <b>32</b> irradiate the frosted stickers, direct light is reflected through the rough surfaces of the frosted stickers to form diffuse reflection such that incident light having high directivity may be well changed into the reflected light pointing to the periphery, and therefore, the workpiece to be inspected, for example, a metal workpiece, may be uniformly illuminated.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">By means of diffuse reflection irradiation of the frosted stickers, the requirement for uniform illumination of most areas of the workpiece to be inspected may be met, and for dark-color casting areas having a complex bottom structure of the workpiece to be inspected, the problem of uniform illumination of the areas may not be well solved only by using a diffuse reflection mode, such that edge features of holes may not be highlighted. In such a case, targeted illumination needs to be carried out according to structural features of a surface of the dark-color casting area, the surface of the dark-color casting area is rough and dark in color, a material of the dark-color casting area is different from that of other portions of the workpiece, and in addition, due to use of a casting technology, the surface has poor consistency, and small holes to be inspected are scattered in position and are usually located on a milling surface of a casting surface.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plurality of light sources further includes a plurality of auxiliary light sources, where the plurality of auxiliary light sources are movably arranged on the inner frame <b>2</b>. For example, the two auxiliary light sources may be arranged on two sides of a casting surface of the workpiece to be inspected respectively for large-angle direct irradiation. For example, the plurality of auxiliary light sources may be rotatably mounted on the inner frame <b>2</b> by means of mounting supports <b>4</b>, so as to adjust an illumination angle of the auxiliary light sources. Understandably, different types of mounting supports <b>4</b> may be customized according to shapes of different light sources, the mounting supports <b>4</b> may each have an angle adjustment range of 180 degrees, and may be flexibly mounted on the inner frame <b>2</b>, so as to meet layout of the light sources at different positions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">Optionally, the plurality of auxiliary light sources are strip light sources.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">In addition to the common small holes, a plurality of threaded holes may be further provided on the surface of the workpiece to be inspected, the threaded holes are different in size, and a plurality of thread surfaces are provided in each of the small holes and extend from top to bottom at a certain angle, resulting in severe light reflection. Therefore, the surface of the workpiece to be inspected may be photographed in a time-sharing manner, thereby improving contrast of edges of the threaded holes.
