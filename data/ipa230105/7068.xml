The bitrate is the number of bits that are communicated over the communication channel per unit of time (e.g., kbit/s or kbps). The higher the bitrate, the more bits that are communicated in the same given time, and the greater the quality. However, a bitrate that exceeds the available bandwidth of the communication channel can significantly degrade communications by causing delays as sufficient data is buffered. When initiating real-time communication, an initial bitrate must be chosen. Typically, the initial bitrate is a predetermined fixed value. Because of a wide variety of user and network conditions, the fixed bitrate may not be an ideal value.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One aspect of the disclosure provides a method for determining an initial bitrate of real time communication.

The bitrate is the number of bits that are communicated per unit of time (e.g., kbps or Mbps). Because the higher the bitrate, the greater the quality of communication, a high bitrate is generally preferred. However, a bitrate that exceeds the available bandwidth of the communication channel can significantly degrade communications by causing delays and freezes as using a bitrate that exceeds the channel capacity leads to buffering and eventually packet drops in network routers. In typical communications, a predetermined fixed value is used to establish an initial bitrate. When the initial bitrate is set too low (i.e., well below the bandwidth of the communication link), the quality of the communication will be artificially low (e.g., a large number of audio or visual artifacts, low resolution, etc.). Alternatively, when the initial bitrate is set too high (i.e., above what the bandwidth of the communication link can support), significant delays or freezing may occur. Thus, an initial bitrate that more accurately reflects the available bandwidth of the communication link between the parties is desirable.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Implementations herein are directed toward an initial bitrate determiner that determines an initial transmit bitrate for a user device establishing digital communication with another user device. The initial bitrate determiner includes an initial bitrate predictor model that generates a probability density function for an average bitrate of a digital communication between a first user device and a second user device. The initial bitrate determiner samples the probability density function to determine an initial bitrate for the digital communication and establishes the digital communication between the first user device and the second user device at the determined initial bitrate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some implementations, an example system <b>100</b> includes two or more user devices <b>10</b>, <b>10</b><i>a</i>&#x2014;n, each associated with a respective user <b>12</b>, <b>12</b><i>a</i>&#x2014;n and each in communication with a remote system <b>140</b> via a network <b>112</b>, <b>112</b><i>a</i>&#x2014;n.

However, due to the wide variety of network conditions and user devices, the predetermined fixed value is often suboptimal. While the digital communication service may eventually respond to the suboptimal initial bitrate by adjusting the bitrate accordingly, the users may still experience communication degradation (e.g., video freezes, delays in starting communication, etc.) until the adjustment is made. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate respective transmission bitrate plots <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b </i>each having an x-axis representing time (in seconds) and a y-axis representing transmission bitrate (in kilobits per second (kbps)) of a digital communication. In the plot <b>200</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the initial predetermined bitrate is 300 kbps, but the upload link for the transmitting user device is only 120 kbps. Because of this bottleneck, the plot <b>200</b><i>a </i>demonstrates a significant network delay spike <b>210</b><i>a </i>immediately after communication is established as packets are queued to use the upload link. In contrast, the plot <b>200</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the initial bitrate set to 120 kbps to result in no significant network delay spike as the upload link is able to keep pace with the transmission bitrate. Minor delay spikes may occur due to encoders not strictly following the initial bitrate and thus causing the actual bitrate to be slightly higher, thus causing some delay.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the initial bitrate predictor model <b>160</b> receives the packet <b>20</b> including the communication request <b>21</b> and a plurality of features <b>310</b> associated with the communication request. In some examples, audio/video samples <b>22</b> in the packet <b>20</b> are preprocessed to improve the quality of the data prior to or after feature extraction. The plurality of features <b>310</b>, as described in more detail below, define a plurality of characteristics of the digital communication (e.g., network types). The model <b>160</b> may be a neural network or other algorithms, e.g., a decision tree, a logistic regression, a recurrent neural network (RNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM), a deep feed forward (DFF) or any other type of neural network or algorithm. The model <b>160</b>, in some examples, generates a probability distribution <b>164</b> over all possible average bitrates for the respective user device <b>10</b> during the digital communication. That is, because the average bitrate of the digital communication is likely a good representation of channel capacity (i.e., the upload bandwidth of the communication channel between the first user device and the second user device), the probability distribution <b>164</b> generates a probability for each potential average bitrate of the communication in a set of average bitrates. Each average bitrate in the set includes a respective probability that it will be the average bitrate of the digital communication (i.e., the average bitrate of the entirety of the digital communication). Put another way, the model <b>160</b> predicts the average bitrate of the forthcoming digital communication between the first user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the second user device <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Other statistical representations may be used instead of the average (e.g., the median). The set of average bitrates includes a minimum average bitrate (e.g., 100 kbps) and a maximum average bitrate (e.g., 5 mbps) and each other average bitrate in the set are distributed between the minimum average bitrate and the maximum average bitrate. Each average bitrate in the set of average bitrates may represent a range of bitrates (e.g., 100 kbps to 300 kbps).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A probability sampler <b>170</b> receives the probability distribution <b>164</b> (i.e., the probability density function <b>164</b>) and samples a value (e.g., via direct sampling, mean sampling, mode sampling, tempered sampling, etc.) to determine the initial bitrate <b>180</b>. For example, the probability sampler <b>170</b> samples the average bitrate from the probability distribution <b>164</b> that has the highest probability. The probability sampler <b>170</b> may also sample values other than the most likely. For example, the probability sampler <b>170</b> selects samples from the probability distribution <b>164</b> with a lower probability in order to select a more conservative bitrate to reduce the likelihood of network delays.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">After determining the initial bitrate <b>180</b> from the probability distribution <b>164</b>, the user device <b>10</b> may establish the digital communication with the other user device <b>10</b> at the determined initial bitrate <b>180</b>. For example, the first user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>(or the remote system <b>140</b>) determines a first initial bitrate <b>180</b><i>a </i>and transmits packets <b>20</b> to the second user device <b>10</b><i>b </i>at the first initial bitrate <b>180</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the second user device <b>10</b><i>b </i>(or the remote system <b>140</b>) determines a second initial bitrate <b>180</b><i>b </i>and transmits packets <b>20</b> to the first user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>at the second initial bitrate <b>180</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the initial bitrate predictor model <b>160</b> is configured to receive a plurality of features <b>310</b> associated with the digital communication request <b>21</b>. In some implementations, the plurality of features <b>310</b> include a geographical identifier <b>310</b><i>a </i>(also referred to as a country category <b>310</b><i>a</i>) identifying a geographical location associated with the respective user device <b>10</b>. That is, the features <b>310</b> may include a country category <b>310</b><i>a </i>of the respective user device <b>10</b>. The country category <b>310</b><i>a </i>indicates the country (i.e., the political state or nation) that the respective user device <b>10</b> is currently located in. The geographical identifier <b>310</b><i>a </i>may be determined via a number of ways (e.g., IP addresses, a GPS signal, etc.).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some implementations, the geographical identifier <b>310</b><i>a </i>includes a select country group from a plurality of country groups. Each country group may include a respective group of countries with similar historical average bitrates used for digital communications. That is, instead of having an entry for each potential country, the geographical identifier <b>310</b><i>a </i>may instead group countries. For example, the countries Canada, the United States, and Mexico are all included in a &#x201c;Group A&#x201d; and the geographical identifier <b>310</b><i>a </i>of any user device located in any of those three countries indicates Group A. Such grouping may greatly reduce the number of possible selections for the geographical identifier <b>310</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, each country group of the plurality of country groups is based on a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering). For example, when grouping the countries based on similarities in average bitrate, bias is reduced by normalizing the average bitrates of a set of percentiles (e.g., the 10 percentile, the 50 percentile, and the 90 percentile). These normalized percentiles, in some examples, are used as features with different weight for clustering. Using k-means clustering, the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> may cluster the countries into a plurality of classes or groups (e.g., five groups). Optionally, the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> includes geographical locations as a further feature to reduce noise.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Other features <b>310</b> may include a first (i.e., local) network type connection <b>310</b><i>b </i>and a second (i.e., remote) network type connection <b>310</b><i>c</i>.

Optionally, the local network connection type <b>310</b><i>b </i>and/or the remote network type connection <b>310</b><i>c </i>may indicate an unknown network type when either network is unable to be identified. In some examples, the local network type connection <b>310</b><i>b </i>is a same type of network connection as the remote network type connection <b>310</b><i>c</i>. In other examples, the network type connections <b>310</b><i>b</i>, <b>310</b><i>c </i>are different.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In additional examples, the plurality of features <b>310</b> include a previous communication average bitrate <b>310</b><i>d</i>. In some implementations, the previous digital communication average bitrate <b>310</b><i>d </i>indicates the average bitrate of the most recent or last digital communication using the same local network type <b>310</b><i>b </i>as the current local network type connection <b>310</b><i>b </i>for the pending digital communication.

For example, when the user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>sends a communication request <b>21</b> to the remote system <b>140</b> via a 3G network (i.e., network <b>112</b><i>a</i>), the user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>and/or the remote system <b>140</b> determines the average bitrate of the most recent digital communication for the user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>that used a 3G network. Thus, each user device <b>10</b> and/or the remote system <b>140</b> may store an average bitrate for each possible network type (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.). In some implementations, the plurality of features <b>310</b> include a plurality of average bitrates of previous communications <b>310</b><i>d</i>. In this example, different average bitrates are assigned different weights.

In another example, one or more layers are Softmax layers. Optionally, the model <b>160</b> includes other layers (e.g., SVDF layers, bottleneck layers, etc.).

The translator <b>400</b>, in some implementations, translates the initial bitrate predictor model <b>160</b> into a lookup table <b>410</b>. Here, the lookup table <b>410</b> includes an array that contains each value that the model <b>160</b> is capable of outputting. These values are indexed such that they may be accessed based on the plurality of features <b>310</b> and that, when provided the same features <b>310</b> as the model <b>160</b>, the lookup table <b>410</b> provides the same or nearly the same output (i.e., initial bitrate <b>180</b>). That is, after translation by the translator <b>400</b>, the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> may bypass the model <b>160</b> and determine the initial bitrate <b>180</b> for the digital communication by accessing the lookup table <b>410</b> based on the plurality of features <b>310</b>. The lookup table <b>410</b> may significantly reduce processing time versus the model <b>160</b> while simultaneously reducing storage requirements. In some implementations, the remote system <b>140</b> trains the model <b>160</b> and translates the model <b>160</b> into the lookup table <b>410</b> and then transmits the lookup table <b>410</b> to the first user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>and/or the second user device <b>10</b><i>b</i>.

In another example, the lookup table <b>410</b> is stored one the memory hardware <b>146</b> of the remote system <b>140</b>. Here, in response to a communication request, user devices <b>10</b> may access the lookup table <b>410</b> stored on the memory hardware <b>146</b> using a plurality of features <b>310</b> associated with communication request <b>21</b>.

The PSNR is a metric commonly used to indicate quality of digital communications, where higher PSNR values are associated with higher quality digital communications. The PSNR may indicate a quality of the compressed video and/or audio data compared to the original (i.e., uncompressed) video and/or audio data. A utility function may generate the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b>, whereby an x-axis of the plot represents the bitrate and a y-axis of the plot <b>500</b> represents the PSNR. In some examples, the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> determines the initial bitrate <b>180</b> for the digital communication between the first user device <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the second user device <b>10</b><i>b </i>by selecting a bitrate bucket <b>311</b> from among a plurality of bitrate buckets <b>311</b> based on the probability distribution <b>164</b> over possible average bitrates based on the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b> (e.g., the same bitrate buckets <b>311</b> used to classify the average bitrate of the previous digital communication <b>310</b><i>d</i>). That is, the determiner <b>150</b> uses the model <b>160</b> to generate a probability distribution <b>164</b> of possible average bitrates for the respective user device <b>10</b> during the digital communication, and then leverages the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b> to select the initial bitrate <b>180</b> for the digital communication. As will become apparent, the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b> may assist in selecting an initial bitrate <b>180</b> for the communication that optimizes quality of the digital communication and mitigates a risk in bandwidth overshooting. More specifically, simply selecting an initial bitrate associated with a highest probability in the probability distribution <b>164</b> may unduly increase the risk of bandwidth overshooting, whereby the determiner <b>150</b> can reference the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b> to select a lower value for the initial bitrate <b>180</b> that provides similar gains in quality while reducing the risk of bandwidth overshooting.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one example, the plot <b>500</b> shows quality in PSNR of an audio or video communication versus bitrate following the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b>. Since the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b> is not linear, a small change in bitrate when the bitrate is low (and quality is poor) results in a greater increase in quality than a resulting increase in quality when a change in bitrate of the same magnitude occurs when the bitrate is high (and the quality is correspondingly high). As the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b> demonstrates, a first delta bitrate change <b>530</b><i>a </i>results in a first delta PSNR <b>540</b><i>a </i>increase. Similarly, a second delta bitrate change <b>530</b><i>b</i>, associated with a same magnitude of change as the first delta bitrate change, results in a second delta PSNR <b>540</b><i>b </i>increase. Because the first delta bitrate change <b>530</b><i>a </i>occurs at a much lower bitrate than the second delta bitrate change <b>530</b><i>b</i>, the first delta PSNR <b>540</b><i>a </i>is much larger than the delta PSNR <b>540</b><i>b</i>. That is, the first delta bitrate change <b>530</b><i>a</i>, despite increasing the bitrate the same magnitude as the second delta bitrate change <b>530</b><i>b</i>, provides a greater increase in quality than the delta bitrate change <b>530</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> determines the initial bitrate <b>180</b> based on the probability distribution <b>164</b> and the rate-distortion curve <b>510</b> to minimize the risk of overshooting the bitrate of the uplink. As illustrated in the table <b>550</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, each bitrate bucket <b>311</b> (bitrate buckets <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> in this example), based on the probability distribution <b>164</b>, accumulates probability that represents the predicted probability that the current channel bandwidth is greater than the respective bitrate bucket <b>311</b>. In the example shown, based on an exemplary probability distribution <b>164</b>, there is a 100-percent chance that the bitrate is greater than bucket <b>0</b>, an 85 percent chance that the bitrate is greater than bucket <b>1</b>, a 65-percent chance that the bitrate is greater than bucket <b>2</b>, etc. In some examples, the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> defines a confidence threshold and selects a bitrate bucket <b>311</b> when the bitrate bucket <b>311</b> satisfies the confidence threshold. In the example shown, when the confidence threshold is 75-percent, bitrate bucket <b>1</b> is the nearest bitrate bucket <b>311</b> that satisfies (e.g., exceeds) the confidence threshold, and thus the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> selects bucket <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, the initial bitrate determiner <b>150</b> takes an audio and/or video encoder of the user device <b>10</b> into consideration. An encoder attempts to generate optimal perceptual communication quality (i.e., minimize distortion) under a set of constraints such as channel bandwidth. An output bitrate of the encoder is dependent upon a quantization step size.
