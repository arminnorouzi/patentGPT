A wind power plant typically comprises a plurality of wind turbine generators and is also known as a wind park or a wind farm. The regulation and general operation of the power plant is controlled by a power plant control system or controller (PPC), which implements operational limits and requirements as set out by a power grid operator such as a Transmission System Operator (TSO) or a Distribution System Operator (DSO), or by country- or region-specific grid interconnection requirements, known as &#x2018;grid codes&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some power grid operators implement operational requirements for wind power plants that relate to the stability of the power network. The stability of a power network is often measured in relation to frequency. Typically, power grid operators require specific controls if power network frequency changes to above or below set limits such as a frequency dead band. The dead band comprises an upper bound and a lower bound, around a nominal frequency, as would be well understood by a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Historically, within the frequency dead band, there was no expectation by power grid operators for wind and other renewable power plants to take steps to contribute to the stability of the power network. However, the increasing penetration of renewable power sources, whose supply is relatively volatile compared to traditional non-renewable sources, is resulting in power grid operators implementing stricter requirements for their operation. Some power grid operators now require that wind power plants are operated to counteract any deviation from the nominal frequency, even within the frequency dead band. Such measures are useful in improving overall stability of the power network&#x2014;if deviations are counteracted at the earliest opportunity, then more detrimental deviations may also be avoided. However, as historically no action has been required by wind power plants in the dead band, current control methods are not appropriate for application in the dead band.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an aim of the present invention to address one or more of the disadvantages associated with the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for controlling a renewable power plant connected to a power network to reduce deviation of a measured frequency of the power network from a target frequency. The method comprises: determining a forecasted power gradient over a forecast interval defined between a first time point and a second time point; and, at a third time point during the forecast interval, controlling the power plant to output active power according to a minimum active power level if the measured frequency at the third time point is below the target frequency, controlling the power plant to output active power according to a maximum active power level if the measured frequency at the third time point is above the target frequency. The maximum and minimum active power levels are based on the forecasted power gradient.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Implementing this method in renewable power plants advantageously results in an improved contribution by the power plant to the stability of the power network. The method is particularly suitable for use when the frequency deviations are within the frequency dead-band because it is a straightforward control method that does not require complex calculation or complex operation of the generators, such as wind turbines, photovoltaic cells, or batteries, or ancillary equipment. Long-term, committing to stabilisation of the frequency of the power network by implementing this method to reduce deviations in the dead-band leads to improved overall stabilisation and fewer severe frequency deviations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Determining the forecasted power gradient may comprise receiving an active power level for the first time point and an active power level for the second time point; and determining the forecasted power gradient as the gradient between the received active power levels. Alternatively, determining the forecasted power gradient may comprise receiving the forecasted power gradient from a transmission system operator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The active power level for the first time point may comprise a measured active power level. Alternatively, the active power level for the first time point may comprise an active power level received for the second time point of a previous forecast interval.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The active power level for the second time point may be received from a forecasting source external to the wind power plant.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The value of the maximum active power level may be the value of the forecasted power gradient at the third time point. The value of the minimum active power level may be the value of the forecasted power gradient at the third time point.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The value of the maximum active power level may be less than the value of the forecasted power gradient at the third time point. The value of the minimum active power level may be greater than the value of the forecasted power gradient at the third time point.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise: receiving the measured frequency at the third time point; comparing the measured frequency with the target frequency; and determining whether the measured frequency is above, below, or equal to the target frequency.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">If the measured frequency is determined to be equal to the target frequency, controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise controlling the power plant to maintain its present operation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">If the measured frequency at the third time point is determined to be above the target frequency, controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise: comparing an active power output level of the power plant at the third time point with the value of the forecasted power gradient at the third time point; and, if the active power output level is determined to be above the forecasted power gradient, communicating the maximum active power level to the power plant as an active power set point or, if the active power output level is determined to be equal to or below the forecasted power gradient, controlling the power plant to maintain its present operation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise curtailing the active power output level of the power plant to the active power set point.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the measured frequency at the third time point is determined to be below the target frequency, controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise: comparing an active power output level of the power plant at the third time point with the forecasted power gradient; and, if the present active power output level is determined to be below the forecasted power gradient, communicating the minimum active power level to the power plant as an active power set point; or, if the active power output level is determined to be equal to or above the forecasted power gradient, controlling the power plant to maintain its present operation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise operating compensation equipment to supply additional active power. Controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise over-rating one or more generators of the power plant to supply additional active power to increase the active power output level of the power plant to the active power set point. Controlling the power plant to output active power may comprise using any suitable technology that permits an increase in the active power output of one or more of the generators.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The target frequency may be a nominal frequency of the power network.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a power plant controller configured to implement a method as described above.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Within the scope of this application it is expressly intended that the various aspects, embodiments, examples and alternatives set out in the preceding paragraphs, in the claims and/or in the following description and drawings, and in particular the individual features thereof, may be taken independently or in any combination.

As will be understood by the skilled reader, a WPP comprises at least one wind turbine generator (WTG), and is also known as a wind park or a wind farm. A WTG is commonly referred to as a wind turbine. The examples shown are representative only and the skilled reader will appreciate that other specific architectures are possible, in relation to both wind power plants, power plants for other renewable energy sources, wind turbine generators and other renewable energy generating sources such as solar power plants comprising photovoltaic cells as well as power plants comprising batteries. Thus, the invention also relates to renewable energy power plants and renewable energy generators in general, rather than being specific to wind power plants and generators as in the Figures. In addition, the skilled reader will appreciate that methods, systems and techniques also described below may be applicable to many different configurations of power network. Moreover, the components of the wind power plant and power network are conventional and as such would be familiar to the skilled reader. It is expected that other known components may be incorporated in addition to or as alternatives to the components shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such changes would be within the capabilities of the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a power network <b>10</b> incorporating a WPP <b>12</b>. The WPP <b>12</b> includes a plurality of WTGs <b>14</b>. Each of the plurality of WTGs <b>14</b> converts wind energy into electrical energy, which is transferred as active power from the WTGs <b>14</b> to a main transmission network, also referred to as a power network or a main grid <b>16</b>, for distribution.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The WPP <b>12</b> also includes compensation equipment <b>17</b>, such as a synchronous condenser, and/or static compensation equipment (STATCOM) and/or other generator types such as batteries or PV cells (in hybrid plants) configured to provide active and/or reactive power support as required. Compensation equipment <b>17</b> may not be present in some WPPs <b>12</b> operated according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each of the WTGs <b>14</b> is associated with a respective WTG controller <b>15</b>. In some examples, a set of WTGs may share a single, semi-centralised WTG controller, such that there are fewer WTG controllers than WTGs. As would be understood by the skilled person, WTG controllers <b>15</b> can be considered to be computer systems capable of operating a WTG <b>14</b> in the manner prescribed herein, and may comprise multiple modules that control individual components of the WTG or just a single controller. The computer system of the WTG controller <b>15</b> may operate according to software downloaded via a communications network or programmed onto it from a computer-readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">During normal operation of the WPP <b>12</b>, the WTG controllers <b>15</b> operate to implement active and reactive current requests or set points received from a power plant controller (PPC) <b>22</b>. During extraordinary conditions, the WTG controllers <b>15</b> operate to fulfil predetermined network requirements, and also act to protect the WTGs <b>14</b> from any potentially harmful conditions. Normal operation may be defined as when voltage levels and frequency levels of the main grid <b>16</b> is within acceptable levels, typically a voltage or frequency deadband region surrounding a nominal voltage or frequency value. Extraordinary conditions occur when the voltage and/or frequency are not at acceptable levels. The methods described herein are generally concerned with normal operation of power plants.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The WPP <b>12</b> is connected to the main grid <b>16</b> by a connecting network <b>18</b>. The WPP <b>12</b> and the main grid <b>16</b> are connected at a Point of Interconnection (Pol) <b>20</b>, which is an interface between the WPP <b>12</b> and the main grid <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The PPC <b>22</b> is connected to the power network at a Point of Measurement (PoM) <b>24</b> and is connected directly to the WPP <b>12</b>. The role of the PPC <b>22</b> is to act as a command and control interface between the WPP <b>12</b> and the grid <b>16</b>, and more specifically, between the WPP <b>12</b> and a grid operator <b>26</b>, which as described above may be a TSO or a DSO. The PPC <b>22</b> is a suitable computer system for carrying out the controls and commands as described above and so incorporates a processing module <b>28</b>, a connectivity module <b>30</b>, a memory module <b>32</b> and a sensing module <b>34</b>. The PPC <b>22</b> may also receive information regarding the grid <b>16</b> and/or the local buses, substations and networks from an energy management system (not shown). The WPP <b>12</b> is capable of altering its power or current output in reaction to commands received from the PPC <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The PPC <b>22</b> is equipped to measure a variety of parameters including a representative power output that will be supplied to the main grid <b>16</b> at the Pol <b>20</b> by the WPP <b>12</b>. As the PoM <b>24</b> is not at the Pol <b>20</b>, the measured parameters are only representative as losses in the lines between the PoM <b>24</b> and Pol <b>20</b>, and between the PoM <b>24</b> and the PPC <b>22</b>, may have an effect on the measurements. Suitable compensation may take place to account for the losses to ensure that the measurements are accurate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The PPC <b>22</b> communicates control commands to the WPP <b>12</b> in a suitable manner. It will be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view, so the way in which the control commands are transferred to the WPP <b>12</b> is not depicted explicitly. However, it will be appreciated that suitable cabling may be provided to interconnect the PPC <b>22</b> and the WPP <b>12</b>. The interconnections may be direct or &#x2018;point to point&#x2019; connections, or may be part of a local area network (LAN) operated under a suitable protocol (CAN-bus or Ethernet for example). Also, it should be appreciated that rather than using cabling, the control commands may be transmitted wirelessly over a suitable wireless network, for example operating under WiFi&#x2122; or ZigBee&#x2122; standards (IEEE802.11 and 802.15.4 respectively).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The grid operator <b>26</b> operates to coordinate the supply and demand for electricity/power from the power network <b>10</b>, typically to avoid unwanted high-level deviations of frequency and voltage of the main grid <b>16</b>. To allow the coordination of supply and demand, the grid operator <b>26</b> balances available supply and demand by generating forecasts of the available supply at a future time point. The forecast is produced for each power plant that is connected to the main grid <b>16</b>, so, in the power network <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the grid operator <b>26</b> generates at least a forecast of expected output for the WPP <b>12</b> at a point in the future. In generating a forecast of supply, the grid operator <b>26</b> is able to identify potential under- or over-generation and act accordingly. The forecasts are generated for a set time point in the future, at the end of a predetermined period of time, hereafter referred to as a forecast interval. A forecast interval may therefore be considered to be defined between a first time point marking the beginning of the forecast interval and a second time point marking the end of the forecast interval. The forecasted output is generated for the end of the forecast interval, i.e. at the second time point.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> should be taken as a representation of a wind power plant <b>12</b> only. Alternative configurations of wind power plants are known and it is expected that other known components may be incorporated in addition to or as alternatives to the components shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such changes would be within the capabilities of the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">During operation of the WPP <b>12</b>, the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> may deviate from a nominal frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b>. The nominal frequency level of national power networks is typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, and the exact value may vary depending on country. Deviation of the frequency from the nominal frequency is usually acceptable within a frequency dead band. The frequency dead band may be a region either side of the nominal frequency. For example in a 50 Hz network, the frequency dead band may be 49.85 Hz to 50.15 Hz, i.e. 0.15 Hz either side of the nominal frequency. If the frequency of the power network deviates to a level outside of the dead band, power plants connected to the network as well as the grid have certain protection devices and/or control mechanisms to ensure that the frequency deviation is not detrimental to the power network and so that it can be returned to within the dead band quickly.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above, it is useful to strive to reduce any deviations from the nominal frequency, even within the dead band of the power network. A WPP that is acting to reduce deviations is contributing to the overall stability of the grid it is connected to, reducing the likelihood that the grid is destabilised in future and that more serious deviations occur.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is provided as a method suitable for controlling the WPP <b>12</b> in order to reduce deviations from the nominal frequency within the frequency dead band of the main grid <b>16</b>, with the intention of improving or at least contributing to the stability of the main grid <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> operates to ensure that when the frequency of the main grid <b>16</b>, as measured or received by the PPC <b>22</b>, is different to the nominal frequency, the PPC <b>22</b> acts to control the WPP <b>12</b> so that it is contributing to the stabilisation of the main grid <b>16</b> and not contributing to its destabilisation. The WPP <b>12</b> is able to contribute to the stabilisation of the main grid <b>16</b> by supplying active power to the main grid <b>16</b> at a particular level according to the demand placed on the main grid <b>16</b> by end users.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Over- or under-generation of active power by the WPP <b>12</b>, when compared to the demand from end users on the main grid <b>16</b>, contributes to changes in the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b>. If the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> is higher than the nominal frequency level and the WPP <b>12</b> is generating active power higher than the demanded level, i.e. over-generating, the WPP <b>12</b> is acting to further increase the frequency level, and thereby destabilising the main grid <b>16</b> by causing increased deviation from the nominal frequency level. Similarly, if the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> is lower than the nominal frequency level and the WPP <b>12</b> is generating active power lower than the demanded level, i.e. under-generating, the WPP <b>12</b> is acting to further decrease the frequency level, and thereby destabilising the main grid <b>16</b> by causing increased deviation from the nominal frequency level.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, under-generation while the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> is above the nominal level and over-generation while the frequency level of the main grid is below the nominal level are desirable as the WPP <b>12</b> is then considered to be contributing to the stabilisation of the main grid <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> operates to counteract the destabilisation effects caused by over- or under-generation when the frequency level is above or below the nominal level respectively. By making use of the way in which the grid operator <b>26</b> acts to balance available supply with the demand from end users, over- or under-generation that causes destabilisation can be identified and/or prevented.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the grid operator <b>26</b> balances available supply and demand by generating forecasts of the available supply to identify potential under- or over-generation and act accordingly. The forecasts are made for regular forecast intervals for each power plant connected to the main grid <b>16</b>. The length of each forecast interval may be any period of time. For example, each forecast interval may be for a period of time selected from the following: 5 minutes; 10 minutes; 15 minutes; 30 minutes; or 1 hour. In other examples, the forecast intervals may be any length of time. Forecasts may be received from a source external to the grid operator <b>26</b> such as a national forecasting service.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> begins with the step <b>102</b> in which a forecasted power gradient is determined over a forecast interval. As described above, forecast intervals are defined over a period of time between first and second time points, marking the beginning and end of the forecast respectively. Therefore, the forecasted power gradient is provided as a gradient or slope between an active power level for the first time point and an active power level for the second time point. It will be appreciated that the term &#x2018;gradient&#x2019; is here used to refer to the actual line or slope between two points rather than the numerical value for the steepness of the line. Accordingly, points on the forecasted power gradient at specific times can be compared with measurements taken at that time.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The forecasted power gradient defines a threshold for indicating over- or under-generation of active power by the WPP <b>12</b>. In this respect, the gradient for the forecast between the beginning and end points of the forecast is used as an approximation to the demand by the end users, and so can be used to indicate over- or under-generation accordingly. The gradient may be flat if the active power levels at the first and second time points are the same.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this step <b>102</b>, determining the forecasted power gradient may include the PPC <b>22</b> receiving the forecasted power gradient directly from the grid operator <b>26</b> or from elsewhere, such as an external forecasting service associated with the PPC <b>22</b>, WPP <b>12</b>, or grid operator <b>26</b>. Alternatively, determining the forecasted power gradient may include the PPC <b>22</b> receiving the active power levels at the first and second time points, with the active power level for the second time point being the forecasted level received from the forecasting service, and calculating the forecasted power gradient based on the active power levels it receives. In a further alternative, determining the forecasted power gradient may include the PPC <b>22</b> receiving a forecasted wind profile from which the power gradient can be subsequently calculated.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The active power level for the first time point may be determined by measurement from the WPP <b>12</b>, or may be determined as the active power level at the end of the immediately prior forecast interval may be re-used. The active power level for the second time point is the active power level that the WPP <b>12</b> is expected to be producing at the second time point of the forecast interval.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is envisaged that in some embodiments where the active power levels for the first and second time points are received by the PPC <b>22</b>, the active power levels will be received prior to the first time point of the forecast interval so that the gradient may be generated before the forecast interval begins. Alternatively, in other embodiments, one or both of the active power levels may be received at the beginning of the forecast interval, so that the gradient is generated as close as possible to the beginning of the forecast interval. Similarly, in embodiments where the grid operator <b>26</b> provides the forecasted power gradient directly to the PPC <b>22</b>, the gradient is provided prior to or at the first time point of the forecast interval.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The next step <b>104</b> of the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is performed during the forecast interval. It is envisaged that this step <b>104</b> will be repeated at a plurality of regularly spaced time points during the forecast interval. At the very least, the step will be performed at one time point in the forecast interval. This time point may be considered to be a third time point which is in the forecast interval. In some embodiments, the third time point may be the same as the first or second time points.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At this step <b>104</b>, during the forecast interval, the WPP <b>12</b> is controlled to output active power according to a minimum active power level or according to a maximum active power level. Which active power level the WPP <b>12</b> is controlled according to is based on the measured frequency of the main grid <b>16</b> at that time. In particular, if the measured frequency at the time point that step <b>104</b> is performed is below a target frequency or frequency threshold, which is typically the nominal frequency, this step <b>104</b> of the method <b>100</b> comprises controlling the WPP <b>12</b> to output active power according to the minimum active power level, i.e. at or above the minimum active power level. If the measured frequency is above the target frequency, this step <b>104</b> of the method <b>100</b> comprises controlling the WPP <b>12</b> to output active power according to the maximum active power level, i.e. at or below the maximum active power level.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The maximum and minimum active power levels are based on the forecasted power gradient determined in the earlier step <b>102</b>, which is used as an active power threshold. In some embodiments, the maximum and minimum active power levels are the value of the gradient at that time point. In other embodiments, the maximum and minimum active power levels are based on the value of the gradient at the time point but are respectively proportionally smaller or larger than the gradient to provide a buffer region.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of how the control step <b>104</b> of the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be performed. The steps of the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are performed during the forecast interval following the step <b>102</b> of determination of the forecasted power gradient.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Having determined the forecasted power gradient, two comparison steps <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are performed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In one of the comparison steps <b>108</b>, the present active power output from the WPP <b>12</b> is compared to the present value of the forecasted power gradient. By present active power output and present value of the forecasted power gradient, it is meant the active power output and value of the forecasted power gradient at a time point. i.e. a third time point, during the forecast interval. In other words, at a time point T during the forecast interval, the active power output of the WPP <b>12</b>, P<sub>T</sub>, for that time point, T, is compared to the value for the forecasted power gradient, m<sub>T</sub>, at that time point T. The active power output may be measured directly by the PPC <b>22</b> or otherwise received.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the other of the comparison steps <b>110</b>, the present grid frequency level is compared to the target frequency level.

The frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> may be measured by the PPC <b>22</b> directly or otherwise received.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Both comparison steps <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are performed to establish whether the relevant parameter is above or below its relevant threshold or target. During the forecast interval, the comparison steps may be repeated at regularly spaced time points within each forecast interval. For example, the regularly spaced time points may be spaced apart by 0.5 s, 1 s, 3 s, 4 s, 5 s, 10 s, 1 minute, or 5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The next step <b>112</b> of the method is a step to determine whether the outcome of the comparisons requires a change in control of the WPP <b>12</b>. In step <b>112</b>, there are three outcomes where the flow chart returns to the comparison steps <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> without any change in control of the WPP <b>12</b> being required, ie. &#x2018;Yes&#x2019; in response to step <b>112</b>. The control of the WPP <b>12</b> is here provided in controlling the WPP <b>12</b> to continue its operation without change.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">These three outcomes are outcomes where the WPP <b>12</b> is acting to stabilise the main grid <b>16</b> and/or where the frequency level is at the nominal frequency. As can be seen in step <b>112</b>, these three outcomes are: (1) the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> is equal to the nominal frequency, i.e. f<sub>T</sub>=f<sub>0</sub>; (2) the active power output of the WPP <b>12</b> is equal to or less than the value of the gradient at that time point and the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> is greater than the nominal frequency, i.e. P<sub>T</sub>&#x2264;m<sub>T </sub>and f<sub>T</sub>&#x3e;f<sub>0</sub>; or (3) the active power output of the WPP <b>12</b> is equal to or greater than the level of the gradient at that time point and the frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> is less than the nominal frequency, i.e. P<sub>T</sub>&#x3e;m<sub>T </sub>and f<sub>T</sub>&#x3c;f<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">If the outcome of the comparisons do not fulfil these requirements, for example if both parameters active power output of the WPP <b>12</b> and frequency level of the main grid <b>16</b> are above their respective threshold/target or below their threshold/target, i.e. P<sub>T</sub>&#x3e;m<sub>T </sub>and f<sub>T</sub>&#x3e;f<sub>0 </sub>or P<sub>T</sub>&#x3c;m<sub>T </sub>and f<sub>T</sub>&#x3c;f<sub>0</sub>, then the answer to step <b>112</b> is &#x2018;No&#x2019;. In these outcomes, the WPP <b>12</b> is considered to be contributing to the destabilisation of the main grid <b>16</b> and the active power output of the WPP <b>12</b> needs to be changed. Accordingly, an active power set point for the WPP <b>12</b> is generated and output to the WPP <b>12</b> according to the gradient at step <b>114</b>. The active power set point is set as m<sub>T</sub>, the value of the gradient at time T. When considered in the context of step <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the setting of an active power set point is essentially setting a maximum active power output for the WPP <b>12</b> where the active power output and frequency level are both above their respective threshold/target and setting a minimum active power output for the WPP <b>12</b> where the active power output and frequency level are both below their respective threshold/target.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It will be appreciated that the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is by way of example only, and that the decision step <b>112</b> may be phrased in other ways.

For example, in some embodiments, over-rating or boosting of output from the WPP <b>12</b> to increase the active power level to the active power set point may be achieved by pitching the wind turbine blades and controlling the generator and converter system in the WTGs <b>14</b> to allow more power to be produced, regardless of the additional wear that will be produced.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Alternatively, additional active power may be leveraged by performing short-term forecasts within the forecast interval to determine the expected output during those shorter periods and to determine whether a boost will be required based on the short-term forecast and the forecast power gradient. In these embodiments, a separate forecasting system predicts a power output over a short period of time within the forecast interval, and this predicted short-term forecast output is compared with the actual output throughout the period to estimate whether the predicted power output will be achieved at the end of the period. If the predicted power output will be achieved and the output will be above the forecast power gradient, then there is no need for boosting of the power. However, if the predicted power output is expected to be below the forecast power gradient, and/or if the predicted power output is expected to be above the forecast power gradient but subsequent estimation based on measurement and meteorological data indicates that the forecast power gradient will not be met, then a boosting of the output of the WTGs <b>14</b> of the WPP <b>12</b> is performed. The above methods may be combined to evaluate the wear of the turbine based on forecasts, and to generate additional power if it is permitted based on a control methodology.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The beginning of the third period <b>143</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is where the active power level rises above the gradient again.

Accordingly, the answer to the step <b>112</b> is &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;, so no further action is taken and the comparisons are performed again. Throughout the third period <b>143</b>, the answer is &#x2018;yes&#x2019; and so no action is taken throughout the period <b>143</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the active power levels of the WPP <b>12</b> are the same in this period <b>143</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the fourth period <b>144</b>, the active power output level of the WPP <b>12</b> remains above the value of the gradient, but the frequency level rises to a level between the nominal frequency f<sub>0 </sub>and the upper bound of the deadband, f<sub>upper</sub>. This means that both the active power level and the frequency level are above their respective thresholds, i.e. in step <b>112</b> P<sub>T</sub>&#x3e;m<sub>T </sub>and f<sub>T</sub>&#x3e;f<sub>0</sub>, so the answer to step <b>112</b> is &#x2018;no&#x2019; and so the active set point is set to m<sub>T</sub>, i.e. a maximum active power set point is set for the WPP <b>12</b> to curtail its generation towards.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this case, the active power output of the WPP <b>12</b> is curtailed by applying curtailment measures such as pitching the blades of the WTGs <b>14</b> so that lower active power levels are produced, or, in extreme cases, by utilising the dump load or applying braking force to the rotor. As with the increase of active power, any method that suitably curtails active power production by the WPP <b>12</b> can be utilised here. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the curtailment brings the active power output of the WPP <b>12</b> to the value of the gradient throughout this period <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Finally, in the fifth period <b>145</b>, the active power level falls below the gradient again but the frequency level remains above the nominal frequency so the maximum active power is not exceeded, the answer to step <b>112</b> is &#x2018;yes&#x2019; and there is no action to be taken by any comparisons performed during this period <b>145</b>. The WPP <b>12</b> is providing active power below the maximum active power level.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the setting of only one of the maximum or minimum active power level may be implemented only according to how the WPP <b>12</b> can be controlled. Generally, where compensation equipment is unavailable, it is likely that the WPP <b>12</b> will be controlled according to a maximum active power level only as required, as the WPP <b>12</b> can actively curtail active power output but it is more difficult to increase active power output on demand without the use of compensation equipment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">It will be appreciated that various changes and modifications can be made to the present invention without departing from the scope of the present application.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
