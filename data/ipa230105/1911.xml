The hybrid drive system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a first drive device <b>1</b> including an electric motor M<b>1</b> that applies a rotational torque to a wheel <b>3</b> based on a torque command <b>4</b>, an inverter IN<b>1</b> that controls a current applied to the electric motor M<b>1</b>, and a controller MC<b>1</b> that controls a rotational speed (or torque) of the electric motor M<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The electric motor M<b>1</b> also has a function of regenerating energy at the time of deceleration of the vehicle, and the regenerated electric energy is converted into a direct current by the inverter IN<b>1</b> and stored in a battery BT. When the first drive device operates as a regeneration function, the inverter IN<b>1</b> and the controller MC<b>1</b> function as a converter that converts an AC voltage output from the electric motor M<b>1</b> into a DC voltage and charges the battery BT.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An engine <b>5</b> is used for power generation to generate electric energy when the electric motor M<b>1</b> is in a normal state. A rotational force of the engine <b>5</b> is converted into an AC current by an electric motor M<b>2</b>. The AC current generated by the electric motor M<b>2</b> is converted into a DC current by a controller MC<b>2</b> and an inverter IN<b>2</b> to charge the battery BT. Note that the inverter IN<b>2</b> can function as a converter including a rectifier circuit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the electric motor M<b>2</b> has a function (starter) of generating a starting torque of the engine <b>5</b>. In this case, the electric motor M<b>2</b> is included in a second drive device <b>2</b> including the inverter IN<b>2</b> that controls a current applied to the electric motor M<b>2</b> and the controller MC<b>2</b> that controls a rotational speed (or torque) of the electric motor M<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Note that the controller MC<b>1</b> and the controller MC<b>2</b> are configured by different ICs and are disposed separately. In addition, the inverter IN<b>1</b> and the inverter IN<b>2</b> are configured by different ICs and are disposed separately. Redundancy can be secured by separately disposing circuits of the controllers MC<b>1</b> and MC<b>2</b> and the inverters IN<b>1</b> and IN<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order to apply the hybrid drive system as described above to a drive system of an automatic driving vehicle, it is required to provide a hybrid drive system in which a redundancy cost for securing safety is suppressed as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since the number of components is large in the hybrid drive system, it is necessary to reduce the size and cost by narrowing down individual components to the minimum necessary capacity and function. For example, a low-output product having a small power generation capacity can be selected as the electric motor M<b>2</b>. This is because the electric energy stored in the battery BT can be used when necessary electric power temporarily increases, for example, at the time of acceleration.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, it is necessary to suppress the cost by using an existing hybrid drive system for redundancy of the drive system. Since the hybrid drive system includes the first drive device <b>1</b> and the second drive device <b>2</b>, a redundant configuration can be formed as follows by using these drive devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails, the electric motor M<b>1</b> is disconnected from the wheel <b>3</b> by a clutch <b>6</b><i>a</i>, a clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>is engaged, and the electric motor M<b>2</b> is connected to the wheel <b>3</b> to continue traveling. The engine <b>5</b> is disconnected from the electric motor M<b>2</b> by a clutch <b>6</b><i>c</i>. The torque command <b>4</b> switches a destination of the torque command from the controller MC<b>1</b> to the controller MC<b>2</b> by a signal switch <b>7</b>. As will be described later, the clutches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>c </i>and the signal switch <b>7</b> are controlled by a monitoring device <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The clutch <b>6</b><i>a </i>is for reducing a torque loss caused by the failed electric motor M<b>1</b>. Since the clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>only needs to transmit the driving force from the electric motor M<b>2</b> having a torque output smaller than that of the electric motor M<b>1</b>, it is possible to select a compact and low-cost product. In addition, the clutch <b>6</b><i>c </i>is intended to disconnect the engine <b>5</b> and the electric motor M<b>2</b> in order to reduce a torque loss of the electric motor M<b>2</b> caused by the engine <b>5</b>. The clutches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the present example function as a switching device of a driving force for causing a vehicle to travel.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The clutch <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the clutch <b>6</b><i>c </i>are intended to reduce the torque loss transmitted to the electric motor M<b>2</b> by disconnecting the clutch. Even if the engine <b>5</b> or the electric motor M<b>1</b> is coupled to the electric motor M<b>2</b>, these clutches are not necessarily required components as long as the driving force required for the vehicle can be secured.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the above-described redundant configuration, since the low-output electric motor M<b>2</b> is used when the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails, the driving force at the time of a failure is limited. However, it is only necessary to secure the minimum driving force for causing the vehicle to be retracted to a safe place, and a low-cost redundant configuration is obtained.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to determine and instruct the above switching, the hybrid drive system includes the monitoring device <b>8</b> to which the present invention is applied. The monitoring device <b>8</b> is a device that detects a failure of the first drive device <b>1</b> and performs control to safely switch to the second drive device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to detect the speed (vehicle speed) of the vehicle, a signal of a vehicle speed sensor <b>11</b> that detects a vehicle speed from, for example, the rotational speed (rotational speed per unit time) of the wheel <b>3</b> is input to the monitoring device <b>8</b>. The monitoring device <b>8</b> is a computer including a CPU <b>81</b> and a memory <b>82</b>. A control program (PGM in the drawing) <b>83</b> is loaded into the memory <b>82</b> and executed by the CPU <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The control program <b>83</b> monitors a current of the electric motor M<b>1</b> to detect a failure, and when the failure is detected, controls the clutches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>c </i>and the signal switch <b>7</b> according to a value of the vehicle speed sensor <b>11</b> to switch to traveling by the electric motor M<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present example, an example is described in which the electric motor M<b>1</b> includes a current sensor, and the control program <b>83</b> of the monitoring device <b>8</b> acquires a value of the current sensor and detects the failure when the current of the electric motor M<b>1</b> is cut off (or decreased). However, the present invention is not limited to this example. For example, the electric motor M<b>1</b> may include a failure detection device (not illustrated) that detects a failure by monitoring a current or a drive state, and the failure detection device may notify the monitoring device <b>8</b> of an occurrence of the failure when the failure occurs. Furthermore, as the vehicle speed sensor <b>11</b>, a wheel speed sensor that detects a rotational speed of the wheel, an acceleration sensor, a satellite positioning system, or the like can be adopted.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A traveling state when the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a profile of a vehicle speed and a state of an electric motor in a case where the present invention is not applied. As an example, drive states and vehicle speeds of the electric motors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> when the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails while the vehicle is traveling at 100 km/h are illustrated.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the vehicle is traveling at 100 km/h, the vehicle travels by the driving force of the electric motor M<b>1</b>, and the electric motor M<b>2</b> is driven by the engine <b>5</b> to be in a power generation state. Here, it is assumed that when the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails, the monitoring device <b>8</b> detects the failure, engages the clutch <b>6</b><i>b</i>, and connects the electric motor M<b>2</b> to the wheel <b>3</b>. In this case, the rotational force of the wheel <b>3</b> is applied to the electric motor M<b>2</b>, and the electric motor M<b>2</b> rotates at a high speed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the electric motor M<b>2</b> rotates by an external force, the electric motor M<b>2</b> enters a power generation (regeneration) state, and the vehicle speed rapidly decreases due to a resistance of the electric motor M<b>2</b> in the power generation state.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the vehicle speed becomes equal to or less than a constant vehicle speed Vt, the driving force of the electric motor M<b>2</b> is obtained in a range, and the vehicle is in a traveling state at a low speed. Such a rapid decrease in the vehicle speed may cause rear-end collision of a following vehicle or slip of the vehicle. In addition, a load is applied to the clutch <b>6</b><i>c </i>having a weak strength due to rapid deceleration by the electric motor M<b>2</b>, which may cause a failure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a profile of drive states and vehicle speeds of the electric motors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> when the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails in the hybrid drive system including the monitoring device <b>8</b> to which the present invention is applied.

The vehicle travels by means of inertia after time T<b>1</b>, and gradually decelerates due to travel resistance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, at time T<b>2</b> when the vehicle speed decreases to a predetermined vehicle speed Vt, the monitoring device <b>8</b> engages the clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>and connects the electric motor M<b>2</b> to the wheel <b>3</b>.

The operation of the engine <b>5</b> may be continued.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the vehicle speed is equal to or less than the constant vehicle speed Vt, the driving force of the electric motor M<b>2</b> is obtained, so that the vehicle can travel at a low speed after time T<b>2</b>. By the function of the monitoring device <b>8</b>, the vehicle can be decelerated and retracted to a safe place while securing safety by executing an appropriate brake operation without rapidly decelerating the vehicle. The brake operation can be performed by an automatic driving control unit (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example in which the clutch <b>6</b><i>c </i>is released at time T<b>2</b> when the driving by the electric motor M<b>2</b> is started, and the engine <b>5</b> is disconnected from the electric motor M<b>2</b>, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the clutch <b>6</b><i>c </i>may be released in a period before time T<b>2</b> at which the clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>is engaged after time T<b>1</b> at which the failure of the electric motor M<b>1</b> is detected. When the monitoring device <b>8</b> releases the clutch <b>6</b><i>c </i>at time T<b>2</b>, the battery BT can be charged during the inertia traveling.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reason why rapid braking is applied when the clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>is engaged to switch to the electric motor M<b>2</b> while the vehicle is traveling at a high speed will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph illustrating a relationship between the rotational speeds of the electric motor M<b>1</b> and the electric motor M<b>2</b> and a maximum torque.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The torque of the electric motor M<b>1</b> has a characteristic that the torque decreases as the rotational speed increases. This is because when the electric motor M<b>1</b> rotates at a high rotational speed, a counter electromotive force increases, and a drive current for traveling cannot flow.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The maximum torque of the electric motor M<b>2</b> is lower than that of the electric motor M<b>1</b> because a low-output electric motor is used. The range in which the drive torque (positive torque) for causing the vehicle to travel by the electric motor M<b>2</b> is obtained is up to a rotational speed Nt, and when the rotational speed reaches Nt or more due to an external force, it becomes a power generation region, and a deceleration torque (negative torque) is generated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Therefore, when switching to the electric motor M<b>2</b> is performed when the vehicle is traveling at a high speed at the time of a failure of the electric motor M<b>1</b>, if the rotational speed of the electric motor M<b>2</b> exceeds Nt, the electric motor M<b>2</b> becomes a power generation region and a deceleration torque is generated. The higher the vehicle speed, the more rapid the deceleration.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to avoid the rapid deceleration, in the present invention, the second drive device <b>2</b> including the electric motor M<b>1</b> (first electric motor) that causes the vehicle to travel and the electric motor M<b>2</b> (second electric motor) having a smaller output than the electric motor M<b>1</b> includes the monitoring device <b>8</b> that monitors the state of the vehicle, and the monitoring device <b>8</b> detects the failure of the electric motor M<b>1</b> and switches to the vehicle travel by the electric motor M<b>2</b> when the vehicle speed becomes equal to or less than the vehicle speed Vt at which the positive torque is obtained from the electric motor M<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Note that, in a case where the vehicle speed is low (equal to or less than Vt) and the rotational speed of the electric motor M<b>2</b> when switching to the electric motor M<b>2</b> is equal to or less than Nt, switching to the electric motor M<b>2</b> can be performed at the time point when the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As a result, it is possible to perform a safe fail operation even when the low cost electric motor M<b>2</b> having a small output or the small clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>is used, and it is possible to achieve both miniaturization, cost reduction, and redundancy of the hybrid drive system.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Whether the electric motor M<b>2</b> is in the positive torque range at the time of a failure of the electric motor M<b>1</b> can be calculated from the vehicle speed and the rotational speed of the wheel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph illustrating an example of a relationship among the vehicle speed, the rotational speed of the wheel, and the rotational speed of the electric motor M<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The relationship among these can be calculated from a diameter of the wheel and a reduction ratio between the electric motor M<b>2</b> and the wheel. The rotational speed of the wheel at the rotational speed Nt for obtaining the positive torque by the electric motor M<b>2</b> is Nt&#x2032;, and the vehicle speed is Vt.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to determine the switching of a drive source when the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails, the rotational speed of the wheel and the vehicle speed can be used, but the present invention is not limited to any of these values. In addition, since a power generation capacity and a driving capability of the electric motor M<b>2</b> are appropriately designed depending on the engine, the vehicle weight, or the like, the range (Nt) in which the positive torque of the electric motor M<b>2</b> is obtained is not uniformly determined.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a modification of Example 1 and illustrating a relationship between an electric motor and a clutch. In the modification, a hybrid drive system in which a range in which a positive torque can be obtained in traveling by the electric motor M<b>2</b> can be adjusted will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram obtained by extracting a portion that transmits the driving force of the electric motor M<b>1</b> and the electric motor M<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to the wheel <b>3</b>. The difference from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is that a rotation speed converter <b>9</b> is provided between the electric motor M<b>2</b> and the clutch <b>6</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As the rotation speed converter <b>9</b>, a combination of a pair of rotation gears, a belt, a pulley, or the like can be used. The rotation speed converter <b>9</b> increases the rotational speed of the electric motor M<b>2</b> to drive the wheel <b>3</b>. Note that the rotation speed converter <b>9</b> may be disposed between the electric motor M<b>2</b> and the wheel <b>3</b>, and may be disposed, for example, between the clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the wheel <b>3</b>. The driving force may be transmitted between the clutch <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the wheel <b>3</b> by a gear. Effects obtained by providing the rotation speed converter <b>9</b> will be described below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph of the torque and the rotational speed output from the electric motor M<b>2</b> via the rotation speed converter <b>9</b>. A transmission ratio of the rotation speed converter <b>9</b> is different between characteristics of the electric motor M<b>2</b> in the drawing and an electric motor M<b>2</b>&#x2032; indicated by a solid line in the drawing. For example, the characteristic of the electric motor M<b>2</b>&#x2032; is set such that the transmission ratio is smaller than the characteristic of the electric motor M<b>2</b>. In the present example, the transmission ratio is defined as an input-shaft rotational speed/an output-side rotational speed of the rotation speed converter <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Since the rotational speed on the output side of the rotation speed converter <b>9</b> is increased by decreasing the transmission ratio (less than 1), it is possible to generate a positive torque up to a higher rotational speed. On the other hand, by setting the transmission ratio to be small, the maximum torque that can be output from the rotation speed converter <b>9</b> decreases. If the positive torque can be generated up to the high rotation range, a traveling range of the electric motor M<b>2</b> can be expanded, and the vehicle can be retracted more safely while suppressing a decrease in the vehicle speed during high-speed traveling or climbing. How much the transmission ratio is set can be appropriately designed by a weight of the vehicle and a maximum output of the electric motor M<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although an example in which the electric motor M<b>1</b> has failed has been described in the present example, the control of the monitoring device <b>8</b> can be applied even in a case where any one of the electric motor M<b>1</b> included in the first drive device, the inverter IN<b>1</b>, or the controller MC<b>1</b> has failed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As described above, in the hybrid drive system of the present example, when the traveling electric motor M<b>1</b> fails, it is possible to realize a low-cost redundant configuration by using the electric motor M<b>2</b> as a generator as the power source.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Then, it is possible to provide a hybrid drive system that secures safety by adopting the electric motor M<b>2</b> having a maximum torque smaller than that of the electric motor M<b>1</b> and gradually decelerating the vehicle speed by inertia traveling until a driving state of the vehicle in a case where the electric motor M<b>1</b> fails reaches a predetermined condition (vehicle speed is equal to or less than Vt) in which a driving force (positive torque) can be generated by the electric motor M<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, in the present example, an example in which the engine <b>5</b> is used as a power source in a case where the electric motor M<b>2</b> is used as a generator has been described, but the invention is not limited thereto.
