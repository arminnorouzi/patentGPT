More specifically, the invention pertains to the field of seismic engineering.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior art's two main types of structures, stiff monolithic and flexible segmented, are at the two opposite ends of the seismic performance spectrum. Stiff monolithic structures are operational only until the design earthquake level is reached, and then brake. Flexible segmented structures have higher design earthquake level, however, their low stiffness, causing an earlier transition from stiff to flexible state, reduces their operational level far below the operational level of stiff structures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Prior art building code mostly prescribes stiff monolithic structures, designed to withstand reaction forces in an earthquake by strength as a single solid body. The main problem with the code approach is that the stiff structures resist the full reaction forces at once, which significantly reduces achievable design earthquake level.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Without compromising on stiffness of the structures, negative effects of earthquakes in the stiff structures can be mitigated to some extent by using various prior art methods, such as base isolation and tuned-mass damping.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Prior art research attempts to develop flexible segmented structures designed to reduce reaction forces by letting segments to move relative to each other, proportionally to magnitude of each earthquake. The main problem with the research approach is that stiffness of the flexible segmented structures is far too low to be accepted by the code, which keeps research experiments from influencing the code.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Deficiencies in the prior art design and construction of earthquake-resistant structures can be summarized in a two-fold problem statement as follows:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Unsatisfactory seismic performance of prior art structures, despite excessive cost of prior art design and construction.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This invention presents a plurality of interrelated components of a solution to the stated two-fold problem in the prior art, wherein the solution comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">a. improved seismic resistance of structures by transition from stiff to non destructible flexible state at a threshold earthquake level higher than prior art maximum design earthquake level of stiff structures;
