5, 2021, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a display device and a tiled display having the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the information-oriented society evolves, various demands for display devices are ever increasing. For example, display devices are being employed by a variety of electronic devices such as smart phones, digital cameras, laptop computers, navigation devices, and smart televisions. Display devices may be flat panel display devices such as a liquid-crystal display device, a field emission display device, and an organic light-emitting display device. Among such flat panel display devices, a light-emitting display device includes a light-emitting element that can emit light on its own, so that each of the pixels of the display panel can emit light by themselves. Accordingly, a light-emitting display device can display images without a backlight unit that supplies light to the display panel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For a display device having a large screen, a great amount of pixels are disposed, and thus the defect rate of light-emitting elements may increase while productivity or reliability may deteriorate. To overcome such issues, a tiled display can provide a large screen by connecting a plurality of display devices having a relatively small size. Such a tiled display may include boundary areas between a plurality of display devices, which are referred to as seams because there are the non-display areas or bezel areas between the plurality of display devices adjacent to each other. When a single image is displayed on the full screen, such boundary areas between the display devices result in visible seams, hindering a viewer from getting immersed into the image.</p><heading
