Such macromolecules and polymers can be used as building blocks for block copolymers having characteristics suitable for use in a wide range of applications, including adhesives and especially hot melt adhesives and pressure sensitive adhesives.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0003">While bio-based and degradable or compostable polymers are well-known, few provide the proper properties to replace styrene block copolymers (SBc) currently used to formulate hot melt adhesive (HMA) and pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) products. Current bio-based materials are simply not well-suited to generate low modulus, elastomeric adhesives with high bonding performance. Currently, there is not a commercial material available that possesses the phase-separated morphology and displays the desired hard-soft behavior offered by SBc-based adhesives. As used herein, &#x201c;bio-based&#x201d; means that the material is made using sustainable sources and not petroleum-based products.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">In <i>Poly. Chem., </i>2015, 6, 1445, the authors describe both the conversion of alkyl-substituted 1,2-epoxides to lactone species and the subsequent ring-opening polymerization to provide PLA-PHA-PLA triblock materials. A homopolymer of one long-chain alky lactone with R=n-C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>21 </sub>(referred to as &#x3b2;-TBL) is reported. It was made using benzyl alcohol and not a diol initiator; accordingly, the resultant polymer is not a diol. The polymerization kinetics of &#x3b2;-TBL are examined, but, unlike the Me, Et, and n-Bu derivatives described in the paper, little characterization is reported on the properties of the polymer nor is the analog of the triblock produced. Interestingly, the authors find shorter chain hydroxyl butyric acid (HBA) species to be miscible as Tg values for the HBA block are shifted at even low n values for PLA (n=10, m=100) and collapse to a single Tg at higher values (n=50, m=100) for the methyl derivative. Similar trends were seen for the ethyl derivative. The n-butyl derivative is largely unaffected even up to n=100 and m=75. At higher PLA levels (n=75 and m=100), the Tg collapses, implying the phases have some degree of miscibility. Also of note with regard to the novelty of the polymers proposed in this paper, the authors make the following statement:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0005">While both homopolymerization and copolymerization using &#x3b2;-BL are well understood, there has not yet been a study of the effect of changing the nature of the alkyl substituent in R lactone polymerization.

Suitable examples of these 1,2-long-chain epoxides include: Vikolox 10 (R=n-octyl), Vikolox 12 (R=n-decyl), Vikolox 14 (R=n-dodecyl), Vikolox 16 (R=n-tetradecyl), and Vikolox 18 (R=hexadecyl). The inventive materials are produced by performing a carbonylation reaction on a long-alkyl chain epoxide to generate a &#x3b2;-lactone. The lactone subsequently undergoes a ring opening polymerization to yield a polyester in the poly(hydroxyalkonaote), PHA, family, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, an epoxy (such as 1,2-epoxyhexadecane) and one or more catalysts (such as ClCr (TTP) and dicobalt octacarbonyl) may be dissolved in a solvent in a pressure-rated reaction vessel. The vessel can then be flushed with carbon monoxide and heated to carbonylate the epoxide. Carbonylation of internal epoxides can also be performed to give di-substituted lactones. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of one such internal epoxide produced by Arkema and sold under the trade name Vikoflex 7150.

To achieve this, the ring-opening transesterification polymerization (ROTEP) is done using a diol-initiator, such as 1,4-benzenedimethanol, along with a metal catalyst to provide hydroxy-terminated polymers, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. More specifically, 1,4-benzenedimethanol initiator, Sn(octyl)<sub>2 </sub>catalyst, and the &#x3b2;-lactone of formula I can be dissolved in a solvent and placed in a pressure-rated reaction vessel. The sealed vessel can then be heated under sufficient conditions to polymerize the &#x3b2;-lactone monomer. The vessel can then be cooled to room temperature and the reaction product can then be precipitated using another solvent to provide poly(&#x3b2;-lactone). The copolymerization of the &#x3b2;-lactone of formula I along with one or both of the other lactone monomers shown in formulas II or III would be substantially similar. Alternatively, a long-chain diol, such as a hydroxy-terminated macromolecule or polymer like polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, could also be employed as an initiator to impart flexibility to the main polymer chain.

Ring-opening polymerization on mixtures of the chiral materials can be performed to control the tacticity&#x2014;and in turn&#x2014;the thermal and mechanical properties of the final product.

Inclusion of these comonomers as well as their derivatives with pendant alkyl groups can be performed to alter the thermal and hydrolytic stabilities as well as the overall crystallinity and mechanical properties of the inventive polymers.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0072">Introduction of some stereoregularity (tacticity) in the mid-block is also a possible option to optimize the inventive PHA performance. Bacteria/biomass derived long chain PHA's are isotactic and this more regular array of side groups gives them crystalline behavior. For example, relatively long-chain isotactic PHAs (R=10 and 12) display Tm values in the range of 40 to 80&#xb0; C. These systems may display more crystallinity than desired for the reasons described above. Nevertheless, introduction of some degree of crystallinity using judiciously selected mixtures of enantiomerically-pure or enriched lactone monomers could be employed to target materials with fairly low crystallinity with Tm values in the range of 20-40&#xb0; C., potentially allowing for tackifier free systems to be developed that display creep resistance. If the overall crystallinity is low and these materials can be plasticized to effectively depress the crystallinity even further, the materials might function well as PSA's where tack is required at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0073">The introduction of some lower chain alkyl moieties into the PHA backbone (R=octyl or less) could serve a similar role to change thermal behaviour as is proposed by introducing tacticity above.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074">PHA polymers could be generated using mixtures of long-chain lactone monomers, for example a random copolymer of C<sub>8 </sub>and C<sub>18 </sub>n-alkyls substituents. Although this likely will not change the thermal behaviour dramatically as atactic PHA copolymers, it is potentially a method to vary the van der Waals bonding forces exhibited by adhesive made from the inventive polymers, copolymers, and block copolymers. Such variations could allow the adhesives to be designed to selectively fail adhesively or cohesively.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0075">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the &#x3b2;-lactone monomers of formula I are non-functionalized and, preferably, the &#x3b2;-lactone monomers of formula II are also non-functionalized and/or the higher lactone monomers of formula III are also non-functionalized. As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-functionalized&#x201d; means that the monomer does contain any groups that would polymerize or otherwise react upon application of heat, uv-curing, and/or catalysis, other than the lactone group itself or its precursor which forms the polymer backbone. Thus, embodiments using monomers which are non-functionalized would not be suitable to make cross-linkable, curable adhesives.

For example, macromolecules of the present invention which are diols can be reacted with diacids or diesters to make (co)polyesters, or they can be reacted with diisocyanates to polyurethanes. Similarly, they could be reacted with acid-terminated polyesters or NCO-end capped polyurethanes to provide species with compostable/biodegradable elastomeric blocks. Another method of the invention comprises reacting the diol macromolecules (or macromolecules of higher functionality) of the present invention with siloxides to form alkoxysilane-terminated oligomer or polymer, for example having &#x2014;Si(OMe)<sub>3 </sub>and &#x2014;Si(OEt)<sub>3 </sub>end groups, to provide moisture curable polymers.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0084">In still another embodiment of the invention, such diol-terminated PHA species could also be employed to produce tri-block copolymers. For example, the polymers can serve as diol-macromonomer initiators in ring-opening trans-esterification polymerization (ROTEP) of lactide to provide triblock species with another polymer backbone as end-blocks. Thus, an embodiment of the invention is a triblock copolymer having an A:B:A backbone, wherein block B comprises the residue of the any of the macromolecules described above, and block A selected from the group consisting of polylactic acid, polycaprolactone, polystyrene, polyhydroxybutyrates, PMMA, or polyamides, or copolymers thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an example in which Block A is a residue of polylactic acid. More generally, block A may be any ring-opened polymerized product of lactide. This includes polylactide copolymers of lactic acid and lactones, such as glycolide and caprolactone. In a preferred embodiment, block A comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of polylactic acid. As will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, reference herein to a polymer in a block structure means the residue of that polymer as it is in the form of a block copolymer.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0085">Alternatively, the triblock systems can be prepared via living ROTEP using a non-diol initiator and sequential monomer addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Similar methods may be employed to produce both di- and multi-block copolymers. Free radical polymerization and other polymerization methods may be used to make the triblock copolymers of the present invention. For example, a hydroxy-terminated macromolecule according to any embodiment of the invention can be used as a macroinitiator, by dissolving it in a solvent along with a catalyst (such as Sn(octyl)<sub>2</sub>), and DL-lactide in a sealed reaction vessel. The reactants can then be heated under conditions to polymerize the lactide monomers, initiated at the hydroxyl groups at the terminal ends of the macromolecule starting material. After cooling, the reaction product may be precipitated using a solvent to provide the PLA-poly(&#x3b2;-lactone-co-&#x3b5;-caprolactone)-PLA triblock polymer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The molar percents of the two blocks may vary over a wide range, with the triblock copolymer comprising 95 to 40 molar percent of the block B and 60 to 5 molar percent of the block A, preferably 95 to 60 molar percent of block B and 40 to 5 molar percent of block A.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0086">The most preferred end-blocks (i.e., referred to herein also as block A) are materials known to display biodegradability or composability like that of the PHA mid-block. The end-blocks should display high modulus values to provide toughness and thermal resistance to the material. In some embodiments, such modulus values may be in the range of 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>Pa at 20&#xb0; C. Towards this end, these &#x201c;hard blocks&#x201d; can be crystalline in nature displaying melt points, Tm, in the range of 60 to 165&#xb0; C. Alternatively, the end-blocks may be amorphous species with Tg values ranging from 40 to 200&#xb0; C. In contrast, the mid-block (i.e., block B) is elastomeric or rubbery and has a lower Tg as indicated above and preferably at most 40&#xb0; C., preferably at most 30&#xb0; C., more preferably at most 25&#xb0; C., and still more preferably at most 0&#xb0; C., and most preferably at most &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., all depending on the needs presented by the ultimate application of the block polymer. If crystalline, block B may have a melting point, Tm, below 30&#xb0; C., preferably below 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">For optimal performance, the end-blocks are designed to display poor miscibility with the PHA mid-block leading to distinct phases in the block copolymer. Poor miscibility can be demonstrated by the two blocks showing microphase separation, as evidenced by differences in crystallinity and/or distinct glass transition temperatures, Tg, in the DSC. This can be noted by seeing only minor shifts in the Tg values of any signals present in the DCS of the block copolymers (note: if one of the materials is present at low amounts&#x2014;for example in a 5-90-5 triblock copolymer, end-block signals are typically weak and can't be seen for the lower weight percent fraction). The phase separation is critical in certain applications as it enables the polymer to display the positive features of the individual segments. For example, low modulus at room temperature while still having good thermal resistance or ability to set up quickly and yet still provide creep resistance in an elastic adhesive application. Miscibility can result in the materials displaying compromised properties between those of the individual segments and closer to those of a random copolymer made from the materials. Materials showing good miscibility between blocks may still find utility in hot melt adhesives or in other applications not requiring high tack at room temperature, however.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">Block A, such as the PLA end-groups, can be made from various isomers of monomers. For example, the PLA end groups may be made from a racemic mixture of the D- and L-stereoisomers; from lactide monomers consisting essentially of, or consisting of, L-lactide stereoisomers; or from lactide monomers consisting essentially of, or consisting of, D-lactide stereoisomers. The selection of the stereochemistry of the monomers of the end blocks may be based on the desired thermal properties of the block copolymer. The L,L isomer provides crystalline end-blocks, melting in the range of 150-200&#xb0; C.; polymers from racemic mixtures, on the other hand, are amorphous and display Tg values in the range of 50-70&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">In embodiments of the invention, the macromolecule of the invention or the triblock copolymer made therefrom are compostable. As used herein, the term &#x201c;compostable&#x201d; as applied to an adhesive is an adhesive which meets the requirements of either: (1) the Disintegration Testing as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ISO 20200) (84 day compost exposure) or (2) the Aerobic Biodegradation as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ASTM 5338-15) (at 58&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. at 141 days). In other words, the adhesive will reach a minimum of 90% weight loss within 84 days under the Disintegration Testing conditions or will have reached at least 90% carbon conversion (based on CO<sub>2 </sub>production) within 141 days according to the Aerobic Biodegradation testing as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ASTM 5338-15) (at 58&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. at 141 days). In preferred embodiments, the adhesive meets the requirements of both: (1) the Disintegration Testing as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ISO 20200) (84 day compost exposure) and (2) the Aerobic Biodegradation as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ASTM 5338-15) (at 58&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. at 141 days).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0090">In terms of molecular weight, the inventive PHA polymers possess a degree of polymerization, m, of anywhere from 20 to 2,000 with number average molecular weights, Mn, of m&#xd7;MW lactone monomer; as ROTEP is living in nature and gives polydispersity values only slightly above 1, the weight average Mw values will be very close to the Mn. Molecular weight values of the inventive polymers can be determined using a variety of methods including NMR analysis as well as those well-known in the art. Values herein refer to absolute values based on degree of polymerization. In the case of diol initiated ROTEP, m can be between 10-1000 as branches grow off both sides of the diol. For the hard segments in block copolymers, the degree of polymerization, n, can be between 20-1000.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">In terms of block copolymer composition, any combination of m and n values can be used. Most preferred will be those containing 95 to 40 molar percent of the inventive PHA and 60 to 5 molar percent of the &#x201c;hard&#x201d; end block segments such that the overall storage modulus (G&#x2032;) of the block copolymer is not substantially higher than 10<sup>6 </sup>Pa at room temperature to maintain tack when formulated. For example, a PLA-PHA-PLA triblock copolymer using the lactone of formula I with R<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>21 </sub>(MW monomer=184 g/mol) to generate a midblock with a 90,000 g/mol molecular weight (m=489 moles) and two 5,000 g/mol PLA end-blocks (n=69 moles for each), the net molar composition would be a 11 mol % PLA-78 mol % PHA-11 mol % PLA.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">The inventive PHA polymers and block copolymers can be used in hot met adhesives, HMA, and embodiments of the invention are especially suitable for use in pressure sensitive adhesives. Accordingly, the PHA &#x201c;soft blocks&#x201d; may be tailored to provide optimal properties for displaying tack over a range of temperatures. Specifically, the mid-blocks may be designed to have low crystallinity and low modulus values with their highest thermal transition (Tg or Tm) below 40&#xb0; C. The most preferred inventive PHA materials for use in PSA applications are those that show little crystallinity or are completely amorphous. These may be formed from polymerization of racemic long-chain alkyl lactone monomers along with the &#x3b2;-lactone monomers of formula I. The Tg values for these materials may be below &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. Low crystallinity or amorphous mid-blocks are also desirable as they are most likely to be easily plasticized to enable the adhesives to flow readily and wet out surfaces to form strong bonds. They also should display good long-term compatibility with plasticizers and other formulation components, such as tackifiers, used in hot melt and pressure sensitive adhesives.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0093">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a multipurpose hot melt adhesive comprises: 5 to 40 weight percent of a PLA-PHA-PLA triblock copolymer as described herein; 20 to 70 weight percent of a tackifier; 0 to 30 weight percent of a plasticizer, such as castor oil; and 0.1 to 4 weight percent antioxidant. Optional additives (up to 50% by weight) may be incorporated into the hot melt compositions depending on the end use of the composition. Among these additives may be included colorants such as titanium dioxide; fluorescent agents; and fillers such as talc, clay, calcium carbonate, silica, mica, wollastonite, feldspar, aluminum silicate, alumina, hydrated alumina, glass microspheres, ceramic microspheres, thermoplastic micropheres, baryte and wood flour, as well as minor amounts (e.g., less than about 5%) of a wax such as a petroleum derived wax, a synthetic wax or a polyolefin wax.

The multipurpose hot melt adhesive compositions according to this embodiment have a high level of creep resistance, high bond strength, and relatively low viscosity. Such hot melt adhesives may be applied to substrates using a variety of application techniques. Examples includes hot melt glue gun, hot melt slot-die coating, hot melt wheel coating, hot melt roller coating, melt blown coating, spiral spray and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the hot melt adhesive is sprayed onto a substrate using spiral spray, which is a preferred technique to produce a filamentary spiral pattern for elastic attachment and construction in diaper manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0094">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a hot melt adhesive comprises: the triblock copolymer described above; the silane-modified, moisture curable polymer made from reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a siloxide; the polyurethane made from reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a diisocyanate; or the (co)polyester made reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a diacid or a diester.

Accordingly, an effect of embodiments of the invention is to provide a greater degradation rate because of the higher degree of ester groups along the backbone, and this may be done without unduly compromising adhesive or cohesive strength. Without being bound to any theory, this effect may be due to the increased Van der Waal's forces capable of bonding with substrates, which is also enhanced by having a long-chain alkyl substitution. Embodiments of the present invention would have one long-chain alkyl substituent for every four atoms along the backbone, whereas the macromolecules made from higher lactones (e.g., seven-membered rings) would have only one long-chain alkyl substituent for every seven atoms along the backgone.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0096">Embodiments of the invention are directed to macromolecules made from a monomer of formula I and one or both of monomers of formula II or III. The inclusion of one or two comonomers enables the production of macromolecules having a wider range of melting points and glass transition temperatures so that a more diverse range of macromolecules can be made in accordance with this invention. Consequently, adhesives having a wider range of properties can be made in accordance with this invention. In particular, the ratio of the higher lactone comonomer of formula III to the &#x3b2;-lactone monomer of formula I can be altered to change the melting point and glass transition temperature of the co-polymerized macromolecule relative to the respective individual homopolymers.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0097">In addition, macromolecules of the present invention have a long-chain alkyl substituent. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that such long-chain alkyl substituents better break up regions of crystallinity to provide a more rubbery macromolecule. When such a macromolecule is used as the mid-block of relatively stiffer end blocks in an ABA pattern, the resulting block copolymer has properties which simulate the properties of many styrene block copolymers used in hot melt adhesives but are not sourced from petroleum fuel and may be compostable if properly formulated.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">ASPECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0098">Aspect 1.
