In addition, the power consumption of mLEDs is about 10% of that of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and about 50% of that of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Furthermore, mLEDs have a brightness which is 30 times higher than that of OLEDs that are self-emissive like mLEDs, and a dissolution of 1500 PPI (pixels per inch). Since mLEDs has these significant advantages, they are promising as substitutes for presently used OLEDs and LCDs to become the next generation display light sources.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, mLEDs have yet to be mass produced due to various technical difficulties.
