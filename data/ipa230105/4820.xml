disclosure and the terms used herein are not intended to limit the technology described to a specific embodiment, and should be understood to include various modifications, equivalents, and/or substitutions of those embodiments. In connection with the description of the drawings, like reference numerals may be used for like components. A singular expression may include a plural expression, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Expressions such as &#x201c;A or B&#x201d;, &#x201c;at least one of A and/or B&#x201d;, &#x201c;A, B or C&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one of A, B and/or C&#x201d; may include all the possible combinations of the items listed together. Expressions such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d; or the like may modify the corresponding elements regardless of their order or importance and are used only to distinguish one element from another element and not intended to limit the corresponding elements thereto. When a certain (e.g., a first) element is referred to as being &#x201c;(functionally or communicatively) connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another (e.g., a second) element, the element (e.g., the first) may be either directly connected to the other element (e.g., the second) or may be connected through another element (e.g., a third component).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; do not denote a limitation of quantity, and are intended to include both the singular and plural, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example, &#x201c;an element&#x201d; has the same meaning as &#x201c;at least one element,&#x201d; unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. &#x201c;At least one&#x201d; is not to be construed as limiting &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an.&#x201d; &#x201c;Or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or.&#x201d; As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on &#x201c;upper&#x201d; sides of the other elements. The term &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; depending on the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements.

For example, the first body part indicated by the node corresponding to the first state and the other body part indicated by the node corresponding to the third state may be independent of each other.

Based on the connection between the nodes <b>1615</b>, <b>1522</b> and <b>1550</b>, the electronic device may recognize that displaying the notifying window requires using of the eyes, which is a body part exclusively used in the user's current state. For example, the electronic device may recognize that the user in cleaning action will have to at least temporarily cease the cleaning action in order to gaze at the notifying window. The electronic device, according to an embodiment, may select and execute another function of notifying an incoming call, without displaying such a notifying window, which is a function requiring use of the eye that is a body part exclusively used in the user's current state.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">For example, the node <b>1610</b> corresponding to the state of notifying an incoming call to a user using a voice alarm may be connected to the node <b>1524</b> connected based on intensity indicating partial use with the node <b>1550</b> corresponding to the current state.

For example, it is assumed that the intensity <b>1711</b> between the node <b>1550</b> corresponding to the cleaning state and the node <b>1524</b> corresponding to the ear is &#x2018;0.7&#x2019;, and the intensity between the node <b>1610</b> corresponding to the state of outputting the voice alarm and the node <b>1524</b> corresponding to the ears is &#x2018;0.7&#x2019;. When the user's current state corresponds to both the two distinct states, the electronic device, according to an embodiment, may identify overusing of the body part, by using a sum of the intensities <b>1711</b> and <b>1720</b> between the node <b>1524</b> corresponding to the body part related to both the two states and the nodes <b>1550</b> and <b>1610</b> corresponding to each of the two states.

For example, the electronic device may execute the function to reduce the intensity <b>1711</b> by a difference (e.g., &#x2018;0.4&#x2019;) between the sum (e.g., &#x2018;1.4&#x2019;) of the intensities <b>1711</b> and <b>1720</b> and a predetermined threshold (e.g., &#x2018;1&#x2019;). For example, the predetermined threshold may be a threshold value indicating overusing of a body part. In an embodiment, the adjustment of the intensity <b>1711</b> by the electronic device may be performed within a range in between a minimum intensity value (e.g., a value indicating that a body part is not used at all, such as &#x2018;0&#x2019;) and a maximum intensity value (e.g., a value meaning an exclusive use of a body part, such as &#x2018;1&#x2019;).</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">The electronic device, according to an embodiment, may execute a function for reducing overusing of a body part in the state, based on the attributes of the node <b>1550</b> corresponding to the state having a relatively low priority.
