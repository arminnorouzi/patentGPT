More specifically, to account for different entities individually tracking player activity data, such as player preferences and/or states of one or more games, and further to account for certain players wanting access to the tracked player activity data across such different entities, the system of the present application forms one or more groups of such entities and enables the access or modification of such tracked player activity data across such different entities. Put differently, the system disclosed herein binds or otherwise clusters one or more entities together with respect to the creation, handling and access to player activity data such that a player's progress through different stages or states of one or more games seamlessly persists from a first entity to a second, different entity which is grouped with or otherwise associated with the first entity. Accordingly, by clustering different entities and enabling such entities to share (or even modify) part or all of the data sets which each respective entity individually maintains in association with an individual player, the system enables processes to be applied to different player activity data sets across different types of gaming such that a player may view persistent data between different entities and/or utilize such persistent data between these different entities.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, prior to providing one entity access to (or the ability to modify) player activity data associated with another entity, the system establishes a grouping of entities that have agreed to interact together with respect to persistent player activity data of one or more players. For example, the system determines to group a first gaming establishment venue (or first gaming establishment brand) with a second, different gaming establishment venue (or second gaming establishment brand). In these embodiments, after establishing the grouping of entities and prior to providing one entity access to (or the ability to modify) player activity data associated with another entity, the system determines the scope or magnitude of the entity interaction. In one such embodiment, the system determines the scope of the entity interaction by determining each entities ability to modify one or more aspects of the player activity data. For example, the system determines that the persistent player activity data of player preference data associated with a first gaming establishment may be utilized to customize the player preferences for a play of a game at a second, different gaming establishment (which is clustered with the first gaming establishment) and further that the player preference data associated with the first gaming establishment may be modified in association with one or more inputs made at the second gaming establishment. In another such embodiment, the system determines the scope of the entity interaction by determining whether the different entities will each share or otherwise contribute data pertaining to different types of gaming activities, such as (i) monetary wagering gaming activities, (ii) casual non-monetary wagering gaming activities, or (iii) monetary wagering gaming activities and casual non-monetary wagering gaming activities. For example, the system determines that while casual non-monetary wagering gaming data associated with a first gaming establishment may be accessible in association with a second, different gaming establishment (which is clustered with the first gaming establishment), monetary wagering gaming data associated with the first gaming establishment may not be accessed in association with the second, different gaming establishment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Following the determination of the scope of the entity interaction, the system enables the individual entity data that falls within the determined scope of the entity interaction to be shared (and potentially modified) from one clustered entity to another clustered entity. That is, after defining one or more parameters for which data will be shared between clustered entities and how each individual entity may utilize such data (i.e., after forming a ring-fence between disparate entities), the system enables the different entities access to the pooled data sets to enhance the player's gaming experience amongst the different clustered entities. Put differently, this binding of entities coupled with defining types of data to be shared and/or modified enables the dissemination of data amongst different bound entities to provide a player a seamless gaming experience wherein data associated with the player becomes mobile regardless of which particular clustered entity the player is currently located at.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example process or method of operating the system of the present disclosure. In various embodiments, the process is represented by a set of instructions stored in one or more memories and executed by one or more processors. Although the process is described with reference to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, many other processes of performing the acts associated with this illustrated process may be employed. For example, the order of certain of the illustrated blocks or diamonds may be changed, certain of the illustrated blocks or diamonds may be optional, or certain of the illustrated blocks or diamonds may not be employed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In operation of this example embodiment, upon a coordinating player activity data triggering event, such as one or more inputs to establish a ring-fence amongst multiple entities, the system identifies a plurality of entities to participate in a ring-fence as indicated in block <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this example embodiment, a ring-fence is a set of one or more parameters or rules applied to multiple groups of entities which bind the entities together with respect to the creation, handling and access of game persistent data and/or player data associated with players that engage these different entities. By identifying different entities to participate in a ring-fence of preconfigured data sharing, the system disclosed herein clusters or otherwise groups different entities together to propagate the sharing of certain types of data between such entities to foster a more seamless experience for the players (whom such data pertains to) in the face of unknown regulative environments and changing customer requirements.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In different embodiments, the game persistent data which may be shared (and modified) amongst different identified entities as part of a ring-fence includes the data pertaining to the one or more states of one or more different games based on an individual player's historical gameplay outcomes and activities. In these embodiments, the states of such games include different aspects of the game which persist or carry over from game play to game play, such as, but not limited to: levels or scores obtained, features locked/unlocked, elements accumulated (e.g., symbols accumulated toward the activation of one or more game play features) and/or events tracked. It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments wherein a game includes both a monetary wagering version and a casual non-monetary wagering version, game persistent data is maintained for each of the respective versions of the game. In certain other embodiments wherein a game includes both a monetary wagering version and a casual non-monetary wagering version, game persistent data is collectively maintained for all of the versions of the game.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In different embodiments, the player data which may be shared (and modified) amongst different identified entities as part of a ring-fence includes the data pertaining to one or more player preferences either inputted by the player or detected based on the individual player's historical activities. In these embodiments, the player preferences include, but are not limited to, how a player prefers a game is configured (e.g., wager options, denomination), how a player prefers game is displayed (e.g., use of specific symbols), a player's preferred service options (e.g., a preferred drink ordered through a service window), and/or how an electronic gaming machine (&#x201c;EGM&#x201d;) or personal gaming device is configured (e.g., volume level). It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments wherein a game includes both a monetary wagering version and a casual non-monetary wagering version, player data is maintained for each of the respective versions of the game. In certain other embodiments wherein a game includes both a monetary wagering version and a casual non-monetary wagering version, player data is collectively maintained for all of the versions of the game.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In certain embodiments, the identified entities include a corporate entity and the various children entities (i.e., zero, one or more gaming establishment brands and zero, one or more gaming establishment venues having one or more EGMs and/or being associated with one or more personal gaming devices) that are associated with that corporate entity. In these embodiments, a gaming establishment venue includes a single property where an EGM may operate, a gaming establishment brand includes a group of gaming establishment venues under a single brand, and a corporate entity includes a group of gaming establishment brands and/or a group of gaming establishment venues. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, amongst the different entities associated with a corporate entity for a first ring-fence, the identified entities include gaming establishment Brand A associated with two gaming establishment venues under Brand A; gaming establishment Brand B associated with two gaming establishment venues under Brand B; and a fifth gaming establishment venue not branded under gaming establishment Brand A or gaming establishment Brand B but otherwise associated with the same corporate entity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In certain embodiments, the identified entities include different corporate entities that are each associated with one or more gaming establishment brands associated with one or more gaming establishment venues. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a first corporate entity (which includes gaming establishment Brand A associated with two gaming establishment venues under Brand A and gaming establishment Brand B associated with two gaming establishment venues under Brand B) and a second, different corporate entity (which includes gaming establishment Brand C associated with two gaming establishment venues under Brand C and gaming establishment Brand D associated with two gaming establishment venues under Brand D) are each identified to participate in a second ring-fence.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be appreciated that based on the entity hierarchy of corporate entity, then brand entity and then venue entity, subject to any exceptions (as described herein), a ring-fence applied to one entity is applied to each of the children entities associated with that one entity. That is, a ring-fence applied to a corporate entity will also be applied, subject to any exceptions, to any brand entities and any venue entities associated with that corporate entity and a ring-fence applied to a brand entity will also be applied, subjected to any exceptions, to any venue entities associated with that brand entity. Such a configuration enables a set of parameters to share data to be relatively quickly set up across a plurality of different entities, certain of which have preexisting hierarchical relationships to facilitate the propagation of such parameters.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In certain embodiments, rather than identifying entities at the corporate level, a plurality of children entities are identified to participate in the ring-fence. In such embodiments, the identified entities include one or more brand entities (i.e., one or more gaming establishment brands associated with one or more gaming establishment venues (having one or more EGMs and/or being associated with one or more personal gaming devices) and/or one or more gaming establishment venues (having one or more EGMs and/or being associated with one or more personal gaming devices) independent of any brand entities). In certain other embodiments, the identified entities include a plurality of venue entities (i.e., a plurality of gaming establishment venues each having one or more EGMs and/or being associated with one or more personal gaming devices).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In various embodiments, the identified entities to participate in a ring-fence are subject to zero, one or more exceptions. In certain embodiments, the exceptions are jurisdictional wherein one or more jurisdictional or regulatory requirements prevent the sharing of game persistent data and/or player data across various entities. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, if Jurisdiction A does not permit the sharing of game persistent data and/or player data across various entities, then for the gaming establishment venues of Jurisdiction A (i.e., gaming establishment venue B<b>2</b> and gaming establishment venue C<b>2</b>), such gaming establishment venues are excluded from the entities identified to participate in a third ring-fence. In certain embodiments, the exceptions are operator objective related wherein one or more business objectives prevent the sharing of game persistent data and/or player data across various entities. For example, if an operator does not want the sharing of game persistent data and/or player data across various entities within a geographic area and/or between certain brands, then the gaming establishment brands and/or the gaming establishment venues located within the geographic areas and/or which are part of the excluded brands are excluded from the entities identified to participate in a ring-fence.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, the system disclosed herein filters certain entities out from participating in a ring-fence by identifying such entities to participate in a sub-ring-fence which includes a modified set of parameters to account for the necessary exceptions. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, if Jurisdiction A does not permit the sharing of game persistent data pertaining to monetary wagering gaming activities across various entities, then for the gaming establishment venues of Jurisdiction A (i.e., gaming establishment venue B<b>2</b> and gaming establishment venue C<b>2</b>), such gaming establishment venues are identified to participate in a sub-ring-fence which does not permit the sharing of game persistent data pertaining to monetary wagering gaming activities.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be appreciated that different exceptions and filtering may apply for different types of data to be shared for different types of gaming segments. That is, since game persistent data and/or player data may be available to be shared across various entities for monetary wagering gaming activities and/or casual non-monetary wagering gaming activities as described herein, the exceptions and filtering to the identified entities may be for all game persistent data and player data across monetary wagering gaming activities and casual non-monetary wagering gaming activities or for different subsets of data across different subsets of gaming activities. For example, an exception in place for a gaming establishment venue which prevents the sharing of game persistent data for monetary wagering gaming activities does not prevent the sharing of game persistent data and/or player data between this gaming establishment venue and other gaming establishment venues and/or gaming establishment brands identified to participate in the same ring-fence as such sharing pertains to casual non-monetary wagering game activities.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">After identifying the entities to participate in a ring-fence, the system determines the gaming segment scope of the ring-fence as indicated in block <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In these embodiments, in view of the different gaming avenues available to players to participate in using monetary funds or non-monetary funds, the system determines whether the identified entities will each share or otherwise contribute data pertaining to: (i) monetary wagering gaming activities, (ii) casual non-monetary wagering gaming activities, or (iii) monetary wagering gaming activities and casual non-monetary wagering gaming activities. For example, the system determines that while casual non-monetary wagering gaming data associated with a first gaming establishment may be accessible in association with a second, different gaming establishment (which is clustered with the first gaming establishment), monetary wagering gaming data associated with the first gaming establishment may not be accessed in association with the second, different gaming establishment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In certain embodiments, the system imposes one or more gaming segment scope restrictions to a ring-fence. In one such embodiment, the system prohibits an identified entity participating in multiple ring-fences of the same gaming scope. In certain other embodiments, the system imposes no restrictions regarding the gaming segment scope applied to one or more ring-fences.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">After identifying the gaming segment scope of the ring-fence of the entities identified to participate in the ring-fence, the system determines a sharing configuration of the data as indicated in block <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In these embodiments, the sharing configuration pertains to each identified entities ability to access (and potentially modify) different data shared amongst the identified entities participating in the ring-fence. It should be appreciated that within the same ring-fence, different sharing configurations may apply to different sets or types of data.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In various embodiments, one of the sharing configurations for certain data includes a standalone configuration of such data. In these embodiments, a standalone configuration associated with certain data provides that such data is not shared between the identified entities of the ring-fence. For example, the system provides that player data of a player's credit card number or other financial institution account numbers are standalone data for each respective identified entity of the ring-fence such that the player's financial institution data is not shared or otherwise viewable amongst the different entities opting to participate in a ring-fence of shared data.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In various embodiments, another one of the sharing configurations for certain data includes a shared configuration of such data. In these embodiments, a shared configuration associated with certain data provides that such data is viewable between the identified entities of the ring-fence, but not modifiable between these identified entities. For example, the system provides that player preferences data regarding personalized symbols to be displayed instead of a game's default symbols may be accessed from any of the identified entities participating in the ring-fence but such personalized symbols may not be modified from any of the entities participating in the ring-fence (except the entity in which the personalized symbols were initially set up).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In various embodiments, another one of the sharing configurations for certain data includes a communal configuration. In these embodiments, a communal configuration associated with certain data provides that such data is not only shared between the identified entities of the ring-fence, but such data may be modified by the identified entities of the ring-fence. For example, the system provides that game persistent data of a player's highest obtained level for a play of a game may not only be accessed by any of the identified entities within the ring-fence, but any of such identified entities may modify the player's highest obtained level responsive to game events occurring in association with such identified entities.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Following the establishment of the sharing configuration, as indicated in block <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system activates the ring-fence for the applicable data to be shared amongst the identified entities participating in the ring-fence. Such a ring-fence enables different data sets to be modifiable, shared, or not shared between different participating entities across different wagering gaming platforms such that certain aspects of a player's gaming experience are fluid from one participating entity to another participating entity. Put differently, the utilization of one or more ring-fences of data provide that, subject to certain exclusions, data sets particular to an individual player are preserved and/or modified between different entities.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Following the activation of the ring-fence for the applicable data to be shared amongst the identified entities participating in the ring-fence and upon a potential data sharing event, the system determines whether a ring-fence is applicable in association with the potential data sharing event as indicated in diamond <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain embodiments, the potential data sharing event includes a player whom is associated with game persistent data and/or player data for a first entity accessing a service at a second entity. For example, a potential data sharing event includes a player (whom a first gaming establishment maintains a first player account for which includes first data pertaining to a first level obtained in association with a monetary wagering game played at the first gaming establishment) accessing a second player account (or otherwise being identified) at a second gaming establishment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the system determines that no ring-fence is applicable in association with the potential data sharing event, as indicated in block <b>112</b>, the system enables the potential data sharing event to proceed without any sharing of any data in association with the potential data sharing event. That is, upon a determination not to share any data from a first entity to a second entity in association with a potential data sharing event, the system enables the potential data sharing event to proceed at the second entity in isolation from the first entity. For example, if the potential data sharing event includes a player (whom a first gaming establishment maintains a first player account for which includes first data pertaining to a first level obtained in association with a first monetary wagering game played at the first gaming establishment) making one or more inputs to play the first monetary wagering game at a second gaming establishment (which is not part of a ring-fence with the first gaming establishment for monetary wagering games), the system enables the player to proceed with the play of the first monetary wagering game without accessing any levels obtained in association with the first monetary wagering game played at the first gaming establishment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the other hand, if the system determines that a ring-fence is applicable in association with the potential data sharing event, as indicated in blocks <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>, the system enables the potential data sharing event to proceed with the sharing of data in accordance with the applicable ring-fence and then causes a display of the shared data. Put differently, upon a determination to share data from a first entity to a second entity in association with a potential data sharing event, the system enables the second entity to access data (in accordance with the parameters of the applicable ring-fence) from the first entity and then proceeds with the potential data sharing event in view of this accessed data. For example, if the potential data sharing event includes a player (whom a first gaming establishment maintains a first player account for which includes data pertaining to: (i) scores obtained in different levels of a monetary wagering version of a game played at the first gaming establishment and (ii) scores obtained in different levels of a casual non-monetary wagering version of the game played in association with the first gaming establishment) accessing their player account at a second gaming establishment (which is part of a ring-fence with the first gaming establishment to share game persistent data of scores obtained in different levels of both monetary wagering and casual non-monetary wagering versions of the same game), the system enables the sharing of such game persistent data between the first gaming establishment and the second gaming establishment. In this example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, following such sharing of game persistent data in accordance with the applicable ring-fence, the system enables the player located at the second gaming establishment to access the game persistent data (i.e., the quantity of stars obtained in different levels of a monetary wagering version of a game played and the quantity of medals obtained in different levels of a casual non-monetary wagering version of the game). As illustrated in this example, the sharing of the game persistent data in accordance with the established ring-fence enables the player to access and build up a gaming experience from one gaming establishment to another gaming establishment despite such gaming establishments being disparate entities.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Following the conclusion of the potential data sharing event, upon the system determining that a shared data modification event occurred in association with the potential data sharing event, the system determines whether the applicable ring-fence permits the modification of the shared data as indicated in diamond <b>118</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In other words, if the potential data sharing event resulted in any modifications to the data which was shared from a different gaming entity, the system determines, based on the ring-fence in place, whether or not such modifications to the data overrides the existing data.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the system determines that no modification of the shared data is permitted in accordance with the applicable ring-fence, the system does not modify the shared data as indicated in block <b>120</b>. That is, if the sharing configurations for the shared data includes a shared configuration of such data, then despite such shared data being modified in association with one or more activities occurring following the sharing of such data, the modifications of such shared data are discarded and not retained by the system.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the other hand, if the system determines that modification of the shared data is permitted in accordance with the applicable ring-fence, the system modifies the shared data as indicated in block <b>122</b>. That is, if the sharing configurations for the shared data includes a communal configuration of such data, then the modification of the shared data in association with one or more activities occurring following the sharing of such data is retained by the system for future access.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, the system and method disclosed herein coordinates the access to persistent data amongst a plurality of disparate entities which otherwise have no player data sharing relationship with one another by forming one or more groups of such entities and enabling the access or modification of such tracked player activity data across such different entities. As such, the system disclosed herein binds or otherwise clusters one or more entities together with respect to the creation, handling and access to player activity data such that a player's progress through different stages or states of one or more games seamlessly persists from a first entity to a second, different entity which is grouped with or otherwise associated with the first entity. By clustering different entities and enabling such entities to share (or even modify) part or all of the data sets which each respective entity individually maintains in association with an individual player, the system enables processes to be applied to different player activity data sets across different types of gaming such that a player may view persistent data between different entities and/or utilize such persistent data between these different entities.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be appreciated that while certain games disclosed herein are described as being played at land-based gaming establishments, such games include games played upon the wagering of monetary credits and/or for monetary credit awards in association with an online gaming establishment or online casino that permits such monetary credit game play. It should further be appreciated that the system of the present disclosure includes different configurations of different components including, but not limited to: (i) one or more central servers, central controllers, or remote hosts; (i) one or more EGMs such as those located on a casino floor; and/or (ii) one or more personal gaming devices, such as desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers or computing devices, personal digital assistants, mobile phones, and other mobile computing devices. As such, the present disclosure provides a mixed channel environment wherein different players utilizing different gaming platforms powered via different gaming system components participate in one or more wagering games and/or social or casual games wherein different data is shared between the different channels.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, as indicated above, the system shares persistent data associated with different games played in different gaming environments in accordance with an applicable ring-fence. In one such embodiment, one of the games played includes a wagering game associated with monetary awards played at an EGM of a gaming establishment upon a placement of a monetary wager. In another such embodiment, one of the games played includes a wagering game associated with monetary awards played at an EGM of a gaming establishment upon a placement of a non-monetary wager. In another such embodiment, one of the games played includes a wagering game associated with non-monetary awards played at an EGM of a gaming establishment upon a placement of a non-monetary wager. In another such embodiment, one of the games played includes a bonus or secondary game associated with monetary awards played at an EGM of a gaming establishment upon a secondary game triggering event. In another such embodiment, one of the games played includes a bonus or secondary game associated with non-monetary awards played at an EGM of a gaming establishment upon a secondary game triggering event.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another such embodiment, one of the games played includes a social or casual game associated with non-monetary awards played at an EGM of a gaming establishment. In another such embodiment, one of the games played includes a social or casual game associated with non-monetary awards played remote from any EGM of any gaming establishment (e.g., a social or casual game played in association with a mobile device). In certain embodiments, the gaming system enables a player to play a casual or social game in conjunction with the play of a wagering game. In one such embodiment, the casual or social game is a secondary game which is launched or otherwise triggered from the play of a wagering game. In another embodiment, the gaming system enables a player to play a casual or social game independent of the play of a wagering game. In one such embodiment, the casual or social game is launched or otherwise triggered apart from the play of the wagering game. Such a configuration enables a player to participate in the play of the casual or social game remote from a wagering game EGM located at a gaming establishment, and thus enables the player to continue their gaming experience in a different gaming format.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be appreciated that persistent data associated any suitable game may be shared and implemented in accordance with the wagering game and/or the social or casual game disclosed herein.

Gaming systems in which the data network is a WAN are substantially identical to gaming systems in which the data network is a LAN, though the quantity of EGMs (or personal gaming devices) in such gaming systems may vary relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0070">In further embodiments in which the gaming system includes: (a) an EGM (or personal gaming device) configured to communicate with a central server, central controller, or remote host through a data network; and/or (b) a plurality of EGMs (or personal gaming devices) configured to communicate with one another through a data network, the data network is an internet (such as the Internet) or an intranet. In certain such embodiments, an Internet browser of the EGM (or personal gaming device) is usable to access an Internet game page from any location where an Internet connection is available. In one such embodiment, after the EGM (or personal gaming device) accesses the Internet game page, the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies a player before enabling that player to place any wagers on any plays of any wagering games. In one example, the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies the player by requiring a player account of the player to be logged into via an input of a unique username and password combination assigned to the player. The central server, central controller, or remote host may, however, identify the player in any other suitable manner, such as by validating a player tracking identification number associated with the player; by reading a player tracking card or other smart card inserted into a card reader (as described below); by validating a unique player identification number associated with the player by the central server, central controller, or remote host; or by identifying the EGM (or personal gaming device), such as by identifying the MAC address or the IP address of the Internet facilitator. In various embodiments, once the central server, central controller, or remote host identifies the player, the central server, central controller, or remote host enables placement of one or more wagers on one or more plays of one or more primary or base games and/or one or more secondary or bonus games, and displays those plays via the Internet browser of the EGM (or personal gaming device). Examples of implementations of Internet-based gaming are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,764,566, entitled &#x201c;Internet Remote Game Server,&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,147,334, entitled &#x201c;Universal Game Server&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0071">The central server, central controller, or remote host and the EGM (or personal gaming device) are configured to connect to the data network or remote communications link in any suitable manner. In various embodiments, such a connection is accomplished via: a conventional phone line or other data transmission line, a digital subscriber line (DSL), a T-1 line, a coaxial cable, a fiber optic cable, a wireless or wired routing device, a mobile communications network connection (such as a cellular network or mobile Internet network), or any other suitable medium. The expansion in the quantity of computing devices and the quantity and speed of Internet connections in recent years increases opportunities for players to use a variety of EGMs (or personal gaming devices) to play games from an ever-increasing quantity of remote sites. Additionally, the enhanced bandwidth of digital wireless communications may render such technology suitable for some or all communications, particularly if such communications are encrypted. Higher data transmission speeds may be useful for enhancing the sophistication and response of the display and interaction with players.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">EGM Components</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example EGM <b>1000</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> include two different example EGMs <b>2000</b><i>a </i>and <b>2000</b><i>b</i>.

The secondary game typically enables an award to be obtained addition to any award obtained through play of the primary game(s). The secondary game(s) typically produces a higher level of player excitement than the primary game(s) because the secondary game(s) provides a greater expectation of winning than the primary game(s) and is accompanied with more attractive or unusual features than the primary game(s). The secondary game(s) may be any type of suitable game, either similar to or completely different from the primary game.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0130">In various embodiments, the gaming system automatically provides or initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of a triggering event or the satisfaction of a qualifying condition. In other embodiments, the gaming system initiates the secondary game upon the occurrence of the triggering event or the satisfaction of the qualifying condition and upon receipt of an initiation input. In certain embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition is a selected outcome in the primary game(s) or a particular arrangement of one or more indicia on a display device for a play of the primary game(s), such as a &#x201c;BONUS&#x201d; symbol appearing on three adjacent reels along a payline following a spin of the reels for a play of the primary game. In other embodiments, the triggering event or qualifying condition occurs based on a certain amount of game play (such as number of games, number of credits, amount of time) being exceeded, or based on a specified number of points being earned during game play. Any suitable triggering event or qualifying condition or any suitable combination of a plurality of different triggering events or qualifying conditions may be employed.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0131">In other embodiments, at least one processor of the gaming system randomly determines when to provide one or more plays of one or more secondary games. In one such embodiment, no apparent reason is provided for providing the secondary game. In this embodiment, qualifying for a secondary game is not triggered by the occurrence of an event in any primary game or based specifically on any of the plays of any primary game. That is, qualification is provided without any explanation or, alternatively, with a simple explanation. In another such embodiment, the gaming system determines qualification for a secondary game at least partially based on a game triggered or symbol triggered event, such as at least partially based on play of a primary game.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0132">In various embodiments, after qualification for a secondary game has been determined, the secondary game participation may be enhanced through continued play on the primary game. Thus, in certain embodiments, for each secondary game qualifying event, such as a secondary game symbol, that is obtained, a given number of secondary game wagering points or credits is accumulated in a &#x201c;secondary game meter&#x201d; configured to accrue the secondary game wagering credits or entries toward eventual participation in the secondary game. In one such embodiment, the occurrence of multiple such secondary game qualifying events in the primary game results in an arithmetic or exponential increase in the number of secondary game wagering credits awarded. In another such embodiment, any extra secondary game wagering credits may be redeemed during the secondary game to extend play of the secondary game.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0133">In certain embodiments, no separate entry fee or buy-in for the secondary game is required. That is, entry into the secondary game cannot be purchased; rather, in these embodiments entry must be won or earned through play of the primary game, thereby encouraging play of the primary game. In other embodiments, qualification for the secondary game is accomplished through a simple &#x201c;buy-in.&#x201d; For example, qualification through other specified activities is unsuccessful, payment of a fee or placement of an additional wager &#x201c;buys-in&#x201d; to the secondary game. In certain embodiments, a separate side wager must be placed on the secondary game or a wager of a designated amount must be placed on the primary game to enable qualification for the secondary game.

In this embodiment, a player is issued a player identification card that has an encoded player identification number that uniquely identifies the player. When the player's playing tracking card is inserted into a card reader of the gaming system to begin a gaming session, the card reader reads the player identification number off the player tracking card to identify the player. The gaming system timely tracks any suitable information or data relating to the identified player's gaming session. The gaming system also timely tracks when the player tracking card is removed to conclude play for that gaming session. In another embodiment, rather than requiring insertion of a player tracking card into the card reader, the gaming system utilizes one or more portable devices, such as a mobile phone, a radio frequency identification tag, or any other suitable wireless device, to track when a gaming session begins and ends. In another embodiment, the gaming system utilizes any suitable biometric technology or ticket technology to track when a gaming session begins and ends.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0136">In such embodiments, during one or more gaming sessions, the gaming system tracks any suitable information or data, such as any amounts wagered, average wager amounts, and/or the time at which these wagers are placed. In different embodiments, for one or more players, the player tracking system includes the player's account number, the player's card number, the player's first name, the player's surname, the player's preferred name, the player's player tracking ranking, any promotion status associated with the player's player tracking card, the player's address, the player's birthday, the player's anniversary, the player's recent gaming sessions, or any other suitable data. In various embodiments, such tracked information and/or any suitable feature associated with the player tracking system is displayed on a player tracking display. In various embodiments, such tracked information and/or any suitable feature associated with the player tracking system is displayed via one or more service windows that are displayed on the central display device and/or the upper display device. Examples of player tracking systems are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,722,985, entitled &#x201c;Universal Player Tracking System&#x201d;; U.S. Pat.

In various embodiments, the player must first access a gaming website via an Internet browser of the personal gaming device or execute an application (commonly called an &#x201c;app&#x201d;) installed on the personal gaming device before the player can use the personal gaming device to participate in web-based game play. In certain embodiments, the one or more servers and the personal gaming device operate in a thin-client environment. In these embodiments, the personal gaming device receives inputs via one or more input devices (such as a touch screen and/or physical buttons), the personal gaming device sends the received inputs to the one or more servers, the one or more servers make various determinations based on the inputs and determine content to be displayed (such as a randomly determined game outcome and corresponding award), the one or more servers send the content to the personal gaming device, and the personal gaming device displays the content.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0138">In certain such embodiments, the one or more servers must identify the player before enabling game play on the personal gaming device (or, in some embodiments, before enabling monetary wager-based game play on the personal gaming device). In these embodiments, the player must identify herself to the one or more servers, such as by inputting the player's unique username and password combination, providing an input to a biometric sensor (e.g., a fingerprint sensor, a retinal sensor, a voice sensor, or a facial-recognition sensor), or providing any other suitable information.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0139">Once identified, the one or more servers enable the player to establish an account balance from which the player can draw credits usable to wager on plays of a game. In certain embodiments, the one or more servers enable the player to initiate an electronic funds transfer to transfer funds from a bank account to the player's account balance. In other embodiments, the one or more servers enable the player to make a payment using the player's credit card, debit card, or other suitable device to add money to the player's account balance. In other embodiments, the one or more servers enable the player to add money to the player's account balance via a peer-to-peer type application, such as PayPal or Venmo. The one or more servers also enable the player to cash out the player's account balance (or part of it) in any suitable manner, such as via an electronic funds transfer, by initiating creation of a paper check that is mailed to the player, or by initiating printing of a voucher at a kiosk in a gaming establishment.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0140">In certain embodiments, the one or more servers include a payment server that handles establishing and cashing out players' account balances and a separate game server configured to determine the outcome and any associated award for a play of a game. In these embodiments, the game server is configured to communicate with the personal gaming device and the payment device, and the personal gaming device and the payment device are not configured to directly communicate with one another. In these embodiments, when the game server receives data representing a request to start a play of a game at a desired wager, the game server sends data representing the desired wager to the payment server. The payment server determines whether the player's account balance can cover the desired wager (i.e., includes a monetary balance at least equal to the desired wager).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0141">If the payment server determines that the player's account balance cannot cover the desired wager, the payment server notifies the game server, which then instructs the personal gaming device to display a suitable notification to the player that the player's account balance is too low to place the desired wager. If the payment server determines that the player's account balance can cover the desired wager, the payment server deducts the desired wager from the account balance and notifies the game server. The game server then determines an outcome and any associated award for the play of the game. The game server notifies the payment server of any nonzero award, and the payment server increases the player's account balance by the nonzero award. The game server sends data representing the outcome and any award to the personal gaming device, which displays the outcome and any award.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0142">In certain embodiments, the one or more servers enable web-based game play using a personal gaming device only if the personal gaming device satisfies one or more jurisdictional requirements. In one embodiment, the one or more servers enable web-based game play using the personal gaming device only if the personal gaming device is located within a designated geographic area (such as within certain state or county lines or within the boundaries of a gaming establishment). In this embodiment, the geolocation module of the personal gaming device determines the location of the personal gaming device and sends the location to the one or more servers, which determine whether the personal gaming device is located within the designated geographic area. In various embodiments, the one or more servers enable non-monetary wager-based game play if the personal gaming device is located outside of the designated geographic area.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0143">In various embodiments, the gaming system includes an EGM configured to communicate with a personal gaming device&#x2014;such as a smartphone, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, or a laptop computer&#x2014;to enable tethered mobile game play using the personal gaming device. Generally, in these embodiments, the EGM establishes communication with the personal gaming device and enables the player to play games on the EGM remotely via the personal gaming device. In certain embodiments, the gaming system includes a geo-fence system that enables tethered game play within a particular geographic area but not outside of that geographic area. Examples of tethering an EGM to a personal gaming device and geo-fencing are described in U.S. Patent Appl. Pub. No. 2013/0267324, entitled &#x201c;Remote Gaming Method Allowing Temporary Inactivation Without Terminating Playing Session Due to Game Inactivity&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Social Network Integration</heading><p id="p-0134" num="0144">In certain embodiments, the gaming system is configured to communicate with a social network server that hosts or partially hosts a social networking website via a data network (such as the Internet) to integrate a player's gaming experience with the player's social networking account. This enables the gaming system to send certain information to the social network server that the social network server can use to create content (such as text, an image, and/or a video) and post it to the player's wall, newsfeed, or similar area of the social networking website accessible by the player's connections (and in certain cases the public) such that the player's connections can view that information. This also enables the gaming system to receive certain information from the social network server, such as the player's likes or dislikes or the player's list of connections. In certain embodiments, the gaming system enables the player to link the player's player account to the player's social networking account(s). This enables the gaming system to, once it identifies the player and initiates a gaming session (such as via the player logging in to a website (or an application) on the player's personal gaming device or via the player inserting the player's player tracking card into an EGM), link that gaming session to the player's social networking account(s). In other embodiments, the gaming system enables the player to link the player's social networking account(s) to individual gaming sessions when desired by providing the required login information.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0145">For instance, in one embodiment, if a player wins a particular award (e.g., a progressive award or a jackpot award) or an award that exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., an award exceeding $1,000), the gaming system sends information about the award to the social network server to enable the server to create associated content (such as a screenshot of the outcome and associated award) and to post that content to the player's wall (or other suitable area) of the social networking website for the player's connections to see (and to entice them to play). In another embodiment, if a player joins a multiplayer game and there is another seat available, the gaming system sends that information to the social network sever to enable the server to create associated content (such as text indicating a vacancy for that particular game) and to post that content to the player's wall (or other suitable area) of the social networking website for the player's connections to see (and to entice them to fill the vacancy). In another embodiment, if the player consents, the gaming system sends advertisement information or offer information to the social network server to enable the social network server to create associated content (such as text or an image reflecting an advertisement and/or an offer) and to post that content to the player's wall (or other suitable area) of the social networking website for the player's connections to see. In another embodiment, the gaming system enables the player to recommend a game to the player's connections by posting a recommendation to the player's wall (or other suitable area) of the social networking website.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Differentiating Certain Gaming Systems from General Purpose Computing Devices</heading><p id="p-0136" num="0146">Certain of the gaming systems described herein, such as EGMs located in a casino or another gaming establishment, include certain components and/or are configured to operate in certain manners that differentiate these systems from general purpose computing devices, i.e., certain personal gaming devices such as desktop computers and laptop computers.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0147">For instance, EGMs are highly regulated to ensure fairness and, in many cases, EGMs are configured to award monetary awards up to multiple millions of dollars. To satisfy security and regulatory requirements in a gaming environment, hardware and/or software architectures are implemented in EGMs that differ significantly from those of general purpose computing devices. For purposes of illustration, a description of EGMs relative to general purpose computing devices and some examples of these additional (or different) hardware and/or software architectures found in EGMs are described below.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0148">At first glance, one might think that adapting general purpose computing device technologies to the gaming industry and EGMs would be a simple proposition because both general purpose computing devices and EGMs employ processors that control a variety of devices. However, due to at least: (1) the regulatory requirements placed on EGMs, (2) the harsh environment in which EGMs operate, (3) security requirements, and (4) fault tolerance requirements, adapting general purpose computing device technologies to EGMs can be quite difficult. Further, techniques and methods for solving a problem in the general purpose computing device industry, such as device compatibility and connectivity issues, might not be adequate in the gaming industry. For instance, a fault or a weakness tolerated in a general purpose computing device, such as security holes in software or frequent crashes, is not tolerated in an EGM because in an EGM these faults can lead to a direct loss of funds from the EGM, such as stolen cash or loss of revenue when the EGM is not operating properly or when the random outcome determination is manipulated.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0149">Certain differences between general purpose computing devices and EGMs are described below. A first difference between EGMs and general purpose computing devices is that EGMs are state-based systems. A state-based system stores and maintains its current state in a non-volatile memory such that, in the event of a power failure or other malfunction, the state-based system can return to that state when the power is restored or the malfunction is remedied. For instance, for a state-based EGM, if the EGM displays an award for a game of chance but the power to the EGM fails before the EGM provides the award to the player, the EGM stores the pre-power failure state in a non-volatile memory, returns to that state upon restoration of power, and provides the award to the player. This requirement affects the software and hardware design on EGMs. General purpose computing devices are not state-based machines, and a majority of data is usually lost when a malfunction occurs on a general purpose computing device.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0150">A second difference between EGMs and general purpose computing devices is that, for regulatory purposes, the software on the EGM utilized to operate the EGM has been designed to be static and monolithic to prevent cheating by the operator of the EGM. For instance, one solution that has been employed in the gaming industry to prevent cheating and to satisfy regulatory requirements has been to manufacture an EGM that can use a proprietary processor running instructions to provide the game of chance from an EPROM or other form of non-volatile memory. The coding instructions on the EPROM are static (non-changeable) and must be approved by a gaming regulators in a particular jurisdiction and installed in the presence of a person representing the gaming jurisdiction. Any changes to any part of the software required to generate the game of chance, such as adding a new device driver used to operate a device during generation of the game of chance, can require burning a new EPROM approved by the gaming jurisdiction and reinstalling the new EPROM on the EGM in the presence of a gaming regulator. Regardless of whether the EPROM solution is used, to gain approval in most gaming jurisdictions, an EGM must demonstrate sufficient safeguards that prevent an operator or a player of an EGM from manipulating the EGM's hardware and software in a manner that gives him an unfair, and in some cases illegal, advantage.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0151">A third difference between EGMs and general purpose computing devices is authentication&#x2014;EGMs storing code are configured to authenticate the code to determine if the code is unaltered before executing the code. If the code has been altered, the EGM prevents the code from being executed. The code authentication requirements in the gaming industry affect both hardware and software designs on EGMs. Certain EGMs use hash functions to authenticate code. For instance, one EGM stores game program code, a hash function, and an authentication hash (which may be encrypted). Before executing the game program code, the EGM hashes the game program code using the hash function to obtain a result hash and compares the result hash to the authentication hash. If the result hash matches the authentication hash, the EGM determines that the game program code is valid and executes the game program code. If the result hash does not match the authentication hash, the EGM determines that the game program code has been altered (i.e., may have been tampered with) and prevents execution of the game program code. Examples of EGM code authentication are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,530, entitled &#x201c;Authentication in a Secure Computerized Gaming System&#x201d;; U.S. Pat. No. 7,043,641, entitled &#x201c;Encryption in a Secure Computerized Gaming System&#x201d;; U.S. Pat. No. 7,201,662, entitled &#x201c;Method and Apparatus for Software Authentication&#x201d;; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,627,097, entitled &#x201c;System and Method Enabling Parallel Processing of Hash Functions Using Authentication Checkpoint Hashes&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0152">A fourth difference between EGMs and general purpose computing devices is that EGMs have unique peripheral device requirements that differ from those of a general purpose computing device, such as peripheral device security requirements not usually addressed by general purpose computing devices. For instance, monetary devices, such as coin dispensers, bill validators, and ticket printers and computing devices that are used to govern the input and output of cash or other items having monetary value (such as tickets) to and from an EGM have security requirements that are not typically addressed in general purpose computing devices. Therefore, many general purpose computing device techniques and methods developed to facilitate device connectivity and device compatibility do not address the emphasis placed on security in the gaming industry.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0153">To address some of the issues described above, a number of hardware/software components and architectures are utilized in EGMs that are not typically found in general purpose computing devices. These hardware/software components and architectures, as described below in more detail, include but are not limited to watchdog timers, voltage monitoring systems, state-based software architecture and supporting hardware, specialized communication interfaces, security monitoring, and trusted memory.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0154">Certain EGMs use a watchdog timer to provide a software failure detection mechanism. In a normally-operating EGM, the operating software periodically accesses control registers in the watchdog timer subsystem to &#x201c;re-trigger&#x201d; the watchdog. Should the operating software fail to access the control registers within a preset timeframe, the watchdog timer will timeout and generate a system reset. Typical watchdog timer circuits include a loadable timeout counter register to enable the operating software to set the timeout interval within a certain range of time. A differentiating feature of some circuits is that the operating software cannot completely disable the function of the watchdog timer. In other words, the watchdog timer always functions from the time power is applied to the board.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0155">Certain EGMs use several power supply voltages to operate portions of the computer circuitry. These can be generated in a central power supply or locally on the computer board. If any of these voltages falls out of the tolerance limits of the circuitry they power, unpredictable operation of the EGM may result. Though most modern general purpose computing devices include voltage monitoring circuitry, these types of circuits only report voltage status to the operating software. Out of tolerance voltages can cause software malfunction, creating a potential uncontrolled condition in the general purpose computing device. Certain EGMs have power supplies with relatively tighter voltage margins than that required by the operating circuitry. In addition, the voltage monitoring circuitry implemented in certain EGMs typically has two thresholds of control. The first threshold generates a software event that can be detected by the operating software and an error condition then generated. This threshold is triggered when a power supply voltage falls out of the tolerance range of the power supply, but is still within the operating range of the circuitry. The second threshold is set when a power supply voltage falls out of the operating tolerance of the circuitry. In this case, the circuitry generates a reset, halting operation of the EGM.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0156">As described above, certain EGMs are state-based machines. Different functions of the game provided by the EGM (e.g., bet, play, result, points in the graphical presentation, etc.) may be defined as a state. When the EGM moves a game from one state to another, the EGM stores critical data regarding the game software in a custom non-volatile memory subsystem. This ensures that the player's wager and credits are preserved and to minimize potential disputes in the event of a malfunction on the EGM. In general, the EGM does not advance from a first state to a second state until critical information that enables the first state to be reconstructed has been stored. This feature enables the EGM to recover operation to the current state of play in the event of a malfunction, loss of power, etc. that occurred just before the malfunction. In at least one embodiment, the EGM is configured to store such critical information using atomic transactions.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0157">Generally, an atomic operation in computer science refers to a set of operations that can be combined so that they appear to the rest of the system to be a single operation with only two possible outcomes: success or failure. As related to data storage, an atomic transaction may be characterized as series of database operations which either all occur, or all do not occur. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring only partially, which can result in data corruption.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0158">To ensure the success of atomic transactions relating to critical information to be stored in the EGM memory before a failure event (e.g., malfunction, loss of power, etc.), memory that includes one or more of the following criteria be used: direct memory access capability; data read/write capability which meets or exceeds minimum read/write access characteristics (such as at least 5.08 Mbytes/sec (Read) and/or at least 38.0 Mbytes/sec (Write)). Memory devices that meet or exceed the above criteria may be referred to as &#x201c;fault-tolerant&#x201d; memory devices.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0159">Typically, battery-backed RAM devices may be configured to function as fault-tolerant devices according to the above criteria, whereas flash RAM and/or disk drive memory are typically not configurable to function as fault-tolerant devices according to the above criteria. Accordingly, battery-backed RAM devices are typically used to preserve EGM critical data, although other types of non-volatile memory devices may be employed. These memory devices are typically not used in typical general purpose computing devices.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0160">Thus, in at least one embodiment, the EGM is configured to store critical information in fault-tolerant memory (e.g., battery-backed RAM devices) using atomic transactions. Further, in at least one embodiment, the fault-tolerant memory is able to successfully complete all desired atomic transactions (e.g., relating to the storage of EGM critical information) within a time period of 200 milliseconds or less. In at least one embodiment, the time period of 200 milliseconds represents a maximum amount of time for which sufficient power may be available to the various EGM components after a power outage event has occurred at the EGM.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0161">As described previously, the EGM may not advance from a first state to a second state until critical information that enables the first state to be reconstructed has been atomically stored. After the state of the EGM is restored during the play of a game of chance, game play may resume and the game may be completed in a manner that is no different than if the malfunction had not occurred. Thus, for example, when a malfunction occurs during a game of chance, the EGM may be restored to a state in the game of chance just before when the malfunction occurred. The restored state may include metering information and graphical information that was displayed on the EGM in the state before the malfunction. For example, when the malfunction occurs during the play of a card game after the cards have been dealt, the EGM may be restored with the cards that were previously displayed as part of the card game. As another example, a bonus game may be triggered during the play of a game of chance in which a player is required to make a number of selections on a video display screen. When a malfunction has occurred after the player has made one or more selections, the EGM may be restored to a state that shows the graphical presentation just before the malfunction including an indication of selections that have already been made by the player. In general, the EGM may be restored to any state in a plurality of states that occur in the game of chance that occurs while the game of chance is played or to states that occur between the play of a game of chance.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0162">Game history information regarding previous games played such as an amount wagered, the outcome of the game, and the like may also be stored in a non-volatile memory device. The information stored in the non-volatile memory may be detailed enough to reconstruct a portion of the graphical presentation that was previously presented on the EGM and the state of the EGM (e.g., credits) at the time the game of chance was played. The game history information may be utilized in the event of a dispute. For example, a player may decide that in a previous game of chance that they did not receive credit for an award that they believed they won. The game history information may be used to reconstruct the state of the EGM before, during, and/or after the disputed game to demonstrate whether the player was correct or not in the player's assertion. Examples of a state-based EGM, recovery from malfunctions, and game history are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,804,763, entitled &#x201c;High Performance Battery Backed RAM Interface&#x201d;; U.S. Pat. No. 6,863,608, entitled &#x201c;Frame Capture of Actual Game Play&#x201d;; U.S. Pat. No. 7,111,141, entitled &#x201c;Dynamic NV-RAM&#x201d;; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,384,339, entitled, &#x201c;Frame Capture of Actual Game Play&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0163">Another feature of EGMs is that they often include unique interfaces, including serial interfaces, to connect to specific subsystems internal and external to the EGM. The serial devices may have electrical interface requirements that differ from the &#x201c;standard&#x201d; EIA serial interfaces provided by general purpose computing devices. These interfaces may include, for example, Fiber Optic Serial, optically coupled serial interfaces, current loop style serial interfaces, etc. In addition, to conserve serial interfaces internally in the EGM, serial devices may be connected in a shared, daisy-chain fashion in which multiple peripheral devices are connected to a single serial channel.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0164">The serial interfaces may be used to transmit information using communication protocols that are unique to the gaming industry. For example, IGT's Netplex is a proprietary communication protocol used for serial communication between EGMs. As another example, SAS is a communication protocol used to transmit information, such as metering information, from an EGM to a remote device. Often SAS is used in conjunction with a player tracking system.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0165">Certain EGMs may alternatively be treated as peripheral devices to a casino communication controller and connected in a shared daisy chain fashion to a single serial interface. In both cases, the peripheral devices are assigned device addresses. If so, the serial controller circuitry must implement a method to generate or detect unique device addresses. General purpose computing device serial ports are not able to do this.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0166">Security monitoring circuits detect intrusion into an EGM by monitoring security switches attached to access doors in the EGM cabinet. Access violations result in suspension of game play and can trigger additional security operations to preserve the current state of game play. These circuits also function when power is off by use of a battery backup. In power-off operation, these circuits continue to monitor the access doors of the EGM. When power is restored, the EGM can determine whether any security violations occurred while power was off, e.g., via software for reading status registers. This can trigger event log entries and further data authentication operations by the EGM software.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0167">Trusted memory devices and/or trusted memory sources are included in an EGM to ensure the authenticity of the software that may be stored on less secure memory subsystems, such as mass storage devices. Trusted memory devices and controlling circuitry are typically designed to not enable modification of the code and data stored in the memory device while the memory device is installed in the EGM. The code and data stored in these devices may include authentication algorithms, random number generators, authentication keys, operating system kernels, etc. The purpose of these trusted memory devices is to provide gaming regulatory authorities a root trusted authority within the computing environment of the EGM that can be tracked and verified as original. This may be accomplished via removal of the trusted memory device from the EGM computer and verification of the secure memory device contents is a separate third party verification device. Once the trusted memory device is verified as authentic, and based on the approval of the verification algorithms included in the trusted device, the EGM is enabled to verify the authenticity of additional code and data that may be located in the gaming computer assembly, such as code and data stored on hard disk drives. Examples of trusted memory devices are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,567, entitled &#x201c;Process Verification&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0168">In at least one embodiment, at least a portion of the trusted memory devices/sources may correspond to memory that cannot easily be altered (e.g., &#x201c;unalterable memory&#x201d;) such as EPROMS, PROMS, Bios, Extended Bios, and/or other memory sources that are able to be configured, verified, and/or authenticated (e.g., for authenticity) in a secure and controlled manner.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0169">According to one embodiment, when a trusted information source is in communication with a remote device via a network, the remote device may employ a verification scheme to verify the identity of the trusted information source. For example, the trusted information source and the remote device may exchange information using public and private encryption keys to verify each other's identities. In another embodiment, the remote device and the trusted information source may engage in methods using zero knowledge proofs to authenticate each of their respective identities.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0170">EGMs storing trusted information may utilize apparatuses or methods to detect and prevent tampering. For instance, trusted information stored in a trusted memory device may be encrypted to prevent its misuse. In addition, the trusted memory device may be secured behind a locked door. Further, one or more sensors may be coupled to the memory device to detect tampering with the memory device and provide some record of the tampering. In yet another example, the memory device storing trusted information might be designed to detect tampering attempts and clear or erase itself when an attempt at tampering has been detected. Examples of trusted memory devices/sources are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,515,718, entitled &#x201c;Secured Virtual Network in a Gaming Environment&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0171">Mass storage devices used in a general purpose computing devices typically enable code and data to be read from and written to the mass storage device. In a gaming environment, modification of the gaming code stored on a mass storage device is strictly controlled and would only be enabled under specific maintenance type events with electronic and physical enablers required. Though this level of security could be provided by software, EGMs that include mass storage devices include hardware level mass storage data protection circuitry that operates at the circuit level to monitor attempts to modify data on the mass storage device and will generate both software and hardware error triggers should a data modification be attempted without the proper electronic and physical enablers being present. Examples of using a mass storage device are described in U.S. Pat.
