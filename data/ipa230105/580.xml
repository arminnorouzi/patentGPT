The disclosures of the above-mentioned applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to medical devices. More particularly, the disclosure exemplifies a sterile bag preloaded onto a sterile medical device and methods of deploying and using the same during interaction of sterile and unsterile medical devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sterilization refers to any process that effectively renders any surface, equipment or article free from viable microorganisms. Sterility and its maintenance, together with the prevention of cross-infection, are at the top of any list of critical factors in patient care. In practice, however, it is impossible to prove that all organisms have been destroyed. Therefore Sterility Assurance levels (SAL) are used as a measure of the survival level of microorganisms after terminal sterilization. In Europe, for example, items such as medical devices can only be labelled &#x201c;sterile&#x201d; if the chance of an item remaining contaminated after sterilization is less than or equal to one chance in a million. Therefore, the packaging around medical devices is carefully designed so that it allows those devices to be sterilized, provides a microbial barrier and maintains sterility effectively up to the point of use. This type of packaging is known as a sterile barrier system. A sterile barrier system is an essential part of a sterile medical device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the medical field, for devices requiring an unsterile and sterile component to interface with each other and pass together into a sterile field, the prior state of the art has primarily relied on a removable sterile cover (e.g., a drape or a bag) that acts as a barrier when deployed over the unsterile component(s). This type of removable cover, in the form of a sterile drape, blanket, or bag, is often rolled or pleated prior to being deployed over the unsterile components to minimize the chance of loss of sterility. To facilitate deployment, tabs are included on the deployment end of the barrier for the user to grip while deploying the barrier. To facilitate attachment, an attached component with a good degree of rigidity or another attachment mechanism may anchor the barrier to the component(s) which the barrier covers. Examples of patent publications related to this type of removable sterile barrier deployable over unsterile components include U.S. Pat. No. 8,459,266 B2 entitled &#x201c;Pleated bag for interventional pullback systems&#x201d; and pre-grant patent application publication US 20140338676 A1 entitled &#x201c;Medical drape and methods of covering equipment with medical drapes&#x201d;. Additional examples of sterile covers are disclosed in pre-grant patent application publications US 20170333147 A1, US 20160361129 A1, and US 20170258544 A1.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For medical systems with the need to cover unsterile components with a sterile bag or drape that interface with sterile components and pass into a sterile field, the bag or drape does not come preloaded to the sterile component. Hence, the use o such barrier requires the user to load a sterile barrier to the sterile/unsterile interface, deploy the bag or drape over the unsterile components, and then load or connect the sterile disposable components to the already covered non-sterile components. This process is time consuming and is prone to accidental loss of sterility when a sterile component comes into contact with an unsterile user or component.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, in the event that the sterile barrier comes into contact unsterile components, current state of the art lacks the ability to replace a sterile barrier without removing the single-use, sterile, disposable components from the interface. If a mechanism exists to prevent the reuse/reattachment of the sterile components after removal and replacement of the barrier despite the maintenance of sterility of the disposable components, then removal and replacement of the barrier also requires removal and replacement of the disposable sterile component.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, current state of the art requires removal of a sterile barrier should the disposable, sterile components need to be removed and/or replaced after barrier deployment, further adding cost and user burden. Moreover, current sterile barrier/drapes lack a method for securing the barrier orifice on the unsterile end so as to prevent the sterile exterior surface of the barrier from coming into contact with unsterile surfaces before passing into the sterile field, hence increasing the likelihood of compromising the sterility of the sterile barrier.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is evident, therefore, that there is a need for improved sterile barrier/drapes that can provide quick deployment and improved sterility.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to at least one embodiment of the disclosure, there is provided an apparatus comprising a sterile bag preloaded to a disposable sterile component (e.g., catheter handle) in a rolled or folded state; the preloaded sterile bag is configured to be deployed over an unsterile component, where the deployment process takes place in parallel with the engagement of the sterile and unsterile components (e.g., sterile bag deployment occurs in parallel with catheter motor engagement). Upon deployment, a distal end of the sterile bag can be affixed with an attachment to the modality's cart to minimize the possibility of contact with unsterile surfaces or components. The sterile bag can be removable from catheter handle to allow for replacement if the unsterile surface of the bag is contacted by non-sterile components.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In its simplest form, the present disclosure provides a sterile cover for covering medical equipment, comprising: a barrier component configured to be coupled to a sterile component of the medical equipment; and a flexible body coupled to the barrier component, the flexible body having a tubular shape extending from a proximal end to a distal end thereof, and having an outer surface, an inner surface and an open end, wherein the flexible body is configured to enclose within the inner surface a non-sterile component connectable to the sterile component.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, when taken in conjunction with the appended drawings, and provided claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures showing illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary medical imaging system where a sterile cover or bag may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of a sterile cover deployed over non-sterile components of the imaging system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref> show various views of an exemplary sterile cover or bag <b>1200</b>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a plane view of a barrier section <b>1210</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows a plane view of an attaching section <b>1220</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> shows a three-dimensional view of a flexible body section <b>1202</b> coupled to the barrier section <b>1210</b> and to the attaching section <b>1220</b> of the exemplary sterile cover or bag <b>1200</b> preloaded onto a sterile component.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows an exemplary sterile cover or bag <b>1200</b> preloaded onto a sterile component, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows an exemplary process of deploying the preloaded sterile cover <b>1200</b> over a non-sterile component in parallel with the engagement of the sterile component to non-sterile component.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>5</b>C, <b>5</b>D, <b>5</b>E, and <b>5</b>F</figref> each shows a different design of the barrier section <b>1210</b> of the sterile cover or bag <b>1200</b>, where the barrier section has an opening configured to engage with a connecting portion <b>1152</b> of a sterile component.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a plane view of an exemplary connecting portion <b>1152</b> configured to engage with the barrier section <b>1210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates a plane view of an exemplary connecting portion <b>1152</b> configured to engage with the barrier section <b>1210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> show details of an exemplary sterile cover, drape, or bag <b>1200</b> configured to be preloaded to a sterile component or to be attached to an unsterile component of medical equipment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Throughout the figures, the same reference numerals and characters, unless otherwise stated, are used to denote like features, elements, components or portions of the illustrated embodiments.

The sterile cover includes a barrier component configured to be coupled to a sterile component of the medical equipment; and a flexible body coupled to the barrier component, the flexible body having a tubular shape extending from a proximal end to a distal end thereof, and having an outer surface, an inner surface, and an open end. The flexible body is configured to enclose within the inner surface thereof a non-sterile component connectable to the sterile component.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Many medical devices require a sterilized component capable of extending into a sterile field, without risk of contaminating that field, where that sterile component interfaces with an unsterile component needed to operate the device. In this situation, the unsterile component can potentially enter the sterile field and negate the sterility of that filed. A solution to prevent loss of sterility has been to deploy a sterile barrier over any unsterile component entering the sterile field. This especially applies to medical devices used in in-vivo environments, where sterile components such as interventional deployment system catheters must interface with an electronic controller which cannot be sterilized.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Examples of such in-vivo deployable systems include an optical coherence tomography (OCT) catheter system which includes a catheter containing an imaging optical component that interfaces with a pullback system enabling catheter deployment and imaging functionality. The pullback system in turn interfaces with a computer system responsible for the digital operations of the system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary medical imaging system <b>1100</b>. The medical imaging system <b>1100</b> includes an imaging console <b>1110</b> and a mechanically rotated optical probe <b>1120</b> (e.g., an endoscope or catheter). A patient interface unit (PIU) <b>1130</b> connects the optical probe <b>1120</b> to the imaging console <b>1110</b> using a cable bundle <b>1106</b>. The imaging console <b>1110</b> includes, among other things, a computer cart <b>1102</b> and one or more displays <b>1104</b>. The optical probe <b>1120</b> may include, for example, a fiber-optic based catheter <b>1124</b> and a catheter handle <b>1122</b>. The handle <b>1122</b> has a proximal end and a distal end extending along a z-axis direction. In an exemplary imaging procedure, the imaging system console <b>1100</b> controls the catheter <b>1124</b> via the PIU <b>1130</b> to obtain images of a target sample (not shown), such as a cardiovascular bodily lumen of a patient.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The PIU <b>1130</b> is the main interface between the probe <b>1120</b> and the system console <b>1110</b>. The PIU <b>1130</b> provides the means to spin and linearly translate the catheter's imaging core within the catheter's stationary outer sheath (not labeled). The system console <b>1110</b> and PIU <b>1130</b> are connected to each other by the cable bundle <b>1106</b>. The cable bundle <b>1106</b> houses therein cables for transmitting electrical power and for communication signaling, as well as optical fibers for illumination a collection of light. During use of the imaging system console <b>1100</b>, the entire PIU <b>1130</b> is preferably covered with a sterile drape/bag <b>1200</b> and placed on the patient's bed or operating table. The PIU <b>1130</b> may provide a user interface for operating the imaging functions of the probe from an sterile field by the use of actionable buttons <b>1131</b>; these buttons <b>1131</b> may mirror other controls provided on a graphical user interface (GUI) at the imaging console <b>1110</b>. The state of each button <b>1131</b> (e.g., active, inactive, warning, etc.) is communicated by indicator LEDs provided on the housing of the PIU; and these indicators too are mirrored on the GUI of display <b>1104</b>. Therefore, users of the medical imaging system <b>1100</b> may perform the same operations from either a non-sterile field using the GUI in display <b>1104</b> or from the sterile field using the buttons <b>1131</b> on the PIU <b>1130</b>. The PIU <b>1130</b> is composed of a beam combiner (not shown), a fiber optic rotary joint (FORJ), a motion mechanism including a rotational motor and a linear stage, electronic control boards, control buttons and/or an LED panel <b>1131</b>, and a catheter receptacle <b>1150</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The catheter <b>1124</b> and the handle <b>1122</b> that the catheter attaches to are intended to be single-use, sterile components. However the PIU <b>1130</b> and a pullback unit (included in the PIU, but not shown) that the catheter interfaces with must be multi-use and unsterile due to costs associated with maintaining or rendering its sterility before use or implementing it as single-use component. The PIU <b>1130</b> and pullback unit, when attached to the catheter, must pass into the sterile field in order to facilitate proper catheter deployment control and repositioning. Therefore, a sterile barrier must be introduced between the PIU <b>1130</b> with its cable bundle <b>1106</b> and the sterile surfaces (e.g., operating table) and catheter handle that it touched in order to avoid contamination of these sterile surfaces.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To that end, the present disclosure provides a novel sterile barrier (a sterile bag or sterile cover) <b>1200</b> which extends over the unsterile component(s) of a device requiring passage of said unsterile components into a sterile field.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a sterile bag <b>1200</b> includes a flexible body section <b>1202</b>, a barrier section <b>1210</b>, and an attaching section <b>1220</b>. The flexible body section <b>1202</b> has a tubular shape extending from a proximal end to a distal end thereof, and having an outer surface, an inner surface, and an open end. As used herein, the term &#x201c;tubular shape&#x201d; refers to the flexible body section <b>1202</b> being any sterile draping structure having a hollow opening through the center, forming a tube, which can have many different sizes and shapes. For example, the flexible body section <b>1202</b> can have a tubular shape long and narrow in some embodiments, while in other embodiments the flexible body section <b>1202</b> can have a tubular shape short and wide. Moreover, the term tubular shape does not necessarily limit the flexible body section <b>1202</b> to a tubular shape having circular cross-section. In the present disclosure, the flexible body section <b>1202</b> can have a tubular shape which is substantially cylindrical, as in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In other embodiments, the tubular shape of the flexible body section <b>1202</b> can have a rectangular cross-section, so as to have a rectangular tubular shape. In further embodiments, the flexible body section <b>1202</b> can have an irregular tubular shape, or the flexible body section <b>1202</b> can be open as a flat sheet rolled on one end to form the outer edge of the barrier section <b>1210</b>, and the other end (attaching section <b>1220</b>) taped onto the surface of computer cart <b>1102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the flexible body section <b>1202</b> is shown as a tube for ease of illustration, but it is not limited to just tubular shapes. Indeed, to facilitate manipulating and engagement/disengagement of sterile components to unsterile components, the flexible body section <b>1202</b> may take any shape to even conform to the shape of the medical equipment being covered. In terms of material, the flexible body section <b>1202</b> may be made of any suitable, flexible material including textile and/or plastic materials typically used for conventional medical drapes.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The barrier section <b>1210</b> includes an outer edge <b>1212</b> and a passage <b>1211</b> (central opening or through hole).

Additionally, a small hook <b>1223</b> for each tab <b>1221</b> can be installed around the interface between the unsterile cable bundle <b>1106</b> and the main body of the computer cart <b>1102</b>. The sterile bag <b>1200</b>, when deployed by an unsterile user, can be held with the hooks <b>1223</b> so as to avoid contact between the sterile surface of the bag and the user. When fully deployed, the tabs <b>1221</b> can be affixed to the hooks <b>1223</b> on the main body of computer cart <b>1102</b>, thereby temporarily holding the barrier in place while the unsterile component (e.g., PIU <b>1130</b>) is repositioned. Thus, reducing the possibility of the exterior surface of the sterile bag coming into contact with an unsterile surface outside of the sterile field. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the full device with the sterile bag <b>1200</b> deployed and affixed to the hook <b>1223</b>, reducing the possibility of contact between barrier section <b>1210</b> and unsterile components (PIU <b>1130</b>, cable bundle <b>1106</b>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Conventionally, the process for sterile bag deployment over the non-sterile components (e.g., PIU <b>1130</b>, cabling, etc.) is slow because the sterile bag is provided as a separate package and it must be deployed over the PIU before the catheter <b>1124</b> is engaged to the PIU.

According to the present disclosure, preloading the sterile bag <b>1200</b> onto the sterile components of the system offers a significant advantage in usability such that when the mating process between the sterile and unsterile components occurs, any necessary engagement procedure between the two components manifesting as an electrical, mechanical, optical process, etc. can occur in parallel with the deployment of the sterile bag <b>1200</b> over the unsterile components (e.g., PIU <b>1130</b> and cable bundle <b>1106</b>). With the expectation that the engagement procedure may take several seconds, preloading the sterile bag on the sterile component eliminates any additional time that would be needed to deploy a non-preloaded bag over the unsterile components followed by the time needed for mating and engagement of the sterile and unsterile components.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows a pre-deployment state where the sterile bag <b>1200</b> is preloaded at the proximal end of the catheter handle <b>1122</b>. The general pre-deployment configuration, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, is characterized by the sterile bag <b>1200</b> consisting of a rigid or semi-rigid component (barrier section <b>1210</b>) having a circular surface containing a through-hole <b>1211</b> allowing for the junction element (connecting portion <b>1152</b>) of the sterile component (catheter handle <b>1122</b>) responsible for mating with the unsterile component (PIU <b>1130</b>) to pass through. The rigid or semirigid component (barrier section <b>1210</b>) is connected to the flexible body section <b>1202</b> composing the majority of the surface area of the sterile bag <b>1200</b> that is pleated or folded in such a way that, the flexible body's surface <b>1202</b><i>a </i>that will contact the unsterile component's surface when deployed, is facing outward when pre-deployed, while the outward sterile surface <b>1202</b><i>b </i>faces inward, maintaining its sterility during predeployment. The semirigidity of the barrier section <b>1210</b> interfacing with the sterile component's junction element (connecting portion <b>1152</b>) allows for compression of the barrier section <b>1210</b> prior to removing the sterile component and preloaded bag from its packaging while still maintaining the integrity of the sterile bag-junction element connection during predeployment and deployment. The flexible body section <b>1202</b> of the sterile bag <b>1200</b> can be rolled or pleated or creased or folded with the interior surface <b>1202</b><i>a </i>facing outward prior to deployment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) in order to minimize the probability of contact between the exterior surface <b>1202</b><i>b</i>, which requires maintenance of sterility, and other unsterile surfaces.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows a deployed state of the sterile bag <b>1200</b>. The preloaded and predeployed sterile bag <b>1200</b> can be situated on the junction element (<b>1152</b>) of the sterile component (<b>1122</b>). This is recommended in order to facilitate minimum interference with the sterile component's operation following deployment of the sterile bag <b>1200</b> over the unsterile component <b>1130</b>. Specifically, to ease deployment over the unsterile component, and to secure the sterile barrier's semirigid component between the unsterile and sterile components following mating and engagement, it is advantageous to have the sterile bag <b>1200</b> preloaded on the junction element (<b>1152</b>) of the sterile component (<b>1122</b>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the event that the sterility of the sterile bag <b>1200</b> becomes compromised, e.g., where the bag <b>1200</b> may lose its sterility via contact with an unsterile surface following deployment, or the flexible body section <b>1202</b> may be punctured, cut, etc., it is proposed that the sterile bag <b>1200</b> disclosed herein can be easily removed and replaced, or only replaced. This process can occur before or after the sterile and unsterile components are mated. In the case of removing and replacing the sterile bag prior to components mating and bag deployment, removing the folded/pleated sterile barrier from the junction element (<b>1152</b>) simply involves disengaging the mechanism temporarily attaching it to the element, such as one of those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, and attaching a new folded/pleated sterile barrier using the same mechanism. In the case of replacing the sterile barrier after mating and engagement have taken place, the barrier may be removed via one of the previously mentioned junction element mechanisms before or after deployment without needing to remove the sterile component, and a new folded/pleated sterile barrier may be brought over the sterile component and attached via the same mechanism. Additionally, if the integrity of the barrier to be replaced permits, a new barrier or sterile bag <b>1200</b> can simply be affixed and deployed over the previous one without removing the other barrier. This mechanism allows for replacement of the barrier or bag <b>1200</b> without removing or replacing the sterile component, thus offering a significant time and cost advantage over having the barrier permanently affixed.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the case of a compromised sterile component, where the engagement mechanism may fail, or the sterility of the sterile component is compromised, etc., if the sterile barrier or bag <b>1200</b> has already been deployed over the unsterile component, the bag or barrier may be left deployed, removed from the sterile component, and affixed to a new sterile component followed by the new sterile component's mating and engagement with the unsterile component. This mechanism allows for replacement of the sterile component without replacing the sterile barrier or bag <b>1200</b> already deployed over unsterile components, offering a significant time advantage over having the barrier permanently affixed and needing to redeploy the barrier should the sterile component need to be replaced.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The manner in which the sterile bag <b>1200</b> is preloaded onto the catheter handle <b>1122</b> is not limited to the usage of a rigid or semirigid barrier section <b>1210</b>, as described above. The present disclosure also makes use of several other configurations for affixing the rigid or semirigid barrier section <b>1210</b> to the junction element (<b>1152</b>) of the catheter handle. The primary configuration can be characterized by the semi-rigid barrier component (barrier section <b>1210</b>) previously described above with a through-hole <b>1211</b> with a diameter D<b>1</b> slightly smaller than that of the junction element (<b>1152</b>). This allows for holding the barrier section <b>1210</b> in place with the elastic force of the barrier component and friction.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D</figref>, the barrier section <b>1210</b> has a through-hole with diameter smaller than the junction element (<b>1152</b>), but the material has higher rigidity. In this case, the plurality of branches of the flower ring are flexible, allowing for easier translation in the direction of preloading the bag (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) and more difficult translation in the direction of bag deployment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) over the unsterilized component.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>E and <b>5</b>F</figref> illustrate a further embodiment of a barrier section <b>1210</b>, shown as a rigid barrier component with trough hole or central opening <b>1211</b> having circular cutouts (cut sectors) which are configured to engage with sector protrusions or keys <b>1153</b> of the junction element (connecting portion <b>1152</b>) of the sterile component.

In the latter case, the flange could be removed with the handle, but the tubular body may stay over the PIU if needed. For example, in one embodiment, the simplest implementation of the sterile bag or cover may be just a long plastic bag with a hole punched in the bottom of the bag through which a connection between PIU and the catheter handle is made. The hole punched in the bag may be reinforced with a piece or rigid or semirigid material to form the barrier component, as described above, and this bag may be attached to the catheter handle flange with a temporary glue and removed if needed. In other embodiment, the plastic bag having the hole punched in the bottom thereof can be attached directly to the flange <b>1122</b><i>a </i>of the catheter handle <b>1122</b>. In this case the barrier component <b>1210</b> has no physical outer edge as it is just the bottom portion of the tubular bag glued to the flange <b>1122</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the present disclosure, with the sterile bag <b>1200</b> being preloaded to the catheter handle <b>1122</b> (sterile component), where the unsterile surface of the flexible body of the bag facing outward prior to deployment and allowing for drape deployment to occur simultaneously with mating of the unsterile and sterile components of the device, reducing time need to fully ready the device for use is achieved. Furthermore, in the event that the sterility of the exterior surface of the sterile bag becomes compromised, the method for affixing the barrier component to the sterile component allows for quick removal and replacement of the sterile bag or deployment of another sterile bag over the already deployed sterile bag without requiring removal of the sterile component already connected to the non-sterile component(s). This advantageously reduces the time and cost associated with replacing a damage sterile bag or requiring replacement of the sterile components. Additionally, the sterile component of the device may be replaced without requiring replacement of the sterile barrier and the barrier, if already deployed over the unsterile components of the device, may remain deployed while the sterile component is replaced, again reducing the time and burden that would be required to remove and redeploy a sterile bag if it were permanently affixed to the sterile component.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Another advantage is the provision of attaching tabs at the distal end of the sterile bag allowing for ease of deployment by an unsterile user without compromising the sterility of the sterile bag but also providing for a method of affixing the sterile barrier to a surface so as to avoid contact between the exterior sterile surface and an unsterile surface prior to bringing the barrier into the sterile field. In this regard, although a description has been made of an attaching component being attachable tabs having a thru-hole to engage with hooks, the attachment component is not limited to tabs and corresponding hooks. Any other attachment structure (e.g., adhesives such as Velcro&#xae;) can be used to attach the distal end of the sterile bag <b>1200</b> to an unsterile surface (e.g., the surface of the computer cart <b>1102</b>). The attaching component may include other attaching structures, e.g., fasteners, a clasp, buttons, a zipper or any other suitable mechanism, which can be attached and removed in any suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The materials for the sterile cover would be selected to provide adequate barrier to prevent through contamination. As such, thin films of non-woven polymers (e.g. polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, polyurethane, polystyrene, polycarbonate, acrylics, silicone rubber, polypropylene, synthetic rubbers, etc.), preferably transparent for ease of use, are commonly employed. In addition, the materials selected should withstand sterilization method(s) selected to be used for the sterile component. For example, for a sterile component containing plastic and requiring Ethylene Oxide (EtO) sterilization method, a 2 mils thick polyethylene film with 10 mils thick Mylar semi-rigid barrier component can be used.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Embodiment(s) of the present disclosure can be modified and/or combined with each other. Moreover, it is understood that numerous modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In in the present disclosure, preloading the sterile barrier to the sterile component of a medical equipment system offers a significant advantage in usability such that when the mating process between the sterile and unsterile components occurs, any necessary engagement procedure between the two components manifesting as an electrical, mechanical, or optical process, etc., can occur in parallel with the deployment of the sterile barrier over the unsterile component. With the projection that the engagement procedure may take several seconds, preloading the barrier onto the sterile component eliminates any additional time that would be needed to deploy a non-preloaded barrier over the unsterile component followed by the time needed for mating and engagement of the sterile and unsterile components. The general pre-deployment configuration, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, is characterized by the sterile barrier comprising of a barrier component in the shape of semirigid circular surface containing a through-hole (central opening) allowing for the junction element (connection portion <b>1152</b>) of the sterile component (catheter handle <b>1122</b>) responsible for mating with the unsterile component to pass through. The said semirigid barrier component section <b>1210</b> connected to the flexible body section <b>1202</b> composing the majority of the surface area of the sterile barrier or bag <b>1200</b> that is pleated or folded in such a way that, the flexible body's surface <b>1202</b><i>a </i>that will contact the unsterile component's surface when deployed, is facing outward when predeployed, while the outward sterile surface <b>1202</b><i>b </i>of the flexible body faces inward, thereby maintaining its sterility during predeployment. The semirigidity of the barrier component interfaces with the sterile component's junction element (<b>1152</b>), and allows for compression of the flexible body against the barrier component prior to removing the sterile component and preloaded barrier from its packaging while still maintaining the integrity of the sterile barrier-junction element connection during predeployment and deployment. The barrier can be rolled/pleated with the interior surface facing outward prior to deployment in order to minimize the probability of contact between the exterior surface, which requires maintenance of sterility, and other unsterile surfaces. The predeployed barrier can be situated on the junction element of the sterile component in order to facilitate minimum interference with the sterile component's operation following deployment, ease of deployment over the unsterile component, and to secure the sterile barrier's semirigid component between the unsterile and sterile components following mating and engagement.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to another embodiment, the sterile bag <b>1200</b> is not preloaded onto the sterile component, but it can be deployed directly onto a non-sterile component in parallel with (or immediately before) the engagement of a sterile component to an unsterile component already covered by the sterile barrier, drape or bag <b>1200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> show details of an exemplary sterile cover, drape, or bag <b>1200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows a perspective view of the sterile cover, drape, or bag <b>1200</b> in a preloaded and pre-deployment state. The sterile bag <b>1200</b> has a tubular flexible body section <b>1202</b>, a barrier section <b>1210</b>, and an attaching section <b>1220</b>. In its preloaded state, at least part of the non-sterile inner surface <b>1202</b><i>a </i>of bag <b>1200</b> is exposed outwards. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>, in the preloaded state, the flexible body section <b>1202</b> is rolled or creased or folded or pleated (see detail A) to remain compact prior to deployment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows detail A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> as one example of the manner in which the bag <b>1200</b> is folded prior to loading and deployment of the bag. Specifically, prior to deployment, the sealed end (barrier section side) and the open end (attaching section side) are at substantially at the same plane, and the body section <b>1202</b> is folded with a plurality of z-folds to form a compact package. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> shows the deployed state of the sterile bag <b>1200</b>. To facilitate ease of deployment by a non-sterile user, one or more tabs <b>1221</b> are provided around the open end of the body section <b>1202</b>. The tabs <b>1221</b> are attached to the un-sterile inner surface <b>1202</b><i>a </i>with an adhesive <b>1227</b> (e.g., medical device adhesive or curable material).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>, the barrier section <b>1210</b> has an opening <b>1211</b> and an adhesive-backed, semi-rigid ring (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) meant to provide a means to temporarily affix the bag <b>1200</b> to the edge or distal end of the PIU <b>1130</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>) prior to deployment. Naturally, the adhesive-backed, semi-rigid ring of barrier section <b>1210</b> can also provide a means to preload and temporarily affix the bag <b>1200</b> to the proximal end of the catheter handle <b>1122</b> prior to deployment, as described in the previous embodiments. The drape or bag <b>1200</b> is pleated in a z-fold manner prior to deployment, with the interior surface <b>1202</b><i>a </i>of the drape facing outwards pre-deployment. Pull tabs <b>1221</b> with optional holes <b>1222</b> are affixed to the pleated interior surface <b>1202</b><i>a </i>of the drape proximal to the semi-rigid ring prior to drape deployment. The tabs <b>1221</b> are used for pulling and deploying the bag by placing the bag over the most distal unsterile component, principally the PIU <b>1130</b>, adhering the interior of the ring to the catheter handle or the edge of the PIU and aligning the opening <b>1211</b> around the catheter insertion point, and then unfolding the drape toward the proximal end of the PIU by pulling the pull tabs <b>1221</b> in the direction of deployment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>). Similar to previous embodiments, the diameter D<b>1</b> of opening <b>1211</b> is approximately equal to the diameter &#x201c;d&#x201d; of the connection potion <b>1152</b> or the sterile component (catheter handle <b>1122</b>). When fully deployed, the drape or bag <b>1200</b> will completely contain the unsterile components of the PIU that pass into the unsterile field and its position will be maintained and not obscure the catheter insertion point on the catheter handle or PIU via the adhesion offered by the semi-rigid ring adhesive or the lock provided by the PIU/catheter handle junction. In addition, to secure the attachment of the deployed sterile barrier or bag <b>1200</b> over the unsterile components, the tabs <b>1221</b> can be tied, affixed, attached, or otherwise secured to the proximal end of the PIU or to some structure of the console <b>1110</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>, similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, in the event that the sterility of the sterile bag <b>1200</b> becomes compromised, e.g., where the bag <b>1200</b> may lose its sterility via contact with an unsterile surface following deployment, or the flexible body section <b>1202</b> may be punctured, cut, etc., the sterile bag <b>1200</b> can be easily removed and replaced, or only replaced, before or after the sterile and unsterile components are mated. In the case of removing and replacing the sterile bag <b>1200</b> prior to components mating, removing the folded/pleated sterile bag <b>1200</b> from the distal end of the PIU involves detaching the adhesive backed semi-rigid ring <b>1210</b> from the catheter handle or the PIU, and attaching a new folded/pleated sterile bag <b>1200</b> using the same mechanism. In the case of replacing the compromised sterile barrier after mating and engagement of sterile and unsterile components have taken place, the compromised sterile bag <b>1200</b> may be left in place, and a new folded/pleated sterile barrier may be brought over and attached via the same procedure. That is, if the integrity of the new sterile barrier or bag <b>1200</b> can be maintained, such new barrier or sterile bag <b>1200</b> can simply be affixed and deployed over the previous one without removing the other compromised barrier. This mechanism allows for replacement of the barrier or bag <b>1200</b> without removing or replacing the sterile component, thus offering a significant time saving advantage over having the barrier permanently affixed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">An advantage of the sterile barrier disclosed herein is that it provides with the sterile barrier being preloaded to a sterile component by using the rigid or semirigid barrier component. In this manner, the unsterile surface of the barrier can be preloaded facing outward prior to barrier deployment, and during barrier deployment allowing for barrier deployment to simultaneously occur with mating of the unsterile and sterile components of the device, reducing time need to fully ready the device for use. Furthermore, the method for affixing the barrier to the sterile component allows for removal and replacement of the sterile barrier or deployment of another barrier over the barrier already in place without requiring removal of the sterile component of the device should the sterility of exterior surface of the barrier become compromised, reducing the time and cost associated with replacing the barrier requiring replacement of the sterile components. Additionally, the sterile component of the device may be replaced without requiring replacement of the sterile barrier and the barrier, if already deployed over the unsterile components of the device, may remain deployed while the sterile component is replaced, again reducing the time burden that would be required to remove and redeploy a sterile barrier if it were permanently affixed to the sterile component.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">An additional advantage of providing tabs <b>1221</b> at the distal end of the sterile barrier or bag <b>1200</b> is that it allows for ease of deployment of the sterile barrier by an unsterile user without compromising barrier sterility but also providing for a method of affixing the barrier to a surface so as to avoid contact between the exterior sterile surface <b>1202</b><i>b </i>and an unsterile component prior to bringing the barrier or bag <b>1200</b> into the sterile field.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In referring to the description, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the examples disclosed.
