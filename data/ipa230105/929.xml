Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a composition and the applications thereof, particularly to a composition for elevating the ability of brain tissue, which contains at least one of lactic acid bacterium strains and the fermentation metabolites thereof, and the applications thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to US statistics, about 1% population aged over 60 years old suffer Parkinson's disease (PD). In Taiwan, data shows that the average age of onset of PD is about 62 years old and that the prevalence rate of PD is about 1%. The probability that males suffer PD is about 1.5 times the probability of females. The primary pathology of PD is the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta of midbrain, which would affect the movement ability of patients progressively and leads to bradykinesia, tremor, stiffness, and posture instability.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The substantia nigra pars compacta of midbrain contains massive dopaminergic neurons, which transmit signals to basal ganglia. The cause why PD is accompanied by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has not been settled yet so far. In a primary group (about 60-70%) of PD patients, the midbrain substantia nigra cells are degenerated by heredity, brain injury, chemical toxicity, etc. The degeneration of the midbrain substantia nigra cells leads to hypocrinia of dopamine (a neuro-transmitter) or inbalance of acetylcholine (Ach) and dopamine. The striatum of basal ganglia, which receives dopamine from substantia nigra as the neuro-transmitter, is thus affected and unable to regulate the signals of cerebral cortex, thalamus and the extrapyramidal system. Then, the function of coordinating muscles fails to work.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many researches show that Parkinsonism is usually accompanied by variation of the metabolites of intestinal microbiota. Especially, the patients of Parkinsonism have a very high morbidity of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>. Besides, the recent study found that Parkinsonism is accompanied by inbalance of bacteria microbiota, such as the decrease of Genuses Blautia, <i>Coprococcus </i>and <i>Roseburia </i>and the increase of Genus <i>Ralstonia </i>in fecal microbiota.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some researches show that certain lactic acid bacterium strains not only can treat diseases but also can relieve the problems of cognitive functions and emotional damage. For example, Dinan et al. expanded the concept of probiotics and proposed psychobiotics. The concept of psychobiotics is that taking appropriate amount of active microorganisms is favorable to the health of psychiatric patients, such as enhancing the disease resistance of intestinal tracts, improving the bacteria flora of intestinal tracts, regulating immunological systems, and helping digestion (Dinan et al., (2013). &#x201c;Psychobiotics: a novel class of psychotropic&#x201d;. Biological Psychiatry, 74(10):720-6. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2013_05.001). It is found recently: feeding lactic acid bacteria may influence the behavior of hosts and the function of brains. For example, Desbonnet et al. found that feeding <i>Bifidobacterium infantis </i>35624 may improve depressive disorder of mice and increase neuro-transmitters in the brains of mice (Desbonnet et al., (2008). &#x201c;The probiotic Bifidobacteria <i>infantis</i>: An assessment of potential antidepressant properties in the rat&#x201d;. Journal of Psychiatric Research, 43(2): 164-174. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.03.009).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, lactic acid bacteria are safe to human bodies and favorable to health. It has been a target the manufacturers are eager to achieve: developing nutritional supplement products safe to human bodies and suitable to use persistently to elevate the ability of brain tissue.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a composition containing at least one of lactic acid bacterium strains and the fermentation metabolites thereof, which has a physiologically-active effect of elevating the ability of brain tissue, whereby the composition containing at least one of lactic acid bacterium strains and the fermentation metabolites thereof of the present invention may be used to elevate the ability of brain tissue and may be fabricated in form of a food composition or a pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the present invention proposes an application of using at least one of lactic acid bacterium strains and the fermentation metabolites thereof to fabricate a food composition for elevating the ability of brain tissue, wherein the food composition comprises at least one of isolated lactic acid bacterium strains and the fermentation metabolites thereof and a physiologically-acceptable recipient, diluent or carrier.

The animal disease-inducing mode used by the experiment injects 6-OHDA to rats unilaterally to damage the unilateral dopaminergic system and induce the hemi-parkinsonism. The unilateral injection mode is often adopted at present because it can overcome the difficult of nursing the rats receiving bilateral injection of 6-OHDA. A stereotaxic instrument and a microinjector are used to inject 6-OHDA into a region between the striatum and the substantia nigra pars compacta to damage the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and decrease the dopamine released to the striatum, whereby to induce rats to suffer parkinsonism-like diseases.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">Unilateral 6-OHDA disease-inducing process: Mix Tiletamine and Zolazepam (TZ) by a ratio of 1:1 to form an intramuscular injection anesthetics. Use the abovementioned anesthetics (2.5 mg/kg) and ROMPUN (0.3 mg/kg) to anesthetize all the rats having been disease-induced by 6-OHDA. Before being injured by 6-OHDA, Norpramin (25 mg/kg) is intraperitoneally into all the rats to protect the arterenol neurons thereof. Use a micro drill to drill a hole on the right frontal bone. Dissolve 12 g 6-OHDA (purchased from Sigma) in 4 L of an aseptic solution containing 0.9% NaCl and 0.02% ascorbic acid. Use a Hamilton microliter syringe to inject the abovementioned 6-OHDA solution into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) at a flowrate of 0.5&#x3bc;L/min.

Dopamine is also a hormone generated by the endocrine system, performing physiological functions, such as vasoconstriction regulation and glycogenolysis. Dopamine is a biogenic amine, derived from tyrosine through a series of reactions. The metabolic path of dopamine includes the following reactions: phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes phenylalanine to form tyrosine; tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes tyrosine to form L-dopa; aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) or DOPA decarboxylase strips off one carbon dioxide molecule of L-dopa to form dopamine. Therefore, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) plays an important role in the synthesis of brain dopamine.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0049">In clinics, lacking tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) will interrupt the transference of neuro-transmitters and lead to deficiency of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, wherein dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine are totally referred to as catecholamine. The phenomenon of lacking tyrosine hydroxylase is called tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency in clinical medicine. The expressions of TH deficiency vary greatly, including the mild TH-deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), the severe TH-deficient infantile Parkinsonism, and the further severer TH-deficient progressive infantile encephalopathy. The patients of mild symptoms are likely to fall ill in their childhoods. At beginning, the symptom may be unilateral dystonia, asymmetric four-limb dystonia, postural tremor, uncoordinated pace, etc. With progression of the disease, the patient may suffer classic dopa-responsive dystonic gait disorder. Pharmacotherapy is normally effective to the patients of mild symptoms. The patients of moderate symptoms may be unable or hard to walk. The therapy of the moderate-symptom patients is more difficult, needing cooperation of several drugs. However, the side-effects of the drugs may cause hyperactivity, irascibility, etc. Besides, the patients of moderate symptoms need long-term therapy.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0050">In the experiment, after the rats are sacrificed, the skulls thereof are opened with a bone cutting tool to reveal the full brain tissues.

In fact, monoamine oxidase (MAO), which is responsible for metabolism of monoamine neuro-transmitters, is exactly in the outer membranes of the mitochondria. The dysfunction of mitochondria will decrease the energy generated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and raise oxidative stress.
