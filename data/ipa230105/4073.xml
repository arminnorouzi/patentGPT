id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, a parallel link structure attracts attention. For example, the parallel link structure attracts attention as a structure that allows for a high-speed operation of an arm section at a low power consumption because it is possible to configure a distal end side of an arm section constituting a parallel link to be light-weight and high rigidity.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the parallel link structure, a delta structure that allows for a translational movement in three degrees of freedom, a Stewart platform having six degrees of freedom, and the like have been proposed. In addition, a parallel link structure that achieves a wider movable range in all of the three translational axes and the three rotational axes has been studied (for example, Patent Literature 1). The parallel link apparatus including the parallel link structure is utilized in various applications because of many features such as high-speed operation capability, high rigidity, easy designing of a wiring line and the like, and low power consumption.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2000-284228</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, in order to further increase availability of a parallel link apparatus, an improvement in easiness of transportation of a parallel link apparatus is desired.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a parallel link apparatus with an improved storage property.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A parallel link apparatus according to one embodiment of the present disclosure includes: a base section; three or more deployment sections that extend radially from the base section and that are pivotable with end parts coupled to the base section being pivot axes; arm sections that are coupled to end parts, of the respective deployment sections, that are on opposite sides of the end parts coupled to the base section, and are pivotable with respect to the deployment sections and expandable and contractible in one direction independently of each other; and a movable section coupled to each of second ends, of the arm sections, that are on opposite sides of first ends, of the arm sections, coupled to the deployment sections.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the parallel link apparatus of one embodiment of the present disclosure, it is possible to support the base section by the three or more deployment sections that extend radially from the base section and that are pivotable with the end parts coupled to the base section being the pivot axes and by the arm sections that are coupled to the respective end parts of the deployment sections and are pivotable with respect to the deployment sections and expandable and contractible in one direction independently of each other.

Specifically, the arm section <b>230</b> is pivotably coupled to the end part on the tip side of the of deployment section <b>211</b> via the base end coupling part <b>213</b> in two degrees of freedom. Thus, it is possible for the arm section <b>230</b> to pivot, relative to the base section <b>210</b>, in two degrees of freedom including a pivot axis in which the extending direction of the deployment section <b>211</b> serves as an axial direction and a pivot axis in which a direction orthogonal to the extending direction of the deployment section <b>211</b> within the plane of the principal surface of the base section <b>210</b> serves as an axial direction.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The arm section <b>230</b> is provided so as to be extendable and contractible in one direction toward an upper part of the base section <b>210</b> by a pantograph structure. The pantograph structure is a structure in which a plurality of contractible rhombic structures is linked, and is extendable and contractible in one direction by the contraction of the rhombic structures. The pantograph structure may be formed, for example, by pivotably coupling end parts of a cross-shaped link in which a middle part is pivotably coupled to end parts of a cross-shaped link having a similar configuration.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The pantograph structure is determined in an expansion contraction rate and an expansion contraction length by the number of couplings of the rhombic structures and a length of each of the links forming the rhombic structures.

However, the pantograph structure of the arm section <b>230</b> may be configured such that the rhombic structure on the tip side is smaller than the rhombic structure on the base end side in order to prevent an interference or a contact of the mutual arm sections <b>230</b> in the vicinity of the movable section <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In addition, the pantograph structure of the arm section <b>230</b> is provided with pulley mechanisms <b>231</b>.

Because it is possible for the actuator <b>221</b> to contract each of the rhombic structures constituting the pantograph structure of the arm section <b>230</b> in conjunction with each other by the ball screw, it is possible to expand and contract the arm section <b>230</b> in one direction.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The ball screw is configured by a threaded shaft, a nut, a ball, or the like, and is a mechanical element that converts a rotational motion of the motor into a linear motion. Because the ball screw has a low back drivability, it is possible to suppress the arm section <b>230</b> from rapidly contracting or falling down even in a case where the power from the motor is lost. In addition, it is possible for the ball screw to lower the back drivability by making a lead of the threaded shaft smaller.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The tip coupling sections <b>241</b> are provided at the movable section <b>240</b> at equal intervals so as to be point symmetric with respect to the center of the movable section <b>240</b>.

According to the technique of the present disclosure having the following configurations, it is possible to provide a parallel link apparatus that supports the movable section by three or more deployment sections that extend radially from the base section and that are pivotable with the end parts coupled to the base section being the pivot axes and by the arm sections that are coupled to the respective end parts of the deployment sections and are pivotable with respect to the deployment sections and expandable and contractible in one direction independently of each other. Because it is possible for such a parallel link apparatus to be deformed in into a shape in which the deployment sections are folded in a direction perpendicular to the principal surface of the base section, it is possible for the parallel link apparatus to be deformed into the storage state having the higher space filling rate. Accordingly, because the storage property is increased, it is possible for the parallel link apparatus to improve easiness of transportation. An effect to be exerted by the technique according to the present disclosure is not necessarily limited to the effect described herein, and may be any of the effects described in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0000">(1)</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">A parallel link apparatus including:</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">a base section;</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">three or more deployment sections that extend radially from the base section and that are pivotable with end parts coupled to the base section being pivot axes;</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">arm sections that are coupled to end parts, of the respective deployment sections, that are on opposite sides of the end parts coupled to the base section, and are pivotable with respect to the deployment sections and expandable and contractible in one direction independently of each other; and</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">a movable section coupled to each of second ends, of the arm sections, that are on opposite sides of first ends, of the arm sections, coupled to the deployment sections.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0000">(2)</p><p id="p-0148" num="0145">The parallel link apparatus according to (1), in which the arm sections have a pantograph structure.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0000">(3)</p><p id="p-0150" num="0146">The parallel link apparatus according to (2), in which the pantograph structure is provided such that a rhombic structure on the second end side is smaller than a rhombic structure on the first end side.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0000">(4)</p><p id="p-0152" num="0147">The parallel link apparatus according to any one of (1) to (3), in which the first end side of the arm sections is provided with first actuators that expand and contract the arm sections.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0000">(5)</p><p id="p-0154" num="0148">The parallel link apparatus according to (4), in which the first end side of the arm sections is provided with second actuators that cause the arm sections to pivot relative to the deployment sections.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0000">(6)</p><p id="p-0156" num="0149">The parallel link apparatus according to (5), in which the first actuators and the second actuators include ball screws.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0000">(7)</p><p id="p-0158" num="0150">The parallel link apparatus according to any one of (1) to (6), further including fixing mechanisms that fix pivot positions of the deployment sections relative to the base section.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0000">(8)</p><p id="p-0160" num="0151">The parallel link apparatus according to any one of (1) to (7), in which the deployment sections are provided in a point symmetrical arrangement with respect to center of the base section.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0000">(9)</p><p id="p-0162" num="0152">The parallel link apparatus according to any one of (1) to (8), in which the arm sections are coupled to the movable section in a point symmetric arrangement with respect to center of the movable section.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0000">(10)</p><p id="p-0164" num="0153">The parallel link apparatus according to any one of (1) to (9), in which the respective arm sections expand and contract in directions that are torsional with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0000">(11)</p><p id="p-0166" num="0154">The parallel link apparatus according to any one of (1) to (9), in which a coupling angle between the arm sections and the movable section is controlled on the basis of coupling angles between the arm sections and the deployment sections.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0000">(12)</p><p id="p-0168" num="0155">The parallel link apparatus according to (11), in which the movable section is translationally movable with respect to the base section.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0000">(13)</p><p id="p-0170" num="0156">The parallel link apparatus according to any one of (1) to (12), further including an imaging device provided on the movable section.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0000">(14)</p><p id="p-0172" num="0157">The parallel link apparatus according to (13), in which the imaging device is provided on the movable section via a gimbal structure.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0158">The present application claims the benefit of Japanese Priority Patent Application JP2019-225421 filed with the Japan Patent Office on Dec. 13, 2019, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0159">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
