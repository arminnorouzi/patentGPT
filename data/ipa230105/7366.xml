The following description includes various details for facilitation of understanding. However, these details are merely considered as examples, not for limiting the present disclosure. The present disclosure is defined by the attached Claims and their equivalents. The words and phrases used in the following description are only used to enable a clear and consistent understanding of the present disclosure. In addition, for clarity and brevity, descriptions of well-known structures, functions, and configurations may be omitted. Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that various changes and modifications can be made to the examples described in the present specification without departing from the gist and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As mentioned above, with the development of internet TV, users' demand for interaction is increasing day by day.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, users may want to send comment messages to express their feelings or view other users' evaluations on videos while watching video programs. Bullet screen is a kind of commentary subtitle that pops up when watching videos, which is very popular among content providers, especially in East Asian cultural circles. However, compared with Asian characters which are suitable for scrolling display (whether in rows or columns), some languages such as English may not be so suitable for scrolling viewing. In addition, at present, most of the bullet messages are edited and entered by mobile terminal or personal computer (PC), while it may not be so fast and convenient as entering through TV and its STB.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For another example, for a video program, the user may also want to preview or evaluation some highlights of the video program. At present, the highlights are usually generated on the server side based on the segments manually marked by managers, which need to be downloaded and watched by the device on the TV terminal side. This may consume and occupy the computing resources and network performance on the network side, and it is difficult to match the personalized needs of the local users in time, which affects the interactive experience of users when watching TV programs.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, the present disclosure seeks to provide a richer interactive experience by using network devices, terminals, servers and other devices. During the video playing process, multiple users can enter several types of evaluations on video segments by pressing the predetermined buttons on their respective remote controllers or other devices, and these evaluations can be displayed in the form of bullet messages during the video playing process. By summarizing and counting multiple evaluations from multiple users, highlights can be generated for the local users that meet their individual needs. The local users can conduct jump-playing of the generated highlights to watch the content they are interested in and get a richer interactive experience.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing an example system environment according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the exemplary system environment may include a server <b>140</b> on the server side, a TV <b>110</b>, a network device <b>120</b>, a remote controller <b>130</b>, and the like on the terminal side. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows only one group of terminal side devices, the present disclosure may include a plurality of groups of terminal side devices used by a plurality of users.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the network device <b>120</b> (which may be a STB, for example) can receive various types of communication from the remote controller <b>130</b> and/or send various types of communication to the TV set <b>110</b>, and perform various types of communication with the server <b>140</b>. For example, the TV <b>110</b> may receive one or more data services, one or more audio/video services and/or other services from the server <b>140</b> through the network device <b>120</b>. In another example, the remote controller <b>130</b> can include a STB remote controller and/or a TV remote controller, which can control the input to the STB or TV, and a part of the input can be sent to the server <b>140</b> for storage or processing after being processed by the STB.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the TV <b>110</b> can include various types of display devices, including but not limited to Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) based on telecommunication private network, Internet TV based on public Internet, Internet TV, or various electronic display devices integrating the functions of playing and displaying video programs, TV programs or live programs. Note: This disclosure refers it as TV <b>110</b> for convenience of understanding, but this disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The network device <b>120</b> may be various types of network devices connecting the TV <b>110</b> with external signal sources, and may be, for example, a STB capable of converting acquired digital signals into TV contents and displaying them on the TV <b>110</b>. The STB can be a digital TV STB for receiving cable TV (DVB-C), a digital TV STB for receiving digital satellite TV (DVB-S), a digital TV STB for receiving terrestrial broadcast TV (DVB-T). In some embodiments, the network device <b>120</b> may be a device located outside the TV <b>110</b> or a module or function integrated in the TV <b>110</b>. Note: The present disclosure does not specifically limit the type of the network device <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The remote controller <b>130</b> may be a device that controls input to a STB or a TV, and may also be a limited device that is inconvenient to quickly enter words and phrases. The remote controller <b>130</b> may also be an STB remote controller and/or a TV remote controller or other types of input-limited devices.
