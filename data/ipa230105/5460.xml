More specifically the disclosed invention relates to a pedalboard with support members that are extendable and a musical effects pedal attachment device used to connect a musical effects pedal to the horizontal mounting members.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Musician often use musical effects pedals to vary the sound of the music they are playing. Musical effects pedals (&#x201c;pedals&#x201d;) generally only provide one varying sound for each pedal, so a musician who likes to create many different sounds with their instrument would need to have many musical effects pedals. Keeping the pedals scattered around on the floor would be unsuitable for many reasons. The pedals could become easily disconnected and moving the pedals from one location to another would also be very cumbersome. One solution is for the musician to mount their pedals on a pedalboard. This provides quick access to their preferred pedals.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior art pedalboards have limitations. For example, many are limited to specific fixed sizes and also a particular musical effects pedal connection means. Also, many musicians may play in a variety of bands, each band requiring a different pedalboard setup with different pedals. Current pedalboards do not lend themselves to easy pedal swapping or quickly modifying the pedalboard size to accommodate more or fewer pedals. Another downfall of existing pedalboards is the way they connect the musical effects pedal to the pedalboard. In some cases, this done with a hook and loop fastener arrangement. The hook side may be placed on the back of the effects pedal and the loop side may be placed on the pedalboard. The hook and loop generally have an adhesive backing to adhere it to the appropriate surface. This connection method is not very secure and pedals can become loose and fall off the board, risking damage to the pedal. Additionally, if the hook and loop is removed from the effects pedal it can leave a sticky residue. This is less than ideal as pedals are becoming more expensive and also because a musician would not want to ruin the value of a vintage pedal with this residue. There are pedalboards with connection means other than hook and loop, but these connection means may require a threaded connection and a tool such as a screwdriver in order to swap pedals in and out. This presents a problem when, for example, the musician doesn't have the appropriate tool and therefore cannot readily detach the pedal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, pedalboards with a larger number of musical effects pedals often require a power supply to power all of the musical effects pedals. This requires space, preferably on the bottom side of the pedalboard between the pedalboard and the ground. Otherwise, a power supply would have to be mounted to the top of the pedalboard, which takes away valuable space for a musical effects pedal. Many pedalboards, especially the smaller boards, do not allow for this power supply area on the bottom side.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of at least the above, there is room in the art for improvement.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is explained in the following description in view of the drawings that show:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an example embodiment of an extendable musical effects pedalboard in non-extended configuration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exploded perspective view of the extendable musical effects pedalboard of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an example embodiment of an attachment device attached to a musical effects pedal.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows another perspective view of the attachment device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a top view of an example embodiment of the musical effects pedalboard arrangement with an alternate example embodiment of the musical effects pedalboard in non-extended configuration and with the musical effects pedal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> attached</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an example embodiment of the musical effects pedalboard arrangement with the musical effects pedalboard of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and musical effects pedal attached.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an exploded perspective view of the musical effects pedalboard arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a right side cross-sectional view of the musical effects pedalboard arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an alternate example embodiment of the musical effects pedalboard in the extended configuration.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a bottom view of the musical effects pedalboard of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref></p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the support member of the musical effects pedalboard of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows an exploded perspective view of the support member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an alternate example embodiment of an extendable musical effects pedalboard.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows an exploded perspective view of an alternate example embodiment of the extendable musical effects pedalboard.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The Inventor has created a unique and versatile musical effects pedalboard arrangement. The musical effects pedalboard arrangement includes a pedalboard which is expandable and an attachment device which enables the musician to easily and without tools connect and disconnect the musical effects pedals to/from the pedalboard. The expandable nature of the pedalboard allows the musician to deftly and efficiently change a size of the pedalboard to accommodate changing needs. Not requiring tools enables the musician to connect and disconnect the musical effects pedal anytime and anywhere.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> show an example embodiment of a musical effects pedalboard <b>100</b> of the pedalboard arrangement disclosed herein. The musical effects pedalboard <b>100</b> includes a right support end <b>102</b>, a left support end <b>104</b>, and a pair of support members <b>106</b> configured to support a foot pedal for musical effects. Each support member <b>106</b> shown is a single rail <b>108</b> and is secured in position between the right support end <b>102</b> and the left support end <b>104</b>. In this non-limiting example embodiment, the support members <b>106</b> are parallel to each other. Each support member <b>106</b> includes a clip feature <b>110</b> that extends along a long axis <b>112</b> for at least a portion of a length of the respective support member <b>106</b>. Each support member <b>106</b> is also set apart from the other support member <b>106</b> by a gap <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example embodiment, the support members <b>106</b> are secured to the right support end <b>102</b> and the left support end <b>104</b> via fasteners <b>120</b> (e.g. thumb screws) that pass through a respective support end and which, in an example embodiment, screw into a threaded receptacle <b>122</b> in an end <b>124</b> of the respective support member <b>106</b>. Adjustable front plates <b>130</b> are connected to the right support end <b>102</b> and the left support end <b>104</b> by fasteners <b>132</b> (e.g. thumb screws) which thread into adjustable front plate nuts <b>134</b>. The adjustable front plates <b>130</b> are shown in a non-extended configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and in an extended configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Optional rubber grommets <b>140</b> are pressed into holes <b>142</b> in the left support end <b>104</b> and the right support end <b>102</b> to keep the musical effects pedalboard <b>100</b> from sliding around on the ground or stage during use. Handle grips <b>144</b> snap into holes <b>146</b> located in the right support end <b>102</b> and the left support end <b>104</b> and secure handles <b>148</b> in place.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this example embodiment, a front track assembly <b>150</b> includes an upper channel track <b>152</b> secured to a top of a fixed front plate <b>154</b> via, for example, track fasteners <b>156</b>, and a lower channel track <b>158</b> secured to a bottom of the fixed front plate <b>154</b> via, for example, the track fasteners <b>156</b>. The adjustable front plates <b>130</b> are located behind the fixed front plate <b>154</b> but within the upper channel track <b>152</b> and within the lower channel track <b>158</b>. The adjustable front plates <b>130</b> can move freely within the upper channel track <b>152</b> and the lower channel track <b>158</b> until a desired distance <b>170</b> between the right support end <b>102</b> and the left support end <b>104</b> suitable for accommodating the support members <b>106</b> is reached. Once the desired distance <b>170</b> is reached, the adjustable front plates <b>130</b> can be secured in position using, for example, front plate set screws <b>172</b> which are threaded thought the fixed front plate <b>154</b> and which press on and secure the adjustable front plates <b>130</b> when tightened.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> show an attachment device <b>300</b> attached to an example musical effects pedal <b>302</b>. In this example embodiment, four attachment devices <b>300</b> are used. However, any number can be used, from one and up. Each attachment device <b>300</b> includes a clip <b>304</b> configured to clip onto the clip feature <b>110</b> and remain retained thereon via a resilience of the clip <b>304</b> at a variety of locations along the long axis <b>112</b>; and a clip connector <b>306</b> having a clip hole <b>308</b> through a first end <b>310</b> configured to receive a fastener <b>320</b> associated with the musical effects pedal <b>302</b> and a second end <b>322</b> connected to the clip <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an example embodiment, the clip <b>304</b> includes one or more connection points <b>324</b> configured to receive the second end <b>322</b> of the clip connector <b>306</b>. In an example embodiment, the connection point <b>324</b> may be a female recess such as a through hole or a blind hole, and the second end <b>322</b> may include a protrusion such as a stud. In this example embodiment, the connection points <b>324</b> are disposed in a clip surface <b>312</b> that faces the support member <b>106</b> when secured to the support member <b>106</b>. This arrangement traps the second end <b>322</b> of the clip connector <b>306</b> between the clip <b>304</b> and the support member <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example embodiment, the connection between the clip <b>304</b> and the clip connector <b>306</b> is a pivoting connection that enables pivoting around a clip pivot axis <b>326</b>. In a non-limiting example embodiment, the clip <b>304</b> and the clip connector <b>306</b> have cooperating circular cross sectional shapes. In alternate example embodiments, the connection between the clip <b>304</b> and the clip connector <b>306</b> is a non-pivoting connection. In such an example embodiment, the connection point <b>324</b> and the clip connector stud may both have, for example, cooperating, non-circular cross sectional shapes. The clip hole <b>308</b> similarly permits the clip connector <b>306</b> to pivot about a fastener axis <b>328</b>. This enables the attachment device <b>300</b> to adjust to the locations of the support members <b>106</b> through a range of sizes of gap <b>114</b>, which provides great flexibility without the need for any tools. Having more than one connection point <b>324</b> increases the range of sizes of gap <b>114</b> that the attachment device <b>300</b> can accommodate. Likewise, the flexibility of the pivoting connections and the connection points <b>324</b> allow the attachment device <b>300</b> to accommodate a variety of different sizes of musical effects pedals <b>302</b> for a given gap <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The clip <b>304</b> further includes catches <b>330</b> configured to cooperate with the clip feature <b>110</b> to attach the musical effects pedal <b>302</b> to the support members <b>106</b>. To install the clip, the clip <b>304</b> is opened against a resilience of the clip <b>304</b>. This increases a distance between the catches <b>330</b>. The clip <b>304</b> is then lowered onto the support member <b>106</b> and the resilience of the clip <b>304</b> is allowed to cause the catches <b>330</b> to close back, which causes the catches <b>330</b> to engage the clip feature <b>110</b>. The clips <b>304</b> optionally include a finger tab <b>332</b>. To disengage the clip <b>304</b>, the tab finger can be lifted by finger. This releases the adjacent catch <b>330</b> from the clip feature <b>110</b> and thereby releases the clip <b>304</b> from the support member <b>106</b>. Consequently, the attachment device <b>300</b> allows a musician to adjust the attachment device to make it compatible with support members <b>106</b> at different distances from each other. It also allows the musician to attach and detach the musical effects pedal <b>302</b> to/from the support member <b>106</b> without having to use any tools. The clip <b>304</b> can be made from any material that provides sufficient strength and resilience. Non-limiting example materials include plastics and thin metals.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a top view of an example embodiment of the musical effects pedalboard arrangement <b>500</b> with an alternate example embodiment of the musical effects pedalboard <b>502</b> in non-extended configuration and with the musical effects pedal <b>302</b> attached via plural attachment devices <b>300</b>. The clip <b>304</b> is clipped over top surfaces <b>504</b> of the respective support members <b>106</b>. In example embodiments, the clips <b>304</b> can also clip over bottom surfaces.

In this example embodiment, the support members <b>106</b> each have a top <b>800</b>, a bottom <b>802</b>, and sides <b>804</b> that connect the top <b>800</b> and the bottom <b>802</b> and which are disposed on opposite sides of the support member <b>106</b>. Each clip feature <b>110</b> comprises a first clip track <b>810</b> that extends along the long axis <b>112</b> and a second clip track <b>812</b> that extends along the long axis <b>112</b>. The first clip track <b>810</b> and the second clip track <b>812</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the respective support member. Catches <b>330</b> of the clip <b>304</b> are configured to clip onto the first clip track <b>810</b> and the second clip track <b>812</b> and remain retained thereon via the resilience of the clip <b>304</b> at a variety of locations along the long axis <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in a first clipped position the clip <b>304</b> clips over the top <b>800</b> of the respective support member <b>106</b>. In a second clipped position, (not shown), the clip <b>304</b> clips over the bottom <b>802</b> of the respective support member <b>106</b>. The attachment devices <b>300</b> can be used in the second clipped position to, for example, secure a power supply to the bottom <b>802</b> of the support members <b>106</b>. This keeps the top <b>800</b> free for musical effects pedals <b>302</b>. The gap <b>114</b> provides a way to get wires from the power supply to the musical effects pedals <b>302</b> as well as a way to run other wires associated with the musical effects pedals <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an alternate example embodiment, at least one of the first clip track <b>810</b> and the second clip track <b>812</b> may instead be a series of discrete recesses disposed along the long axis <b>112</b> and configured to cooperate with the catches <b>330</b>, as opposed to a continuous track. In another alternate example embodiment, the clips <b>304</b> clip over the entire support member <b>106</b> so that the catch <b>330</b> engages with the bottom <b>802</b> of the support member <b>106</b>. In this alternate example embodiment, only one clip <b>304</b> could be located at any given position along the long axis <b>112</b>. In contrast, in the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, one clip <b>304</b> could be clipped over the top <b>800</b> of the support member <b>106</b> and one clip <b>304</b> could be secured over the bottom <b>802</b> at the same position along the long axis <b>112</b> because each only extends approximately half way along the sides <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The tops <b>800</b> of the support members <b>106</b> define a plane <b>820</b> configured to support the musical effects pedal <b>302</b>. The right support end <b>102</b> and the left support end <b>104</b> are at different elevations and thereby define an angle <b>822</b> of the plane <b>820</b> relative to a surface <b>824</b> on which the musical effects pedalboard arrangement <b>600</b> rests, such as the ground. The right support end <b>102</b> and the left support end <b>104</b> dictate the angle <b>822</b> as well as the height of the top <b>800</b> and bottom <b>802</b> of the support members <b>106</b>, as well as a corresponding elevation of the respective long axes <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an alternate example embodiment of the musical effects pedalboard <b>900</b> with the adjustable front plates <b>130</b> in the extended configuration. The musical effects pedalboard <b>900</b> is similar to the musical effects pedalboard <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, the musical effects pedalboard <b>900</b> includes a larger right support end <b>902</b> and a larger left support end <b>904</b> to hold multiple support members <b>906</b>. The multiple support members <b>906</b> allow for more room to store musical effects pedals as well as allowing for more placement options.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this example embodiment, each support member <b>906</b> is composed of two discrete rails <b>910</b>, <b>912</b> connected to each other end-to-end at an interface <b>914</b>. In this example embodiment, the two rails <b>910</b>, <b>912</b> are of different sizes. However, the rails <b>910</b>, <b>912</b> can be the same size. Moreover, the support member <b>906</b> may include any number of rails, each rail being any size desired. This allows the musician to assemble rails together as desired to create support members <b>906</b> of a variety of lengths. The adjustable front plates <b>130</b> are universally adjustable and so they can be adjusted to accommodate support members <b>106</b> of any length within a range of the adjustable front plates <b>130</b>. If the support members <b>106</b> are longer than a particular set of adjustable front plates <b>130</b> can accommodate, the particular set of adjustable front plates <b>130</b> can be swapped out for longer adjustable front plates.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a bottom view of the musical effects pedalboard of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. A rail connector <b>1000</b> can be seen securing the rails <b>910</b>, <b>912</b> to each other end-to-end.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> show the support member <b>906</b> of the musical effects pedalboard <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The rail connector <b>1000</b> cooperates with a connection feature <b>1100</b> in each rail. The connection feature <b>1100</b> in this example embodiment includes at least one connector track <b>1102</b> that extends along the long axis <b>1104</b> and is open at the interface <b>914</b> between the two rails <b>910</b>, <b>912</b>. The rail connector <b>1000</b> comprises an interlocking feature <b>1106</b> that extends into and geometrically interlocks with each connector track <b>1102</b>. The connector track <b>1102</b> need not extend along an entire length of the rail <b>910</b>, <b>912</b>. Instead, the connector track <b>1102</b> can be disposed only at the ends of the rails and of a size necessary to accommodate the interlocking feature <b>1106</b> of the rail connector <b>1000</b>. Optional rail connector screws <b>1108</b> are threaded into the rail connector <b>1000</b> and can be tightened to press on and secure the rails <b>910</b>, <b>912</b> together. In an example embodiment, the rail connector screws <b>1108</b> are threaded into press nuts <b>1110</b> which are, in turn, pressed into the rail connector <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, an optional rail stud <b>1200</b> may be used to aid the rail connector <b>1000</b> in securing the connection between the first rail <b>1202</b> and the second rail <b>1204</b>. In such an embodiment, the rail connector <b>1000</b> is fully inserted in one of the rails (e.g., the first rail <b>1202</b>) until the rail connector <b>1000</b> is past a bitter end <b>1206</b> of the rail. Once the rail connector <b>1000</b> is fully inserted, the first rail <b>1202</b> and the second rail <b>1204</b> can be threaded together and the connector tracks <b>1102</b> aligned. Then, the rail connector <b>1000</b> is positioned so it spans both the first rail <b>1202</b> and the second rail <b>1204</b> and the rail connector screws <b>1108</b> are then tightened. The rail stud <b>1200</b> thereby holds the first rail <b>1202</b> and the second rail <b>1204</b> together along the long axis <b>1104</b>. The rail connector <b>1000</b> prevents the first rail <b>1202</b> and the second rail <b>1204</b> from rotating relative to each other which, in turn, ensures the first rail <b>1202</b> and the second rail <b>1204</b> do not disengage from the rail stud <b>1200</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> show an alternate example embodiment of an extendable musical effects pedalboard <b>1300</b>. This example embodiment is otherwise the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, except that the front track assembly <b>150</b> is replaced with a fixed front assembly <b>1302</b> that includes a fixed front <b>1304</b> and brackets <b>1306</b> to secure the fixed front to the right support end <b>1310</b> and the left support end <b>1312</b> via, for example, fasteners <b>1314</b> such as thumbscrews <b>1316</b> and nuts <b>1318</b>. In this example embodiment, there may be any number of fixed fronts <b>1304</b> of differing lengths that are sized to accommodate support members <b>1320</b> of different lengths.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an alternate example embodiment, the musical effects pedalboard does not have the front track assembly <b>150</b>, the fixed front assembly <b>1302</b>, or any connecting structure in that location. In that alternate example embodiment, the support members, the right support end, and the left support end are structurally sufficient to hold the musical effects pedalboard together.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">From the foregoing it can be seen that the inventor has created a pedalboard arrangement that provides great flexibility in adjusting the size of the pedalboard. In addition, the pedalboard arrangement allows a musician to easily attach and detach musical effects pedals, without using any tools, and to adjust the attachment device to accommodate a range of musical effects pedal sizes and pedalboard sizes and configurations.
