In other use cases, other entities may offer plans to a user.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During an interaction, if a plan is to be selected and implemented, then additional messaging is required to pass plan information between computers in the interaction system. Additionally, a user may typically be notified of available plans after a resource provider computer submits interaction data for authorization. For example, a network processing computer may receive an authorization request message including the interaction data for authorization of the interaction from the resource provider computer. The network processing computer can then reach out to the user to query the user on whether or not the user wants to select a plan, thus slowing down the processing of the interaction due to messaging and waiting for user input.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the disclosure address this problem and other problems individually and collectively.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment is related to a method comprising: receiving, by a network processing computer, an authorization request message comprising a token and a cryptogram during an interaction between a resource provider and a user; determining, by the network processing computer, user credentials associated with the token; determining, by the network processing computer, a plan identifier based on the authorization request message; and providing, by the network processing computer, and the plan identifier or plan information associated with the plan identifier to an authorizing entity computer.

In some embodiments, a user may be associated with one or more personal accounts and/or mobile devices. The user may also be referred to as a cardholder, account holder, or consumer in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A &#x201c;user device&#x201d; may be a device that is operated by a user. Examples of user devices may include a mobile phone, a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a server computer, a vehicle such as an automobile, a thin-client device, a tablet PC, etc. Additionally, user devices may be any type of wearable technology device, such as a watch, earpiece, glasses, etc. The user device may include one or more processors capable of processing user input. The user device may also include one or more input sensors for receiving user input. As is known in the art, there are a variety of input sensors capable of detecting user input, such as accelerometers, cameras, microphones, etc. The user input obtained by the input sensors may be from a variety of data input types, including, but not limited to, audio data, visual data, or biometric data. The user device may comprise any electronic device that may be operated by a user, which may also provide remote communication capabilities to a network. Examples of remote communication capabilities include using a mobile phone (wireless) network, wireless data network (e.g., 3G, 4G or similar networks), Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, or any other communication medium that may provide access to a network such as the Internet or a private network.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A &#x201c;credential&#x201d; may comprise any evidence of authority, rights, or entitlement to privileges. For example, access credentials may comprise permissions to access certain tangible or intangible assets, such as a building or a file. In another example, payment credentials may include any suitable information associated with and/or identifying an account (e.g., a payment account and/or a payment device associated with the account). Such information may be directly related to the account or may be derived from information related to the account. Examples of account information may include an &#x201c;account identifier&#x201d; such as a PAN (primary account number or &#x201c;account number&#x201d;), a token, a subtoken, a gift card number or code, a prepaid card number or code, a user name, an expiration date, a CVV (card verification value), a dCW (dynamic card verification value), a CVV2 (card verification value 2), a CVC3 (card verification code 3), etc. An example of a PAN is a 16-digit number, such as &#x201c;4147 0900 0000 1234&#x201d;. In some embodiments, credentials may be considered sensitive information. Credentials associated with a user can be &#x201c;user credentials.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A &#x201c;token&#x201d; may be a substitute value for a credential. A token may be a string of numbers, letters, or any other suitable characters. Examples of tokens include payment tokens, access tokens, personal identification tokens, etc. A payment token may include an identifier for an account that is a substitute for account data, such as an account number. For example, a token may include a series of alphanumeric characters that may be used as a substitute for an original account identifier. For example, a token &#x201c;4900 0000 0000 0001&#x201d; may be used in place of a PAN &#x201c;4147 0000 1234.&#x201d; In some embodiments, a token may be &#x201c;format preserving&#x201d; and may have a numeric format that conforms to the account identifiers used in existing transaction processing network computers. In some embodiments, a token may be used in place of an account number to initiate, authorize, settle or resolve a transaction or represent the original credential in other systems where the original credential would typically be provided. In some embodiments, a token value may be generated such that the recovery of the original account number or other account identifier from the token value may not be computationally derived. Further, in some embodiments, the token format may be configured to allow the entity receiving the token to identify it as a token and recognize the entity that issued the token.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An &#x201c;interaction&#x201d; can be a reciprocal action, effect, or influence. An interaction, for example, could be an exchange or transaction between two or more parties. Example interactions include a transaction between two parties and a data exchange between two devices. In some embodiments, an interaction can include a user requesting access to secure data, a secure webpage, a secure location, and the like. In other embodiments, an interaction can include a payment transaction in which two devices can interact to facilitate a payment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An &#x201c;Application Programming Interface&#x201d; or &#x201c;API&#x201d; may include software specifying how components of a system should interact. The API may comprise a set of routines, protocols, and tools on which software applications may be built. An API may be used for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library, and may include specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, variables and/or remote calls.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A &#x201c;plan&#x201d; can include a proposal for doing or achieving something. A plan can include one or more actions, events, or methods that can be proposed to occur in the future. A plan can include an intention to perform the actions, events, or methods. A plan can include any suitable type of plan, for example, an installment plan (e.g., a payment plan), a data plan, a digital or physical asset transfer plan, and/or any other actions, events, or methods that can be planned to do or achieve a goal. A plan can relate to an interaction. In some embodiments, a plan can alter an interaction in a particular predefined manner (e.g., an installment plan can separate a transaction total into a plurality of payments).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An &#x201c;installment plan&#x201d; or &#x201c;installments plan&#x201d; may be a scheme for dividing something across two or more events based on an installment time. For example, the event may be paying for a portion of a total amount, and the installment time may be a month (e.g., for monthly payments). In some cases, an installment plan may be linked to a new, unique line of credit. In some cases, an installment plan may be linked to a particular payment instrument such as a debit card or credit card. In some cases, the card may be a card issued specifically for installments (an &#x201c;installments card&#x201d;). Alternatively, the card may be a user's credit card, for which installments have been temporarily or permanently enabled, along with typical functionalities such as debit or traditional credit payment processing.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A &#x201c;plan identifier&#x201d; can include a sequence of characters used to identify or refer to a plan such as an installment plan. A plan identifier can be associated with a particular plan. For example, a first plan identifier can identify and be associated with a first plan, while a second plan identifier can identify and be associated with a second plan. A plan identifier can include alphanumeric characters that may refer to a plan. For example, a plan identifier can be &#x201c;001&#x201d; or &#x201c;plan1,&#x201d; which may refer to a first plan. As another example, a plan identifier can be &#x201c;GX834KL&#x201d; which may refer to plan.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A &#x201c;resource provider&#x201d; may be an entity that can provide a resource such as goods, services, information, and/or access. Examples of resource providers includes merchants, data providers, transit agencies, governmental entities, venue and dwelling operators, etc. A &#x201c;merchant&#x201d; may typically be an entity that engages in transactions and can sell goods or services, or provide access to goods or services.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A &#x201c;resource provider computer&#x201d; may be a computer operated by a resource provider. Suitable computers may include access devices, back end server computers, as well as combinations of the above.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An &#x201c;acquirer&#x201d; may typically be a business entity (e.g., a commercial bank) that has a business relationship with a particular merchant or other entity. Some entities can perform both issuer and acquirer functions. Some embodiments may encompass such single entity issuer-acquirers. An acquirer may operate an acquirer computer, which can also be an example of a &#x201c;transport computer.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An &#x201c;authorizing entity&#x201d; may be an entity that authorizes a request. Examples of an authorizing entity may be an issuer, a governmental agency, a document repository, an access administrator, etc. An authorizing entity may operate an &#x201c;authorizing computer&#x201d; or an &#x201c;authorizing entity computer.&#x201d; An &#x201c;issuer&#x201d; may refer to a business entity (e.g., a bank) that issues and optionally maintains an account for a user. An issuer may also issue payment credentials stored on a user device, such as a cellular telephone, smart card, tablet, or laptop to the consumer, or in some embodiments, a portable device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Interaction data&#x201d; may include any suitable information associated with an interaction between an access device and a user device. Interaction data may include any suitable data associated with an interaction (e.g., a purchase transaction.). In some embodiments, interaction data may include any suitable combination of: identification data associated with an access device (e.g., one or more identifiers of an access device), identification information associated with a user device (e.g., one or more identifiers associated with a user device), an interaction value (e.g., a transaction amount such as a preauthorization amount and/or purchase price of a transaction), payment data (e.g., a payment account identifier associated with a payment account), one or more locations each associated with an access device and/or a user device, or any suitable information. Examples of payment data may include a PAN (primary account number or &#x201c;account number&#x201d;), username, expiration date, CVV (card verification value), dCVV (dynamic card verification value), CVV2 (card verification value 2), CVC3 card verification values, etc. CVV2 is generally understood to be a static verification value associated with a payment device. CVV2 values are generally visible to a user (e.g., a consumer), whereas CVV and dCVV values are typically embedded in memory or authorization request messages and are not readily known to the user (although they are known to the issuer and payment processors). Payment data may be any information that identifies or is associated with a payment account. Payment data may be provided in order to make a payment from a payment account. Payment data can also include a username, an expiration date, a gift card number or code, and any other suitable information. Interaction data may relate to ticket information for an event, data to access a building, transit ticket information, passwords, biometrics or other credentials to access secure data, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An &#x201c;authorization request message&#x201d; may be an electronic message that requests authorization for an interaction. In some embodiments, it is sent to a transaction processing computer and/or an issuer of a payment card to request authorization for a transaction. An authorization request message according to some embodiments may comply with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) <b>8583</b>, which is a standard for systems that exchange electronic transaction information associated with a payment made by a user using a payment device or payment account. The authorization request message may include an issuer account identifier that may be associated with a payment device or payment account. An authorization request message may also comprise additional data elements corresponding to &#x201c;identification information&#x201d; including, by way of example only: a service code, a CVV (card verification value), a dCVV (dynamic card verification value), a PAN (primary account number or &#x201c;account number&#x201d;), a payment token, a user name, an expiration date, etc. An authorization request message may also comprise &#x201c;transaction information,&#x201d; such as any information associated with a current transaction, such as the transaction value, merchant identifier, merchant location, acquirer bank identification number (BIN), card acceptor ID, information identifying items being purchased, etc., as well as any other information that may be utilized in determining whether to identify and/or authorize a transaction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An &#x201c;authorization response message&#x201d; may be a message that responds to an authorization request.

The network processing computer can determine user credentials associated with the token. The network processing computer can then determine an installment plan identifier based on the authorization request message. The network processing computer can then provide the installment plan identifier to an authorizing entity computer. The authorizing entity computer can then determine whether or not to authorize the interaction. In some embodiments, the installment plan identifier or plan information (e.g., a name, terms and conditions, etc.) can be sent to the authorizing entity computer via a communication separate from the authorization process. For example, the plan identifier or plan information can be sent to the authorizing entity computer via an API. In other embodiments, the plan identifier or plan information associated with the plan identifier is sent to the authorizing entity computer in a modified authorization request message that contains the plan identifier or plan information.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the authorizing entity computer can set up plans for a user (e.g., installment plans, data plans, etc.). In other embodiments, the authorizing entity computer can set up the plans in conjunction with the network processing computer. The network processing computer can generate and assign a plan identifier of each plan received from the authorizing entity computer. Further, each plan may be associated with plan metadata (e.g., data relating to the plan). Plan metadata may be an example of plan information. The plan metadata can include, for example, the length of the plan, a number of increments of the plan, an amount of each increment (e.g., information about the interest rate or any fees), an expiration date of the plan, a minimum amount of the plan, a location requirement of the plan, etc. The network processing computer can provide the plan identifiers and the plan metadata to a service provider computer. The service provider computer can store the plan identifiers and plan metadata onto the user device and/or at the service provider computer. Then during an interaction and when selecting a particular plan to use for the interaction, the user device can generate a cryptogram (e.g., TAVV (Token Authentication Verification Value)) based on the plan identifier associated with a plan selected by the user. The user device can provide the cryptogram along with a token to the network processing computer via the resource provider computer in an authorization request message. The network processing computer can determine the plan identifier from the cryptogram, which allows the network processing computer to determine which plan the user selected. In some embodiments, this does not expand the size of the authorization request message to include additional data.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other embodiments, the network processing computer can assign a plan identifier to each plan that the user is eligible for. The network processing computer can provide the plan identifiers to the service provider computer. For example, a user may be associated with (e.g., qualified for) five different plans. The network processing computer can provide the plan identifiers for the five plans to the service provider computer. The network processing computer may also provide plan metadata for each plan to the service provider computer. The service provider computer can then store the plan identifiers and associated metadata onto the user device. During an interaction, after a user selects a plan, the user device can determine the plan identifier associated with a plan selected by a user. The user device can provide the plan identifier to the network processing computer in a cryptogram that will be sent in the authorization request message. The user device can then provide a token associated with user credentials to the resource provider computer, which can generate and provide an authorization request message for the interaction to the network processing computer. The network processing computer can then determine the plan identifier of the plan that the user selected from the cryptogram. As noted above, the plan identifier or plan information associated with the plan identifier may be provided to the authorizing entity computer via an API or via the authorization request message.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a system <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the disclosure.

A fifth user interface <b>710</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> includes a notification to the user that indicates that the resource provider computer <b>604</b> has submitted the authorization request message to the authorizing entity computer <b>612</b>. For example, the fifth user interface <b>710</b> includes a loading icon and a notification of &#x201c;authorizing interaction.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">At step <b>654</b>, after receiving the authorization request message from the resource provider computer <b>604</b>, the transport computer <b>608</b> can provide the authorization request message to the network processing computer <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">At step <b>656</b>, after receiving the authorization request message, the network processing computer <b>610</b> can obtain a user credential associated with the token. For example, the network processing computer <b>610</b> can detokenize the token to determine the user credential (e.g., a PAN). In some embodiments, the network processing computer <b>610</b> can detokenize the token in conjunction with a token provider computer (not shown) as described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments, the network processing computer <b>610</b> may have previously determined the plan identifier during step <b>646</b> and stored the plan identifier in association with user and/or user device <b>602</b> identifying data (e.g., a user identifier, a user device identifier, the token, etc.). In such a case, at step <b>658</b>, the network processing computer <b>610</b> can retrieve the plan identifier from memory (or a database).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">At step <b>660</b>, after obtaining the plan identifier of the selected plan, the network processing computer <b>610</b> can modify the authorization request message to comprise the user credential and the plan identifier or plan information associated with the plan identifier, as described above. Or, the plan identifier and/or plan information associated with the plan identifier can be sent to the authorizing entity computer outside of the authorization process (e.g., via an API).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">At step <b>662</b>, the network processing computer <b>610</b> can transmit the modified authorization request message to the authorizing entity computer <b>612</b> for authorization. The network processing computer <b>610</b> can provide the modified authorization request message to the authorizing entity computer <b>612</b> over any suitable communication channel.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Steps <b>664</b>-<b>676</b> are similar to steps <b>560</b>-<b>572</b> and will not be repeated here in their entirety. At step <b>676</b>, after the resource provider computer <b>604</b> receives the authorization response message from the network processing computer <b>610</b> via the transport computer <b>608</b>, the resource provider computer <b>604</b> can provide an indication of whether or not the interaction is authorized to the user via the webpage accessed and displayed by the user device <b>602</b>. For example, the sixth user interface <b>712</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> includes a webpage that indicates that the interaction is authorized.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of techniques <b>800</b> for post-interaction installment processing according to some embodiments. A network computer <b>810</b> (substantially similar to the network processing computer <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may manage installment plan processing for entities such as a user <b>802</b> (e.g., via user device <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a resource provider computer <b>806</b> (substantially similar to the resource provider computer <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a transport computer <b>808</b>, and an authorizing computer <b>812</b> (substantially similar to the authorizing entity computer <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">At step <b>820</b>A, the resource provider computer <b>806</b> may transmit, to the transport computer <b>808</b>, a settlement request message. The settlement request message may request funding for the total amount of an interaction. The settlement request message may further include additional data such as interaction data (e.g., timestamp, transaction identifier, etc.) and/or an installment plan identifier. At step <b>820</b>B, the transport computer <b>808</b> may transmit the settlement request message to the network computer <b>810</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The transport computer <b>808</b> may receive the settlement request message and analyze data therein (e.g., installment plan identifier). The transport computer <b>808</b> may identify that an installment plan is associated with the settlement request. At step <b>820</b>C, the transport computer <b>808</b> may transmit the settlement request message to the authorizing computer <b>812</b>, which is received by the authorizing computer at step <b>820</b>D.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Responsive to receiving the settlement request message, the authorizing computer <b>812</b> may analyze the settlement request message and determine to proceed with settlement. At step <b>822</b>A, the authorizing computer <b>812</b> may transmit a settlement response message, for the total amount, to the network computer. At step <b>822</b>B, the network computer <b>810</b> may transmit the settlement response message to the transport computer <b>808</b>. At step <b>822</b>C, the transport computer <b>808</b> may transmit the settlement response message to the resource provider computer <b>806</b>. At step <b>822</b>D, the resource provider computer <b>806</b> may receive the settlement response message. Settlement may be completed for the full amount. For example, if the user <b>802</b> purchased a resource (e.g., a television) that cost $699.00, then the authorizing computer <b>812</b> can settle with the network computer <b>810</b> and the transport computer <b>808</b> for the same cost, $699.00.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">At step <b>824</b>, the network computer <b>810</b> (or the authorizing computer <b>812</b>) may set up an installment record. In some embodiments, the installment record may be a temporary account. The temporary account may be a virtual account (e.g., the virtual account may exist as a ledger for record keeping purposes). Alternatively, or additionally, the temporary account may be a prepaid account (e.g., the prepaid account may be loaded with funds and limited to the funds loaded). The installment record may be stored to the network computer <b>810</b> in association with the installment plan identifier and associated interaction data. For example, the network computer may create a temporary account for the installment plan and an identifier for the temporary account for the installment plan. The network computer may record information including the total amount for the installment plan/interaction to the temporary account associated with the account identifier. Thus, the installment record may be a temporary account with a starting balance of the total amount.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">At step <b>826</b>, the network computer <b>810</b> may process an installment. This may occur periodically subject to some condition (e.g., receiving an API call from the authorizing computer and/or determining that an installment time has occurred). In some embodiments, occurrence of an installment time may be when a particular time has elapsed since the last installment and/or since the interaction (e.g., for monthly installments, the network computer <b>810</b> may determine that the installment time has occurred when one month has elapsed since the day the transaction was authorized). In some embodiments, the installment time may be computed based on the installment period (e.g., begin processing monthly installment after two weeks to account for messaging and fund transfer times).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">At step <b>828</b>, the authorizing computer <b>812</b> may process the installment and send a statement to the user <b>802</b>. For example, based on information received from the network computer <b>810</b>, the authorizing computer <b>812</b> may determine that the user <b>802</b> should be charged the full amount of the transaction, but billed an installment amount of $133 on the statement. The authorizing computer <b>812</b> may prepare a statement with the installment amount and send it to the user <b>802</b>. The user may receive and view the statement for the installment at step <b>830</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Embodiments of the disclosure have a number of advantages. For example, embodiments provide for an efficient manner of indicate to a network processing computer that a current interaction is an interaction that will utilize a plan as well as details regarding the plan. Currently, interactions between a resource provider and a user include various messages of standard length. Embodiments provide for a method in which additional information, such as the plan identifier can be provided to from a resource provider computer to a network processing computer, without expanding the length of the messages or adding additional messages between entities. This is due to the cryptogram being generated using the plan identifier of the selected plan.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Furthermore, during a typical interaction, if a plan is to be selected and implemented, user is notified of available plans after the resource provider computer submits interaction data for authorization. For example, the network processing computer receives the authorization request message including the interaction data for authorization of the interaction from the resource provider computer. The network processing computer can then reach out to the user to query the user on whether or not the user wants to select a plan, thus slowing down the processing of the interaction due to messaging and waiting for user input. Embodiments provide for fewer messages being sent during processing of the authorization request message, thus reducing the time taken to authorize the interaction.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Although the steps in the flowcharts and process flows described above are illustrated or described in a specific order, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may include methods that have the steps in different orders.
