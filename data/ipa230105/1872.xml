The present finding is situated in the field of accessories and/or safety devices destined for controlling the presence of children inside automobiles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The problem of parents' accidentally abandoning/leaving children/infants inside motor vehicles is well-known and quite widespread. Such situations sometimes turn tragic, when the parents do not realize in time that they have left their infant/child in the car. In order to attempt to resolve such problem, over time many different safety systems have been designed. A first example of a known safety system is described in the document US 2003/0122662. Such safety system comprises a sensor associated with the buckles or with the systems for locking the belts of the child's child seat; the sensor is configured to send, to a dedicated control unit, a positive warning signal indicative of the presence of the child on the child seat. The sensor continues to detect the locking of the belts and to communicate such state to the safety system: if the safety system does not receive the positive signal emitted by the sensor, an alarm unit provides for emitting an acoustic alarm signal. The safety system is also provided with a sensor for detecting the distance lying between the keys of the driver and the child seat, so that when such distance exceeds a preset maximum limit, the alarm unit emits a signal adapted to remind the driver that the child is still situated inside the passenger compartment. The safety system is also provided with a sensor for detecting the state of the driver door. Such sensor is activated when the door of the driver is opened. The alarm unit is arranged for emitting a signal when the door of the driver is opened, the child seat of the child is fastened and the distance between the driver and the child seat is greater than the limit distance.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A second example of a safety system is described in the document US 2005/0253692. In particular, such document refers to a safety system which provides for a weight sensor capable of detecting the presence of a child on a child seat placed inside a vehicle. When the child is placed inside the vehicle on the weight sensor, his/her presence is detected. When the driver turns off the vehicle, an alarm unit emits a signal relative to the presence of the child inside the vehicle. The removal of the child from his/her position disables the weight sensor, consequently deactivating the safety system. A third example of a safety system that uses a weight sensor with switch is illustrated in the document U.S. Pat. No. 7,714,737. Together with the weight sensor, the safety system provides for a fastening sensor capable of verifying the locking of the belts of the driver. The sensor is constituted by two separate coupling portions, respectively configured for being respectively associated with the fastening tab and with the fastening buckle of the safety belt. The first and the second coupling portions are configured for cooperating with each other such that the sensor can signal to a control unit the locking condition of the belt, i.e. the condition for engaging the tab in the fastening buckle of the belt. When the safety system detects the absence of the driver, intended as the unfastened condition of the safety belt and the presence of the child on the child seat, it emits an alarm signal relative to the abandonment of the child inside the vehicle. Further examples of safety systems are for example described in the U.S. Pat. No. 8,063,788, in the Italian national patent application IT M120112341A1 and in the Chinese patent application No. CN 110435584A. Even if the known safety systems allow a control of the presence of children inside the vehicle, the Applicant has verified that such known systems are not free of drawbacks and that they can be improved with regard to various aspects, mainly in relation to the complexity of such systems, to the costs, to the ease and simplicity of installation and applicability, as well as to the possible reuse of the same with other child seats or vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object the present invention is therefore that of resolving at least one of the drawbacks and/or limitations of the preceding solutions. A first objective of the present invention is to provide an anti-abandonment system and an effective signaling/warning process, capable of readily warning of a potentially hazardous situation relative to an infant/child present inside a vehicle, hence allowing the prevention of the abandonment thereof. Another object the present invention is to provide an anti-abandonment system that is simple and inexpensive; in particular, one object of the present invention is to provide an all-purpose anti-abandonment system, easy to install and apply, on any vehicle without requiring the intervention of specialized technicians.

The anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> can be easily installed on any one car and on any restraining device R (e.g. a child seat or a pod) for a child and/or an infant. In particular, as will be better described hereinbelow, the anti-abandonment system is associable, on one side, with a restraining device R and, on the other side, with the safety belt S of the driver of a vehicle (automobile). For better comprehension of the structure and operation of the anti-abandonment system <b>1</b>, a brief description of the components of the safety belt S and of the restraining device R is reported. With regard to the restraining device R, this comprises a predefined seating or abutment area R<b>1</b> dedicated to the accommodation of the infant and/or child; the restraining device R is generally fixed to passenger seats P, generally but not necessary rear, of the vehicle by means of at least one safety belt or it can be directly fixed to the structure of the vehicle by means of the international standardized fixing system, isofix. With regard instead to the safety belt S, as is known, this is constituted by a fastening buckle F associated with an anchorage point</p><p id="p-0146" num="0242">A of the vehicle: the fastening buckle F comprises a block F<b>1</b> having a compartment F<b>3</b> inside which a locking mechanism is housed F<b>4</b> configured to receive in engagement an inserting portion L<b>1</b> of a fastening tab L. In detail, the block F<b>1</b> comprises a slot F<b>2</b> configured to allow the insertion of the inserting portion L<b>1</b> of the fastening tab L in the compartment F<b>3</b> for housing the block F<b>1</b> in order to allow the engagement of said fastening tab L with the locking mechanism F<b>4</b> of the fastening buckle F. The fastening tab L is stably carried by a webbing C designed to restrain the body of the driver.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0243">In detail, the fastening buckle F is configured to cooperate with the fastening tab L in order to define:<ul id="ul0066" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0066-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0067" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0067-0001" num="0244">at least one fastened condition of the safety belt during which the fastening tab L and the fastening buckle F are stably engaged with each other,</li>        <li id="ul0067-0002" num="0245">at least one unfastened condition of the safety belt during which the fastening tab L and the fastening buckle F are uncoupled.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0148" num="0246">The anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> comprises at least one first sensor <b>2</b> associable with a restraining device R and configured to emit a signal representative of the presence or not of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R. In detail, the first sensor <b>2</b> comprises at least one switch or micro-switch or button or a weight sensor configured to detect the presence and/or the weight of the child and/or infant resting on a predefined area of the restraining device R dedicated to the accommodation of the infant and/or child.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0247">In detail, the anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> comprises a seating device <b>7</b>, schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, placed in abutment against the predefined area of accommodation of the child and/or infant of a child seat. The seating device is then associable with the restraining device R and configured to be positioned on a predefined seating area of the restraining device R aimed to accommodate the child and/or infant; the first sensor <b>2</b> is associated with the seating device <b>7</b> in a manner such that following the positioning of the child and/or infant on the predefined area of the restraining device R, the first sensor <b>2</b> can be actuated in a manner such that the sensor <b>2</b> can send a signal representative of the presence of the child and/or infant on the restraining device R. In still more detail, the seating device <b>7</b> comprises a casing <b>8</b> in turn having at least one base <b>9</b> and at least one cover <b>10</b> engaged with the base <b>9</b>. The base <b>9</b> and cover <b>10</b> are relatively movable with respect to each other between a close position and a spaced position. In detail, the base <b>9</b> and the cover <b>10</b> are configured to stably remain in the spaced position: base <b>9</b> and cover <b>10</b> are configured to be arranged in the close position in the condition in which a child and/or an infant is arranged on the seating device <b>7</b> positioned on the predefined seating area of the child and/or infant of the restraining device R. The first sensor <b>2</b>&#x2014;for example comprising a switch or a button&#x2014;is interposed between the base <b>9</b> and the cover <b>10</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>) and is configured to emit the signal representative of the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R in the close position of base <b>9</b> and cover <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0248">In fact, when the child and/or infant is rested on the seating device <b>7</b>, the weight of the child exerts a thrust action on the seating device <b>7</b> which allows the base <b>9</b> and the cover <b>10</b> to pass from the stable spaced position to the close position: the thrust action of the child (or infant) generates the relative approaching movement of base <b>9</b> and cover <b>10</b> which is detected by the first sensor <b>2</b> which, in such condition, is configured to send the signal representative of the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R. The casing <b>8</b> can comprise an external covering comprising at least one padded portion adapted to define a cushion; the padded portion at least partially encloses the base <b>9</b> and at least partially encloses the cover <b>10</b> of the casing <b>8</b> such to define a comfortable seat for the child and/or infant. The anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> can comprise only one first sensor <b>2</b> or a plurality of first sensors <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>. For example, one or more of said first sensors <b>2</b> can be associated with a seating device <b>7</b> and for example housed inside the casing <b>8</b> in a manner such to be able to effectively detect one or more relative displacements between base <b>9</b> and cover <b>10</b> of the casing <b>8</b>. Of course, it may also be possible to equip the anti-abandonment system with two or more seating devices <b>7</b> such that the anti-abandonment system can be associated with multiple child seats and/or pods arranged inside the vehicle; each of said seating devices can be associated with one or more of said first sensors <b>2</b>. In detail, each of the seating devices <b>7</b> of the anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of first sensors placed in interposition between the base <b>9</b> and the cover <b>10</b> of the casing <b>8</b>, as is illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. In detail, each seating device <b>7</b> can comprise a printed circuit placed inside the casing <b>8</b> and to which the at least one first sensor <b>2</b> (optionally the plurality of first sensors <b>2</b>) is connected. Analog electronic components can also be provided, for example one or more electrical resistors, connected to the printed circuit and to the at least one first sensor <b>2</b>: the analog components are configured to receive the signal emitted by the first sensor and vary it in the desired manner. For example, such analog components can filter and modulate the signal of the first sensor <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0249">The first sensor <b>2</b> can be electronically power supplied by a battery and/or a supercapacitor, e.g. connected to the printed circuit. Alternatively or additionally, the first sensor <b>2</b> is configured to be electrically connected to a power supply source of the vehicle, for example to the control unit or to the battery of a car. In a further alternative, the first sensor <b>2</b> can be power supplied by the control unit <b>50</b>. In the latter two described configurations, the anti-abandonment system can still be provided with a battery and/or a supercapacitor connected to the first sensor (e.g. by means of the printed circuit): the battery and/or the supercapacitor can act as electric energy accumulators in a manner such that, in the absence of power supply by the vehicle and/or by the control unit <b>50</b>, the first sensor can still be electrically power supplied and have an autonomy sufficient for generating and sending the signal to the control unit. The anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> also comprises a control unit <b>50</b>, schematized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, connected to the first sensor <b>2</b>. The control unit <b>50</b> is configured to receive the signal emitted by the first sensor <b>2</b>, processing it, and determining (as a function of said signal) the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R. The first sensor <b>2</b> can be connected by means of a wired circuit to the control unit <b>50</b>; nevertheless, it may be possible to use a wireless transmission system (e.g. Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) for transmitting the signal emitted by the first sensor <b>2</b> to the control unit <b>50</b>. The first sensor <b>2</b> can be connected directly to the control unit <b>50</b>; alternatively, the first sensor <b>2</b> is connected to the printed circuit which is in turn connected by means of wired circuit to the control unit <b>50</b>. As specified above, at least one analog electronic component can be associated with the printed circuit and placed in connection interposition between the first sensor and the control unit: the analog electronic component is configured to receive and vary the signal emitted by the first sensor <b>2</b>. The control unit <b>50</b> is configured to receive the signal emitted by the first sensor <b>2</b> and varied by the analog electronic component and determine, as a function of the signal emitted by the first sensor <b>2</b>, the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R. The control unit <b>50</b> can be configured to receive the signal emitted by the first sensor <b>2</b> and varied by the analog component such to be able to determine, for example: the number of first sensors <b>2</b> present, the number of first sensors <b>2</b> actuated, identify the first sensor actuated, identify the number of seating devices <b>7</b>, the number of seating devices actuated, identify which seating device has been actuated. Of course it may be possible to arrange, inside each seating device, a digital electronic board provided with microprocessor and connected to the first sensors <b>2</b>; the microprocessor is configured to process the signal received by the first sensors and send a digital signal to the control unit <b>50</b> which can be configured to process said electronic signal for the determination of the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device. Of course, also in the event that there is a digital electronic board, the control unit <b>50</b> can be configured to determine, for example: the number of first sensors <b>2</b> present, the number of first sensors <b>2</b> actuated, identify the first sensor actuated, identify the number of seating devices <b>7</b>, the number of seating devices actuated, identify which seating device was actuated. In the event that there is a printed circuit or a digital electronic board, these can be power supplied by a battery <b>5</b> arranged in the casing <b>8</b> or they can be connected, by means of wired circuit, to a power supply source of the vehicle, for example to the control unit or to the battery of a car or to the control unit <b>50</b>. Alternatively, the anti-abandonment system can comprise a battery <b>5</b> or a backup supercapacitor placed inside the casing and connected to the first sensor <b>2</b>, optionally to the printed circuit or to the digital electronic board, and at the same time have a wired connection circuit that connects the first sensor <b>2</b>, optionally to the printed circuit or to the digital electronic board, to a power supply source of the vehicle, e.g. to the control unit or to the battery of a car. In this manner, the power supply is mainly provided by the car, when turned on, while the battery or the supercapacitor possibly power supply the first sensor <b>2</b> when the car is turned off.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0250">As is visible for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> also comprises at least one second sensor <b>3</b> associable with the safety belt S of the driver of the vehicle. The second sensor <b>3</b> is configured to emit a signal representative of a fastened or unfastened condition of the safety belt S of the driver. Also the second sensor <b>3</b> is connected to the control unit <b>50</b> which is configured to determine, as a function of the signal emitted by the second sensor <b>3</b>, the fastened condition or the unfastened condition of the safety belt S. The control unit <b>50</b> is configured in order to define an alarm condition in the event that the control unit <b>50</b> itself determines the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R and at the same time the unfastened condition of the safety belt S of the driver. Actually, the control unit is configured to implement a control procedure during which the unit <b>50</b> is configured to:<ul id="ul0068" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0068-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0069" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0069-0001" num="0251">determine, as a function of the signal emitted by the first sensor <b>2</b>, the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R,</li>        <li id="ul0069-0002" num="0252">determine, as a function of the signal emitted by the second sensor <b>3</b>, the fastened condition or the unfastened condition of the safety belt,</li>        <li id="ul0069-0003" num="0253">define an alarm condition in the event that the control unit <b>50</b> determines the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device and at the same time the unfastened condition of the safety belt of the driver.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0153" num="0254">In detail, the control unit, during the performance of the control procedure, is configured in order to define the alarm condition if the same control unit <b>50</b> determines the passage from the fastened condition to the unfastened condition of the safety belt S of the driver, during the determination of the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0255">The control unit <b>50</b> can have an active condition following the simultaneous determination of the presence of a child and/or an infant on the restraining device R and the determination of the fastened condition of the safety belt of the driver: the control unit <b>50</b>, during the active condition, is configured to perform said control procedure adapted to define the alarm condition. The control unit can also have a deactivated condition, during which the same is not configured to perform the control procedure; the deactivated condition is defined in the event that the presence of a child and/or an infant is not determined by the control unit on the restraining device R. Indeed, due to the active or deactivated condition, the control unit <b>50</b> is capable of excluding situations in which it is not necessary to carry out the control procedure, for example in the absence of children and/or infants in the vehicle. The deactivated condition of the control unit <b>50</b> can also be commanded by a deactivation button connected to the control unit <b>50</b>: the button is configured to emit a command signal to send to said control unit <b>50</b> in order to command the temporary deactivation condition to the latter. For example, the temporary deactivation of the control unit <b>50</b> can be useful if it is necessary to make a temporary stop, for example for refueling the car, for which it is not required to execute the control procedure for warning of a potentially hazardous situation.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0256">As is visible from the enclosed figures, the second sensor <b>3</b> is associable with only one between said fastening tab L and said fastening buckle F of the safety belt S of the driver, while on the other between said fastening buckle F and said fastening tab L, the second sensor <b>3</b> is not present. In other words, the second sensor is associated with only one between the fastening buckle and the fastening tab of the belt, such that on the other between said tab and fastening buckle there is no component of the second sensor <b>3</b>. The second sensor <b>3</b> is distinct from the safety belt S and it is the only component of the anti-abandonment system dedicated to emitting the signal representative of the fastened condition or of the unfastened condition of the safety belt. On the other hand, the control unit <b>50</b> is configured to determine the fastened or unfastened condition of the safety belt only by means of the signal emitted by the second sensor <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0257">Illustrated in the enclosed figures, in a non-limiting manner, is a configuration in which the second sensor <b>3</b> is carried together with the fastening buckle (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>): on the fastening tab L, there is no component present that is ascribable to the second sensor <b>3</b>. In such configuration, the second sensor <b>3</b> is configured to directly detect the safety belt S of the driver and in particular directly the fastening tab L: on the fastening tab L, there are no additional components of the second sensor <b>3</b> which can communicate with components installed on the buckle. Indeed, the second sensor directly senses the presence of the fastening tab: the control unit processes the signal emitted by the second sensor and interprets the direct detection of the fastening tab as fastened condition of the safety belt. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the operation of the second sensor <b>3</b> is schematically illustrated.

The holding element <b>40</b><i>b </i>has an elongated body extending along a predetermined longitudinal profile between a first end portion, in which it is engaged with the support <b>40</b><i>a </i>, and a second end portion, in which it is engaged with a locking system <b>42</b>. In the embodiment of the coupling element <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the elongated body has a predetermined number of locking teeth <b>43</b> that are separate and spaced from each other along the longitudinal extension of the elongated body and emerging transverse to the latter, defining a respective protuberance: each locking tooth <b>43</b> is then configured to engage the locking system <b>42</b> at a respective protuberance. It is also useful to observe that the elongated body has at least one seat, defined in interposition between two protuberances that are adjacent to each other, configured to house a hook <b>44</b> of the locking system <b>42</b>, in a manner such to define, in the second operating position of the holding element <b>40</b><i>b </i>, the stable engagement between the elongated body and the locking system <b>42</b>.

It is also useful to observe that the engagement between the elongated body and the locking system <b>42</b> allows the holding element <b>40</b><i>b </i>to engage the block F<b>1</b>.

In the embodiment of the coupling element <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the locking system <b>2</b> can instead have an engagement surface, e.g. made of Velcro, configured to constrain the respective engagement surface of the elongated body. The coupling element <b>4</b> can for example be at least partially made of at least one of the following materials: silicone, rubber, plastic, aluminum, steel, iron.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0266">It is useful to observe that the second sensor <b>3</b> is configured to be placed in proximity to the slot F<b>2</b> of the block F<b>1</b> in a manner such that the same second sensor <b>3</b> can directly detect the presence of the fastening tab L, optionally directly detect the presence of the inserting portion L<b>1</b>; the signal of the second sensor <b>3</b> is thus representative of a position of the inserting portion L<b>1</b> of the fastening tab L in the compartment of the block F<b>1</b> and hence of an engagement condition of the insertion portion L<b>1</b> with the locking mechanism F<b>4</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) of the block F<b>1</b> to define said fastened condition of the safety belt. Illustrated in the enclosed figures, in a non-limiting manner, is a second sensor placed outside the compartment of the block in a manner such that the same sensor <b>3</b> can detect, from outside the block F<b>1</b>, the presence of the fastening tab L. Of course, it may be possible to arrange the second sensor <b>3</b> inside the compartment F<b>3</b> of the block F<b>1</b> in a manner such that the second sensor <b>3</b> can detect the presence of the tab L when placed inside the block F<b>1</b> in coupling to the blocking device F<b>4</b>. Of course, the positioning outside the block F<b>1</b> simplifies the installation of the anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> and renders the user autonomous in the arrangement of the same.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0267">As is visible for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the coupling element <b>4</b> can comprise one or more positioning elements <b>4</b><i>c </i>configured to allow the quick and correct mounting of the coupling element <b>4</b> on the fastening buckle F: in this manner, it is possible to arrange the sensor <b>3</b>, carried by the coupling element, in the correct position for detecting the fastening tab L.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0268">The anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> can comprise one or more sensors <b>3</b>. In the enclosed figures, an anti-abandonment system comprising two second sensors <b>3</b> is also illustrated; it may be possible to provide for only one second sensor <b>3</b> (e.g. only one emitter/receiver sensor) or a number of second sensors <b>3</b> higher than two. The second sensor <b>3</b> comprises at least one selected in the group between: an optical sensor, an infrared optical sensor, a capacitive sensor, a magnetic sensor, an ultrasound transducer, a micro-switch, a micro-button. As for the first sensor <b>2</b>, also the second sensor <b>3</b> is connected, by means of a wired circuit, to the control unit <b>50</b>; nevertheless, it may be possible to use a wireless transmission system (e.g. Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) for transmitting the signal emitted by the second sensor <b>3</b> to the control unit <b>50</b>. The second sensor <b>3</b> can be directly connected to the control unit <b>50</b>. It is useful to observe that the deactivation condition of the control unit <b>50</b> can also be commanded by a deactivation button <b>70</b>, connected to the control unit <b>50</b> and configured to emit a predetermined number of command signals in order to command a temporary deactivation condition to the latter. For example, the temporary deactivation of the control unit <b>50</b> can be useful in the event that it is necessary to make a temporary stop, for example for refueling the car, for which it is not required to execute the control procedure for warning of a potentially hazardous situation.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0269">In particular, each command signal emitted by the deactivation button <b>70</b> is representative of a minimum duration value of the temporary deactivation condition. Indeed a user, by actuating the deactivation button <b>70</b>, can set the duration of the temporary deactivation condition, which can be comprised between <b>30</b>s and <b>600</b>s. The minimum duration value can take on a predetermined constant value, for example equal to <b>30</b>s, equal to the minimum duration of the temporary deactivation condition. It is useful to observe that the duration of the temporary deactivation condition can be increased following each successive activation of the deactivation button <b>70</b>, by an amount equal to the minimum duration value. In other words, the duration of the deactivation condition, following a first actuation of the deactivation button <b>70</b>, takes on the minimum duration value, and it can be increased by an amount equal to the minimum duration value as a function of the number of actuations of the deactivation button <b>70</b>. The latter can thus be configured to emit a respective command signal for each actuation of the button performed by the user. The control unit <b>50</b>, following the reception of said command signals, is thus configured in order to define the temporary deactivation condition, determining the duration thereof. It is in fact useful to note that the control unit <b>50</b> can comprise at least one memory buffer configured to keep track of the command signals received from the same control unit <b>50</b>. In detail, the memory buffer is configured to store at least one minimum duration value of the temporary deactivation condition. Following the detection of a plurality of command signals by the control unit <b>50</b>, the buffer is configured to store each minimum duration value and perform the sum of the latter, in a manner such to define a threshold value representative of the total duration of the temporary deactivation condition set by the user. The control unit <b>50</b> can be configured to send the threshold signal to a timer <b>71</b>, the latter adapted to emit a timeout signal, as a function of the threshold signal, and representative of the end of the temporary deactivation condition. The control unit <b>50</b> is therefore configured to detect the timeout signal emitted by the timer <b>71</b> and subsequently the reception of the latter, restarting the execution of the control procedure. As mentioned above, the anti-abandonment system can further have at least one timer <b>71</b> connected to the control unit <b>50</b>, configured to detect the threshold signal and perform a count procedure comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0072" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0072-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0073" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0073-0001" num="0270">increasing a count value,</li>        <li id="ul0073-0002" num="0271">comparing said count value with the threshold signal,</li>        <li id="ul0073-0003" num="0272">emitting the timeout signal following the verification of the equivalence between the count value and the threshold signal,</li>        <li id="ul0073-0004" num="0273">resetting the count value.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0167" num="0274">In other words, the timer <b>71</b>, by increasing the count value by a predetermined amount, e.g. equal to 1s, is configured to keep track of the passage of time. It is useful to observe that the count procedure executed by the timer <b>71</b> has a time duration equal to the duration of the temporary deactivation condition. The timer <b>71</b>, following the emission of the timeout signal, thus defines the end of the temporary deactivation condition, allowing the control unit to restart the execution of the control procedure and detect possible alarm conditions, detecting the signals emitted by the first and by the second sensors <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. In detail, the control unit <b>50</b> comprises an electronic board <b>51</b> and at least one microprocessor <b>52</b> connected to the electronic board <b>51</b>. The second sensor <b>3</b>, optionally also the first sensor <b>2</b>, is connected to the electronic board <b>51</b> of the control unit <b>50</b> which is configured to receive the signal from the second sensor and to transmit it to the microprocessor <b>52</b> which is configured to perform the control procedure. The electronic board <b>51</b> is connected to a power supply of the vehicle, for example the battery of the car or the control unit. In particular, following the connection of the electronic board <b>51</b> to the control unit, the control unit <b>50</b> can be configured to detect a starting signal emitted by the vehicle, as well as determine a driving condition of the vehicle by means of the reception of the starting signal. The electronic board <b>51</b> is also electrically connected to a battery <b>5</b> and/or to a supercapacitor configured to electrically power supply the electronic board <b>51</b> and consequently the microprocessor <b>52</b> and the second sensor <b>3</b>. In the event that the first sensor <b>2</b> is connected to the electronic board <b>51</b>, the latter is configured to electrically power supply also said first sensor <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0275">In detail, and as illustrated in the enclosed figures, the control unit <b>50</b> is carried directly by the coupling element <b>4</b>; in particular, the coupling element <b>4</b> comprises a respective casing defining a compartment <b>12</b>, inside which the electronic board <b>51</b>, the microprocessor <b>52</b> and the battery or the supercapacitor of the control unit <b>50</b> are housed. The second sensor <b>3</b> can also be housed at least partially in the compartment <b>12</b> of the coupling element <b>4</b>. Illustrated in the enclosed figures, in a non-limiting manner, is a control unit <b>50</b> carried by the first portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the coupling element <b>4</b>. It may also be possible to arrange the control unit in association with the second portion <b>4</b><i>b </i>or separated from said coupling element <b>4</b>. As schematized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> also comprises at least one emitter <b>6</b> connected to the control unit <b>50</b>, for example by means of a wired circuit, and configured to emit at least one from among an acoustic signal, a haptic signal and a visual signal; the control unit <b>50</b>, following the definition of the alarm condition, is configured to command the emitter <b>6</b> to emit at least one among said acoustic signal, haptic signal and visual signal to warn of a potentially hazardous situation to the driver relative to the presence of an infant/child inside a vehicle. Indeed, the emitter <b>6</b> represents the element of the anti-abandonment system adapted to signal the alarm condition. It is also useful to observe that the emitter can be configured to emit at least one among an acoustic signal, haptic signal and visual signal, specific for any one of the conditions detectable by the control unit <b>50</b>. In particular, the emitter <b>6</b> is configured to emit a plurality of acoustic signals that are at least partially different from each other, each of which representative of an operating condition of the anti-abandonment system detectable by the control unit <b>50</b>. Indeed, the control unit <b>50</b> is configured to command the emitter <b>6</b> to reproduce a specific acoustic signal for each from among the active condition, the deactivated condition, the alarm condition, the inactivity condition and the driving condition. The emitter <b>6</b> can also be associated with the coupling element <b>4</b> or it can be defined by an element separate from the coupling element <b>4</b> and from the seating device <b>7</b> positionable inside the vehicle in a zone adapted to allow the effective signaling to the user regarding the alarm condition. For example, the emitter <b>6</b> can be positioned at the dashboard of a motor vehicle or at the buckle F. Alternatively, the control unit <b>50</b> can be connected, by means of wired circuit, to the horn of the car and configured to command the activation of the horn and/or of the emergency lights following the definition of the alarm condition.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0276">The control unit <b>50</b> can be configured to command the activation of the emitter <b>6</b> and/or of the horn of the car immediately after having defined the alarm condition; the control unit <b>50</b> can also be configured to send the command signal to the emitter <b>6</b> and/or to the horn and/or to the emergency lights of the car after a predetermined time period, possibly in two time settable by the user by means of the same control unit <b>4</b>, by the determination of the alarm condition. In this manner, the control unit <b>50</b> could give time to the driver to unfasten the safety belt S and remove the child and/or infant from the vehicle before the emitter and/or the horn and/or the emergency lights of the car are activated. For example, the control unit p<b>50</b> can be configured to determine the alarm condition and command the emitter, by means of sending a first command signal, to emit a first optical, acoustic and/or haptic warning signal and after a certain time period, if the presence of the child on the restraining device R is still detected, sending a command signal to the emitter, for the emission of a second alarm signal (still of optical, acoustic and/or haptic type) in order to signal the abandonment of the child and/or infant in the vehicle. Indeed, the control unit <b>50</b> generates a first optical, acoustic and/or haptic alarm as soon as the safety belt of the driver is released, in order to give the time necessary for the driver to take the child, and thereafter&#x2014;if the alarm condition persists&#x2014;in a second step activating the actual alarm (for example given by the activation of horn and emergency lights) which signals the abandonment of the child and/or infant in the vehicle. The control unit <b>50</b> can also be configured to deactivate the alarm condition as soon as there is no detected presence of the child and/or infant on the restraining device R. In this manner, the control unit <b>50</b>&#x2014;due to the delay in the activation of the emitter <b>6</b> and/or of the horn of the car and together with the possibility to deactivate the alarm condition in the event that the child and/or infant is picked up from the vehicle&#x2014;allows signaling only actually hazardous situations relative to the abandonment of a child and/or an infant inside the vehicle and preventing the activation of the emitter <b>6</b> and/or the horn and the emergency lights of the car in the case of brief stops or in the case of unfastening of the safety belt for the removal of the child from the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0277">The anti-abandonment system <b>1</b> can also comprise:<ul id="ul0074" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0074-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0075" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0075-0001" num="0278">at least one acoustic indicator (e.g. the emitter <b>6</b> and/or the horn of the car) connected to the control unit <b>50</b> and configured to emit at least one acoustic signal,</li>        <li id="ul0075-0002" num="0279">at least one mobile device configured to:        <ul id="ul0076" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0076-0001" num="0280">detect said acoustic signal,</li>            <li id="ul0076-0002" num="0281">following the detection of said acoustic signal, determine a hazardous condition,</li>            <li id="ul0076-0003" num="0282">following the determination of the hazardous condition, emit a warning signal.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0171" num="0283">Indeed, as mentioned above, the control unit <b>50</b> is configured to command the acoustic indicator, in particular the emitter <b>6</b>, to emit a specific acoustic signal as a function of the detected operating condition. The acoustic signal can thus vary following the detection of the active condition, the deactivated condition, the alarm condition, the inactivity condition and the driving condition. The mobile device can also comprise at least one microphone <b>101</b>, directly connected to a control unit <b>90</b> of the mobile device, and configured to detect the acoustic signal emitted by the emitter <b>6</b>. In particular, the microphone <b>101</b> is configured to detect an acoustic signal and send it to the control unit <b>90</b> of the mobile device in order to be analyzed. The mobile device can further comprise an internal memory <b>102</b> configured to store a predetermined number of reference signals, each of which corresponding to an acoustic signal reproducible by the emitter <b>6</b>. In particular, the internal memory <b>102</b>, as detailed below, is also configured to store a predetermined number of points of interest, each of which representative of a predetermined geographic position of the mobile device. The mobile device can further comprise a control unit <b>90</b> configured to perform an acoustic signal recognition procedure comprising at least one step of sampling the acoustic signal detected by the microphone. In particular, the step of sampling the acoustic signal allows converting the detected acoustic signal into a digital signal, which can be easily manipulated and analyzed. Indeed, the digitized signal can be analyzed regarding frequency such to be able to easily detect the acoustic tones of the signal and hence recognize if such signal corresponds to a known signal, for example corresponding to the reference signal. The recognition procedure can in fact comprise a step of comparing the sampled signal with a reference signal, which can in turn provide for the steps of:<ul id="ul0077" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0077-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0078" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0078-0001" num="0284">determining a frequency signal of the sampled signal,</li>        <li id="ul0078-0002" num="0285">determining a respective frequency signal of the reference signal,</li>        <li id="ul0078-0003" num="0286">determining a temporary signal equal to the difference between the frequency signal of the sampled signal and the frequency signal of the reference signal,</li>        <li id="ul0078-0004" num="0287">comparing the temporary signal with a predetermined interval of frequencies.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0172" num="0288">By converting the sampled signal and the reference signal into respective frequency signals, it is possible for the control unit <b>90</b> of the mobile device to perform the mathematical operations on the same, facilitating the recognition of the signals. Indeed, the recognition of the signal detected by the microphone can be reached by only analyzing the temporary signal, which comprises the information contained in the sampled signal and the reference signal. The control unit <b>90</b> of the mobile device is therefore configured to compare the temporary signal with a predetermined interval of frequencies. It is in fact useful to observe that said interval of frequencies is to be considered as a maximum interval within which the sampled signal, in order to be considered equal to the reference signal, must fall. In other words, the sampled signal, in order to be considered equal to the reference signal, can at most vary by a frequency comprised in the predetermined interval of frequencies.
