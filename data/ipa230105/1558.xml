Moreover, when a related-art hammer tool is used to strike the nail, it is necessary to hold the nail with one hand and hold the hammer tool with the other hand to position the nail and hammer it into the fixed location.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in the process of hammering the nail with the related-art hammer tool, the hand holding the nail is easily to be hit and work injury occurs. Moreover, when the fixed location is situated on a high position, the users are unable to see the location to position the nail. As a result, the nail may not be accurately fixed on the predetermined position by the hammer. This affects the convenience and operation of the hammer tool in use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above drawbacks, the inventor proposes this disclosure based on his expert knowledge and elaborate researches in order to solve the problems of related art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One object of this disclosure is to provide a hammer tool for positioning a duplex head nail.

As a result, the duplex head nail may be accurately fixed on the predetermined position to enhance the convenience and operation of use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the embodiment of this disclosure, a hammer tool is provided for positioning a duplex head nail with a first nail head and a second nail head. The hammer tool includes a hammer body, a hammer head and a necked section. The hammer body includes a front end and a rear end located oppositely, and a first abutting portion and a second abutting portion are disposed on the front end of the hammer body. The hammer head is connected to the front end of the hammer body. A first positioning groove is disposed correspondingly to the first abutting portion, and a second positioning groove is disposed correspondingly to the second abutting portion. The necked section is formed between the hammer body and the hammer head. The necked section is formed with a first accommodating space between the first abutting portion and the first positioning groove, and formed with a second accommodating space between the second abutting portion and the second positioning groove. The first nail head is optionally positioned in the first abutting portion or the second abutting portion, and the second nail head is located in the first accommodating space or the second accommodating space along with the positioning of the first nail head correspondingly.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Comparing to the related art, the hammer tool of this disclosure includes a first abutting portion and a second abutting portion disposed on opposite sides of the hammer body, and a first positioning groove and a second positioning groove are disposed on opposite sides of the hammer head. In additionally, the necked section is formed between the hammer body and the hammer head. The necked section is formed with a first accommodating space between the first abutting portion and the first positioning groove, and formed with a second accommodating space between the second abutting portion and the second positioning groove.
