Nail salon customers typically experience a number of inefficiencies such as long wait times and difficulty in deciding on colors and other finishes. Selection of a nail treatment frequently is not done until after arrival at a salon and often involves difficulties such as fumbling with mannequin hands, browsing through an overwhelming number of color and style options, or trying to select a finish without being able to see how the treatment would look on the customer's own hands before the treatment. Accordingly, systems for a more efficient and/or enjoyable customer experience are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The systems and methods of this disclosure each have several innovative aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope as expressed by the claims that follow, its more prominent features will now be discussed briefly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As disclosed herein, the systems and methods described may provide a social community of nail artists who display their designs and clients who discover them using augmented reality to try the nails on and book appointments. Advantageously, clients looking for nail treatments (e.g., individuals interested in manicures or pedicures) are able to take advantage of augmented reality (&#x201c;AR&#x201d;) nail detection technology that detects images of the user's hands and provides images of various artists work as the art would appear on the user's actual fingernails. Additionally, clients may book nail treatment appointments directly from the system (e.g., an application executing on a mobile device of a consumer) with a provider (e.g., the artist and/or another salon technician), such as directly from an image of artwork that the user desires.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As discussed below, the systems and methods described herein allow a user to simply glide their hand under a smart device and virtually sample freshly polished manicured nails in real-time from the options provided by salons, brands, retailers, and social media. (1) Consumers purchase products and (2) book appointments accompanied by their polish selection, (3) while brands and salons reach and retain new clients through data driven marketing-streamlining the process and transforming the industry by decreasing wait time in the chair, empowering salons with data to anticipate a client's service, and interactively engaging consumers: effectively increasing revenue.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, a system includes one or more client applications executable by respective communication devices, each communication device including one or more processors in communication with an image capture device, the one or more processors configured with processor-executable instructions included in the client application to perform operations including. The operations may also include receiving, from the image capture device, frames of image data obtained at the image capture device, the image data including a finger of a user. The operations may also include detecting, within individual frames of the image data, a fingernail region of the finger, the fingernail region including a plurality of pixels corresponding to an imaged fingernail of the image data. The operations may also include identifying, within subsequent frames of the image data, the fingernail region, where the fingernail region in subsequent frames is positioned differently than in previous frames based on movement of the image capture device and/or finger of the user. The operations may also include display, on a display of the communication device, augmented reality images including the subsequent frames of the image data overlaid with a virtual nail treatment occupying at least a portion of the one or more fingernail regions, where the augmented reality images depict movement of the finger and fingernail while maintaining the virtual nail treatment on the fingernail region, and an identifier of the virtual nail treatment, the identifier selectable to initiate communication with a scheduling application configured to schedule an appointment with a service provider of the virtual nail treatment. The operations may also include transmitting, in response to selection of the identifier, request information associated with the virtual nail treatment identification information. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the system may further include a server including one or more processors configured with processor-executable instructions to perform operations including receiving, via the network, the request information from the communication device; identifying, based at least in part on the request information, a service provider corresponding to the request; and transmitting, via the network, a response to the communication device, the response including provider information corresponding to the identified service provider.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the request information is associated with a request received from a user, at the communication device, to schedule an appointment corresponding to the displayed virtual nail treatment, and where the provider information identifies a service provider capable of providing a nail treatment corresponding to the virtual nail treatment. In some embodiments, the provider information further includes scheduling information indicative of one or more available appointment times of the service provider. In some embodiments, the one or more processors of the communication device are further configured with processor-executable instructions included in the client application to perform operations including: receiving, via a user interface of the communication device, a selection from the user of one of the one or more available appointment times of the service provider; and causing, at least in part, the server to send a scheduling request message to a service provider device associated with the service provider. In some embodiments, the request information is associated with a request received from a user, at the communication device, to purchase one or more products corresponding to the displayed virtual nail treatment, and where the provider information identifies a networked resource at which the one or more products are available for purchase.

For example, a user may browse Facebook and see a friend's post or advertisement regarding a nail design, or more generally, some artwork that the user feels would look nice as a nail design. The user may select the artwork and be redirected to the nail application to begin an augmented reality testing of one or more nail artwork designs and/or schedule treatments. In some embodiments, the social media website utilizes an API provided by the data center (e.g. the entity that coordinates the treatment booking process and provides augmented reality software to the users) so that the user can &#x201c;Touch to try-on&#x201d; a particular design team in social media by clicking on the design. For example, in one embodiment, in response to the user clicking on a design and social media (where the social media site has the API installed), an application installed on the user's device (e.g. the users smart phone), and account is created for the user, the user has the ability to view the design using augmented reality, and the user is able to book appointments for nail treatment, purchase products, and/or subscribe to services provided by the various service providers associated with the network.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0052">In addition to introducing consumers to the social nail design and consumption network via a strong social media presence, such as by leveraging online celebrity clients and nail artist influencers through product driven content featuring, other channels for introduction of consumers to the artwork and nail design network include providing free accounts to esthetician schools to integrate into their curriculum as early adopters, boots on the ground sales initiatives with top tier salon down approach, and beauty trade shows/nail magazines and online advertisements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0053">The method <b>300</b> begins at block <b>302</b>, for example, when a user opens an application such as the application <b>230</b> executing on a computing device <b>200</b> (e.g., the user device <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As noted above, a user may be introduced to the application and/or automatically redirected to the application (e.g., through an API executing on a social media site) via many different media channels and mediums.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0054">At block <b>304</b>, image data is received. For example, the user device <b>120</b> and/or an application executing on the user device <b>120</b> may receive image data from a camera <b>225</b> or other image capture device of the user device <b>120</b>. In various embodiments, the image data may be one or more single image frames, video image data, or the other image data. The image data may include one or more images of a hand of the user or another hand within an imaging area of the image capture device. For example, the image data may include one or more images of the back of the user's hand and fingers, including one or more of the user's fingernails. In one example, the image data acquisition at block <b>304</b> is illustrated in the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0055">At block <b>306</b>, the application <b>230</b> detects one or more fingernail regions within the image data. Detection of fingernail regions may be performed at the user device <b>120</b>, at the data center <b>110</b>, and/or by a combination of processing resources of the user device <b>120</b> and the data center <b>110</b>. In one example, the detection of fingernail regions may be accomplished by an automated system for detecting and tracking fingernail from images and/or video collected with the camera <b>225</b> of the computing device <b>200</b> (e.g., user device <b>120</b>). In some embodiments, detection may be accomplished using one or more machine learning implementations, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or the like. Fingernail detection within image data is discussed in greater detail below. Depending on the embodiment, the fingernail detection models may be generated using various techniques, such as machine learning techniques that may include artificial intelligence such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, clustering, or the like. Machine learning may be performed using a training set of data. The training data may be used to generate the model that best characterizes a feature of interest using the training data. In some implementations, the class of features may be identified before training. In such instances, the model may be trained to provide outputs most closely resembling the target class of features. In some implementations, no prior knowledge may be available for training the data. In such instances, the model may discover new relationships for the provided training data. Such relationships may include similarities between data elements such as anchor points of nails, fingers, etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0056">The identified fingernail regions may be represented by a set of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more data points such as (x,y) coordinates within the image data. A set of data points identifying each fingernail region may be stored at the user device <b>120</b> (e.g., in a memory <b>210</b> and/or a remote data store <b>255</b>) and/or at the data center <b>110</b> (e.g., in the database <b>114</b>). In some embodiments, coordinates are an array of objects (fingers) each consisting of multiple x and y coordinates (the boundaries of the nail). Once the nails are detected, the application may get an array from the library embedded in the application responsible for fingers and nails detection. Each element in the array may include a series of coordinates of a specific nail. These series or arrays of coordinates may each be the x and y values for the boundary of a nail. Using AR core library, the application may draw and overlay a specific filter given by the user on the nail while passing the coordinates. AR core accepts a polygon as an input to draw on the scene. The application may gather all the coordinates for a nail, and create a polygon and pass it afterwards to the AR core library. After that, the application may pass the filter and mesh details along the polygon created before to AR core for painting and drawing. This process may be repeated for all the other nails/elements of the array.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0057">At block <b>308</b>, the fingernail regions identified at block <b>306</b> are tracked in subsequent image data. Subsequent tracking of fingernail regions across subsequent frames of image data may enable real-time viewing of virtual nail treatments as augmented reality content, and may allow the virtual nail treatments to follow the user's fingernails as the user's hands move relative to the image capture device. In some embodiments, multiple blocks occur concurrently or substantially concurrently. For example, in one embodiment blocks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> may occur concurrently.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0058">At block <b>310</b>, user input corresponding to one or more nail treatments is received. The user input at block <b>310</b> may correspond to, for example, selection of one of a plurality of options of nail treatments to virtually try on. In some embodiments, the user input comprises selection of one or more nail treatment parameters such as a nail shape, nail length, nail polish color or combination of colors, a commercially available nail treatment product, or other parameter. The user input at block <b>310</b> may be received through a graphical user interface such as a graphical user interface of the application <b>230</b>, for example, as illustrated in the screens of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0059">At block <b>312</b>, the application <b>230</b> displays a nail treatment corresponding to the user input of block <b>310</b>, as augmented reality content in displayed images. For example, the application <b>230</b> may cause the display <b>240</b> of the user device <b>120</b> to overlay images of the user's selected nail treatment onto real-time video data from the camera <b>225</b> at locations corresponding to the fingernail regions identified at block <b>306</b> and tracked in block <b>308</b>. In some embodiments, the virtual nail treatments may change in size, shape, orientation, hue, brightness, etc., as the fingernail regions move within the image frames (e.g., as the user moves the user's hand laterally, closer to the camera, farther from the camera, rotates the hand and/or fingers, etc.). In some embodiments, the application may automatically select one or more nail treatments similar to a nail treatment selected by user and provide augmented reality images of multiple nail treatments on the user's finger concurrently. For example, the display may be segmented into nine (or any other quantity of) windows each, each illustrating the user's finger with a different nail treatment. Thus, the user can obtain a very efficient overview of available designs and select a most desired design.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0060">At decision state <b>314</b>, a user selection may be received. If it is determined at decision state <b>314</b> that a user selection has not yet been received, the method <b>300</b> returns to block <b>312</b>, and the virtual nail treatment corresponding to the user input of block <b>310</b> continues to be displayed on the real-time image data. If a user selection is received at decision state <b>314</b>, the user selection may correspond to a request to purchase one or more products corresponding to the virtual nail treatment and/or a request to schedule an appointment to have a corresponding physical nail treatment applied to the user, such as at a nail salon or other service provider. The user selection may be made, for example, by providing a user input at the screens of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>, <b>9</b></figref>, and/or <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0061">If it is determined at decision state <b>314</b> that the user has selected an option to purchase one or more products reflected in the virtual nail treatment, the method <b>300</b> continues to block <b>316</b>, where one or more product providers are identified. For example, the product provider may correspond to a manufacturer and/or a particular product, shade, etc. of the product from the manufacturer. The system may further identify one or more product providers, such as an internet-based retailer or other entity from which the user is able to order the product. In some embodiments, the data center <b>110</b> may store information corresponding to available inventory held by one or more product providers of products provided as virtual nail treatments within the application <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0062">At block <b>318</b>, the application <b>230</b> causes the user device <b>120</b> to open a browser application. At block <b>320</b>, the method <b>300</b> terminates as the browser application executing on the user device <b>120</b> is redirected to a website corresponding to the product provider.

Thus, in some embodiments, the user interfaces described herein are more efficient as compared to previous user interfaces in which data is not dynamically updated and compactly and efficiently presented to the user in response to interactive inputs.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0101">Further, as described herein, the system may be configured and/or designed to generate user interface data useable for rendering the various interactive user interfaces described. The user interface data may be used by the system, and/or another computer system, device, and/or software program (for example, a browser program), to render the interactive user interfaces. The interactive user interfaces may be displayed on, for example, electronic displays (including, for example, touch-enabled displays).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0102">Additionally, it has been noted that design of computer user interfaces &#x201c;that are useable and easily learned by humans is a non-trivial problem for software developers.&#x201d; (Dillon, A. (2003) User Interface Design. MacMillan Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science, Vol. 4, London: MacMillan, 453-458.) The various embodiments of interactive and dynamic user interfaces of the present disclosure are the result of significant research, development, improvement, iteration, and testing. This non-trivial development has resulted in the user interfaces described herein which may provide significant cognitive and ergonomic efficiencies and advantages over previous systems. The interactive and dynamic user interfaces include improved human-computer interactions that may provide reduced mental workloads, improved decision-making, reduced work stress, and/or the like, for a user. For example, user interaction with the interactive user interfaces described herein may provide an optimized display of time-varying report-related information and may enable a user to more quickly access, navigate, assess, and digest such information than previous systems.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0103">In some embodiments, data may be presented in graphical representations, such as visual representations, such as charts and graphs, where appropriate, to allow the user to comfortably review the large amount of data and to take advantage of humans' particularly strong pattern recognition abilities related to visual stimuli. In some embodiments, the system may present aggregate quantities, such as totals, counts, and averages. The system may also utilize the information to interpolate or extrapolate, e.g. forecast, future developments.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0104">Further, the interactive and dynamic user interfaces described herein are enabled by innovations in efficient interactions between the user interfaces and underlying systems and components. For example, disclosed herein are improved methods of receiving user inputs, translation and delivery of those inputs to various system components, automatic and dynamic execution of complex processes in response to the input delivery, automatic interaction among various components and processes of the system, and automatic and dynamic updating of the user interfaces. The interactions and presentation of data via the interactive user interfaces described herein may accordingly provide cognitive and ergonomic efficiencies and advantages over previous systems.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0105">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide improvements to various technologies and technological fields. For example, as described above, existing data storage and processing technology (including, e.g., in memory databases) is limited in various ways (e.g., manual data review is slow, costly, and less detailed; data is too voluminous; etc.), and various embodiments of the disclosure provide significant improvements over such technology. Additionally, various embodiments of the present disclosure are inextricably tied to computer technology. In particular, various embodiments rely on detection of user inputs via graphical user interfaces, calculation of updates to displayed electronic data based on those user inputs, automatic processing of related electronic data, and presentation of the updates to displayed images via interactive graphical user interfaces. Such features and others (e.g., processing and analysis of large amounts of electronic data) are intimately tied to, and enabled by, computer technology, and would not exist except for computer technology. For example, the interactions with displayed data described below in reference to various embodiments cannot reasonably be performed by humans alone, without the computer technology upon which they are implemented. Further, the implementation of the various embodiments of the present disclosure via computer technology enables many of the advantages described herein, including more efficient interaction with, and presentation of, various types of electronic data.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Notification Module</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0106">In some embodiments, alerts and/or notifications are automatically transmitted to the user device operated by the entity associated with the alert and/or notification. The alert and/or notification can be transmitted at the time that the alert and/or notification is generated or at some determined time after generation of the alert and/or notification. When received by the device, the alert and/or notification can cause the device to display the alert and/or notification via the activation of an application on the device (e.g., a browser, a mobile application, etc.). For example, receipt of the alert and/or notification may automatically activate an application on the device, such as a messaging application (e.g., SMS or MMS messaging application), a standalone application (e.g., a data analysis application), or a browser, for example, and display information included in the alert and/or notification.

The computer program product may include a computer readable storage medium (or mediums) having computer readable program instructions thereon for causing a processor to carry out aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0108">For example, the functionality described herein may be performed as software instructions are executed by, and/or in response to software instructions being executed by, one or more hardware processors and/or any other suitable computing devices. The software instructions and/or other executable code may be read from a computer readable storage medium (or mediums).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0109">The computer readable storage medium can be a tangible device that can retain and store data and/or instructions for use by an instruction execution device. The computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but is not limited to, an electronic storage device (including any volatile and/or non-volatile electronic storage devices), a magnetic storage device, an optical storage device, an electromagnetic storage device, a semiconductor storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. A non-exhaustive list of more specific examples of the computer readable storage medium includes the following: a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a solid state drive, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a static random access memory (SRAM), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a memory stick, a floppy disk, a mechanically encoded device such as punch-cards or raised structures in a groove having instructions recorded thereon, and any suitable combination of the foregoing. A computer readable storage medium, as used herein, is not to be construed as being transitory signals per se, such as radio waves or other freely propagating electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic waves propagating through a waveguide or other transmission media (e.g., light pulses passing through a fiber-optic cable), or electrical signals transmitted through a wire.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0110">Computer readable program instructions described herein can be downloaded to respective computing/processing devices from a computer readable storage medium or to an external computer or external storage device via a network, for example, the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network and/or a wireless network. The network may comprise copper transmission cables, optical transmission fibers, wireless transmission, routers, firewalls, switches, gateway computers and/or edge servers. A network adapter card or network interface in each computing/processing device receives computer readable program instructions from the network and forwards the computer readable program instructions for storage in a computer readable storage medium within the respective computing/processing device.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0111">Computer readable program instructions (as also referred to herein as, for example, &#x201c;code,&#x201d; &#x201c;instructions,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;application,&#x201d; &#x201c;software application,&#x201d; and/or the like) for carrying out operations of the present disclosure may be assembler instructions, instruction-set-architecture (ISA) instructions, machine instructions, machine dependent instructions, microcode, firmware instructions, state-setting data, configuration data for integrated circuitry, or either source code or object code written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, C++, or the like, and procedural programming languages, such as the &#x201c;C&#x201d; programming language or similar programming languages. Computer readable program instructions may be callable from other instructions or from itself, and/or may be invoked in response to detected events or interrupts. Computer readable program instructions configured for execution on computing devices may be provided on a computer readable storage medium, and/or as a digital download (and may be originally stored in a compressed or installable format that requires installation, decompression or decryption prior to execution) that may then be stored on a computer readable storage medium. Such computer readable program instructions may be stored, partially or fully, on a memory device (e.g., a computer readable storage medium) of the executing computing device, for execution by the computing device. The computer readable program instructions may execute entirely on a user's computer (e.g., the executing computing device), partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider). In some embodiments, electronic circuitry including, for example, programmable logic circuitry, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), or programmable logic arrays (PLA) may execute the computer readable program instructions by utilizing state information of the computer readable program instructions to personalize the electronic circuitry, in order to perform aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0112">Aspects of the present disclosure are described herein with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems), and computer program products according to embodiments of the disclosure. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer readable program instructions.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0113">These computer readable program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer readable program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable storage medium that can direct a computer, a programmable data processing apparatus, and/or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the computer readable storage medium having instructions stored therein comprises an article of manufacture including instructions which implement aspects of the function/act specified in the flowchart(s) and/or block diagram(s) block or blocks.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0114">The computer readable program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other device to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other device to produce a computer implemented process, such that the instructions which execute on the computer, other programmable apparatus, or other device implement the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid state drive of a remote computer. The remote computer may load the instructions and/or modules into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone, cable, or optical line using a modem. A modem local to a server computing system may receive the data on the telephone/cable/optical line and use a converter device including the appropriate circuitry to place the data on a bus. The bus may carry the data to a memory, from which a processor may retrieve and execute the instructions. The instructions received by the memory may optionally be stored on a storage device (e.g., a solid state drive) either before or after execution by the computer processor.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0115">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods, and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of instructions, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). In some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the Figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. In addition, certain blocks may be omitted in some implementations. The methods and processes described herein are also not limited to any particular sequence, and the blocks or states relating thereto can be performed in other sequences that are appropriate.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0116">It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts or carry out combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions. For example, any of the processes, methods, algorithms, elements, blocks, applications, or other functionality (or portions of functionality) described in the preceding sections may be embodied in, and/or fully or partially automated via, electronic hardware such application-specific processors (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), programmable processors (e.g., field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)), application-specific circuitry, and/or the like (any of which may also combine custom hard-wired logic, logic circuits, ASICs, FPGAs, etc. with custom programming/execution of software instructions to accomplish the techniques).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0117">Any of the above-mentioned processors, and/or devices incorporating any of the above-mentioned processors, may be referred to herein as, for example, &#x201c;computers,&#x201d; &#x201c;computer devices,&#x201d; &#x201c;computing devices,&#x201d; &#x201c;hardware computing devices,&#x201d; &#x201c;hardware processors,&#x201d; &#x201c;processing units,&#x201d; and/or the like. Computing devices of the above-embodiments may generally (but not necessarily) be controlled and/or coordinated by operating system software, such as Mac OS, iOS, Android, Chrome OS, Windows OS (e.g., Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server, etc.), Windows CE, Unix, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, Blackberry OS, VxWorks, or other suitable operating systems. In other embodiments, the computing devices may be controlled by a proprietary operating system. Conventional operating systems control and schedule computer processes for execution, perform memory management, provide file system, networking, I/O services, and provide a user interface functionality, such as a graphical user interface (&#x201c;GUI&#x201d;), among other things.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
