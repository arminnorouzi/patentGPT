The invention also relates to a method of disinfecting a dialysis machine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are several types of treatments in which blood is extracted in an extracorporeal blood circuit. Such treatments involve, for example, haemodialysis, haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration, plasmapheresis, etc. Normally, blood is removed from a blood vessel at an access site and returned to the same blood vessel or at another location.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In for example the cases of haemodialysis, haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration, and plasmapheres, but not limited to these cases, a treatment fluid (also referred to as a dialysis fluid) is made approximately isotonic with a patient's blood. In haemodialysis and haemodiafiltration, the treatment fluid and the patient's blood are made to flow on each side of a semi-permeable membrane of a membrane device (referred to as a dialyzer). Diffusive transfer is achieved from one side of the membrane to the other when the concentration of the substance on each side of the membrane differs. Such substances may be impurities in the blood (urea, creatinine, etc.) which thereby migrates from the blood to the treatment fluid. Since fluid normally has to be removed from the patient during haemodialysis, a convective transfer by ultrafiltration, resulting from a pressure difference created between the blood side and the treatment fluid side of the membrane, is added to the diffusive transfer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An apparatus for extracorporeal blood treatment includes a dialysis machine which is connected to a disposable extracorporeal blood circuit. The disposable extracorporeal blood circuit includes blood transport lines (in general an arterial line for blood removal from the patient, and a venous line for blood return to the patient) and the membrane device for blood treatment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The semi-permeable membrane of the membrane device divides a blood compartment, connected to the blood transport lines, and a fluid compartment, connected to treatment fluid supply and discharge circuits. The blood transport lines are further coupled to a sensor and actuator system equipped on the dialysis machine, which system normally comprises means for blood circulation, pressure sensors, air bubble sensor, one or more circuit blocking clamps, blood detector, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The treatment fluid supply circuit receives purified water from a water supply system. The water supply system may be a small unit providing water to only a single treatment control machine, but may also be a large unit providing water by means of a water system loop arrangement to a significant number of treatment units in for example a hospital or a clinic.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Dialysis fluid, which may come into contact with the patients' blood, is often prepared from the purified water by means of a treatment fluid supply circuit. It is of paramount importance that the dialysis fluid used for the treatment is substantially free from virus, fungi, bacteria and their residue and degradation products, such as endotoxins.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the treatment fluid path of a dialysis machine may be disinfected between dialysis treatments in order to reduce the presence of virus, fungi, bacteria, etc in the treatment fluid path. Chemical disinfection (e.g. using NaOCl or other chemical disinfection agents) is an efficient way to reduce the presence of bacteria, etc but it makes great demands on the following rinse procedure and requires very close measuring to assure that the treatment fluid path is free of chemical residual products before being used for subsequent treatments. The chemical process is not environmentally friendly and may have a negative effect on the life-length of the disinfected parts and components.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an alternative disinfection process, thermal disinfection is achieved by letting hot water pass through the treatment fluid path. As a result, the problem of chemical residual products does not exist, the process puts less load on the environment, and often has comparatively less negative effect on the life-length of the disinfected parts and components compared to the use of biological aggressive solutions (as for example Chlorine).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further alternative disinfection process, the thermal disinfection is combined with chemical agents, such as citric acid, in order to achieve an efficient disinfection of the treatment fluid path.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">WO96/09080 discloses a disinfection arrangement for a dialysis machine consisting of a clean side and dirty side. The clean side comprises an inlet for water, a heat exchanger as well as a water vessel containing a heater. A feed conduit leads from the water vessel to a tube which is normally connected to the clean side of the dialyser but, during disinfection, is connected to a recirculation conduit via a valve in order to perform a first recirculation circuit. A second recirculation circuit is constituted by a recirculation conduit, a valve, a tube, which is normally connected to the dirty side of a dialyser, a return conduit as well as a pump. A heat exchanger heats up the fluid in the second circuit with help of the fluid in the first circuit, which is heated up by the heater in the water vessel. A small amount of fluid is transferred from the first circuit to the second circuit via a shunt conduit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another example of disinfection arrangement of similar configuration is disclosed in WO96/40314.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thermal disinfection of the treatment fluid path of a machine is preferably carried out after the treatment of each patient. As the number of dialysis patients increases there is a need to increase the available time for treatments in the clinics. Consequently, there is a desire to reduce the time spent on disinfection between treatments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Before dialysis treatment can be commenced for a patient, the dialysis machine needs a certain time to start up the production of treatment fluid with the correct composition and at a set temperature. Again, as the number of dialysis patients increases there is a need to increase the available time for treatments in the clinics. Consequently, there is a need to reduce the time spent on the starting-up of the preparation of the treatment fluid before the dialysis treatment can be commenced on the patient.</p><heading

In this latter situation, heated water or disinfectant circulates (and is not re-circulated) in the feed arrangement <b>170</b> being e.g. directly discharged through the feed forward arrangement <b>172</b>. Therefore, the feed arrangement <b>170</b> is disinfected for a short time without recirculation, and the disinfection of the return arrangement <b>171</b> is then continued by re-circulation while the dialysis fluid for the treatment is being prepared.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Additionally, the short heating cycle (e.g. 5 minutes) in the feed arrangement <b>170</b> may be combined with a subsequent dialysis fluid preparation cycle.

Similarly, the return fluid removable connector <b>139</b> is disconnected from the dialyzer treatment fluid outlet <b>153</b> and connected to the return tube parking connector <b>137</b>. The fluid loop path and the auxiliary fluid loop path are filled with water coming from inlet <b>101</b>. Circulations in the fluid loop path and the auxiliary fluid loop path, respectively, are made possible by opening the second return valve <b>124</b> and the first return valve <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Water in the feed arrangement <b>170</b> (and in the auxiliary fluid loop path) is heated by the heater <b>104</b> and the water in the return arrangement <b>171</b> (and in the fluid loop path) is heated by either the heater <b>501</b> in the return arrangement <b>171</b> (if present) or the heater <b>104</b> in the feed arrangement (and then heat transferred to the return arrangement directly transferring fluid or indirectly transferring heat via the heat exchanger <b>301</b>). The by-pass valve <b>121</b> is closed during disinfection in order to prevent fluid from the fluid loop path to reach the auxiliary fluid loop path. Water and/or disinfectant in the auxiliary fluid loop path is re-circulated by means of the flow pump <b>120</b>, whereas the water and/or disinfectant in the fluid loop path is re-circulated by means of the suction pump <b>122</b>. In a first phase, when both the feed and the return arrangements <b>170</b>, <b>171</b> are subjected to respective and independent re-circulation of heated water, the second exit valve <b>126</b> (or third exit valve <b>226</b>) is closed and first exit valve <b>125</b> is closed as well. Furthermore, the controller <b>160</b> receives signals from the first and second fluid path temperature sensors <b>127</b>, <b>128</b> and controls the respective short-cuts on the heat exchanger <b>310</b> (if present) in order to enable the heat to distribute between the fluid loop path and the auxiliary fluid loop path. In detail, the controller <b>160</b> measures the temperatures of the fluid loop path and the auxiliary fluid loop path and controls the heaters <b>104</b> and <b>501</b> and the bypass valve <b>121</b> in order to arrive and maintain the temperature in the auxiliary fluid loop path at a high temperature, but being less than 90 degrees Celsius (e.g. 75 degrees Celsius) referred to as the first operating temperature, and the temperature in the fluid loop path at a higher temperature (e.g. in the range of 80-90 degrees Celsius) referred to as the second operating temperature.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">A second phase is commenced when water with the first operating temperature has been circulating for a short period of time (e.g. 5 minutes) in the auxiliary fluid loop path. During this second phase, the dialysis fluid preparation cycle is performed in the feed arrangement <b>170</b>, while water with the second operating temperature continues to be circulated in the fluid loop path. This is achieved by opening the second exit valve <b>126</b>, closing the first return valve <b>123</b> and starting the preparation of dialysis fluid in a known way prior to a new treatment. The prepared dialysis fluid during the dialysis fluid preparation cycle needs to be discharged to the waste bag or drain. Since disinfection may still be on-going in the fluid loop path, the dialysis fluid is instead lead to waste bag or drain by means of the feed forward arrangement <b>172</b> with second exit valve <b>126</b> (or third exit valve <b>226</b>&#x2014; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) open. Furthermore, as the temperature of the prepared dialysis fluid should be kept roughly at body temperature, the incoming water to the treatment fluid preparation unit <b>110</b> needs to be shielded from the hot water present in the return arrangement <b>171</b>. To achieve this task, second heat exchanger short-cut valve <b>303</b> and/or fourth heat exchanger short-cut valve <b>403</b> are closed (and respective by-pass lines opened) thereby short-cutting the heat exchanger <b>301</b> on the primary and/or secondary side.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">The second phase is completed when the water with the second operating temperature has been circulating for a longer period of time (e.g. 15 minutes) in the fluid loop path. The first exit valve <b>125</b> is then opened and the second return valve <b>124</b> is closed which leads to that the heated water of the fluid loop path is pumped out to the waste bag or drain. Thereafter, the by-pass valve <b>121</b> is opened and the second exit valve <b>126</b> is closed thereby leading dialysis fluid prepared by the treatment fluid preparation unit <b>110</b> in the feed arrangement <b>170</b> through to the return arrangement <b>171</b>. The dialysis machine is ready to start the next treatment in a known manner.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In an alternative design only the feed arrangement <b>170</b> is disinfected to thereby kill bacteria only in the auxiliary fluid loop path and prohibit any significant growth of bacteria upstream the dialyzer <b>150</b> (that is, the bacteria that can reach the dialyzer during treatment). This is achieved by disinfecting only the auxiliary fluid loop path in the same manner as above described in between treatments. In this case, the fluid loop path may be emptied of fluid during the disinfection of the auxiliary fluid loop path or the fluid therein may be kept still or be allowed to flow at a low flow rate in order to reduce the exchange of heat between the fluid loop path and the auxiliary fluid loop path (which may occur for example in the heat exchanger <b>301</b>&#x2014;if not short-cut as above discussed). Of course, the return arrangement <b>171</b> needs to be disinfected on a regular basis as well (e.g. once a day). However, the amount of bacteria and virus that may grow in between such disinfection of the fluid loop path may be deemed to be on an acceptable low level, since these bacteria and virus will not be able to reach the dialyzer <b>150</b> during treatment (as the return arrangement <b>171</b> is located downstream of the dialyzer <b>150</b>).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In addition to the disinfections between treatments as above discussed, the complete hydraulic circuit needs a full disinfection on a regular basis (e.g. once a day). Additionally, the dialysis machine <b>1</b> may be provided by a control mechanism/algorithm (in particular implemented using the controller <b>160</b>) such that the short disinfections of the feed arrangement (auxiliary fluid loop path) can only be repeated a pre-set number of times before a disinfection of the complete hydraulic circuit (fluid loop path and auxiliary fluid loop path) is mandatory required. Alternatively, the control mechanism/algorithm sets a limit to how long accumulated time disinfection at the first operating temperature in the feed arrangement is allowed to be performed, over a set period of time, before disinfection of the complete hydraulic circuit will be required.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The above disinfection steps have been primarily referred to thermal disinfection. Additionally, or alternatively, disinfection agents may be added to heated water (or to water) in any one of the disinfection steps in both the fluid loop path and auxiliary fluid loop path or exclusively in one of the mentioned loop paths.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">An advantage, at least in respect of some embodiments of the present invention, is that the time required for disinfection between treatments has been reduced.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Another advantage, at least in respect of some embodiments of the present invention, is that it is possible to independently disinfect the feed arrangement <b>170</b> and/or the return arrangement <b>171</b>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Another advantage, at least in respect of some embodiments of the present invention, is that it is possible to start preparing treatment fluid at the same time disinfecting a portion of the machine hydraulic circuit.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
