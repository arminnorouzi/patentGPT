Information distributions platforms may allow users to identify specific topics of interest and share information related to certain topics in a real- or near real-time manner. For example, an information distribution platform may allow users to label user-generated content with tags, such as hashtags, which identify or otherwise associate a particular topic with the user-generated content. In this way, information distribution platforms may allow users to search for user-generated content associated with a particular topic based on a hashtag. In some instances, content providers may promote certain products or services using these hashtags with compelling images or videos. However, these promotions may remain stagnant upon distribution, or recipients of the content may only interact with these promotions in the same way that the recipients may interact with other user-generated content.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Techniques of the disclosure are directed to sending and receiving messages that allow for content providers to interact with potential recipients and customers.

An information distribution system may receive a first message from a content provider via a first client device that includes targeted content, such as a string of characters, an image, a video, and/or some other form of media. The targeted content may also include tags, such as hashtags, which identify or otherwise associate a particular topic with the user-generated content. Further, the targeted content may include a selectable graphical user interface element that a user reading the targeted content may interact with on a second client device. If the user selects the selectable graphical user interface element, the information distribution system may generate a custom message that may be sent on behalf of the user, which may also include a tag, such as a hashtag. When provided with information associated with multiple selected graphical user interface elements from various users, the content provider may track how the various users respond to the particular targeted content in order to, e.g., provide more efficient promoting. Further, by allowing users to send out messages regarding the targeted content on behalf of the content provider, the targeted content may reach a broader audience. The broader audience is also reached by users themselves rather than by the content providers, which may provide more efficient and trustworthy promoting than if the targeted content came from the content provider.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, after selecting one of the selectable graphical user interface elements, the information distribution system may send an addendum to the initial first message, such as extra text or a new media file.

For example purposes, information distribution system <b>112</b> includes message module <b>114</b>, user data <b>116</b>, and targeted content <b>120</b>. However, information distribution may include more or fewer modules or data in other examples. User data <b>116</b> may include data representing user accounts and demographic data about each user. As described above, a user account for a user of information distribution system <b>112</b> may include but is not limited to a user name, password, phone number, email address, and/or home address. In some examples, user data <b>116</b> may also include, current location of the user, devices authenticated with the user, interests of the user, history of content generated by the user, history of content read and/or followed by a user, hashtags and/or mention tags used by the user, other users followed by the user, other users following the user, private messages sent and/or received by the user, and/or search history of the user, to name only a few examples.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For instance, information distribution system <b>112</b> may include targeted content <b>120</b>. Targeted content may include any targeted content created by content provider system <b>124</b> or any number of similar computing devices. In the instance where targeted content <b>120</b> includes targeted content created by content provider system <b>124</b>, information distribution system <b>120</b> may receive targeted content <b>122</b> (e.g., targeted content created by content provider system <b>124</b>) from content provider system <b>124</b> and store the received targeted content <b>122</b> in targeted content <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Information distribution system may also include user data <b>118</b>. User data <b>118</b> may include data representing user accounts and demographic data about each user. A user account for a user of information distribution system <b>112</b> may include, but is not limited, to a user name, password, phone number, email address, and/or home address. In some examples, user data <b>118</b> may also include, current location of the user, devices authenticated with the user, interests of the user, history of content generated by the user, history of content read and/or followed by a user, hashtags and/or mention tags used by the user, other users followed by the user, other users following the user, private messages sent and/or received by the user, and/or search history of the user, to name only a few examples.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Information distribution system <b>112</b> may also include message module <b>114</b>. Message module <b>114</b> may construct and maintain information generated by users and/or operators of information distribution system <b>112</b>. Message module <b>114</b> may receive user content <b>108</b> from one or client devices, and store and organize the user content in the information network. The user content may be stored and organized using any number of datastores and data structures, such as but not limited to graphs, lists, tables, a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), Object Database Management System (ODBMS), and/or Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) system.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition to performing one or more aspects of this disclosure, message module <b>114</b> may perform general techniques for message distribution. Message module <b>114</b> may parse or analyze user content to share or otherwise redistribute the user content to other users of information distribution system <b>112</b>. For example, numerous users may each share or re-share content for a particular topic, and include or associate hashtag for the topic with the content. As an non-limiting example, multiple users may each share content about the Olympics and include a hashtag #Olympics with the content (e.g., text and/or pictures). Message module <b>114</b> may receive the content and parse the hashtag #Olympics to structure content associated with the hashtag as searchable. In this way, if a user wishes to view all content associated with #Olympics, the user may submit a query to message module <b>114</b>, which may return a set of content or messages that include the hashtag #Olympics. In some examples, message module <b>114</b> may automatically send to a user's client device, without additional user intervention, content or messages that include the hashtag #Olympics, if the user previously searched for, shared, re-shared, and/or viewed content associated with the hashtag #Olympics.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Message module <b>114</b> may parse or analyze user content to share or otherwise redistribute the user content to other users of information distribution system <b>112</b> based at least in part on whether a user is following another particular user or has mentioned the particular user. For instance, if the user provides user input to client module <b>106</b>A to follow a particular user, information distribution system <b>112</b> may receive an indication of the user input and store the indication with the user's account. When the particular user shares or re-shares content, information distribution system <b>112</b> may send the content to client device <b>102</b>A such that the user can view the content. As another example, if the user mentions the particular user in shared or re-shared content, information distribution system <b>112</b> may receive the content and send the content or notification of the mention to a client device of the particular user that was mentioned. In some examples, message module <b>114</b> may store information about user content viewed by a particular user. For instance, client module <b>106</b>A may send data that indicates the user has viewed specific user content to information distribution system <b>112</b>. Message module <b>114</b> may store data that indicates the user has viewed the specific user content. Although a number of examples above have described how message module <b>114</b> determines relationships between user content and redistributes user content to client devices, many other examples of distributing content and determining relationships are also possible.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some instances, the amount of content associated with a particular hashtag may grow or decline rapidly relative to content associated with other hashtags. The rapid change may be due to a particular event, controversy, person, or topic that captures or loses the interest of a large audience of users. Such change in the increase or decrease of content associated with the hashtag may represent a trend. A magnitude of a trend may represent the degree interest or engagement by an audience of users. For instance, if a magnitude of a trend is high, the degree of interest by the audience of users may be high. As an example, there may be relatively more users in the audience and those users may be more engaged in content for the particular event, controversy, person, or topic. Conversely, if a magnitude of a trend is low, the degree of interest by the audience of users may be low. As an example, there may be relatively fewer users in the audience and those users may be less engaged in content for the particular event, controversy, person, or topic.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, message module <b>114</b> may, in addition to re-distributing user content to client devices as described above, send targeted content <b>120</b> to client devices for display. Targeted content <b>120</b> may include, but is not limited to targeted content, offers, rewards, discounts, political information, public interest information, entertainment information, sports information, or any other informational content.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure, targeted content <b>120</b> may also include conversational targeted content. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, distribution module <b>112</b> may send collocated content <b>110</b> that includes targeted content and/or distributed user content from other users. Client module <b>106</b>A may generate a graphical user interface <b>130</b> for display that includes information included in collocated content <b>110</b>, such as user content <b>134</b> and message options <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B. In some examples, user interface <b>130</b> outputs information in a sequence or stream of &#x201c;cards&#x201d; or graphical user elements <b>132</b>A-<b>132</b>D (hereinafter, &#x201c;cards <b>132</b>&#x201d;). The sequence or stream of &#x201c;cards&#x201d; may be ordered in chronological or reverse chronological order, in some examples. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, card <b>132</b>B includes an icon <b>138</b>A and user content <b>134</b>. Card <b>132</b>C includes an icon <b>138</b>B and message options <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B. Icon <b>138</b>A may correspond to the particular user that shared or re-shared user content <b>134</b>. Icon <b>138</b>B may correspond to the particular content provider that provided card <b>132</b>C.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, card <b>132</b>C may be interspersed with other user content in graphical user interface <b>130</b>. Accordingly, if a user is viewing a sequence or stream of cards, such as cards <b>132</b>, information distribution system <b>112</b> may also include one or more cards with targeted content. As an example, if the sequence or stream of cards is associated with a specific topic, targeted content that is relevant to the specific topic may be included in the sequence or stream of cards.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, information distribution system <b>112</b> may receive targeted content from content providers operating one or more content provider systems, such as content provider system <b>124</b>. Content providers may include promotion agencies, companies, public interest organizations, governments, individual persons, and political candidates, to name only a few examples. Such content providers may be interested in providing target content to users of information distribution system <b>112</b>. More particularly, content providers may be interested in generating and displaying targeted content to specific audiences (e.g., sets of users of information distribution system <b>112</b>) that are highly engaged or interested in a particular event, controversy, person, or topic.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure, message module <b>114</b> may receive, from content provider system <b>124</b>, a first message (e.g., card <b>132</b>C) including a first string of characters and at least one selectable graphical user interface element (e.g., message options <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B). For example, message module <b>114</b> may receive card <b>132</b>C from content provider system <b>124</b> belonging to a content provider in the car industry. Card <b>132</b>C may include a string of characters that makes up a message asking which model of the content provider's line of products the user may prefer. In some examples, the first string of characters may include at least one hashtag. Card <b>132</b>C may also include message option <b>140</b>A and message option <b>140</b>B, each of which include a respective model of the content provider's line of products. Message options <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B may be interactive graphical user interface elements to be displayed at client device <b>102</b>A in card <b>132</b>C.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In response to receiving the first message, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at user interface component <b>104</b>A at client device <b>102</b>A, the first message in card <b>132</b>C. Client device <b>102</b>A may present card <b>132</b>C to a user of client device <b>102</b>A in order to obtain feedback regarding the model preference of the user, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Message module <b>114</b> may receive, from client device <b>102</b>A, an indication of a first user input. The first user input may include a selection of a first selectable graphical user interface element of the at least one selectable graphical user interface element of the first message. For example, message option <b>140</b>A may be an option for a first model of car, and message option <b>140</b>B may be an option for a second model of car. The user of client device <b>102</b>A may select message option <b>140</b>B, as the user may prefer the second model of car to the first model of car. Client device <b>102</b>A receives an indication of user input at user interface component <b>104</b>A indicative of the user's preference of the second model of car. Message module <b>114</b> may then receive the indication of user input from client device <b>102</b>A.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In response to receiving the indication of the first user input, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at client device <b>102</b>A, a second message including a second string of characters and a prompt for an indication of a second user input. The prompt for the indication of the second user input may prompt for one of an affirmation for information distribution system <b>112</b> to send the second string of characters to a group of one or more client devices for display or a denial restricting information distribution system <b>112</b> from sending the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display. In some examples, the second string of characters in the second message may be an editable string of characters. In some examples, the second message further includes the at least one selectable graphical user interface element of the first message. Further, in some examples, the second string of characters may include at least one hashtag.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, upon receiving the indication of user input selecting message option <b>140</b>B, information distribution system <b>112</b> may compose a default message that states &#x201c;I love content provider's second model! You should all check it out here!&#x201d; with a hyperlink to the content provider's website. In order to further engage the user, information distribution system <b>112</b> may send the composed message to client device <b>102</b>A for user review. The user, in some examples, may edit the default message in order to customize the output that may be seen by one or more subscribers to the user's social media account.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Message module <b>114</b> may receive, from client device <b>102</b>A, the indication of the second user input. In response to the second user input including the affirmation for information distribution system <b>112</b> to send the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at the group of one or more client devices, the second string of characters. Conversely, in response to the second user input including the denial restricting information distribution system <b>112</b> from sending the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display, message module <b>114</b> may refrain from sending the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, if the message is satisfactory, the user may input an indication of user input to client device <b>102</b>A affirming that information distribution system <b>112</b> may output the message (e.g., the default message or the edited message as altered by the user) to the group of one or more client devices that may subscribe to a social media account of the user. In response to receiving the affirmation, message module <b>114</b> may send the message to the group of one or more client devices for display on the respective user interface components of the client devices belonging to the subscribers of the user's social media account. If, however, the user does not wish to have the message sent to their subscribers, the user may select the denial option. As such, information distribution system <b>112</b> may refrain from sending the message to the subscriber's client devices.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In general, information distribution system <b>112</b> may send an indication of the user interaction to content provider system <b>124</b> for the content provider's records. The information of the user interacting with the content in general, or, if the content includes multiple message options, the information of which message option the user selects may provide valuable information to the content provider for its marketing efforts.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, further in response to receiving the indication of the first user input, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at client device <b>102</b>A, an addendum to the first message. The contents of the addendum may be an additional string of characters or a media file. For instance, message module <b>114</b> may send an addendum with contents based on the selected option. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the user selected message option <b>140</b>B to choose the second model. As such, the addendum may replace message options <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>B and include the string of characters &#x201c;We love the second model, too!&#x201d; In other examples, the contents of the addendum may be a media file, such as a video commercial for the second model of vehicle produced by the content provider.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The above techniques may enable a computing device to create a targeted message that enables an interactive experience with the user, rather than limiting a creator to only a one-sided message. These techniques may further enable a content provider, such as a content provider, to enable multiple forms of interaction via a single targeted message, thereby increasing the amount of content provided to the user without increasing the size of the content on the screen of the user's computing device. In some instances, media may be more effective in conveying information regarding a product, especially if the user receiving the content has provided an indication that they are interested in the product. By including an addendum to the message after the user interacts with the content, the content provider may more effectively send content to the user that interests the user rather than guessing which product the user may be interested in. As information distribution system <b>112</b> may send fewer pieces of targeted content that are ineffective, information distribution system <b>112</b> may potentially consume less battery power and produce less congestion over network <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating details of an example information distribution system for managing targeted content, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates only one particular example of information distribution system <b>112</b>, and many other examples of information distribution system <b>112</b> may be used in other instances and may include a subset of the components included in example information distribution system <b>112</b> or may include additional components not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Information distribution system <b>112</b> may implement techniques of this disclosure to manage conversational targeted content.

Examples of non-volatile memories include magnetic hard discs, optical discs, floppy discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable (EEPROM) memories.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Storage devices <b>204</b>, in some examples, include one or more computer-readable storage media. In some examples, storage devices <b>204</b> represent non-transitory computer readable storage medium that store instructions later executed by one or more processors <b>212</b> during operation of information distribution system <b>112</b>. For example, storage devices <b>204</b> may store program instructions and/or information (e.g., data) associated with modules and/or components <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>227</b>, <b>229</b>, and <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">One or more processors <b>212</b> may implement functionality and/or execute instructions within information distribution system <b>112</b>. For example, processors <b>212</b> on information distribution system <b>112</b> may receive and execute instructions stored by storage devices <b>204</b> that execute the functionality of modules <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>227</b>, <b>229</b>, and <b>202</b>. The instructions executed by processors <b>212</b> may cause information distribution system <b>112</b> to read/write/etc. information, such as one or more data files at user data <b>118</b> and/or analytics data <b>227</b> and stored within storage devices <b>204</b> during program execution. Processors <b>212</b> may execute instructions of modules <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>227</b>, <b>229</b>, and <b>202</b> to cause information distribution system <b>112</b> to perform the operations described in this disclosure. That is, modules <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>227</b>, <b>229</b>, and <b>202</b> may be operable by processors <b>212</b> to perform various actions or functions of information distribution system <b>112</b>, for instance, detecting magnitudes of trends in user-generated content and facilitating the delivery of targeted content based on demographic data of the users associated with the user-generated content, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Techniques of this disclosure may be applied to managing conversational targeted content. In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure, message module <b>114</b> may receive, from a content provider system, a first message including a first string of characters and at least one selectable graphical user interface element. For example, message module <b>114</b> may receive a card from the content provider system belonging to a content provider in the coffee industry. The card may include a string of characters that makes up a message asking which beverage offered by the content provider the user may prefer. In some examples, the first string of characters may include at least one hashtag. For instance, the first message may read &#x201c;Which delicious coffee drink do you want to grab today? #BevA or #BevB?&#x201d; In some instances, the message may also include media, such as image files, video files, or audio files. The card may also include one or more message options, each of which include a respective beverage offered by the content provider. For instance, the first message option may be associated with BevA, and the second message option may be associated with BevB. The message options may be interactive graphical user interface elements to be displayed at the client device in a card.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In response to receiving the first message, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at a user interface component of the client device, the first message in the card. The client device may present the card to a user of the client device in order to obtain feedback regarding the model preference of the user.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Message module <b>114</b> may receive, from the client device, an indication of a first user input. The first user input may include a selection of a first selectable graphical user interface element of the at least one selectable graphical user interface element of the first message. For example, a first message option may be an option for a first coffee beverage, and a second message option may be an option for a second coffee beverage. The user of the client device may select the first message option, as the user may prefer the first coffee beverage (BevA) to the second coffee beverage (BevB). The client device may receive an indication of user input at its respective user interface component indicative of the user's preference of the second coffee beverage. Message module <b>114</b> may then receive the indication of user input from the client device.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In response to receiving the indication of the first user input, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at the client device, a second message including a second string of characters and a prompt for an indication of a second user input. The prompt for the indication of the second user input may prompt for one of an affirmation for information distribution system <b>112</b> to send the second string of characters to a group of one or more client devices for display or a denial restricting information distribution system <b>112</b> from sending the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display. In some examples, the second string of characters in the second message may be an editable string of characters. In some examples, the second message further includes the at least one selectable graphical user interface element of the first message. Further, in some examples, the second string of characters may include at least one hashtag.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, upon receiving the indication of user input selecting the first message option, information distribution system <b>112</b> may compose a default message that states &#x201c;I can't wait to grab my #BevA from content provider! Doesn't it look scrumptious?&#x201d; with a picture of BevA served by the content provider. In order to further engage the user, information distribution system <b>112</b> may send the composed message to the client device for user review. The user, in some examples, may edit the default message in order to customize the output that may be seen by one or more subscribers to the user's social media account.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Message module <b>114</b> may receive, from the client device, the indication of the second user input. In response to the second user input including the affirmation for information distribution system <b>112</b> to send the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at the group of one or more client devices, the second string of characters. Conversely, in response to the second user input including the denial restricting information distribution system <b>112</b> from sending the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display, message module <b>114</b> may refrain from sending the second string of characters to the group of one or more client devices for display.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, if the message is satisfactory, the user may input an indication of user input to the client device affirming that information distribution system <b>112</b> may output the message (e.g., the default message or the edited message as altered by the user) to the group of one or more client devices that may subscribe to a social media account of the user. In response to receiving the affirmation, message module <b>114</b> may send the message to the group of one or more client devices for display on the respective user interface components of the client devices belonging to the subscribers of the user's social media account. If, however, the user does not wish to have the message sent to their subscribers, the user may select the denial option. As such, information distribution system <b>112</b> may refrain from sending the message to the subscriber's client devices.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In general, information distribution system <b>112</b> may send an indication of the user interaction to the content provider system for the content provider's records. The information of the user interacting with the content in general, or, if the content includes multiple message options, the information of which message option the user selects may provide valuable information to the content provider for their marketing efforts.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, further in response to receiving the indication of the first user input, message module <b>114</b> may send, for display at the client device, an addendum to the first message. The addendum may be an additional string of characters or a media file. For instance, message module <b>114</b> may send an addendum based on the selected option. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the user selected the first message option to choose BevA. As such, the addendum may replace the message options and include the string of characters &#x201c;Isn't BevA so refreshing?&#x201d; In other examples, the addendum may be a media file, such as a video commercial for or a picture of the first coffee beverage offered by the content provider.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram of example targeted messages that include targeted content with a single conversation option to be displayed at one or more client devices, in accordance with one or more techniques of the disclosure.

Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if instructions are transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. It should be understood, however, that computer-readable storage media and data storage media do not include connections, carrier waves, signals, or other transient media, but are instead directed to non-transient, tangible storage media. Disk and disc, as used, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and Blu-ray disc, where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Instructions may be executed by one or more processors, such as one or more digital signal processors (DSPs), general purpose microprocessors, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable logic arrays (FPGAs), or other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;processor,&#x201d; as used may refer to any of the foregoing structure or any other structure suitable for implementation of the techniques described. In addition, in some aspects, the functionality described may be provided within dedicated hardware and/or software modules. Also, the techniques could be fully implemented in one or more circuits or logic elements.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The techniques of this disclosure may be implemented in a wide variety of devices or apparatuses, including a wireless handset, an integrated circuit (IC) or a set of ICs (e.g., a chip set).

Moreover, in certain embodiments, acts or events may be performed concurrently, e.g., through multi-threaded processing, interrupt processing, or multiple processors, rather than sequentially.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some examples, a computer-readable storage medium includes a non-transitory medium. In some examples, the term &#x201c;non-transitory&#x201d; indicates that the storage medium is not embodied in a carrier wave or a propagated signal. In certain examples, a non-transitory storage medium may store data that can, over time, change (e.g., in RAM or cache). Although certain examples are described as outputting various information for display, techniques of the disclosure may output such information in other forms, such as audio, holographical, or haptic forms, to name only a few examples, in accordance with techniques of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Various examples of the disclosure have been described.
