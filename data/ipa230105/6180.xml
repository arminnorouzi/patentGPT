Accordingly, when the light emitted by the light-emitting device <b>350</b> reaches the surface of the first optical structure <b>510</b>, it may be totally reflected and emitted along the direction adjacent to the front viewing angle of the display panel (as shown by the dashed arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The large-angle light emitted by the light-emitting device <b>350</b> may be more converted into small-angle light, and the light extraction efficiency may be increased.

In another word, the side wall <b>513</b> may protrude along a direction away from the inside of the first optical structure <b>510</b>. In this way, for the sidewall, the closer the convex arc surface is to the light-emitting surface of the display panel, the larger the slope angle corresponding to the sidewall is, which may be more conducive to the total reflection; and the process difficulty may also be reduced.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Moreover, for the light emitted from the same position, if it is a light with a particularly large viewing angle, it may be likely to irradiate the sidewall closer to the bottom surface of the first optical structure. At this time, the incident angle of the light relative to the sidewall may be more difficult to satisfy the full range. Under the reflection condition, there may be a high probability of being absorbed by the first optical structure. When the angle of view is not too large, when the light is incident on the sidewall, the incident position may be the side wall closer to the top surface of the first optical structure, the inclination angle of the sidewall may be larger, and it may be easier to satisfy the total reflection condition relative to the incident light. Thus, it may be easy to realize the total reflection. That is to say, the first optical structure designed in this embodiment may further filter the large viewing angle light, and extract the large viewing angle light with better conditions.

At this time, the sidewall has a converging effect on the light incident on it, and will converge this type of light near the light pass opening, and even converge to the light pass opening, and this type of light is not reflected by the touch subject with touch information. Therefore, it will affect the light detection results. That is to say, the reflected light at the edge of the opening of the first optical structure will fall into the imaging acquisition area, which will generate fixed pattern noise and greatly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, for the approach that the light-emitting layer includes the first optical structure and the second optical structure, the interface position between the low refractive index layer and the high refractive index layer may have a high reflectivity, and since the interface position may have a certain curvature, it is easier to form the effect of a concave mirror to converge the reflected light to or around the light opening.

For example, the light pass opening <b>610</b> may be set according to the principle of the pinhole imaging such that it may become an imaging aperture that may satisfy the realization of the pinhole imaging on the photosensitive device. Taking the detection of the fingerprint of the finger touching the touch surface of the display panel with a fingerprint detection function as an example, multiple light-emitting devices <b>350</b> in the display layer <b>300</b> may be multiplexed as a fingerprint identification light source. After the light generated by the light-emitting device <b>350</b> reaches the fingerprint and touches the contact surface, because the fingerprint valley and fingerprint ridge may reflect different degrees of light, the reflected light may enter the light sensor layer <b>800</b> through the imaging aperture (that is, the light pass opening <b>610</b>). When the aperture of the light pass opening <b>610</b> is small enough, the fingerprint image may be imaged onto the light sensor layer <b>800</b> according to the principle of the pinhole imaging to realize the fingerprint identification.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one embodiment, the aperture of the light pass opening <b>610</b> may be in a range between 5 &#x3bc;m and 20 &#x3bc;m to ensure that the light passing opening is small enough to realize the pinhole imaging.

Furthermore, it may be known from the principle of the pinhole imaging that the path of light reflected by the touch surface of the pinhole imaging may be not an orthographic projection to the plane where the vertical substrate is located. Therefore, when the touch surface is imaged, the plane where the first optical structure is located may not be covered, so it may not be affected by the patterned first optical structure. Thus, the interference light incident on the optical sensor layer may be reduced; and the reliability of the light extraction structure combined with the light sensing detection may be improved.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one embodiment, the display panel <b>100</b> may further include a light sensor layer <b>800</b>.
