More particularly, this disclosure relates to shock absorbers and damping and/or shock mitigating valves and control of shock absorber cavity pressures where impact force of a moving object is absorbed by causing a piston to displace hydraulic fluid from a cylinder through metering orifices, sprung bodies, fluid feedback loops and/or valves.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Shock absorbers and damping valves have been used on a number of vehicles including automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, and off-road vehicles to dampen shock transmission from a vehicle wheel to a frame or structure. Such shock absorbers and damping valves have also been used on industrial machines and processing equipment to dampen shock transmission between parts or subassemblies. They have also been used on any of a number of various operating mechanism and machines, including weapons systems and mitigation systems for a pipe fluid shock transmission system. However, certain environments impart a broad range of high speed, large deformation, high speed, small deformation, low speed, large deformation, and low speed, small deformation. Presently used shock absorbers and valve assemblies fail to provide optimal performance across a full spectrum of such shock transmission conditions and further improvements are needed to provide higher order response characteristics and tunability in order to maximize performance, particularly for racing and competition conditions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A hydraulic shock absorber and auxiliary hydraulic fluid valve assemblies are provided for tuning and mitigating shock transmission over a broad range of impact speeds, forces, and volumetric fluid displacements for vehicles, machinery, and equipment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect, a shock absorber is provided having a cylinder, a piston rod, a piston body, a valve, and a housing. The cylinder is filled with a fluid. The piston rod reciprocates within the cylinder. The valve is carried by the piston body having: at least one flow port through the piston body and communicating with a compression chamber end of the valve body; a first valve seat formed at least in part by the piston body; a second valve seat formed at least in part by the piston body; an annular valve chamber defined in part by the piston body and fluid coupled with the at least one flow port; at least one circumferential valving element configured to mate and demate with the first valve seat and the second valve seat; and at least one spring configured to urge the at least one valving element in movable mating and demating relation against the first valve seat and the second valve seat, the at least one valve seat demated from the first valve seat and the second valve seat responsive to fluid pressure in the annular valve chamber compressing the at least one spring to provide a first fluid flow path and a second fluid flow path at least one of radially inwardly and outwardly of the first fluid flow path, and forming a first fluid flow path with a first flow diversion angle and a second fluid flow path with a second flow diversion angle less than the first flow diversion angle. The housing includes an auxiliary reservoir communicating with one of the compression chamber and the rebound chamber and a by-pass passage penetrating an inside of the piston rod in a longitudinal direction of the piston rod, the housing configured to form an auxiliary passage connected to one of the compression chamber and the rebound chamber.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect, a shock absorber piston is provided having a piston body and a valve. The valve is carried by the piston body having: at least one flow port through the piston body and communicating with a compression chamber end of the valve body; an annular volumetric expansion chamber defined in part by the piston body and fluid coupled with the at least one flow port; a first annular valve seat carried by the piston body proximate the annular volumetric expansion chamber; a second annular valve seat carried by the piston body proximate the annular volumetric expansion chamber; at least one valving element configured to mate and demate with the first valve seat and the second valve seat; and at least one spring configured to urge the at least one valving element in mating and demating relation against the first valve seat and the second valve seat, the at least one valving element demated from the first valve seat and the second valve seat responsive to fluid pressure in the annular volumetric expansion chamber to compress the at least one spring and provide a first fluid flow path having a first flow diversion angle and a second fluid flow path with a second flow diversion angle less than the first flow diversion angle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to yet another aspect, a shock absorber valve is provided having a valve body, an outer piston, an inner piston, a spring, a compression fluid passage, and a rebound fluid passage. The valve body has an axial bore forming an annular valve seat at one end. The outer piston is carried in the axial bore having an inner axial bore opposite the valve seat. The inner piston slidably received in the axial bore of the outer piston and cooperating with the outer piston axial bore to define a variable volume reservoir. The spring is seated against the inner piston to urge the inner piston and the outer piston biased towards the annular valve seat. The compression fluid passage extends from proximate the valve seat through the outer piston to the variable volume reservoir. The rebound fluid passage has a one-way check valve extending from the variable volume reservoir through the outer piston proximate the valve seat.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to even another aspect, an auxiliary damping valve for a shock absorber is provided having a valve body, a freely reciprocating first piston, a biased second piston, a spring, and a fluid flow passage. The valve body has a hydraulic cylinder. The freely reciprocating first piston is movable axially within the cylinder. The biased second piston is provided in the cylinder adjacent the first piston defining an expansible fluid chamber between the first piston and the second piston. The spring is disposed between the second piston and one end of the cylinder configured to urge the second piston towards the expansible fluid chamber. The fluid flow passage extends from a compression chamber of a shock absorber into the expansible fluid chamber to provide a sprung fluid capacitive storage for the shock absorber.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

Each fluid valve <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> communicates with a piston and reservoir assembly <b>34</b>. Assembly <b>10</b> is installed between articulating components of a suspension or shock absorbing mechanism, such as a vehicle suspension, using a bushing and bolt (not shown) through top-most bushing bore <b>17</b> and a bolt and bushing (not shown) that extends through bottom-most clevis <b>18</b>. Clevis <b>18</b> is affixed to a bottom end of a reciprocating piston rod assembly <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a compound sectional and perspective view from above of the hydraulic shock absorber assembly <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> taken along line <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a centerline sectional view through the main body and the auxiliary body cylindrical components for an exemplary hydraulic shock absorber assembly <b>10</b> according to one aspect. Shock absorber assembly <b>10</b> includes a sealed shock body <b>12</b> including a main cylindrical shock tube, or cylinder <b>36</b>, a bridge end cap <b>28</b>, and a dust cap <b>26</b>. End cap <b>28</b> is threaded in sealed engagement via an o-ring seal <b>38</b> to tube <b>36</b>. Optionally, shock body <b>12</b> can be made from one or more parts that are integrally formed together, or are welded or bonded together in assembly. A pair of fluid ports <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> fluid couple adjusters <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively, with compression chamber <b>76</b>. Shock absorber assembly <b>10</b> also includes piston rod assembly <b>14</b> having a hollow piston rod, or shaft <b>20</b>, a mid-valve piston <b>22</b> moveable within tube <b>36</b> between a compression chamber <b>76</b> and a rebound chamber <b>78</b> each filled with hydraulic fluid (not shown). A clevis <b>18</b> is provided affixed to a bottom end of piston rod <b>20</b>, forming piston rod assembly <b>14</b> for affixing to a frame member or a vehicle component. A top cap assembly, or bridge <b>16</b> is affixed atop cylinder <b>12</b> opposite clevis <b>38</b> and includes a bushing bore post <b>17</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) for affixing a top end of shock <b>10</b>. Movement of mid-valve piston <b>22</b> within cylinder <b>12</b> causes hydraulic fluid contained within sealed shock body <b>12</b> to move through bi-directional resistance valving structures in mid-valve piston <b>22</b> and also through adjustors, or adjustable primary valve <b>30</b> and adjustable secondary valve <b>32</b>. A piston and reservoir assembly <b>34</b> includes a separator piston <b>48</b> (having a sliding o-ring seal <b>50</b>) that divides an inner portion of a reservoir body <b>46</b> into an oil filled chamber <b>82</b> and an air-filled chamber <b>84</b>.

In this way, fluid flow through piston body <b>100</b> is regulated by flow path resistance of ports <b>96</b> and spring resistance of shim stack <b>98</b> during a rebound movement of mid-valve piston assembly <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, inner circumferential piston <b>112</b> and outer circumferential piston <b>114</b> each have a beveled, or frustoconical piston surface <b>188</b> and <b>190</b> that seats in parallel engagement with a respective stationary frustoconical piston valve seat <b>192</b> and <b>194</b>.

Pursuant of a first implementation, inner spring stack <b>138</b> and outer spring stack <b>140</b> are constructed from wave coil springs of similar material. Since outer spring stack <b>140</b> has a larger diameter than inner spring stack <b>140</b>, this results in outer spring stack <b>140</b> compressing before spring stack <b>138</b>, enabling outer piston <b>114</b> to compress and open before inner piston <b>112</b>.
