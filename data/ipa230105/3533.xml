These designated routes, or &#x201c;patrol routes,&#x201d; may routinely position a safety officer within specific geographic areas during certain times of day. As a result, patrol routes may cause safety officers to regularly patrol the same designated patrol routes at certain times throughout a given day. In one example, a patrol route that includes a public high school may cause a safety officer to routinely patrol an area near the public high school once in the morning and again in the afternoon. In another example, a safety officer may regularly patrol a patrol route through a downtown area in the afternoon as workers are leaving their respective workplaces. However, such patrol routes may not account for people in nearby, or surrounding, geographic areas outside of the regularly designated patrol routes. As a result, people in certain geographic areas may not be in the presence of a safety officer for several hours, or days, despite being located proximate to the regularly designated patrol route. Additionally, such patrol routes may cause recurring patterns in which safety officers regularly encounter the same people while on patrol during specific times of day.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The accompanying figures, where like reference numerals refer to identical or functionally similar elements throughout the separate views, together with the detailed description below, are incorporated in and form part of the specification, and serve to further illustrate embodiments of concepts that include the claimed invention and explain various principles and advantages of those embodiments.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of selected elements of an example patrol route modification system, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate an example use case of a modified patrol route of a safety officer in an indoor geographic location, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate an example use case of a modified patrol route of a safety officer in an outdoor geographic location, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating selected elements of an example process for modifying and transmitting a patrol route, in accordance with some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale.

In response to determining that a respective characteristic for the given person cannot be identified, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may electronically store a generic entry in elapsed time database <b>160</b> for the given person.

For example, if a respective characteristic associated with a given person in a geographic area <b>110</b> is a medical bracelet (as captured by monitoring devices <b>120</b> via, for example, an RFID or image capture sensor), electronic computing device <b>150</b> may determine that the given person may be in more frequent need of medical assistance than other persons located in the geographic area <b>110</b>. Here, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may determine a weight to be applied to the elapsed time value for the given person indicating a higher priority, modify the elapsed time value for the given person based on the determined weight, and update the elapsed time value for the given person in elapsed time database <b>160</b>.

If electronic computing device <b>150</b> identifies that a given person is currently located within the restricted geographic area <b>110</b>, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may identify the respective characteristics associated with the given person and compare the identified respective characteristics to respective characteristics of authorized personnel, for example, such as a badge, safety helmet, orange vest, and the like.

For example, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may apply a weight of 30 minutes to respective elapsed time values of persons under 10 years of age, a weight of 20 minutes for persons between 10 and 20 years of age, a weight of 10 minutes for persons between 20 and 30 years of age, a weight of 1 minute for persons between 30 and 40 years of age, and a weight of 40 minutes for persons over 40 years of age. In one embodiment, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may apply a weight to the respective elapsed time value of a given person by multiplying the respective elapsed time value by the determined weight. For example, if a given person between 20 and 30 years of age has an elapsed time value of 40 minutes, electronic computing device 150 may multiply the elapsed time value of the given person by a weight of 10 minutes to yield an elapsed time value of 400 minutes.

For example, if the total elapsed time values for geographic areas <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> are determined to be 10 hours, 5 hours, and 15 hours, respectively, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may modify the patrol route of the safety officer <b>180</b> to include geographic area <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> when it was not previously included in the patrol route, or may modify the patrol route of the safety officer <b>180</b> to raise the order of geographic area <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> relative to other geographic areas in the prior patrol route. In another embodiment, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may determine that a patrol route for a safety officer <b>180</b> should be modified in response to one or more respective elapsed time values for persons in a geographic location exceeding a threshold elapsed time value. For example, if the respective elapsed time values for three persons in geographic area <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> are 5 hours, 2 hours, and 11 hours and the threshold elapsed time value associated with the geographic location, or geographic area <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, is 10 hours, electronic computing device may modify the patrol route of the safety officer <b>180</b> to include geographic area <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> such that safety officer <b>180</b> may be within a threshold proximity to the person having a respective elapsed time value of 11 hours. Electronic computing device <b>150</b> may then transmit the modified patrol route to the safety officer <b>180</b>, for example, via portable electronic communication device <b>190</b>.

For example, a geographic area <b>110</b> having a total elapsed time value above the threshold elapsed time value may be indicated using a red color within the heatmap. In another example, a geographic area <b>110</b> having a total elapsed time value approaching the threshold elapsed time value may be indicated using an orange color within the heatmap. In response to detecting an instance in which the safety officer <b>180</b> patrols a given geographic area <b>110</b>, the color indicating the total elapsed time value for the given geographic area <b>110</b> may change to a different color, such as blue or indigo, to indicate that the total elapsed time value has been reset to zero. In one embodiment, electronic computing device <b>150</b> may overlay each color indicating a total elapsed time value over an image of a geographic location, such as the image electronically stored in patrol route database <b>140</b>, to generate the heatmap.

In one embodiment, the predicted patrol route for the safety officer <b>180</b> may be based on previous total elapsed time values for the given geographic area <b>110</b> at the given time of day.
