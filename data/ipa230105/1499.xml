As the power demands of the manufacturing processes continue to increase, the RF power generators developed to supply RF power to manufacturing vessels continue to evolve in order to meet the ever-increasing demands. Conventional generators typically use one or more pairs of power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) to generate the desired RF power. As manufacturing demands and tolerances continue to increase, alternatives to MOSFETs are considered for the RF power devices. One such alternative is gallium nitride (GaN) transistors. Gallium nitride transistors typically provide more gain and higher frequency and do so at improved efficiency compared to MOSFET technology. Gallium nitride also has a high activation, which results in desirable thermal properties and a significantly higher breakdown voltage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Whether RF power devices are using MOSFET or GaN devices, both devices generate heat, which must be dissipated in order to protect the RF power devices and the RF generator housing the RF power devices. One particular benefit of GaN devices is that they may be board mounted, as compared to flange mounted, as MOSFET power devices are typically mounted in RF generators. Board mounting can both preserve space and reduce costs. However, board mounted power transistors present particular challenges with respect to heat dissipation. It should be understood that while the present disclosure discusses GaN transistors, the disclosure herein is also equally applicable to other board-mounted power transistors, including in a non-limiting example processors, microprocessors, and the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Some GaN devices may be top cooled. A top cooled device requires a thermal interface material, such as a pad between the device and heatsink. However, such a configuration exerts pressure on the solder joint which must be limited to a predetermined pressure in order to prevent damage to the solder joint. Such top cooled devices can result in the bending of the GaN power transistors since bending and GaN power transistors may be limited to 50-120 &#x3bc;m. Depending on the style, use of a thermal interface material and heat sink requires fairly tight tolerances. Other GaN devices may be bottom cooled. For high heat dissipation, thermal vias may be manufactured into the circuit board to which the GaN devices are mounted. Further, a thermal pad under pressure may be used to increase cooling of such board mount devices. Ideally, pressure should be applied in a way to eliminate any bending stresses on the GaN power devices and the board to which the GaN power devices are mounted. In either the top cooled or bottom cooled configurations, using a thermal pad typically requires a clamp in order to improve heat transfer to enhance the cooling.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Present clamps fail to provide the desired combination of sufficient clamping force while limiting bending of the GaN power transistors, the solder joints, and the circuit board to which the GaN power transistors are mounted. Conventional clamps typically provide either a linear, edge, or point source pressure between the power transistor and the circuit board, which fails to provide the desired uniform pressure and often limits adjustability of the clamping force. An example clamping device that provides uniform linear, edge, or point source pressure include spring clips. Other clamping devices use multiple fasteners arranged about a periphery of the power transistor device to cause a pressure plate to apply a clamping force between the power transistor and the board RF power to which the board transistors are mounted. However, such plates are typically clamped at a point source location, defined by each of the fasteners, so that bending and non-uniform pressure can still result.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a circuit board assembly <b>100</b> including the circuit board <b>110</b> connected to a heat sink <b>114</b> via one or more thermal pads <b>116</b>.

In some examples, the interface circuit(s) may implement wired or wireless interfaces that connect to a local area network (LAN) or a wireless personal area network (WPAN). Examples of a LAN are Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 802.11-2020 (also known as the WIFI wireless networking standard) and IEEE Standard 802.3-2018 (also known as the ETHERNET wired networking standard). Examples of a WPAN are IEEE Standard 802.15.4 (including the ZIGBEE standard from the ZigBee Alliance) and, from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), the BLUETOOTH wireless networking standard (including Core Specification versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, and 5.1 from the Bluetooth SIG).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The module may communicate with other modules using the interface circuit(s). Although the module may be depicted in the present disclosure as logically communicating directly with other modules, in various implementations the module may actually communicate via a communications system. The communications system includes physical and/or virtual networking equipment such as hubs, switches, routers, and gateways. In some implementations, the communications system connects to or traverses a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet. For example, the communications system may include multiple LANs connected to each other over the Internet or point-to-point leased lines using technologies including Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and virtual private networks (VPNs).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various implementations, the functionality of the module may be distributed among multiple modules that are connected via the communications system. For example, multiple modules may implement the same functionality distributed by a load balancing system. In a further example, the functionality of the module may be split between a server (also known as remote, or cloud) module and a client (or, user) module. For example, the client module may include a native or web application executing on a client device and in network communication with the server module.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Some or all hardware features of a module may be defined using a language for hardware description, such as IEEE Standard 1364-2005 (commonly called &#x201c;Verilog&#x201d;) and IEEE Standard 1076-2008 (commonly called &#x201c;VHDL&#x201d;). The hardware description language may be used to manufacture and/or program a hardware circuit. In some implementations, some or all features of a module may be defined by a language, such as IEEE 1666-2005 (commonly called &#x201c;SystemC&#x201d;), that encompasses both code, as described below, and hardware description.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term code, as used above, may include software, firmware, and/or microcode, and may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, data structures, and/or objects. Shared processor hardware encompasses a single microprocessor that executes some or all code from multiple modules. Group processor hardware encompasses a microprocessor that, in combination with additional microprocessors, executes some or all code from one or more modules. References to multiple microprocessors encompass multiple microprocessors on discrete dies, multiple microprocessors on a single die, multiple cores of a single microprocessor, multiple threads of a single microprocessor, or a combination of the above.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The memory hardware may also store data together with or separate from the code. Shared memory hardware encompasses a single memory device that stores some or all code from multiple modules. One example of shared memory hardware may be level 1 cache on or near a microprocessor die, which may store code from multiple modules. Another example of shared memory hardware may be persistent storage, such as a solid state drive (SSD), which may store code from multiple modules. Group memory hardware encompasses a memory device that, in combination with other memory devices, stores some or all code from one or more modules. One example of group memory hardware is a storage area network (SAN), which may store code of a particular module across multiple physical devices. Another example of group memory hardware is random access memory of each of a set of servers that, in combination, store code of a particular module.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The term memory hardware is a subset of the term computer-readable medium. The term computer-readable medium, as used herein, does not encompass transitory electrical or electromagnetic signals propagating through a medium (such as on a carrier wave); the term computer-readable medium is therefore considered tangible and non-transitory. Non-limiting examples of a non-transitory computer-readable medium are nonvolatile memory devices (such as a flash memory device, an erasable programmable read-only memory device, or a mask read-only memory device), volatile memory devices (such as a static random access memory device or a dynamic random access memory device), magnetic storage media (such as an analog or digital magnetic tape or a hard disk drive), and optical storage media (such as a CD, a DVD, or a Blu-ray Disc).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The apparatuses and methods described in this application may be partially or fully implemented by a special purpose computer created by configuring a general purpose computer to execute one or more particular functions embodied in computer programs.
