num="0001">The present application relates to apparatus and methods for rotating camera and microphone configurations, but not exclusively for rotating camera and microphone configurations within spatial audio capture apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Spatial audio capture is a rapidly developing field of investigation. Conventionally a capture device has a microphone configuration which is fixed relative to the camera. In such configurations the spatial relationship between the camera or cameras and the microphones is fixed and aligning the spatial audio signal and video images is a simple operation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example spatial audio which has the ability to determine audio directions in a plane can be captured using a device comprising 3 microphones and to determine audio direction in all directions can be captured using a device comprising 4 microphones.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Audio directions can be typically analysed based on level and phase/time differences of microphone signals. The physical configuration affects audio signals coming from different directions differently and different microphone locations cause sound from different directions to arrive at different time to the microphones. The different arrival times TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) can be used to determine directions using known methods. With the fixed distances and locations of the microphones relative to the camera these directions can be aligned with the camera direction in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There may be in some situations a capture device which has the ability to move or rotate the camera relative to the microphones. In such capture devices there is a need to be able to more efficiently handle the audio signals generated, for example to maintain a &#x2018;correct&#x2019; alignment otherwise the difference between objects in the video images and the audio directions may be distracting for the user of the playback apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is provided according to a first aspect an apparatus comprising: a first part, the first part having at least one camera configured to capture images;

Many different capture and direction analysis algorithms exist.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">If a spatial audio signal is accurately captured then the spatial audio signal can be rotated.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Rotating cameras enable many different use cases. Some microphone locations are more optimal for some use cases and different microphone locations are needed for others. Use case examples include:</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Teleconferences where the capture device is located on a table and the camera can be configured to turn to an active speaker;</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Video recording where the user holds the capture device in their hand; and</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Selfie recording where the camera can be configured to be turned towards the user.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Additionally there is further complexity in that the capture device may be operated in either portrait or landscape orientation.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As discussed above spatial audio directions are typically determined based on an analysis of level and phase/time differences of microphone audio signals. The configuration of the physical device defines the directions and the distances of the microphones which affects the captured audio signals. This can therefore sometimes help allowing larger differences to the microphone audio signals where there is a large physical distance between the microphones, but it can also be a hindrance. In some configurations the microphone locations are such that the acoustic waves which are converted into the audio signals may travel around the device using several paths that are close similar but have slightly difference level and phase/time differences. This produces errors in any level and phase/time difference estimations and disturbs direction detection.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">An example of designed microphone configurations is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The example capture device <b>101</b> on the left hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a fixed configuration of a camera <b>115</b> mounted at the top left of one face of the device <b>101</b>. The capture device furthermore comprises 3 microphones, a first microphone <b>114</b> located at the top middle of the same face as the camera <b>115</b>, a second microphone <b>112</b> located at the bottom middle of the same face as the camera <b>115</b> and a third microphone <b>116</b> located at the top middle of the face opposite to the camera <b>115</b>. This configuration attempts to optimized spatial capture when the device is operated in a landscape orientation because it has 3 microphones in approximately a horizontal plane (when the device is in landscape orientation) that optimizes capture of directions in a horizontal plane which is important for spatial audio.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">This configuration is also designed such that the microphones are away from corners where users typically hold the device <b>101</b> when operating in landscape orientation.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The example capture device <b>103</b> on the right hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a fixed configuration of a camera <b>125</b> mounted at the same top left of one face of the device <b>103</b>. The capture device however in this design comprises 3 microphones, a first microphone <b>124</b> located at the top mid-right of the same face as the camera <b>115</b>, a second microphone <b>112</b> located at the top mid-left of the same face as the camera <b>115</b> and a third microphone <b>116</b> located at the top middle of the face opposite to the camera <b>115</b>. This configuration attempts to optimize spatial audio capture in portrait orientation as it has 3 microphones in approximately a horizontal plane (when the device is operated in portrait orientation) that optimizes capture of directions in a horizontal plane which is important for spatial audio. The microphones are for the same reasons above located away from the device bottom where users typically hold the device when using it in portrait orientation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">As indicated before audio direction detection is often based on analysing differences between microphone signals. The capture device itself may disturb this analysis because the microphones are no longer in free-field conditions. Often optimal location for the microphones for direction detection is to be near edges where they are closer to free-field conditions than in the middle of a facet. In particular, if microphones in a pair are further away from an edge than is their distance from each other then there may be problems in performing direction analysis.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Rotating camera product concepts have been introduced by several manufacturers which reduces the number of cameras needed in a mobile device. For example, the requirement for a selfie camera would become redundant as well as large field-of-view cameras to some extent.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">When a capture device captures both (spatial) audio signals and video or image data, these need to be aligned or to match. Where sound source directions in the audio signal do not match a corresponding visual object direction in the image or video data, the resulting playback of video and audio signals will be incorrect and may produce the effect of looking at a subject talking form a first direction but hearing their voice from a second difference direction creating a perceptual error which may make the user disorientated or dizzy. In a device where the camera may rotate the captured audio signals need to be modified to keep the alignment or match between audio and video object directions. In addition, mobile devices may be used in many orientations (landscape, portrait, on a table etc.) and therefore the audio alignment has to take many differing inputs into consideration.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">For example if the device has only 3 microphones that do not rotate with the camera, the problem is that not all use cases can be served optimally regardless of the microphone locations.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore if the device has 4 microphones, then there may be a good location configuration for microphones so that all use cases can be served but the microphones may be positioned such that the user may easily cover them with their hands or the microphones may be located in places where detecting some directions is difficult.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In configurations with 5 microphones, then there may be configurations or designs where the microphone locations are not easily covered by the user's hands and most if not all directions can be detected with suitable accuracy.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">One proposal as explored in further detail within the embodiments described herein is to place all of the microphones on the rotating camera part. However the rotating camera part is typically small and placing all of the microphones on this part although would enable the alignment between microphone audio signals and thus the spatial audio signals and the images captured by the camera would solve the audio rotation issue above. However the design of locating the camera and microphones on the rotating part causes the microphones to be generally too close and therefore the audio signals from the microphones are highly correlated. Highly correlated audio signals produce a poorer result for several reasons but particularly beamforming at lower frequencies or for direction analysis at low frequencies.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The concepts which are described with respect to the following embodiments include:</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">specific microphone locations for a device with a rotating camera;</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">analyzing audio directions differently in different camera rotations;</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">analyzing audio directions similarly for low frequencies independent of camera rotation and analyzing directions for high frequencies differently depending on camera rotation; and</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">creating spatial and non-spatial audio depending on camera rotation and device orientation.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Additionally a rotating camera part with some microphones located on it can make direction analysis difficult when microphones move with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Additionally microphones have sound ports to allow the acoustic waves to pass to the microphones and furthermore require a hole or aperture in a device cover to prevent a significant attenuation of the acoustic waves by the cover. These holes in the cover are problematic as the current trend of making edge-to-edge displays leaves little space for holes. Additionally a user's hands can cover these holes or create handling noise issues as hands move over the holes. Holes are furthermore in some situations deemed aesthetically problematic and cause designers to locate them where they less apparent but typically acoustically problematic, such as next to a camera which may have noisy moving parts.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The concept as discussed herein in the embodiments is a capture device with microphones and rotating camera which can be configured to implement spatial audio capture and alignment with the camera images in such a manner that the user watching and listening is provided with a quality audio signal which is perceptually in alignment with any video images and additionally is able to suitably place holes or ports.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">A first example capture device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The capture device in this example is a mobile device with 4 microphones located within the device body main part and a camera located in a rotating camera part axially rotatable from the main part. The device configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> having the microphones located in the main part is therefore configured not to rotate with the camera. The mobile device is configured to receive acoustic waves from substantially all directions using the microphones to generate audio signals and from these microphone audio signals create a rotated spatial audio signal where sound object directions match or are aligned with corresponding video object directions (from the camera) regardless of the device orientation and camera part orientation. In some embodiments audio direction detection is implemented based on the direction or orientation of the camera part because the camera part rotation affects microphone signal delays and levels.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The Focusing can be done using beamforming or spatial filtering where audio directions are analysed, and audio is amplified/attenuated based on analysed directions. These three microphones make it possible to analyse audio directions in a plane but since the device can be used both in portrait and landscape orientations, we need directional analysis also in a direction perpendicular to that plane. Thus 4 microphones in total are needed.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> therefore shows as an example of such a configuration. A mobile device <b>200</b> which comprises a body on which the components can be mounted or located. The body can be divided into a main part <b>210</b> and camera part <b>220</b>. The main part <b>210</b> and camera part <b>220</b> are able to be rotate about an axis (show as dashed line <b>240</b>). The mobile device <b>200</b> shown on the left hand side of the figure shows when the camera part <b>220</b> is rotated 90 degrees from alignment with the main part <b>210</b> and on the right hand side of the figure shows the camera part <b>220</b> aligned with the main part <b>210</b> such that when in alignment the camera part and the main part appear substantially a single object.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the microphones are located on the main part <b>210</b>. This makes manufacturing the device easier because the microphones are in the same part where the device processor and motherboard are and thus wirings or other connections are shorter and less complex (and do not have to negotiate the rotating axis).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is shown a first microphone, microphone <b>1</b>, <b>218</b> located at the top centre of the main part <b>210</b> on a first face of the body of the mobile device. In the examples shown herein a face (of the body) of the mobile device is a side with larger dimensions such as height and width or larger area as compared to one of the edges of the body of the mobile device which is the side with a narrow dimension such as thickness or smaller area.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">A second microphone, microphone <b>2</b>, <b>212</b> is located at the bottom centre of the main part <b>210</b> on the first face of the body of the mobile device. In other words the first and second microphones are separated by the length (the longest dimension) of the main part of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">A third microphone, microphone <b>3</b>, <b>214</b> is located at the top centre of the main part <b>210</b> on a second face of the body of the mobile device, where the second face is the opposite side to the first face. The first and the third microphones are separated by the thickness of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">A fourth microphone, microphone <b>4</b>, <b>216</b> is located at the top left of the main part <b>210</b> on the first face of the bode of the mobile device. The first and fourth microphones are separated by half the width (the remaining dimension) of the main part of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Additionally is shown the rotating camera part <b>220</b> comprising a camera <b>205</b> located on a face of the rotating camera part such that when the rotating camera part <b>220</b> is aligned with the main part <b>210</b> the camera <b>205</b> and the first, second and fourth microphone are on the same &#x2018;face&#x2019;. However in some embodiments the camera <b>205</b> can be located on the edge of the mobile device, or any other suitable location on the rotating camera part.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The first microphone <b>218</b>, second microphone <b>212</b> and third microphone <b>214</b> are located such that they can be used to capture spatial audio when the device is operated in landscape mode when spatial audio horizontal directions are enough, and the first microphone <b>218</b>, second microphone <b>212</b>, third microphone <b>214</b> and fourth microphone <b>216</b> used if elevation directionality is required.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">When the device is used in portrait mode the first microphone <b>218</b>, third microphone <b>214</b> and fourth microphone <b>216</b> can be employed to capture spatial audio.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As the rotating camera part is close to the first microphone <b>218</b>, fourth microphone <b>216</b> and third microphone <b>214</b> and the changing device shape may affect audio direction detection and beamforming the device may take the camera part orientation or direction into account and analyse directions differently and use different beams depending on the camera part orientation.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">For example as in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the second microphone <b>212</b> is located further away from the camera part compared to the first microphone <b>218</b>, fourth microphone <b>216</b> and third microphone <b>214</b> any analysis that uses only second microphone <b>212</b> or uses the second microphone <b>212</b> in a pair with another microphone may implement an analysis in a same way for all camera directions (in other words is not affected or modified by the orientation of the camera part). In addition, as low frequencies are less disturbed by small rotating parts such as cameras any analysis may be implemented with no modification for all camera part orientations in low frequencies even if higher frequencies have modifications to processing based on the camera part orientations.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Direction analysis is typically done by finding the delay that gives maximum correlation between microphones. That delay is the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and known methods (e.g. multilateration, and the methods as discussed in WO2018/060549, US20130044884) are used to get the directions. As the microphones are not in a free-field environment and the device obstructs sound (and thus create audio shadows), the determined directions may need to be modified based on the device obstruction. The modification typically is a (look-up) table where an input is a determined or calculated direction and the output is a final output directions. The table is usually created by testing the device by playing sounds from different directions, calculating the estimated directions and then comparing two actual and estimated directions and putting the comparison result into the table. There may be a single table for directions at low frequencies but there may be different tables for directions at high frequencies each table representing different camera rotation. Also, the number of tables may depend on the microphones used in the directional determination. Thus for example when the microphones are located far away from each other or far away from the rotating camera part there may be fewer tables than for microphones that are close to each other and/or close to the rotating part.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">For example with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is shown a suitable spatial audio signal generation system according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The system shows the input microphone audio signals <b>300</b> being passed to an audio direction analyser <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The system may comprise an audio direction analyser <b>301</b> configured to receive the input microphone audio signals <b>300</b> and determine audio directions based on any suitable direction determination.

The audio directions modifier <b>303</b> may be configured to receive the directions from the audio direction analyser <b>301</b> and furthermore receive a camera rotation input <b>304</b> which provides a rotation parameter of the camera part relative to the main part of the body of the device. The audio directions modifier <b>303</b> as discussed above may use a series of look-up tables or any other suitable method to modify directions (for various frequency bands) based on the rotation parameter. Modification of the audio directions can be implemented in any suitable manner.

This device <b>503</b> can produce spatial audio in landscape but can only create spatial audio signals in some camera directions in portrait. The device <b>503</b> can focus to any direction on a horizontal plane (in landscape) but this is of little avail because the camera rotates on a vertical plane.

For example, 3 microphones can be used to create spatial audio (binaural, stereo, 5.1 etc) using methods in WO2018/060549. This type of parametric spatial audio can be rotated by modifying the direction parameter alpha. Also, known methods can be used to create Ambisonics audio. Ambisonics audio can be rotated by multiplying the multichannel (typically 4 channels in first order Ambisonics) signal with rotation matrices.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The first device <b>501</b> orientation (portrait or landscape) device microphones capture spatial audio that is rotated to match camera view direction and rotated spatial audio and camera images can be combined to create a video and the second device <b>503</b> orientation (landscape or portrait) microphones capture non-spatial audio and non-spatial audio and camera images are combined to create a video. In some embodiments audio direction detection is done differently in different camera directions because camera part rotation affects microphone signal delays and levels.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In some embodiments the mobile device can be equipped with more than 3 microphones and a rotating camera part. As in the embodiments described above the microphones do not rotate with the camera part. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example device which has 5 microphones. This mobile device <b>601</b> comprises 5 microphones and a rotating camera. The mobile device <b>601</b> is configured to detect audio directions from substantially all directions using microphone signals and creates rotated spatial audio signal where sound object directions in audio match corresponding video objects directions in video regardless of the device orientation and camera direction.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">The microphone locations are such that there are at least 4 microphones in areas that users don't typically touch and microphones are not far from device edges in both landscape and portrait orientations. Thus for example the device specifically comprises a first microphone, microphone <b>1</b>, <b>624</b> located at the top right of the main part <b>612</b> on a first face of the body of the mobile device. A second microphone, microphone <b>2</b>, <b>618</b> is located at the bottom centre of the main part <b>612</b> on the first face of the body of the mobile device. A third microphone, microphone <b>3</b>, <b>626</b> is located at the top right of the main part <b>612</b> on a second face of the body of the mobile device, where the second face is the opposite side to the first face. The first and the third microphones are therefore separated by the thickness of the device. A fourth microphone, microphone <b>4</b>, <b>614</b> is located at the bottom centre of the main part <b>612</b> on a second face of the body of the mobile device. The second and the fourth microphones are therefore separated by the thickness of the device. A fifth microphone, microphone <b>5</b>, <b>616</b> is located at the top centre of the main part <b>612</b> on the first face of the body of the mobile device. The first and the fifth microphones are therefore separated by half the width of the device.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments audio direction detection is implemented differently in different camera directions because camera part rotation affects microphone signal delays and levels.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In the example device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> microphones <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b> are approximately on the same plane as the camera rotation and are thus good for focusing audio to any direction where the camera can be rotated. Microphones <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> are approximately on a horizontal plane when the device is in landscape orientation and are therefore good for capturing spatial audio in landscape orientation. In this configuration it is only microphone <b>5</b> which is not near a device edge when camera is in default position but this is less of a problem because microphone <b>5</b> is most important for capturing spatial audio when the device is employed in a landscape orientation and the other microphones for this (microphones <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>) are located relatively far from microphone <b>5</b> and therefore a pairwise comparison of microphone signals produces good directional sensitivity. Furthermore this configuration enables elevation directions to be determined when the device is in an landscape orientation employing microphone <b>1</b> in addition to microphones <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>. Although the location of microphone <b>5</b> is not near a device edge and thus the elevation sensitivity (when compared pairwise to microphone <b>1</b>) is not as good as a configuration where the microphone is located at the edge (and has a greater separation) this is not as significant as human beings are less sensitive to accuracy of directions in elevation.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments at least two of the microphones are located on the rotatable camera part. For example in some embodiments the mobile device has at least 3 microphones that are positioned so that they are significantly in a plane with respect to the camera regardless of camera part rotation. The mobile device thus is able to capture or record spatial audio with microphones from both parts in one orientation and focused audio with microphones in the camera part in another orientation.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">For example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in some embodiments, three microphones (or more) are placed into a device with a rotating camera so that the microphones form a plane with the camera. In such embodiments two of the microphones rotate with the camera so that the plane always stays aligned with the camera direction. The three microphone signals are then used to create spatial audio using a suitable method.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">For example the device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> comprises a first microphone, microphone <b>1</b>, <b>716</b> located at the end of the rotating camera part <b>715</b> of the body of the mobile device. A second microphone, microphone <b>2</b>, <b>718</b> is located at the opposite end of the rotating camera part <b>715</b> of the body of the mobile device. A third microphone, microphone <b>3</b>, <b>714</b> is located at the bottom centre of the main part <b>712</b> on a first face of the body of the mobile device. The first and the second microphones are therefore separated by the width of the device. The first and the third and the second and the third are separated within one dimension by approximately the length of the device and in a perpendicular dimension by approximately half the width of the device.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The generation of the spatial audio signals from the audio signals can be performed for example based on the methods as described in US20130044884. The analysis for directions described in US20130044884 can remain fixed in all camera rotations because the plane of microphones rotates with the camera.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In some embodiments, audio can be focused to a direction that is dependent on the camera directions. Typically, if the camera is zoomed then audio would be focused towards camera view direction. Focusing can be done using a suitable beamforming operation. In such an operation microphones from the camera part are only used for beamforming because the beamforming direction is dependent on the microphone configuration and microphones located in the rotating camera part stay in the same configuration with respect to the camera.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In some embodiments where the camera is located or housed in the rotating camera part of the mobile device the camera part is significantly smaller than the rest of the device. The mobile device comprises at least 3 microphones, at least two microphones located in camera part and at least one camera located in the main part. In these embodiments the mobile device can be configured to use at least one microphone from the camera part and at least one microphone from the rest part to analyse audio directions for low frequencies and at least two microphones from the camera part to analyse audio directions for high frequencies. The analysed directions and microphone signals can then be used to create spatial audio signals. In some embodiments the mobile device may use the rotating camera part microphones in order to focus audio to at least one direction where the direction is dependent on the camera part rotation.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In some embodiments there may be configurations other than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, but there are always at least 2 microphones located in the camera part and at least 1 microphone in the main part. When audio directions are analysed based on phase or level differences between microphone signals the performance is better for the lower frequencies when using the bigger distance between microphones, for example the distance between one camera part microphone and one main part microphone when the main part microphone is located at the bottom of the mobile device because then the level and phase differences are bigger. Also, at lower frequencies the camera part is relatively smaller when compared to the wavelength of audio than at high frequencies and furthermore even when the camera part is rotated this rotation has less effect on the analysis as much as for the higher frequency analysis.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The analysis can in some embodiments be rotation independent in some embodiments. In some embodiments the analysis may differ for some camera rotations but only a small number or few different analyses are needed to obtain the values needed for rotation compensation.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">For higher frequencies the rotating camera part is likely to disturb the analysis when done in different rotations when both camera part microphones and main part microphones are used because the wavelength of the audio is closer to the dimensions of the camera part. Therefore, for higher frequencies a directional analysis should be implemented using only camera part microphone audio signals. In such embodiments there may be an additional benefit in that since the camera part rotates both the camera and the microphones the analysis can be the same for all camera rotations when we are interested in audio directions with respect to the camera as is usually the case.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">The analysed directions and microphone signals can then be used to create a spatial audio signal as in US20130044884.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In some embodiments the mobile device is configured to analyse audio directions for some camera rotations using microphones from both parts and for other camera rotations using microphones only from the camera part. These analysed directions together with microphone signals are used to create spatial audio.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">As the rotating camera part changes the way sound travels around the device when the camera part is rotated it would be expected that audio direction analysis is dependent on the camera rotation. As indicated this may require a large number of different analysis for many directions. In some embodiments the analysis is thus performed differently for only a number of fixed camera rotations, for example 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees that are most commonly used for example for selfies, landscape videos etc. Microphones from both the rotating camera part and the main part are used for analysing audio directions in these fixed camera rotations for best accuracy in all frequencies. The same analysis may be used around these fixed directions so that for example the analysis that is used for 0 degrees is also used for rotations around 0 degrees i.e. from &#x2212;20 to 20 degrees rotations. Outside the fixed rotations and their neighbourhood, the device switches to using only rotating camera part microphones for direction analysis. This is because those microphones rotate with the camera and a single analysis can be used for all camera directions.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">In some embodiments two or more microphones in the camera part are used for audio focusing (typically beamforming) and spatial audio is created using both the main and rotating part microphones or only the main part microphones. Spatial audio and focused audio are combined to create an audio signal that is spatial but that emphasizes the focused direction.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In some embodiments the audio can be focused to a direction using any suitable method. For example in some embodiments the focusing is implemented by beamforming. Beamforming (and most if not all of the other known focusing methods) requires that microphone locations are known and the locations with respect of the camera are known if the focus direction is desired to be relative to the camera direction. Therefore in some embodiments beamforming can be implemented using camera part microphones only since they rotate with the camera and their locations are thus fixed relative to the camera and each other.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Spatial audio typically requires some separation between microphones so that the microphone signals contain the natural decorrelation of the acoustic space where the recording is done. This is, in particular, true for a mobile device that uses an omnidirectional microphone. (Omnidirectional microphones are used because they are cheaper and more resilient to wind noise than directional microphones.)</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">In some embodiments a mobile device comprising a rotating camera part and main part may be configured such that an effective microphone location changes as the camera rotates because the sound port of the microphone is revealed under the rotating camera part. This enables the same microphone to be used in different use cases to create spatial audio where use cases require different microphone locations.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">As microphones are typically located inside the mobile device, there is a sound port which is configured to connect the microphone to the outside the device so that sounds from outside the device can reach the microphone. For spatial audio capture an important characteristic of the microphone is how the microphone reacts differently for sounds from different directions. The sound port and the sound port hole (the interface between the sound port and the exterior of the mobile device) in the cover of the device is important because outside the port sounds from different directions travel different paths but inside the sound port all sounds travel the same path. Therefore, sound port locations define the microphone effective location for spatial audio capture.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">An example of this may be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> for example shows an example mobile device <b>801</b> with a rotating camera part <b>807</b> and a main part <b>803</b>. The rotating camera part <b>807</b> comprises a camera <b>805</b> located at the end of the rotating camera part <b>807</b>. Additionally is shown two microphones located within the main part. A first microphone, mic<b>2</b>, <b>815</b> is located in the main part with a sound port <b>807</b> which exits the mobile device main part on one of the faces. This is representative of a normal microphone with a sound port which has the same effective location for all camera part rotations. Thus the effective location of the microphone is constant and independent of the rotation of the rotating camera part <b>807</b>.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Additionally is shown a further microphone, mic <b>1</b>, <b>817</b>. The further microphone is coupled to a sound port which is shown as a port <b>827</b> which has a first exit at a first location <b>821</b> at the face of the main body when the rotating camera part is closed and a second location <b>819</b> over the microphone on the top surface of the main part <b>803</b>. This second location <b>819</b> is blocked when the rotating camera part is in closed position (or in an aligned angle) with respect to the main part (in other words when both parts are aligned with each other) and is open when the rotating camera part is in an open or non-aligned angle (when one part is not aligned with the other). This causes the effective location of the microphone to change as the second location <b>819</b> is exposed.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Thus, for example, when the rotating camera part is closed the microphones <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> effective locations <b>821</b> and <b>807</b> are respectively to the left and right from the camera axis and the microphones can be used to capture stereo audio. The rotating camera part may be closed in two possible camera directions. If the camera is pointing &#x201c;right&#x201d; (top-right in the figure) then mic <b>1</b> <b>817</b> is to the right from the axis and mic <b>2</b> <b>815</b> is to the left and they came be used to capture left and right audio signals. When the camera is pointing &#x201c;left&#x201d; (bottom-left in the figure) then mic <b>1</b> <b>817</b> is to the left and mic <b>2</b> <b>815</b> is to the right of the camera axis and they can be used to capture left and right audio signals.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">When the camera part is open as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, then the effective location <b>819</b> of mic <b>1</b> <b>817</b> is changed and now mic <b>1</b> <b>817</b> is the left microphone and mic <b>2</b> <b>815</b> is the right microphone. Both microphones are to the right of the camera axis but this small sideways shift is not significant for stereo audio capture as long as there is a left/right separation with respect to the camera axis between the microphones. Again, if the camera points 180 degrees to the opposite direction compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, then mic <b>2</b> <b>815</b> becomes the left microphone and mic <b>1</b> <b>817</b> becomes the right microphone.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">When there are at least 3 microphones, spatial audio can be created using known methods such as presented in WO2018/060549, US20130044884. The changing effective microphone locations is taken into account by changing the direction calculation according to the current effective microphone locations.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">In some embodiments the effective microphone location changes when the camera rotates because the sound port of the microphone is revealed under the rotating camera part. The effective location changes gradually as the camera part moves. This enables the same microphone to be used in different use cases to create spatial audio where use cases require different microphone locations.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">These embodiments are similar to those described above but in these embodiments the microphone effective location changes gradually and can be configured to be defined for a range of camera rotations.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">For example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a mobile device <b>901</b> with a rotating camera part <b>907</b> and a main part <b>903</b>. The rotating camera part <b>907</b> comprises a camera <b>905</b> located at the end of the rotating camera part <b>807</b>. Additionally is shown a microphone located within the main part, mic<b>1</b>, <b>917</b> with a sound port <b>921</b> which is formed as an open slot or groove within the main part. The open slot or groove has one end at the microphone <b>917</b> and another end at one of the faces of the main part. This open slot or groove is such that as the rotating camera part rotates from a closed or aligned angle with respect to the main part (when both parts are aligned with each other) to an open or non-aligned angle (when one part is not aligned with the other) then the effective location of the microphone changes as a different part of the groove is exposed. Thus the effective location of the microphone is a first location at the face of the main body when the rotating camera part closed and a second location over the microphone and at the opposite end of the open slot when the rotating camera part is open. The slot may be any suitable shape, for example curved or straight.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">The example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a single microphone and its groove, but typically devices would have at least two microphones and their grooves.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">For example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a plan view of an example mobile device is shown where the rotating camera part <b>1005</b>, shown by the dashed outline, is at various angles with respect to the main part <b>1003</b>, shown by the solid outline.
