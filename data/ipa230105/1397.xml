As means for solving these problems, a catalyst for converting light energy into chemical energy is attracting attention. It is expected that these problems should be solved all at once if carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) could be converted into a useful compound using inexhaustible solar energy. CO<sub>2 </sub>is, however, an end product of oxidation of carbon compounds, and hence is both physically and chemically very stable and has very low reactivity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Recently, some techniques for converting CO<sub>2 </sub>into a useful compound through reduction have been reported. For example, Patent Literature 1 describes a method for obtaining formic acid by reacting CO<sub>2 </sub>and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, and Patent Literature 2 describes a method for obtaining formic acid through reduction of CO<sub>2 </sub>caused by transferring, to a catalyst, an excited electron generated through light irradiation of a semiconductor electrode. Besides, Patent Literature 3 and Non Patent Literature 1 have reported a method for reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>to carbon monoxide by bringing a rhenium complex into contact with CO<sub>2 </sub>and irradiating the resultant with light. Furthermore, attempts have been made to electrochemically reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>in the presence of a metal complex catalyst (Patent Literature 4).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">[Patent Literature 1] JP-A-2004-217632</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">[Patent Literature 2] JP-A-2011-82144</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">[Patent Literature 3] JP-A-2013-180943</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0008">[Patent Literature 4] JP-A-2013-193056</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">[Non Patent Literature 1] J.

Besides, in Patent Literature 3 and Non Patent Literature 1, another catalyst such as a ruthenium complex is necessary for a photocatalytic reaction in addition to a reduction catalyst. Furthermore, in Patent Literature 4, a product resulting from the electrochemical treatment of CO<sub>2 </sub>is unknown.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">On the other hand, if carbon monoxide (CO) or formic acid can be selectively obtained through the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>, the thus obtained carbon monoxide can be a material of extremely various hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon is a chemical energy material similarly to petroleum. Besides, formic acid can be used for easily producing hydrogen through a reaction with a catalyst, and hence is expected as a liquid fuel which stores hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>selectively to carbon monoxide or formic acid by using electrical energy, a catalyst for use in the method, and an electrochemical reduction system.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0013">Therefore, the present inventor made various

formic acid by reacting CO<sub>2 </sub>with a metal complex represented by formula (1) or formula (2) and applying a voltage to the resultant reaction product, and that this reduction reaction proceeds even if the concentration of CO<sub>2 </sub>to be introduced is low, resulting in accomplishing the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">Specifically, the present invention

id="p-0107" num="0102">If a catalyst of the present invention and an electrochemical treatment are employed, carbon monoxide (CO) or formic acid can be efficiently produced from CO<sub>2 </sub>by simple means even if the CO<sub>2 </sub>is at a low concentration. Accordingly, carbon monoxide or formic acid which can be various chemical materials can be efficiently produced from a CO<sub>2</sub>-containing waste gas of facilities, such as a thermal power station or an ironworks, in which a combustion waste gas of an organic matter including petroleum is generated. Accordingly, carbon monoxide or formic acid which can be a raw material of a useful and energy-storing chemical substance such as hydrocarbon or hydrogen can be produced from a combustion waste gas of a fossil fuel such as petroleum, coal or natural gas, and therefore, contribution can be made to both energy reuse and CO<sub>2 </sub>emission reduction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0011" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram of a carbon monoxide production system of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram of an example of a reaction-side cell chamber of the carbon monoxide production system of the present invention.

Then, CO<sub>2 </sub>was allowed to pass through the thus obtained DMF-TEOA mixed solution for 30 minutes. IR spectrum change of the resultant solution is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Besides, change in color of the solution was observed. Furthermore, Ar was allowed to pass for 2 hours through the solution through which CO<sub>2 </sub>had passed, so as to remove dissolved CO<sub>2 </sub>from the solution.

It can be determined based on the shapes of these IR peaks that a newly produced complex retains a tricarbonyl structure. Besides, when CO<sub>2 </sub>was allowed to pass through, the color of the solution was changed from reddish brown to yellow, which suggests that some sort of reaction was caused between Re-DMF or Re-TEOA and CO<sub>2</sub>. Even if CO<sub>2 </sub>was allowed to pass through a DMF solution containing Re-DMF, the IR spectrum was not changed. Accordingly, it is presumed that the reaction is caused between Re-TEOA and CO<sub>2</sub>. Besides, the peak of the newly produced complex (Re&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>-TEOA) is positioned on a lower frequency side of the peak of Re-DMF but on a higher frequency side of the peak of Re-TEOA. This relationship in the wavelength reveals that the electron-donating property of a ligand of Re&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>-TEOA is stronger than that of a DMF ligand but weaker than that of a TEOA ligand.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0324">When Ar was allowed to pass through, the peaks of Re&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>-TEOA were largely reduced, and mainly the peaks of Re-TEOA were recovered.

Change in the IR spectrum caused by allowing the ambient air to pass through each of such solutions for 1 to 2 hours by using a diaphragm pump was observed.
