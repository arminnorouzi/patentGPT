Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for processing a highly transparent plastic workpiece having a first side and a second side using laser ablation, wherein a laser arrangement emits a laser beam, with the laser beam advancing into the plastic workpiece from the outside through the first side.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of Background Information</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Laser ablation, also called laser evaporation, denotes the removal of material from a surface by bombardment with a laser beam. A portion of the surface is thereby evaporated by the laser radiation or laser beam. Depending on the characteristics of the laser beam and of the material of the workpiece, a generation of plasma also occurs, as a result of which material on the surface evaporates and is consequently removed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A laser arrangement describes an arrangement by which a laser beam is generated, guided, and emitted. The laser arrangement thus comprises a laser generating apparatus, a laser guiding arrangement, and a laser guiding device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In known plastic processing methods using laser ablation, the laser beam advances into the plastic workpiece through the top side and evaporates material on the top side of the plastic workpiece. The evaporated material escapes into the surrounding environment from. the top side. in this case, it can occur that the evaporated material interacts with the laser beam, and thus affects the laser beam. This results in a potential source of error, which should be avoided. Accordingly, when designing the geometry that is to be produced, care must be taken that the evaporated material does not interact with the laser beam. This results in a number of design guidelines through which the design freedom of the workpiece is limited.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments are directed to a plastic processing method with a good design freedom.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, embodiments include a method of the type named at the outset in which the laser beam at least partially penetrates the plastic workpiece. The laser beam evaporates a portion of the plastic workpiece starting from the second side.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the method according to the invention, the laser beam at least partially penetrates the plastic workpiece, wherein the laser beam evaporates a portion of the plastic workpiece starting from the second side. The laser beam thus penetrates the plastic workpiece partially, with no material being evaporated on the first side. The second side is thereby arranged such that the laser beam can reach the second side from the first side. For this purpose, the first side is arranged essentially opposite of the second side, for example.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This arrangement results in the evaporated material not being able to interact with the laser beam, so that the laser beam can evaporate material in an unhindered and repeatable manner. This affords a high degree of design freedom.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, a plastic structure that is located around an evaporated region is altered such that said structure is no longer transparent and is thus impermeable by the laser beam. The plastic structure becomes &#x201c;dead&#x201d; in this region. As a result, the laser beam can no longer advance into the plastic workpiece from the outside through the altered plastic structure. With the method according to the invention, the plastic workpiece is processed in the direction of the first side starting from the second side, so that starting from unaltered plastic structure, the laser beam reaches a portion of the plastic workpiece that is to be processed. As a result, there is always transparent, unaltered plastic between the first side and the portion of the plastic workpiece that is to be processed. The plastic workpiece is thus processed against a direction of the laser beam. In this manner, it is possible to write 3D structures of any kind, provided that evaporated plastic can escape in the direction of the second side. A high degree of design freedom is thus achieved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the evaporated plastic escapes towards the outside. The plastic evaporated by the laser beam escapes from the plastic workpiece to a surrounding environment of the plastic workpiece. The direction &#x201c;towards the outside&#x201d; thereby corresponds, for example, to a direction which faces away from the workpiece and/or the laser beam. In this manner, an interaction between the laser beam and the evaporated portion of the plastic workpiece is avoided. This results in a good process reliability. In addition, a good design freedom is achieved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the portion of the plastic workpiece evaporates in the region of a focal point. The focal point describes a point at which the laser beam is focused. Therefore, a high power density occurs at this point, which results in an evaporation of the plastic workpiece in the region of the focal point. Furthermore, energy is introduced in this region in a targeted manner, so that a heating of the surrounding portion of the plastic workpiece is avoided. A change in the morphology of the plastic workpiece in the region around the focal point is thus avoided, so that material properties of the plastic workpiece remain unchanged. Accordingly, an aftertreatment of the plastic workpiece can be dispensed with, which results in good productivity and efficiency.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, undercuts and/or deep-hole geometries are produced using the method. Previous design possibilities for the laser ablation methods described in the introduction are expanded to include deep-hole geometries and undercuts, so that in addition to deep-hole geometries and undercuts, other geometries can also be produced. Deep-hole geometries describe, for example, geometries with a length or depth that is significantly larger than the diameter thereof. Thus, the length corresponds to at least three times the diameter, for example. Undercuts describe geometries in which unprocessed material is located along a line perpendicular to a plastic surface between the plastic surface and. a portion that is to be processed. Examples of an undercut include a helix geometry, spiral-shaped geometry, channels not arranged at a 90&#xb0; angle to the plastic surface, or the like. Because the evaporated portion of the plastic workpiece can escape in the direction of the surrounding environment, the evaporated portion of the plastic workpiece does not interact with the laser beam, so that there is no need to take the evaporated portion of the plastic workpiece into consideration in the design engineering and the design freedom is thus enhanced.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, nozzle bodies are produced using the method. Nozzle bodies, which are used for spray nozzles or the like for example, require intricate geometries, for example, which can be satisfied and produced in a precise manner with the described method. Examples of nozzle bodies include dual-stream nozzles, hollow-cone nozzles, or single-stream nozzles. As a result, a spray pattern of the nozzle body is improved and a design freedom of the nozzle bodies is increased.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The laser arrangement preferably emits a high-energy pulse. Through the high-energy pulse, energy is introduced into the plastic workpiece in the region of the focal point. As a result, material in the region of the focal point is evaporated abruptly, so that an introduction of heat into the material bordering the focal point is minimized. The regions of the plastic workpiece bordering the focal point are thus not morphologically affected. Accordingly, the plastic workpiece retains desired material properties on the unprocessed areas, so that an aftertreatment of the plastic workpiece can be avoided. This results in good efficiency.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the laser beam has a focal point, the dimensions of which lie in the range of 0.001 mm to 0.25 mm. Because the focal point has dimensions in the range of 0.001 mm to 0.25 mm, geometries with a resolution of 0.001 mm to 0.25 mm can be produced. Due to this precise resolution of the geometries, it is possible to produce even small, fine geometries that are below a resolution of injection molding processes, for example. A good design freedom is thus achieved.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The focal point is preferably a first focal point, wherein at least a second focal point lies adjacent to the first focal point. Through this focal point arrangement, it is possible to construct a geometry, or to evaporate a portion of the plastic workpiece, such that the evaporated portion of a second focal point can escape in the direction of the already-evaporated portion of the first focal point. The laser beam is thereby first focused at the first focal point and is subsequently focused at the second focal point, so that a single focal point is focused at a time. Alternatively, the laser beam can be emitted continuously, so that a focal point of the continuously emitted laser beam is transferred from a first point to a second point without being refocused. The ability to also produce undercuts or the like thus becomes possible.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, at least the first focal point and the second focal point lie on a predefined route. The route can thereby comprise additional focal points. Thus, a sequence of portions to be evaporated from the different focal points can be moved through in succession, whereby a desired geometry can be produced. The focal points are moved through in a chronological sequence, so that one focal point is focused at a time. Alternatively, the laser beam can be continuously emitted such that it is focused on one focal point and can be moved along the route. The route can thereby be planned and defined in advance, in order to achieve optimum efficiency. Furthermore, evaporated. material can escape through previously removed and/or evaporated regions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, a nozzle body is produced using a method according to the invention, wherein the nozzle body comprises, at least in part, highly transparent plastic. With the method, channels or recesses can be produced which, for example, have oblong-hole geometries, undercuts, or other geometries. The design freedom of nozzle bodies is thereby increased.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The nozzle body is preferably an atomizing nozzle. An atomizing nozzle is characterized in that the liquid is pressed through at least one channel and is subsequently atomized. The channel is designed differently depending on the requirements for the atomizing nozzle, with the channel also needing, to be adapted to the liquid being atomized, for example. Through the use of the method according to the invention, it is possible, for example, to create at least one undercut that is advantageous for the atomization of the liquid.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The nozzle body preferably comprises a filter arrangement. The filter arrangement is formed by a number of channels, wherein the channels should be smaller than phases in the liquid that are to be filtered. For this purpose, the filter arrangement should he composed of at least one channel, for example. This channel can be produced using the present method.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the nozzle body comprises at least one channel which is cylindrical and has a largest diameter essentially between 0.001 mm and 0.25 mm. Cylindrical thereby describes a prism-shaped geometry in which a cross sectional area is constant along a defined length. With the method, it is possible to produce just such a cylindrical channel with the dimensions indicated. This affords a high degree of design freedom of the nozzle body.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments are directed to a method for processing a plastic workpiece having a first side and a second side opposite the first side using laser ablation. The method includes advancing a laser beam into the plastic workpiece from outside of the plastic workpiece and through the first side to at least partially penetrate the plastic workpiece; and evaporating at least a portion of the plastic workpiece with the laser beam starting from the second side.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to embodiments, the evaporated plastic can escape toward the outside of the plastic workpiece.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with other embodiments, the at least a portion of the plastic workpiece can evaporate in a region of a focal point of the laser beam.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other embodiments, at least one of undercuts or deep-hole geometries may be producible in the plastic workpiece.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to still other embodiments, the plastic workpiece may be processed to produce a nozzle body. The at least one portion of the plastic workpiece evaporated by the laser beam can form at least one channel of the nozzle body. Further or alternatively, the at least one portion of the plastic workpiece evaporated by the laser beam may form a filter arrangement of the nozzle body.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with embodiments, the method can further include emitting the laser beam from a laser arrangement. The laser arrangement can emit a high-energy pulse.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other embodiments, the laser beam can have a focal point with dimensions in a range of 0.001 mm to 0.25 mm.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to other embodiments, the focal point may include a first focal point and at least a second focal point that lies adjacent to the first focal point. Further, at least one of the first focal point and the at least one second focal point may lie on a predefined route.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In embodiments, the plastic workpiece may include a highly transparent plastic workpiece.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to embodiments, the method may also include focusing a focal point of the laser beam on the second side and moving the focal point of the laser beam in a direction from the second side toward the first side. The method may also include moving the focal point of the laser crosswise to the direction from the second side to the first side.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In still other embodiments, the method may further include additional processing of the plastic workpiece, where the additional processing starts from the first side.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with embodiments, a nozzle body can be produced according to any of the above-described embodiments of the method.
