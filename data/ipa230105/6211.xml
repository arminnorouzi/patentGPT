However, these embodiments are exemplary, and the present invention is not limited thereto and is defined as the scope of the following claims.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A negative electrode of a lithium secondary battery of the present invention provides a negative electrode of a lithium secondary battery including a current collector and a negative electrode active material layer formed on the current collector, wherein the negative electrode active material layer includes a first negative electrode active material layer including a first negative electrode active material and a first binder and a second active material layer formed on the first active material layer and including a second negative electrode active material and a second binder.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a schematic structure of the negative electrode according to one embodiment may include a current collector <b>1</b>, a first active material layer <b>3</b> formed on the current collector, and a second active material layer <b>5</b> formed on the first active material layer. That is, the first active material layer is positioned in contact with the current collector, and the second active material layer is not in contact with the current collector and is positioned in contact with the first active material layer. Thus, when the current collector is referred to, the first active material layer may be a lower layer and the second active material layer may be an upper layer. If the active material layer is formed in a single layer, a migration phenomenon of the binder causes the binder to be mainly present on the surface of the electrode which is farther away from the current collector, and thus the resistance may be increased and the cycle-life may be also deteriorated. Furthermore, if the active material layer is formed in a single layer while the thickness of the active material layer is increased in order to increase capacity, pressing in the surface severely occurs rather than at the inner part of the negative electrode active material layer, and thus impregnability of the electrolyte is decreased and the movement of the lithium ions is reduced, thereby decreasing the charge efficiency and deteriorating the cycle-life characteristics. Otherwise, when the active material layer is formed in two layer, as shown in one embodiment of the present invention, the binder being mainly present on the surface of the electrode may be prevented, and the binder may be relatively positioned near the current collector, compared to a single active material layer, and thus it allows good adherence of the active material layer to the current collector, considering the total active material layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the content of the first binder is greater than that of the second binder. That is, the content of the first binder included in the first active material layer which is the lower layer in contact with the current collector is greater than that of the second binder included in the second active material layer which is the upper layer not in contact with the current collector.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A total content of the first binder and the second binder in the total negative electrode active material layer, may be 0.56 wt % to 10 wt % based on the total weight of the negative electrode active material layer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The content of the first binder may be 1 wt % to 10 wt %, or 1 wt % to 5 wt % based on the total weight of the first active material layer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, the content of the second binder may be 0.5 wt % to 10 wt %, or 0.5 wt % to 4 wt %, based on the total weight of the second active material layer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As such, the content of the first binder included in the first active material layer is greater than that of the second binder included in the second active material layer, and the desired ratio may be the ratio of the content of the second binder/the first binder of more than 0 and less than 1. Herein, the content of the first binder and the content of the second binder respectively indicate a value calculated by converting the amount of the active material included in each of the active material to 100 wt %. As shown above, when the content of the first binder included in the first active material layer is greater than that of the second binder in the second active material layer, the adherence of the first active material layer directly in contact with the current collector may be increased, and thus the stability of the battery may be improved. Furthermore, as the content of the second binder included in the second active material layer is smaller than that of the first binder included in the first active material layer, the electrical conductivity is high and pores in the active material layer may be maintained, and thus impregnability of the electrolyte may be increased and tortuosity may be remedied, thereby more freely moving lithium ions and improving the battery performance. If the content of the first binder included in the first active material layer is smaller than that of the second binder included in the second active material layer, the adhesion to the current collector may be deteriorated and separation may occur during charging and discharging.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A loading level of the negative electrode active material layer may be 10 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 30 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, a loading level of the first active material layer may be 4 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 25 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, a loading level of the second active material layer may be 4 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 25 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the loading level of the second active material layer may be equal to or more than the loading level of the first active material layer.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first active material layer which is positioned in direct contact with the current collector and that may have good adherence strength acts to maintain the structural safety and the second active material layer which has lower resistance than that of the first active material, and acts to secure good battery characteristics, so that it is desirable that the loading levels of the second active material layer and the first active material layer are controlled to the loading level of the second active material layer being the same as or greater than that of the first active material layer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to one embodiment, the ratio of the loading level of the first active material layer and the loading level of the second active material layer may be 1:1 to 1:7. When the loading level of the first active material layer and the loading level of the second active material layer are within the above range, the merits from the formation of the first active material layer and the second active material layer may be effectively obtained and the separation of the first active material layer and the second active material layer is effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first active material and the second active material may be a carbonaceous negative electrode active material, a Si-based negative electrode active material, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The carbonaceous negative electrode active material may be crystalline carbon, amorphous carbon, or a combination thereof. The crystalline carbon may be graphite such as with a non-specific shape, or sheet, flake, spherical, or fiber shaped natural graphite or artificial graphite. The amorphous carbon may be soft carbon, hard carbon, mesophase pitch carbide, fired cokes, or so on.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Si-based negative electrode active material may be Si, SiO<sub>x </sub>(0&#x3c;x&#x3c;2), a Si-Q alloy (where Q is an element selected from an alkaline metal, an alkaline-earth metal, a group 13 element, a group 14 element, a group 15 element, a group 16 element, a transitional metal, a rare earth element, or a combination thereof, and is not Si), a Si-carbon composite, Sn, SnO<sub>2</sub>, Sn&#x2014;R (where R is an element selected from an alkaline metal, an alkaline-earth metal, a group 13 element, a group 14 element, a group 15 element, a group 16 element, a transition metal, a rare earth element, or a combination thereof, and is not Sn), a Sn-carbon composite, and the like, and may use a mixture of at least one of these materials with SiO<sub>2</sub>. The elements Q and R may be one selected from Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Rf, V, Nb, Ta, db, Cr, Mo, W, Sg, Tc, Re, Bh, Fe, Pb, Ru, Os, Hs, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, B, Al, Ga, Sn, In, Ge, P, As, Sb, Bi, S, Se, Te, Po, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first active material may be the same as or different from the second active material. Particularly, as the first active material and the second active material, it may be desired that the active material with higher pellet density may be used as the second active material, among the carbonaceous negative electrode active material having a pellet density of 1.1 g/cc to 2.0 g/cc. That is, the pellet density of the second active material is smaller than that of the first active material by 0.01 g/cc to 0.5 g/cc. As described above, when the active material having higher pellet density is used in the first active material layer and the active material having lower pellet density is used in the second active material layer, the first active material layer is more compressed during the pressing of the electrode preparation to increase the adhesion and the second active material is relatively less compressed to effectively produce pores and thus the electrolyte may be well impregnated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The pellet density may be a powder pellet density or a slurry pellet density. The powder pellet density refers to a value measured from a pellet prepared using a negative electrode active material. The powder pellet preparation process may be performed by adding 0.5 g to 1.0 g of the negative electrode active material to a mold and maintaining it under a pressure of 1.0 tons to 2.0 tons for 20 seconds to 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The slurry pellet density refers to a value measured from a pellet prepared by mixing a negative electrode active material, binder, and optionally a conductive material to prepare a slurry, drying the slurry, pulverizing and pressing it. Herein, the pressurization may be performed by maintaining a pressure of 1.0 tons to 6.0 tons for 20 seconds to 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the average particle diameter (D50) of the first active material may be 5 &#x3bc;m to 25 &#x3bc;m, and the average particle diameter (D50) of the second active material may be 5 &#x3bc;m to 25 &#x3bc;m. Furthermore, it may be desired that the average particle diameter (D50) of the first active material is larger than the average particle diameter (D50) of the second active material, that is, the ratio of the average particle diameter (D50) of the first active material to the average particle diameter (D50) of the second active material (the average particle diameter (D50) of the first active material/the average particle diameter (D50) of the second active material) may be more than 1 and 4 or less.
