These applications are currently served by excimer or ion gas lasers, dye or solid-state lasers photopumped by gas lasers, or by lasers using nonlinear optical methods to convert visible laser light to UV wavelengths. These existing UV laser systems are large, mechanically sensitive, and inefficient compared to diode injection lasers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">After decades of research, electrically injected diode lasers have been demonstrated at wavelengths as short as 272 nm, albeit only under pulsed operation at relatively high voltage and low efficiency [1]. The primary impediments to shorter wavelength operation is that the wide band gap AlGaN semiconductor layers needed for deep UV (DUV) operation cannot be effectively doped, resulting in very poor electrical contacts and excessive voltage and optical loss. The main impediments can be described in short by saying that it is difficult to electrically inject the wide band gap AlGaN semiconductor layers needed for deep UV (DUV) operation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Indeed, when Mg doping was omitted from the AlN/AlGaN cladding and waveguide layers of DUV lasers of otherwise conventional design, and the structures were optically pumped by excimer lasers, laser oscillation was observed at wavelengths as low as 267 nm with reasonably low pump threshold fluences [2]. These experiments show that once carriers are introduced into the undoped wide band gap AlGaN or AlN layers, they may successfully diffuse to an active layer to produce laser gain.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One way to introduce carriers is through Auger effects. Vampola et al. [3] studied Auger-assisted carrier leakage from an electrically-driven InGaN quantum well into an adjacent AlGaN/GaN LED structure, observing visible light emission from a nearby monitor InGaN well. Binder et al. [4] and Nirschl et al. [5] also studied Auger scattering between nearby InGaN/GaN quantum wells. Iveland et al. [6] demonstrated surface emission of Auger scattered electrons from an electrically-driven InGaN quantum well LED, showing that such hot carriers may relax into a higher energy conduction band in GaN and transport to the surface as far as 200 nm away.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In all cases, the intent was to understand the role of Auger scattering in the efficiency droop of InGaN LEDs and no suggestion was made to intentionally use Auger scattering to pump UV emitters.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To overcome the limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding this specification, the present invention discloses a Group-III nitride light emitting device, based on carrier recombination in wide band gap semiconductor layers, that utilizes scattering of hot carriers internally generated by Auger recombination in an externally electrically-driven, relatively narrow band gap carrier generation region into a relatively wide band gap carrier recombination region, such that the relatively wide band gap carrier recombination region of the Group-III nitride light emitting device is internally electrically injected by the hot carriers generated in the externally electrically-driven relatively narrow band gap carrier generation region. The present invention therefore transforms the difficult task of electrical injection in a relatively wide band gap carrier recombination region into the much easier electrical injection in a relatively narrow band gap carrier generation region where hot carriers generated by Auger recombination will in turn excite the relatively wide band gap carrier recombination region.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A carrier reflecting structure may be incorporated into the device to redirect scattered hot carriers traveling away from an active region back toward an active region. A carrier anti-reflection structure may be incorporated into the device to increase transmission of the Auger scattered carriers toward an active region. Both the carrier reflecting and carrier anti-reflection structures may be made from one or more semiconductor layers or a semiconductor superlattice. For use in a laser, the carrier-reflecting and/or anti-reflection structures may be made with materials having a band gap and thickness such that the effective optical absorption edge is of higher energy than an intended operating photon energy.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a band diagram under bias of a c-plane embodiment of a laser diode according to the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a band diagram under bias of an m-plane embodiment of a laser diode according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of an c-plane embodiment of the laser diode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic view of an m-plane embodiment of the laser diode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, incorporating a Bragg reflector and antireflection superlattice to improve Auger injection into the laser diode's active region.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of an alternative embodiment of the laser diode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in which a second active region is incorporated, and which is designed to operate with a higher-order transverse optical mode.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a graph of depth vs. optical intensity for the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart showing the process steps for fabricating and operating a III-nitride based laser diode according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawing which forms a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Overview</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Practical diode lasers operating at wavelengths below 300 nm, e.g., ultraviolet wavelengths, have not yet been demonstrated, mainly because the required wide band gap of the semiconductor materials precludes formation of adequate electrical contacts. This invention describes the use of Auger scattering, usually thought of as an impediment to laser or LED performance, as a beneficial mechanism to electrically inject hot carriers into wide band gap materials without the need of direct electrical contact to those materials.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Specifically, the key innovation of the present invention is to introduce the carriers by Auger recombination from an adjacent lower band gap p-n junction that is electrically driven as in a visible diode laser. The result is an electrically driven single chip UV laser manufactured using standard microelectronic fabrication and packaging methods, without the need for critical alignment, mechanically robust and stable without precise temperature control, and with power and efficiency adequate for many portable applications.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Single chip diode lasers that operate at UV wavelengths offer many advantages over existing solid-state, ion and excimer, or frequency-doubled UV lasers, including miniaturization, low-cost mass production, mechanical and environmental stability, high speed modulation, wavelength tunability and high efficiency. Diode lasers with these advantages would not just replace existing lasers in existing applications such as lithography, industrial marking, (bio)chemical and environmental monitoring and scientific instrumentation, but would also enable a host of new portable applications in these diverse fields.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Technical Description</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention is best understood by reference to the band diagrams shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, as well as the accompanying physical structure shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a band diagram under bias of a c-plane embodiment of a Group-III nitride laser diode of the present invention, showing the band energy of both the conduction band edge Ec and the valence band edge Ev, as well as the positions of an Auger injector and an active region relative to a growth substrate. In this example, there is a 3.5 V injector bias and a 3.7 V back electrostatic bias.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of the c-plane embodiment of the laser diode <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, wherein the laser diode <b>200</b> is grown epitaxially on a growth substrate <b>201</b> or epitaxial transfer carrier, which may comprise a polar (0001) AlN substrate <b>201</b>, or on an AlN template itself grown lattice-mismatched upon a substrate <b>201</b> such as sapphire or SiC. An n-type AlGaN back electrostatic contact layer <b>202</b> may be included on or above the substrate <b>201</b>, as described in more detail below. The laser diode <b>200</b> further comprises an AlN lower cladding layer <b>203</b>, an optional step or graded AlGaN waveguide layer <b>204</b> of band gap smaller than the cladding layer <b>203</b>, an AlGaN active region <b>205</b> comprising one or more AlGaN layers of band gap smaller than the waveguide layer <b>204</b> separated by AlGaN layers of band gap larger than the active region <b>205</b> layers, another step or graded AlGaN waveguide layer <b>206</b> of composition similar to the first waveguide layer <b>204</b>, and another AlN cladding layer <b>207</b>. None of these layers <b>203</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>207</b> require doping for electrical conductivity.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Upon the last mentioned AlN cladding layer <b>207</b> is disposed a structure <b>208</b>, hereafter referred to as an Auger injector <b>208</b>, which is an electrically-driven p-n junction comprising an n-type InGaN Auger scattering layer <b>209</b>, typically with indium mole fraction between 0-30%, followed by a compositionally-graded p-type AlGaInN Auger carrier generation layer <b>210</b>, followed by a p-type AlGaN layer <b>211</b>, typically with aluminum mole fraction between 0-40%.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">These layers <b>209</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> may optionally be preceded and/or followed by one or more AlGaN layers or superlattices (not shown) that serve to reflect high energy (e.g., hot) Auger carriers traveling toward a p-GaN contact <b>212</b> back toward the active region <b>205</b> or suppress electron reflection at an interface between the injector <b>208</b> and cladding <b>207</b> of Auger carriers traveling toward the active region <b>205</b>. Such &#x201c;multiple quantum barrier&#x201d; blocking structures have been demonstrated in InGaN-based visible diode lasers [7], and multiple quantum barrier anti-reflection structures may be formed by altering the layer compositions and thicknesses, analogous to optical high-reflection Bragg or Rugate reflectors and anti-reflection multilayer coatings.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Any of these layers may be graded in composition and/or doping to better control carrier generation and injection into the wider bandgap laser structure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In operation, electron and hole currents are injected into the relatively low band gap Auger injector <b>208</b> p-n junction from the top and lateral anode and cathode electrodes <b>213</b>, <b>214</b>. Carriers are confined by the adjacent AlN structures <b>206</b>, <b>207</b> and AlGaN structure <b>211</b>, resulting in carrier densities well above 1&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, densities known to be high enough to efficiently produce energetic electrons and holes via interband Auger recombination [6]. These Auger scattered carriers possess enough kinetic energy to surmount the potential barrier at the interface to the AlN structures <b>206</b>, <b>207</b>, and so be injected into the AlN structures <b>206</b>, <b>207</b>, where they drift or diffuse toward the AlGaN active region <b>205</b> where they recombine to produce Spontaneous emission or produce laser gain.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Both Auger-scattered electrons and holes have been observed to escape from quantum wells in which they were generated, to be captured and radiatively recombine in adjacent quantum wells of different composition with higher recombination energies [4]. Auger carriers with momentum in the wrong direction may be at least partially redirected by the quasi-electric fields associated with compositional grading or by Bragg reflection by an optional blocking layer or layers or a superlattice. Bragg reflection is elastic so those carriers will retain enough energy to continue into the AlN cladding <b>207</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Unlike conventional design, no electrical contact is needed to the wide band gap cladding layers <b>203</b>, <b>207</b> or waveguide layers <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. The non-injecting contact layer <b>202</b> and accompanying back electrode <b>215</b> might be included below the first AlN cladding layer <b>203</b>, such as through a conducting SiC substrate or AlGaN layer of moderate composition, to electrostatically control band tilt in the wide band gap structure due to, for example, piezoelectric fields from polar heterointerfaces.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The optical mode propagating in the plane of the structure may be confined laterally by a rib structure and transversally by the Group-III nitride waveguide layers <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and cladding layers <b>203</b>, <b>207</b>, as in conventional design, or transversally by dielectric layers formed on each side of the structure after removal of the growth substrate, as demonstrated in near infrared lasers [8] and proposed by [9].</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At least one current component, preferably the electron current, must be injected laterally from one or both sides of the rib waveguide, i.e., via n-electrodes <b>214</b>, through a very thin conducting layer <b>209</b>. Calculations indicate that current spreading in an n-type GaN layer <b>209</b> only 2 nm thick will introduce an additional 10 Ohms to the series resistance of a 2 &#x3bc;m wide laser rib, which is undesirable but tolerable.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Auger scattering in a highly excited InGaN layer <b>209</b> may be quite efficient, consuming as much as 50% of the injected current in green-emitting InGaN lasers at threshold. It is thought that carrier localization in nanostructures such as self-assembled InGaN quantum dots or disks further increases the ratio of Auger recombination to radiative recombination [10]. It is also known that Auger scattering may arise due to defects or interfaces in AlGaN layers <b>211</b> or superlattices [11] through trap-assisted Auger recombination (TAAR). TAAR was observed to have very high efficiency in p-n junctions with single AlGaN barriers [11], but also to saturate at high injection currents, so multiple AlGaN barriers can be used to generate enough hot electron current through TAAR.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">If lasing and clamping of the carrier density in the Auger injector <b>208</b> is suppressed, for example, by using facet coatings that are antireflective at the band gap of the injector <b>208</b>, and with conventional carrier leakage from the injector <b>208</b> suppressed by the very wide band gap AlGaN layers <b>211</b> or AlN layers <b>206</b>, <b>207</b> adjacent to the injector <b>208</b>, the carrier density may be pushed high enough to reach an Auger scattering fraction of more than 90%.
