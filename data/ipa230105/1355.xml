More specifically, embodiments of the technology relate to a tangential flow filtration (TFF) assembly within a bioreactor. In some embodiments, the TFF assembly also functions as a baffle during bioprocessing within the bioreactor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Perfusion systems and processes involve filtration of fluid within a bioreactor during semi- and/or continuous bioprocessing. During filtration, target products or other soluble components, such as cellular waste materials (e.g., lactic acid and ammonia), are removed from the bioreactor. Perfusion processes rely on a high density of host cells being maintained throughout each production process, and continuous harvesting, which involves several iterations of filtration, potentially causing physical damage to the host cells. Additionally, conventional perfusion systems and processes use filter elements having open feed channels to avoid obstructions that could damage host cells. Filter elements used in such conventional systems and processes result in relatively low viability and exhibit significantly reduced sieving at low harvest throughputs due to membrane fouling.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Use of cylindrical bioreactor tanks or bags result in vortex formation during bioprocessing regardless of the type of impeller utilized for mixing. Vortices result in decreased mixing and stagnant zones. Baffles are placed within the reusable or single-use bioreactors disclosed herein to prevent or disrupt vortex formation and enhance fluid movement to improve mixing by delivering fluid into a more desirable flow pattern that includes both axial and radial flow. Baffles have also been used with dynamic membrane bioreactors.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The position of the vortex changes with aspect ratio. The region where the vortex would form in the absence of the baffle can be determined from experience or by mixing fluid in the inner volume under similar mixing conditions that will be used in operation, but in the absence of the baffle, and noting where the vortex forms. A &#x201c;vortex map&#x201d; can be created, documenting the location of the vortex for a given bioreactor aspect ratio, volume, mixer position, and mixer size.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Tangential flow filtration (TFF) is a separation process that uses membranes to separate components in a liquid solution or suspension on the basis of size or molecule weight differences. In conventional TFF, the solution or suspension to be filtered is passed across the surface of the membrane in a cross-flow mode, i.e., tangential to a membrane surface. The velocity at which the filtrate is passed across the membrane surface also controls the filtration rate and helps prevent clogging of the membrane. TFF is used frequently in perfusion systems to remove target proteins from a bioreactor during cell culturing, while retaining cells in a bioreactor for further production. TFF recirculates retentate across the membrane surface to reduce membrane fouling, maintain a high filtration rate, and enhance product recovery compared to other filtration methods. TFF also provides lesser shear rates compared with other filtration processes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Applications of TFF include the concentration of biological product(s); clarification and desalting of proteins and other biomolecules from a solution or suspension, such as nucleotides, antigens, and monoclonal antibodies; pre-chromatographic clarification to remove colloidal particles; depyrogenation of small molecules, such as dextrose and antibiotics; harvesting; washing or clarification of cell cultures, lysates, colloidal suspensions, and viral cultures; and sample preparation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventional TFF devices are formed of a plurality of elements, including a pump, a feed solution reservoir, a filtration module and conduits for connecting these elements. In use, the feed solution is directed from the feed solution reservoir to the filtration module, while the retentate from the filtration module is recirculated from the filtration module to the feed solution reservoir until the desired volume of retentate is obtained. In the traditional TFF devices, the membrane is sandwiched between top and bottom manifolds or holders, which provide accurate mechanical constraint against the internal hydraulic pressure of the device. Some previous bioreactors also have included stationary filtration devices within the bioreactor with a mixing assembly able to rotate around the filtration device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Current TFF devices used in perfusion systems include hollow fiber devices and open-channel cassette devices, also referred to as plate-and-frame devices. Examples of commercialized cassette devices for perfusion systems include XCell&#x2122; ATF System (Repligen, Waltham, Mass.) and KrosFlo&#xae; Perfusion System (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, Calif.), which are hollow fiber devices, and Prostak&#x2122; Microfiltration Modules (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, Mass.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The TFF devices presently used in the art require high cross-flow rates to minimize fouling (i.e., the accumulation of particles along the wall of membrane). Eventually, membrane fouling can result in failure of the device, with product no longer being recovered during filtration. In current perfusion systems or processes, the desired cross-flow rate is achieved by an external pump in fluid communication, such as being welded or glued, with the bioreactor to move the cells within the bioreactor to an external device containing the membrane. Then, the permeate is pumped back into the bioreactor where bioprocessing is occurring. Removing and reintroducing the permeate into a perfusion system or process increases the chances of contamination compared to systems that retain the permeate in a single bioreactor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A TFF assembly for use in a bioreactor that does not need a pump, which reduces shear to minimize cell damage, and reduces the likelihood of contamination for ongoing production of a target product during perfusion bioprocessing represents an inventive advance in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome by embodiments described herein, which include various embodiments disclosed herein providing a bioreactor containing a TFF device; having a baffle supporting a membrane.

It is to be understood that elements and features of any embodiment may be found in other embodiments without further recitation and that, where possible, identical reference numerals have been used to indicate comparable elements that are common to the figures.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The disclosure herein describes some embodiments of a TFF assembly to improve the performance of bioprocessing systems and processes. Some embodiments disclosed herein result in a homogeneous mixing state provided by the baffle and can provide even distribution of support matrices for adherent cells, such as microcarriers, increasing potential for good growth of certain cells, including, but not limited to stem cells. An effective mixing system provides three basic functions: creation of constant conditions (nutrients, pH, temperature, etc.) in a homogeneous distribution; dispersion of gas, e.g., oxygen; and extracting carbon dioxide where and when needed as in a bioreactor; and optimization of heat transfer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, the pump used during perfusion bioprocessing exacts a lot of shear. The reusable and single-use bioreactors disclosed herein reduce shear during mixing the fluid in a bioreactor because overall power input can be reduced while still maintaining good mixing. Lower power input translates to lower shear. With more homogeneous mixing at lower power input, a larger process window for cell culture processes is provided, providing greater flexibility in finding optimum process conditions to eliminate shear.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Locating the TFF assembly within the bioreactor as described herein also reduces the physical footprint of the bioreactor and self-containment decreases the likelihood of contamination. Minimizing the number of containers into which bioreactor contents need to be transferred, since each transfer represents a potential breach of sterility, and, frequently, the resulting contamination cannot be filtered away, is favorable. For example, it would be beneficial to mix vaccines in the same bioreactor, such as a flexible, disposable bag, that the vaccines will be shipped within because liquids in vaccines often contain aluminum salt as an adjuvant, which improves the efficacy of the vaccine by enhancing the body's immune response. The aluminum salts consist of particle sizes larger than 0.2 &#x3bc;m, thus sterile filtering generally is not an option. Due to limitations of space in most laboratories, minimal space requirements and small footprints are also a long felt need in the field.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I. Tangential Flow Filtration (TFF)</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The TFF assembly describes herein provides for at least semi-continuous sweeping of the contents of a bioreactor as long as the contents are being mixed and flowing over the microporous filter supported by a baffle. In some embodiments, the target product may be captured in a collection receptacle attached to or which is part of the TFF assembly. In further embodiments, the present disclosure includes recovering the target product in the permeate and/or retaining waste media in the retentate. Alternatively, the present disclosure also includes recovering waste material(s) in the permeate and/or retaining the target product in the retentate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Some embodiments herein describe a TFF assembly, which also functions as a baffle while a target product is being produced within the bioreactor. The TFF assembly may be used to remove waste or impurities during perfusion cell culture. Alternatively, the TFF assembly may be used to capture a target product during perfusion cell culture. Cell culture may be performed for any type of cells, including: plant, animal (e.g., insect), bacteria, fungus (e.g., yeast), and hybridoma cells, which can be grown in a cell culture medium. For example, a cultivated cell line is a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or NS0 cell line (murine myeloma cells). The target product may be produced by microbiological applications, such as cultivating microorganisms, specifically, bacteria, or fungi, e.g., yeast.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II.

In some embodiments, the bioreactor holds a volume of up to about 100 L, about 200 L, about 500 L, about 1000 L, about 2000 L, about 2500 L, or about 3000 L.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the bioreactor has a temperature control unit to maintain the fluid associated with bioprocessing, e.g., cell culture, at a consistent temperature.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">A. Inner Volume</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with some embodiments, the bioreactor disclosed herein is a disposable container designed to receive and hold a fluid. The bioreactor encloses a space referred to as an inner volume in which biological or biotechnological processes can be carried out on a laboratory scale. Such processes include the cultivation of cells, microorganisms, or small plants under defined, controlled, and reproducible conditions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the bioreactor comprises or consists of a material conforming to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI requirements, such as a plastic material. The plastic material may be polyamide, polycarbonate, polymethylpentene, or polystyrene. The disposable bioreactor may be formed of monolayer or multilayer flexible walls of a polymeric composition such as polyethylene, for example, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, low density or medium density polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVOH), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA copolymers), blends of various thermoplastics, co-extrusions of different thermoplastics, multilayered laminates of different thermoplastics, or the like as described in US20190210321 and WO2019199406, which are hereby incorporated by reference in entirety. &#x201c;Different&#x201d; is meant to include different polymer types such as polyethylene layers with one or more layers of EVOH as well as the same polymer type but of different characteristics such as molecular weight, linear or branched polymer, fillers, and the like. Typically, medical grade and preferably animal-free plastics are used, which are generally are sterilizable such as by steam, ethylene oxide, or radiation, such as beta or gamma radiation. Most have good tensile strength, low gas transfer, and are either transparent or at least translucent. In some embodiments, the material is weldable or gluable to form a fluid tight connection with other features of a bioreactor and is unsupported. In some embodiments, welding techniques can be selected from the group consisting of plastic welding or heat sealing, for example, ultrasonic welding, laser welding, welding using infra-red radiation, or thermal welding. In some embodiments, the material is clear or translucent, allowing visual monitoring of the contents. In some embodiments, the bioreactor is integrally formed in an injection molding process or a blow molding process.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the bioreactor is provided with one or more inlets, one or more outlets, and/or one or more optional vent passages allowing access to the inner volume. In some embodiments, the inner volume of the bioreactor is of a sufficient size to contain fluid to be mixed, such as cells and a culture medium. In some embodiments, the inner volume of the bioreactor is capable of supporting a biologically active environment, such as one capable of growing cells in the context of cell cultures.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the bioreactor is a disposable, deformable, and/or foldable bag defining an inner volume, that is sterilizable for a single use, capable of accommodating contents, such as biopharmaceutical fluids, in a fluid state, and that can accommodate a mixing device partially or completely within the inner volume. In some embodiments, the inner volume can be opened, such as by suitable valving, to introduce a fluid into the volume, and to expel fluid therefrom, such as after mixing is complete. In some embodiments, the bioreactor may be a two-dimensional or &#x201c;pillow&#x201d; bag, or the bioreactor may be a three-dimensional bag. The particular geometry of the bioreactor is not limited. In some embodiments, the bioreactor includes a rigid base, which provides access points to the inner volume, such as ports or vents. Each bioreactor may contain one or more inlets and outlets and optionally other features, such as sterile gas vents and ports for the sensing of the liquid of the inner volume for parameters, such as conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved gases, and the like. In some embodiments, the bioreactor includes sensors. Such sensors typically monitor pH, dissolved gases, temperature, conductivity, and the like to determine homogeneity throughout the inner volume. To do so, sensors are often placed within dip tubes from the top of the bag into the inner volume of the bioreactor at one or more locations. Alternatively, the sensors are mounted to a wall of the inner volume.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">B. Baffle</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the bioreactor includes two or more baffles within the inner volume. The two or more baffles may have equal or similar dimensions. The baffle is at least partially submerged in the fluid within the inner volume to enhance disruption of the vortex across the entire vessel height and provide homogeneous mixing throughout all operating volumes. In some embodiments, the baffle is positioned in the inner volume to extend through the vortex or the region where the vortex would form in the absence of the baffle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In accordance with some embodiments, the baffle member should be wide enough (with respect to the radial dimension of the inner volume) to disrupt the vortex formation at the surface of the fluid, but not too wide to block flow from side-to-side within the inner volume, which would increase the time for mixing the entire volume. The dimensions of the baffle depend in part on the size of the inner volume.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the baffle comprises or consists of a material which conforms to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI requirements, such as a plastic material, for example, polyamide, polycarbonate, polymethylpenten, polypropylene, or polystyrene. In some embodiments, at least the outer wall of the baffle comprises or consists of the material conforming to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI requirements.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the microporous membrane supported by the baffle has a mean pore size of at least about 0.65 &#x3bc;m, for example, 0.62, 0.65, 0.67, or 0.80 &#x3bc;m; at least about 1.0 &#x3bc;m, for example, 0.95, 1.0, or 1.2 &#x3bc;m; at least about 3.0 &#x3bc;m, for example, 2.9, 3.0, or 5.0 &#x3bc;m. The mean pore size of the microporous membrane may be about 0.8 &#x3bc;m to about 10 &#x3bc;m, for example, 0.77, 0.8, 0.9, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10.3 &#x3bc;m; or about 1.0 to about 5 &#x3bc;m, for example, 0.97, 1.2, 3, or 5.3 &#x3bc;m. The mean pore size can be selected to provide for sieving of target products and/or waste materials from a cell culture fluid, while retaining cells within the cell culture fluid. Examples of suitable microporous membranes include the membranes listed in Table 1 of WO2018222550, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the baffle includes at least partially hollow interior acting as a collection receptacle for a target product or waste material resulting from bioprocessing. The collection receptacle may be separated from the inner volume in a fluid tight manner. The collection receptacle may allow the fluid to remain in the baffle, or the baffle may include a fluid connector as an outlet for fluid to flow away from the collection receptacle. In some embodiments, the collection receptacle is adapted to withstand fluid pressure with a range of up to about 68 kPa to up to about 70 kPa, which is equivalent to about 10 psi. For example, the collection receptable can withstand a head pressure of the bioreactor is about 6.77 psi. In some embodiments, the collection receptable can withstand pressure associated with fouling of the TFF assembly, e.g. an additional 3 psi of pressure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fluid connector may be made of materials with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Class VI certification, such as polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyamide, or silicone. In some embodiments, the fluid connector is a flexible tube made of thermal plastic elastomers. Alternatively, rigid tubes comprising or consisting of polystyrene, polycarbonate, or polyamide may be used as a fluid connector. In some embodiments, the fluid connector is attached to a pump. In some embodiments, the fluid connector is arranged with the collection receptacle or pump coaxially.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">C. Mixer</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, each inner volume contains, either partially or completely within its interior, a mixer for mixing, dispersing, homogenizing, and/or circulating one or more liquids, gases, and/or solids in the inner volume. In some embodiments, the mixer may include one or more blades, which are movable, such as by rotation or oscillation about an axis. In some embodiments, the mixer includes a shaft rotated by a drive, as a result the blades also rotate to mix the fluid and/or solids in the inner volume. Alternatively, the mixer is magnetically coupled to the motor so no shaft penetrates the bioreactor. In some embodiments, the baffle is not attached or contacted to the mixer. In some embodiments, the baffle rotates or pivots separately from the mixer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The mixer may have a protective hood formed over at least a part of the blades with a space contained between the under surface of the hood and the outer dimension of the blades so as to allow for free movement of the blades and fluid between the blades and the under surface of the hood. The hood protects the wall of the inner volume from the blades that could otherwise damage the bioreactor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">More than one mixer may be enclosed by the bioreactor. When more than one mixer is present, each is spatially arranged to not interfere with the rotation of the other.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">III.
