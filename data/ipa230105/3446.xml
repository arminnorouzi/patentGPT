id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heat exchanger comprising sets of passages for each of the fluids to be brought into a heat exchange relationship, the exchanger comprising an arrangement of mixing devices configured to more homogeneously distribute at least one mixture of two liquid-gaseous phases in at least one of the sets of passages.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, the present invention can be applied to a heat exchanger that vaporizes at least one flow of a liquid-gas mixture, in particular a flow of a liquid-gas mixture with a plurality of constituent elements, for example, a mixture comprising hydrocarbons, by exchanging heat with at least one other fluid, for example, natural gas, that cools, or even at least partly liquefies, or even liquefied natural gas that sub-cools.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among the methods using one or more fluid refrigeration cycle(s) with diphasic coolant, i.e. in the liquid/gas mixture state, several methods for liquefying a natural gas stream in order to obtain liquefied natural gas (LNG) are known. Typically, a cooling stream, generally a mixture with a plurality of constituent elements, such as a mixture containing hydrocarbons, is compressed by a compressor and then introduced into an exchanger or a series of exchangers where it is completely liquefied and sub-cooled to the coldest temperature of the method, typically that of the liquefied natural gas stream. At the coldest outlet of the exchanger, the cooling stream is expanded by forming a liquid phase and a gaseous phase. These two phases are separated by means of a phase separator and then reintroduced into the exchanger and remixed before being reintroduced into the exchanger in the liquid-gas mixture state, i.e. in the diphasic state. The cooling stream introduced into the exchanger in the diphasic state is vaporized therein against the hydrocarbon stream that liquefies and against the natural gas, Document WO-A-2017/081374 describes one of these known methods.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of brazed plate and fin aluminum exchangers allows very compact devices to be provided that provide a large exchange surface, thereby improving the energy performance capabilities of the method, and so doing in a limited volume.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These exchangers comprise a stack of plates that extend in two dimensions, length and width, thus forming a stack of a plurality of sets of passages positioned on top of each other, with some being intended for circulating a heat transfer fluid, for example, the hydrocarbon stream to be liquefied, and others being intended for circulating a coolant, for example, the diphasic cooling stream to be vaporized.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Heat exchange structures, such as heat exchange corrugations, are generally arranged in the passages of the exchanger. These structures comprise fins that extend between the plates of the exchanger and allow the heat exchange surface of the exchanger to be increased. They also function as spacers and contribute to the mechanical strength of the passages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some issues arise in exchangers implementing cooling streams of a diphasic nature, in particular when their vaporization occurs in an ascending vertical flow.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Indeed, in order to ensure that the exchanger operates correctly, i.e. in particular to maximize the use of its exchange surface, in particular for an exchanger implementing a liquid-gas mixture, the proportion of liquid phase and gaseous phase must be the same in all the passages and must be uniform within the same passage.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The dimensioning of the exchanger is computed assuming a uniform distribution of the phases, and thus a single temperature at the end of vaporization of the liquid phase per passage, equal to the dew point of the mixture.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For a mixture with a plurality of constituent elements in particular, the end of vaporization temperature will depend on the proportion of liquid phase and gaseous phase in the passages, since the two phases do not have the same compositions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the event of uneven distribution of the two phases, the temperature profile of the first fluid will therefore vary depending on the passages and/or within the same passage. Due to this non-uniform distribution, the one or more fluid(s) in an exchange relationship with the two-phase mixture can have an exchanger outlet temperature that is higher than the expected temperature, which consequently degrades the performance capabilities of the heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One solution for distributing the liquid and gaseous phases of the mixture as evenly as possible involves separately introducing them into the exchanger and then mixing them together only once they are inside the exchanger.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Documents FR-A-2563620 or WO-A-2018/172644 describe such exchangers, in which a grooved bar is inserted into the set of passages for channeling the two-phase mixture. This mixing device comprises a series of separate channels or grooves for the flow of the liquid phase of the coolant and another series of separate channels for the flow of the gaseous phase of the coolant. The channels of one series are fluidly connected to channels of the other series via openings so that a liquid-gas mixture is distributed out of the mixing device toward the heat exchange area. Each coolant passage of the exchanger is provided with such a device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">One problem that arises with this type of mixing device relates to the uneven distribution of the liquid-gas mixture in the width of the exchanger passages.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Indeed, the two-phase mixture is distributed at the outlet of the channels emerging into the passage. Since the channels are arranged at a certain distance from each other, the liquid-gas mixture is discretely introduced into the exchange zone over the width of the passage. As the fluid flows in the overall direction of flow in the exchanger, a distribution can occur in the direction orthogonal to the overall direction of flow, in particular by virtue of the exchange corrugations that are generally used in this type of exchanger, such as perforated or &#x201c;serrated&#x201d; corrugations that tend to deflect some of the fluid from its direction of flow.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, homogenization of the fluid distribution over the width of the exchanger is only achieved after the mixture travels a certain distance after exiting the mixing device. Over this distance, the fluid supplies the exchange zone with uneven mass flow rates depending on the considered position in the width of the exchanger. Some channels of the exchange corrugations may have a limited or even no supply. The performance capabilities of the exchanger are degraded. In some configurations, acceptable homogenization may not even be achieved. This is particularly the case when the exchange zone is provided with straight corrugations, with which distribution by lateral deflection of the fluid is not possible.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Exchangers working subject to low temperature deviations between the heat transfer and coolant fluids are even more sensitive to this poor distribution phenomenon. In addition, the phenomenon of inhomogeneous distribution is accentuated in the case of a coolant mixture with a plurality of constituent elements.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">None of the existing solutions is fully satisfactory. Thus, arranging a free space at the outlet of the mixing device raises problems in terms of the mechanical strength of the exchanger and can lead to the first phase accumulating in this zone. Increasing the number of channels succeeding each other in the width of the exchanger leads to a reduction in the flow rate in each channel and is detrimental to proper distribution of the mixture at the outlet.

The lateral sealing strips <b>4</b> do not completely seal the passages <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>20</b> but advantageously leave fluid inlet and outlet openings located in the diagonally opposite corners of the passages.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0059">The openings of the passages <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B of the first set are arranged so as to coincide one above the other, while the openings of the passages <b>20</b> of the second set are arranged in the opposite corners.
