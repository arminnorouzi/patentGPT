The main steps in the method are: conditioning the material, grinding, removing ink from the film, washing the film, recovering the cleaning solution, recovering the pigment and drying the film. As a result of the method, it is possible to obtain, on one hand, a plastic film free of ink and, on the other hand, the pigment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO 2012/151291 A2 refers to an apparatus and a method for removing an ink image from a plastic substrate, particularly a plastic container such as a cup. A solvent capable of solvating the ink image is utilized in order to de-ink articles so that they can be recycled and re-imprinted thereby reducing waste associated with printing line start up.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the recycling of plastic, the material is typically in a flaked or ground pellet form. Typically, the resulting clean plastic particles will have a residual moisture of anywhere between 10 wt.-% and 30 wt.-%. This residual moisture has to be washed out of the plastic, entailing substantial losses of the cleaning medium, and by consequence significant waste water streams requiring chemical and/or mechanical and/or biological treatment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, current plastics recycling processes are typically able to achieve a yield of around 50% for input streams containing 90% plastic. The resulting waste stream contains most of the foreign material, but also significant quantities of plastic. This stream has typically a high water content and is usually incinerated at high cost.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the methods known from the prior art for removing ink from a substrate refer to the use of a combination of several components comprising alcohols, anionic and cationic surfactants and solvents.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The known methods have some disadvantages. The efficiency of a process for removing foreign material is a direct consequence of the concentration of the components used in the cleaning medium and deviations in the mixture affect the efficiency of removing foreign material. Furthermore, due to the requirement of a specific combination of components, the complexity of the process increases when these solutions are intended for reuse in the process after cleaning. In addition, the cleaning media known from the prior art are quite expensive and the processes have to be conducted at elevated temperatures.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It was therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a method that allows to use a simple mixture of components or a single component for removing foreign material from the surface of an article. The advantages of using such a simple mixture or a single component, this means a cleaning medium based on cheap readily available materials, include reduced complexity resulting in a lower price. Furthermore, it was an objective of the present invention to provide a method that neutralizes odor, which is particularly preferable when the article is a waste material. In addition, it was an object of the present invention to provide a method which is not limited with regard to the articles used, that works for example for flakes, films and chips but also for more complex packaging structures. It was also an objective of the present invention to provide a method being extremely efficient and allowing to recover and re-use the desired materials, not only the article, but also the cleaning medium and the carrier material, to a huge extent or a total recovery. Another objective of the present invention was to provide a method that allows to remove foreign materials from the surface of an article without harming the internal structure of the article. Furthermore, it was the objective of the present invention to provide a method which generates only a little amount of waste water and solid waste per ton of cleaned product.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These objectives have been solved by the method for removing foreign material from the surface of an article according to claim <b>1</b> comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">i) providing an article having a surface covered at least partly with a foreign material;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">ii) contacting the article provided in step i) with a cleaning medium being an acid having a pKa in the range from &#x2212;10 to 7 having a minimum concentration of 1 wt.-% and with a carrier medium having a density different from the density of the cleaning medium to obtain a mixture comprising the foreign material solved and/or dispersed in the cleaning medium, the carrier medium and the article free from the foreign material;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0013">iii) allowing the mixture obtained in step ii) to separate, to obtain a heterophasic emulsion comprising at least a first phase comprising the carrier medium and the article free from the foreign material and a second phase comprising the cleaning medium and the foreign material solved and/or dispersed therein;</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0014">iv) separating the phases obtained in step iii); and</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0015">v) separating the article free from the foreign material from the carrier medium.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">Advantageous embodiments of the method in accordance with the present invention are specified in the dependent claims <b>2</b> to <b>14</b>.

This means the &#x201c;acid&#x201d; may contain water and preferably contains waters. An &#x201c;acid&#x201d; is a substance that acts as a proton donor in aqueous solutions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">The acid may be monoprotic or multiprotic or a mixture thereof. In the gist of the present invention for multiprotic acids the &#x201c;pKa&#x201d; (logarithmic acid dissociation constant) refers to the first dissociation step of the acid.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">According to the present invention an ink is a liquid or paste that comprises inorganic or organic pigments or dyes and a solvent. The ink may additionally comprise resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate matter, fluorescents, and other materials.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;rinse&#x201d; is used to indicate the addition of a solvent, typically water, which is used to remove foreign material or remaining liquid from the surface of the polyolefin. This can be achieved in very short times, i.e. less than 5 minutes, often less than 1 minute, in contrast to &#x201c;washing&#x201d; steps that typically require a longer time, and agitation, to extract volatile organic compounds from the polyolefin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">Where the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is used in the present description and claims, it does not exclude other non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance.
