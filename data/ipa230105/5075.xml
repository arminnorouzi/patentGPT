disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the context of invoice financing and this disclosure, the term seller refers to a company that is selling services/products and which obtains financing based upon their outstanding invoices. The term buyer refers to a company named on the outstanding invoices that owes an outstanding balance to the seller, typically a customer of the seller. Additionally, the term funder refers to a company or individual that provides funding to the seller utilizing the outstanding invoices and invoice balance as collateral.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are currently no systems in place that provide a transparent and accurate view of the participants in the invoice financing marketplace and their behavior in that marketplace. Conventional funding/financing systems rely only credit scores and similar metrics which do not provide an accurate or reliable information about whether a particular seller will repay financing or the expected return associated with a particular seller in the relevant marketplace.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, as multiple parties are involved in invoice financing, the likelihood a particular seller providing a return on financing will also depend on the buyers to whom they have issued invoices. The behavior and records of buyers may vary greatly, not only with respect to other buyers but also with respect to different sellers. For example, a particular buyer may have a much better record with payment of invoices of a large company (i.e., a seller) than payment of invoices of a small proprietor (i.e., a different seller). Current systems do not track buyer information specific to certain sellers or provide any technology infrastructure to track or leverage this information.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The lack of data relating to parties involved in an invoice transaction, including buyers and sellers, makes it difficult to accurately price invoices. For example, the market value of an invoice having a reliable buyer and seller with good credit scores would be different than the market value of an invoice with delinquent buyers and sellers. However, there are currently no systems which can derive accurate buyer and seller metrics and utilize them for invoice pricing. Without accurate invoice pricing, invoices cannot be sold to funders, bundled, securitized, or otherwise utilized for financing purposes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, improvements are needed in technology systems for tracking, structuring, and storing data associated with the parties involved in invoice financing and for pricing individual invoices based upon the activity of those parties.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart for dynamically modeling a current price of an invoice issued by a seller based on real-time monitoring of transaction data on a computer network according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a table showing possible invoice parameters and example values of these parameters according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of the buyer profile and invoice transaction history according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of the seller profile and invoice transaction history according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the use of seller invoice transaction history for determination of dynamic weights according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart for determining the current price of the invoice according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>H</figref> illustrate a sample invoice, model, and sample calculations and values according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example of costs and returns relating to an invoice fund over a period of monthly cycles in a year according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the components of the specialized computing environment configured to perform the specialized processes described herein according to an exemplary embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is to be understood that at least some of the figures and descriptions of the invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other elements that those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate also comprise a portion of the invention. However, because such elements do not facilitate a better understanding of the invention, a description of such elements is not provided herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Applicant has discovered a method, apparatus, and computer-readable medium for dynamically modeling a current price of an invoice issued by a seller based on real-time monitoring of transaction data on a computer network.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present system allows for a determination of a probability of default for a seller and buyer that utilizes dynamic and shifting weighting of internal metrics and external metrics, whereby the balance of weighting to internal and external metrics shifts as a function of the quantity of transaction data stored on the system for the seller and its associated buyers. In particular, the most pertinent data for assessing risk is the data that pertains to the same type of transactions, on the same platform. For this reason, internal metrics are likely to have a higher reliability. These buyer and seller metrics can then be utilized for pricing invoices involving the buyers and sellers.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the present system, when the number of transactions (repayment events) are low, the weighting is shifted to external metrics, which are relied upon largely as a proxy for the more relevant internal metrics that would likely have a higher reliability in estimating a probability of default. However, as the quantity of internal transactions increases, the reliability of the internal metrics increases as well, and the dynamic weighting shifts the weight so that internal metrics are given greater weighting than external metrics. This dynamic shifting weighting allows for accurate assessment of risk at all stages of experience and history, whether a seller is new to the platform or a more experienced member of the exchange. The system can actively monitor a quantity, quality, or other metric relating to transactions conducted on the network or stored in a database for a particular seller or buyer, and then dynamically shift weighting based on the detection of transactions or transaction metrics beyond a predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present system can also enables more granular and accurate assessment of probability of default and other risk metrics through the use of buyer data that is bound to buyer-seller pairings. In other words, internal transaction data and metrics for buyers are not divorced from the sellers to which they owe payment. Instead buyer metrics and transaction data records are linked to the data for specific sellers. This data linkage allows for more accurate assessment of buyer level risk due to default on invoices, since the behavior and data for a buyer may differ among different sellers. For example, buyer A may have a very good track record of timely payment to seller B on seller B's invoices while at the same time having a poor record of payment to seller C on seller C's invoices. This difference only becomes observable in the data set when the transaction data for buyer A is stored in a data structure which references or links to the specific seller for each transaction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present system utilizes and ultimately emphasizes metrics derived from internal real-time network transaction data to thereby provide greater visibility into the risk metrics for all parties to an invoice financing transaction and greater accuracy in the risk and probability of default assessment. The linked buyer-seller data structures, transaction data sets, and associated metrics also provide a level of transparency and accuracy in risk measurement that would not be possible without the specific linked records and real-time transaction data.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The use of internal real-time network transaction data allow for more accurate pricing of invoices. This pricing accurately captures the default risk and probability of repayment associated with each invoice, resulting in a more reliable current price for a particular invoice.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart for dynamically modeling a current price of an invoice issued by a seller based on real-time monitoring of transaction data on a computer network according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At step <b>101</b> invoice data corresponding to an invoice issued by the seller is received.
