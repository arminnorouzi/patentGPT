The rolling elements are kept in the correct position by a cage including an annular body provided with a plurality of radial pockets or seats suitable for housing the balls. The cage is made entirely of a synthetic plastic material in which polyfunctional monomers have been inserted, these crosslinking during the molding process, thus improving the strength of the cage. This cage is guided, i.e. rotationally supported (subject to a relatively small predefined clearance), on the rolling elements; the cage therefore keeps the rolling elements in the correct position, ensuring smooth operation without any noise.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With regard to high-speed applications U.S. Pat. Pub. 2011/0229067 also discloses an annular cage which may be made of both pressed metal and plastic which is formed with a U-shaped cross-section and which guides the rolling elements only on the lateral flanks, leaving them free both radially on the outside and radially on the inside. However, such a cage may be effectively used only with rolling elements consisting of rollers.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This disclosure will now be described with reference to the attached drawings which illustrate non-limiting exemplary embodiments of a bearing unit, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a radially sectioned right-angled elevation view of a rolling bearing provided according to embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, on a larger scale, a radially sectioned elevation view of the rolling bearing according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in which a radially outer ring, which is stationary during use, has been omitted for easier comprehension;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a radially sectioned view, on a further enlarged scale, of a detail view of the rolling bearing according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows, on a further enlarged scale, of a detail view of the rolling bearing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the case of high-speed applications (for example equal to or greater than 10-20,000 rpm) the friction which develops during use between balls and cage is excessive and increases, on the one hand, the energy consumption and, on the other hand, the internal temperature of the bearing, which may reach levels which are incompatible with a correct operational performance of the bearing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to solve the problem of overheating, it is possible to provide a cage guided on the outer ring of the bearing, if this ring is the stationary ring.
