Such a structure is described in, for example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2010-277936, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2014-11074, and WO2014/033822.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases such as the structure described in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2010-277936, the sealing member is fixed to the exterior container by swaging, whereas in other cases such as each of the structures described in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2014-11074 and WO2014/033822, the sealing member is fixed to the exterior container by welding.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case where the sealing member is fixed to the exterior container by swaging, it is required to avoid occurrence of insufficient swaging in order to secure the sealing of the exterior container. It is an object of the present technology to provide a battery in which occurrence of insufficient swaging is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A battery according to the present technology includes: an electrode assembly and an electrolyte solution; an exterior container that accommodates the electrode assembly and the electrolyte solution and that is provided with an injection hole for the electrolyte solution; a sealing member that is fixed to the exterior container by swaging and that seals the injection hole; and a seal component that has an annular shape and that is located between the exterior container and the sealing member. The sealing member includes a stem portion inserted into the injection hole, a flange portion that is located outside the exterior container and that is located on an outer side with respect to the stem portion in a radial direction of the stem portion, and a protrusion that has a substantially annular shape and that protrudes from the flange portion to the exterior container side. In a state in which the sealing member is fixed to the exterior container by swaging, at least a tip side of the protrusion is embedded in the seal component. In a state before the sealing member is fixed to the exterior container by swaging, when the protrusion of the sealing member and the seal component are brought into abutment with each other, a communication path is formed in the protrusion or the seal component to communicate a space inside the exterior container and a space outside the exterior container with each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a prismatic secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross sectional view taken along II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of a positive electrode plate included in an electrode assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of a negative electrode plate included in the electrode assembly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view showing the electrode assembly including the positive electrode plate and the negative electrode plate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram showing a structure of connection between the electrode assembly and each of a positive electrode current collecting member and a negative electrode current collecting member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing a structure of attaching of the positive electrode current collecting member and the negative electrode current collecting member on a sealing plate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross sectional view taken along VIII-VIII in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross sectional view taken along IX-IX in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram showing a state in which the sealing plate and the electrode assembly are connected to each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram showing a state before the sealing member is fixed to the exterior container by swaging.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram showing a state in which the sealing member is fixed to the exterior container by swaging.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram showing the sealing member to be fixed by swaging.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of the sealing member.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> to <b>19</b></figref> are perspective views each showing an exemplary sealing member.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a diagram showing the sealing member and a washer before the fixation by swaging.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a top view showing an exemplary washer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a perspective view showing the exemplary washer.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present technology will be described.
