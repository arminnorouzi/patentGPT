When the following description relates to the drawings, unless otherwise indicated, the same reference signs in different drawings indicate the same or similar elements. The implementation manners described in the following exemplary examples do not represent all implementation manners consistent with the present disclosure. Rather, they are merely examples of devices and methods consistent with some aspects of the present disclosure as set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A resource allocation method provided by examples of the present disclosure can be applied to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communication system that includes a data transmitting device and a data receiving device. The data transmitting device and the data receiving device may be a STAtion (STA) or an Access Point (AP). The data transmitting device and the data receiving device perform forward and backward transmission of data via the WLAN.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The STA involved in the present disclosure can be understood to be a user terminal in the WLAN, which can be referred to as a User Equipment (UE), a Mobile Station (MS), a Mobile Terminal (MT), etc., and is a device that provides voice and/or data connectivity to a user. For example, a terminal can be a handheld device, a vehicle-mounted device and other devices with wireless connectivity. At present, some examples of the terminal include: a Mobile Phone, a Pocket Personal Computer (PPC), a palmtop computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a laptop, a tablet, a wearable device, a client of Internet of Things (IoT) or an in-car device, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The AP involved in the present disclosure refers to a device, a router, etc. for a user terminal in the WLAN to access the network.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the related art, data frames are transmitted between STA and AP based on IEEE802.11 standard. At present, study group (SG) IEEE802.11be is established based on IEEE802.11 to study the next generation mainstream (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax) Wi-Fi technologies, and the scope of the study includes: transmission with a bandwidth of 320 MHz, aggregation and cooperation of a plurality of frequency segments, etc. The proposed vision is to, compared to the existing IEEE802.11ax, increase the rate and throughput by at least four times. Main application scenarios thereof include video transmission, AR, VR, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Aggregation and cooperation of a plurality of frequency segments refer to simultaneously communicating via a plurality of frequency segments or a plurality of bandwidths in the same frequency segment. For example, simultaneously communicating via three frequency segments, 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz and 6-7 GHz. Simultaneously communicating via a plurality of frequency segments or a plurality of bandwidths in the same frequency segment can be understood as multi-connection communication, or Multi-Link Aggregation (MLA).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Before interacting data between an AP and a STA, a measurement is performed between the AP and the STA for improving the spectrum utilization efficiency in a more effective way. For improving the transmission rate and quality more efficiently, in the related art, the measurement would be performed using beamforming mechanisms (IEEE802.11ac/ax, respectively), such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, prior to starting the measurement, beamformer transmits a probe trigger message frame (as NDP announcement), for example, a Very High Throughput (VHT) NDP announcement or a High Efficiency (HE) NDP announcement. After a certain interval, for example, a Short Inter-Frame Space (SIFS), a measurement message frame is transmitted. The measurement message frame such as a NDP frame or a BeamForming Report Poll (BFRP) frame. Beamformee receives the NDP frame and transmits a measurement message feedback frame for feedback. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> both, one beamformer transmits a NDP announcement, for example, an AP transmits a NDP announcement frame and a NDP frame, and one or more STAs receive the NDP frame and then transmit a measurement message feedback frame for feedback.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a format of a NDP announcement frame.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the Null Data Packet (NDP) announcement frame includes Frame control field, Duration, receiver address, transmission address, Sounding Dialog Token, a plurality of STAtion information (STA info<b>1</b> . . . STA info<b>2</b>) and Frame Check Sequence (FCS).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For improving the spectrum utilization efficiency and the system throughput, IEEE802.11be specifies that communication can be carried out for multi-connection, and that more than one Resource Unit (RU) is to be assigned to a STA. The existing format of NDP announcement frame is no longer suitable for needs of multi-connection communication, so the format of NDP announcement frame is expected to be enhanced to accommodate needs of IEEE802.11be.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Examples of the present disclosure provide a resource allocation method that generates and transmits one or more probe trigger message frames (as NDP announcement frames). A probe trigger message frame includes a plurality of RU start indexes and RU end indexes. For the convenience of description, a start index and an end index for a RU are referred to as a RU index pair, that is, the probe trigger message frame includes a plurality of RU index pairs. Each of the RU index pairs can be understood as corresponding to one RU. Two or more RUs in a plurality of RUs corresponding to the plurality of RU index pairs are to be assigned to one or more STAs with a specified bandwidth to accommodate the needs of multi-connection communication.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a resource allocation method according to an example of the present disclosure.

Each of the RU index pairs includes a start index and an end index. Two or more RUs in the plurality of RUs for a probe trigger message frame are to be assigned to a STA with a specified bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The technical solutions according to the examples of the present disclosure have the following beneficial effects: a probe trigger message frame includes start indexes and end indexes for a plurality of resource units, and two or more resource units in the plurality of resource units are to be assigned to a station with a specified bandwidth, i.e., a plurality of resource units are to be assigned to each station, which enabling resource allocation for multi-connection by transmitting a probe trigger message frame.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a format of a probe trigger message frame including a plurality of RU index pairs according to an example of the present disclosure. The format of probe trigger message frame shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> indicates an enhancement to a format of an existing NDP announcement frame, by enhancing the STA info subfield of the format of IEEE 802.11ax in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to change the status quo where the format of 802.11ax only supports a single RU. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the format of probe trigger message frame includes a plurality of RU index pairs, that is, includes RU start indexes and RU end indexes for a plurality of RUs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The number of RU index pairs is determined based on the number of RUs to be assigned.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one example, in a case that the RUs to be assigned are discontiguous RUs, the number of RU index pairs indicates the number of the discontiguous RUs. In other words, the number of times RU start indexes and RU end indexes occur in the present disclosure is related to the number of discontiguous RUs to be assigned to a STA. For example, in a case that two discontiguous <b>26</b>-tone RUs are to be assigned to a STA, and then the number of times RU start indexes and RU end indexes occur is two.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example, in a case that the RUs to be assigned are contiguous RUs, the number of RU index pairs is determined based on formats of the RUs. For example, in a case that formats of the contiguous RUs are the same, index pairs for the contiguous RUs are combined into one RU index pair. In a case that the formats of the contiguous RUs are different, the number of index pairs for the contiguous RUs indicates the number of the contiguous RUs. For example, the number of times RU start indexes and RU end indexes occur in the present disclosure is related to the number of contiguous RUs to be assigned to a STA. Assuming that two contiguous 26-tone RUs are to be assigned, the two contiguous 26-tone RUs can be combined into one 52-tone RU, that is, only one RU start index and one RU end index occur. In the related art, RU combinations based on 802.11ax include: 26-tone, 52-tone, 106-tone, 242-tone, 484-tone and 996-tone. To be compatible with the existing RU combinations to be assigned, in a case that RUs to be assigned are two contiguous RUs such as 26-tone and 52-tone, the RU start index and RU end index occur twice.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In examples of the present disclosure, the first device transmits one or more probe trigger message frames for multi-connection simultaneously, because IEEE 802.11be supports multi-connection (a plurality of frequency segments or a plurality of bandwidths in one frequency segment). In one example, two or more RUs in the plurality of RUs are to be assigned to one or more STAs with a specified bandwidth for different connections, which enables transmitting the one or more probe trigger message frames simultaneously for multi-connection.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In examples of the present disclosure, for accommodating to the data exchange between a plurality of APs and a plurality of STAs at the same moment, a plurality of RUs for a probe trigger message frame are to be assigned to a plurality of STAs, and two or more RUs are to be assigned to each STA. In another example, a plurality of RUs for a probe trigger message frame are to be assigned to a STA(s) with a specified bandwidth by one or more APs. In other words, in examples of the present disclosure, one AP can correspond to one or more STAs and a plurality of RUs are to be assigned to each STA. In examples of the present disclosure, a plurality of APs can correspond to one or more STAs and a plurality of RUs are to be assigned to each STA.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an example of the present disclosure, the probe trigger message frame further includes a STA identifier, such as an Association IDentifier (AID) or a group number, etc. The STA identifier corresponds to the plurality of RUs to be assigned to the STAs with the specified bandwidth. In one example, the STA identifier corresponding to the plurality of RUs to be assigned to the STAs has a correspondence with one or more APs which are to assign the plurality of RUs with the specified bandwidth as well.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In examples of the present disclosure, APs and STAs may have a correspondence as follows: 1 to 1, that is, an AP corresponds to a single STA and a STA identifier corresponds to a plurality of RUs; 1 to many, that is, an AP corresponds to a plurality of STAs and a STA identifier (such as AID) corresponds to a plurality of RUs; many to many, a plurality of APs correspond to a plurality of STAs and a STA identifier (such as AID or a group number) corresponds to a plurality of RUs.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In examples of the present disclosure, for transmitting one or more probe trigger message frames, the probe trigger message frames can be transmitted for a plurality of different connections. In one example, in examples of the present disclosure, the probe trigger message frame(s) further includes an identification bit for indicating that the probe trigger message frame(s) is transmitted for different connections, which can also be understood as transmitting a NDP announcement frame(s) for a plurality of connections at the same time.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a format of an identification bit in a probe trigger message frame according to an example of the present disclosure.

The probe trigger message frame shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also includes HE field and Sounding Dialog Token field.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the present disclosure, before the first device transmits one or more probe trigger message frames supporting multi-connection communication, the first device can transmit a capability indication message. The capability indication message is to indicate that communication over multi-connection is supportive, so that a subsequent device receiving the probe trigger message frame may clearly know that the first device is for multi-connection communication.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a case that the first device is an AP, the capability indication information may be transmitted based on a beacon frame, an association response frame, a probe response frame or an authentication response frame.
