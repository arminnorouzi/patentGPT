For example, the production data generated by the plurality of sample production devices includes production records of the plurality of sample production devices. For example, the production records include information about the sample production devices through which the plurality of samples pass in their respective production processes and information about defect types of the plurality of samples. Each sample passes through multiple sample production devices in its production process, and each sample production device participates in and only participates in production process(es) of some of the plurality of samples.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0057">The distributed storage device stores thereon relatively complete data (such as a database).

Such raw data may be extracted in an original table manner by a data extraction tool (e.g., Sqoop or Kettle) to be transmitted to the distributed storage device (e.g., a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)), so as to reduce the load on the sample production devices and manufacturing systems, and facilitate data reading of an analysis device in a subsequent process.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0059">The data in the distributed storage device may be stored by a Hive tool or in a HBase database format. For example, according to the Hive tool, the raw data is first stored in a data lake. And then, the raw data may be subjected to pretreatment (e.g., data cleaning and data conversion) in the Hive tool according to application themes, scenes, etc. of the data, so as to obtain a data warehouse with different themes (e.g., a production record theme, a detection data theme and a device data theme), and data marts with different scenes (e.g., a device analysis scene and a parameter analysis scene). The data marts may be connected to a display device, an analysis device, etc. through different application programming interfaces (APIs), so as to realize data interaction with these devices.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0060">Since a plurality of sample production devices in a plurality of factories are involved, the raw data is in a large volume. For example, all sample production devices may generate several hundred gigabytes of raw data every day, and generate dozens of gigabytes of raw data every hour.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0061">For example, there are mainly two solutions for the storage and calculation of massive structured data, i.e., a grid computing solution of a relational database management system (RDBMS), and a big data solution of a distributed file system (DFS).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0062">The grid computing of the RDBMS is to divide a problem, which requires tremendous computing power, into many small parts, distribute these parts to many computers for separate processing, and then combine the calculation results. For example, Oracle real application clusters (RAC) is a core technology of grid computing supported by an Oracle database, and all servers may directly access all data in the database. However, the application system of the grid computing of the RDBMS cannot meet users' requirements when there is a large amount of data. For example, since the expansion space of hardware is limited, when the data is increased to an order of magnitude that is large enough, the data processing efficiency will be very low due to an input/output bottleneck of the hard disk.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0063">The big data technology based on the DFS allows the use of a plurality of inexpensive hardware devices to build large clusters to process massive amounts of data. For example, the Hive tool is a data warehouse tool based on Hadoop, which may be used for data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL). The Hive tool defines a simple SQL-like query language, and also allows Mapper and Reducer in user-defined MapReduce to default complex analysis work that the tool cannot do. The Hive tool does not have a designated data storage format, nor does it create an index for the data. Users may freely organize tables therein, so as to process the data in the database. It will be seen that, the parallel processing of the DFS may satisfy the storage and processing requirements of massive data. Users may use SQL query for simple data processing, and use custom functions to realize complex data processing. Therefore, during analysis of the massive data of a factory, the data of the factory's database needs to be extracted into a DFS. In this way, not only the raw data will not be damaged, but also the data analysis efficiency will be improved.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0064">For example, the distributed storage device <b>400</b> may be one memory, or may include a plurality of memories, or may be a general term for a plurality of storage elements.

Of course, although the treatment is theoretically the same, the actual treatment effects of different processing equipments are not exactly the same since the models, conditions, etc. thereof are different. In this case, each sample needs to pass through a plurality of process stations in the production process, and different samples may pass through different process stations in the production process. Moreover, samples that pass through the same process station may be processed by different sample production devices.

The defective ratio R<sub>1 </sub>of the plurality of samples is a ratio of the total number T<sub>2 </sub>of the defective samples in the plurality of samples to the total number T<sub>1 </sub>of the plurality of samples, i.e., R<sub>1</sub>=T<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>; and the non-defective ratio R<sub>2 </sub>of the plurality of samples is the total number T<sub>3 </sub>of the non-defective samples in the plurality of samples to the total number T<sub>1 </sub>of the plurality of samples, i.e., R<sub>2</sub>=T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>.

For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>, the distribution diagram may be a histogram, a scatter graph, etc.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0161">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, the display device <b>200</b> displays the fifth interface, so as to display the distribution diagram of the first parameters (for example, the defect degree representation values in the first parameters) of the plurality of samples on the fifth interface. In this way, the user may directly see the distribution of non-defective samples and defective samples in the plurality of samples. For example, the focus threshold may be set according to the distribution of the non-defective samples and the defective samples.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0162">In some examples, the fifth interface and the first interface may be the same interface. For example, after the user performs the first input on the first interface, the plurality of samples are obtained, and after the plurality of samples are divided into the non-defective samples and the defective samples, a distribution diagram of the non-defective samples and the defective samples in the plurality of samples are displayed on the first interface.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0163">For another example, parts (A) and (B) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> are distribution diagrams of the first parameters of the samples passing through the sample production device. For example, the first parameters include the defect degree representation values. In part (A), the defect degree representation value in the first parameter is a defective ratio of the sample (e.g., in the case where the sample is the display panel motherboard, a defective ratio of the sample is a ratio of a total number of defective display panels in the display panel motherboard to a total number of all display panels); the denser the scattered points in part (A), the more defective samples there are. In part (B), the defect degree representation value in the first parameter is the defect count of the sample (e.g., in the case where the sample is the display panel motherboard, the defect count of the sample is a total number of defective display panels in the display panel motherboard). A sample production device A is one of the plurality of sample production devices that have been analyzed. A sample production device B is taken as a reference. The sample production device B and the sample production device A belong to a same process station. That is, the sample production device B and the sample production device A correspond to a same process. It will be seen that the number of defective samples, which pass through the sample production device A, is relatively large, and the sample production device A has a large influence on the occurrence of the defect type on the samples. Part (C) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> shows a distribution diagram of the first parameters of the plurality of samples according to production times of different sample production devices. In part (C), the scattered points above the dotted line represent defective samples, and the scattered points below the dotted line represent non-defective samples. Times at which the first parameters of the samples are distributed densely can be seen from the figure. The more densely the scattered points are distributed, the greater the influence degree to which the sample production device affects the occurrence of the defect type on the samples.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0164">In some examples, the fifth interface and the third interface may be the same interface. For example, after the user performs the second input on the third interface, a distribution diagram corresponding to the non-defective samples and the defective samples obtained after dividing the plurality of samples are displayed on the second interface. In some examples, the fifth interface and the fourth interface may be the same interface. For example, after the user performs the third input on the fourth interface, the focus threshold is obtained. And according to the focus threshold and the first parameters of the plurality of samples, a distribution diagram corresponding to the non-defective samples and the defective samples obtained after dividing the plurality of samples are displayed on the fourth interface.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0165">In some embodiments, the data processing method further includes: creating the sample set in response to a fourth input of the user on a sixth interface.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0166">For example, the fourth input of the user on the sixth interface includes: inputting out-of-factory times of the samples, detection times of the samples, informations of the sample detection devices, models of the samples, etc.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0167">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the display device <b>200</b> displays the sixth interface <b>206</b>.
