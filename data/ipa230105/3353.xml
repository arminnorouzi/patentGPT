Motor vehicles are at least required to have one low beam, one high beam, and one position light.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a headlight for single-track vehicles, wherein the headlights can also be used for other vehicles.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding generic headlights, especially for the position light a separate incandescent light or a separate semi-conductor-light-emitting element is used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This results in a higher number of components and a lower mechanical stability and density of the headlight which is particularly important when being used in off-road motorcycles. Furthermore, by having several light-emitting elements, replacing a defective light-emitting element is made more difficult.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">From the prior art there are also known lighting devices that combine main light and signal light function in one lighting device. DE 10 2010 063 713 A1 discloses a lighting device having light-emitting elements which are arranged on a support element. At least one high-light-emitting element and at least one low-light-emitting element are arranged on a light-emitting carrier while at least one position light-emitting element is arranged on a heat sink from which the light-emitting carrier is protruding.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A disadvantage of this prior art is that the at least one position light-emitting element is arranged within the area of the reflector, either as stripes in the reflector or as several spot-light sources.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For arranging the at least one position light-emitting element it is therefore necessary to have a specially adapted reflector having, for example, a gap or a recess.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">By arranging the at least one position light-emitting element within the area of the reflector, the distribution of light can only be adapted to a limited extent.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The objective of this invention is to create a modular lighting device having a light distribution that can be adapted and/or a headlight having such a lighting device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, the at least one position light-emitting element is arranged, in respect of the longitudinal direction, in a front facing end zone of the light-emitting element carrier and the at least one low-light-emitting element and the at least one high-light-emitting element in respect of the longitudinal direction are arranged behind the at least one position light-emitting element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Because the at least one position light-emitting element is arranged, in respect of the longitudinal direction, in a front facing end zone of the light-emitting element carrier, the at least on one position light-emitting element, in a state of being mounted in a headlight, can be arranged at a distance from the reflector. Light emitted by the at least one position light-emitting element can exit directly or by way of the reflector from the headlight. Dependent on the dimensions of the light-emitting element carrier and the configuration of the at least one position light-emitting element, the light distribution can therefore be flexibly adapted by the positioning in the end zone of the light-emitting element carrier.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Because the at least one low-light-emitting element and the at least one high-light-emitting element are arranged behind the at least one position light-emitting element in respect of the longitudinal direction, it is possible that the light-emitting elements each produce differing light distribution.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, in the endzone there is arranged a transmitting optic element around the at least one position light-emitting element. The light distribution of the at least one position light-emitting element can be influenced by the transmitting optic element. In particular, a spatially more extended light distribution can be created by that. This way, light can be deflected into a reflector despite the position of the at least one position light-emitting element in the end zone of the light-emitting element carrier.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the transmitting optic element is in the form of a diffuser and/or has a vertical ribbing and/or cylindrical lenses that are lined up.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further embodiment, a reflecting optic element is arranged around the at least one position light-emitting element in the end zone in such way that the light distribution of the at least one position light-emitting element can be influenced by the reflecting optic element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, the reflecting optic element can be arranged in such a way that the at least one position light-emitting element is shielded from the at least one low-light-emitting element and the at least high-light-emitting element. This way, the light distribution of the light-emitting elements can be adapted independently from each other.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In particular, the reflecting optic element can have a preferably concave outline and/or in respect of the longitudinal direction can be arranged behind the at least one position light-emitting element. This way, light of the at least one position element which is radiated to the back can be reflected to the front by the reflector. Therefore, the light efficiency can be increased by which less energy is used, and less heat is produced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Light reflected from the reflecting optic element can beam through the transmitting optic element in the further course of the rays. The light distribution of the position light can therefore be determined by the choice of the transmitting and the reflecting optic element in combination with the arrangement in the reflector of the headlight.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the reflecting optic element is made of a heat-conducting material, wherein the heat-conducting material can dissipate heat from at least one position light-emitting element to a heat sink.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At least two position light-emitting elements can be provided which are arranged on two opposite sides of the light-emitting element carrier. This way, a symmetric light distribution can be created, in particular, the top and bottom of the reflector can be radiated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The at least one low-light-emitting element and the at least one high-light-emitting element can be arranged on two opposite sides of the light-emitting element carrier. This way, the two light-emitting elements are shielded from each other. The at least one low-light-emitting element is preferably arranged on a top side so that light is emitted to the top and by the reflector reflected to the front and to the bottom. The at least one high-light-emitting element is preferably arranged on a bottom side so that light is emitted to the bottom and by the reflector reflected to the front and partially to the top.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the at least one low-light-emitting element and the at least one high-light-emitting element can be arranged in the longitudinal direction offset to one another. As this way the light-emitting elements each have their own longitudinal section of the light-emitting element carrier, heat can be dissipated more easily. Furthermore, less heat is emitted from at least one low-light-emitting element to the at least one high-light-emitting element, or vice versa, than with light-emitting elements that are arranged directly opposite to each other.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the lighting device has a heat sink, wherein the light-emitting element carrier is arranged at the heat sink in such way that, in respect of the longitudinal direction, the front facing end zone of the light-emitting element carrier is facing away from the heat sink. This way a lighting device is created that has a heat sink on the one end and at least one position light-emitting element on the other end.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The heat sink can have cooling ribs so that heat can be emitted to the environment more easily. Furthermore, in the heat sink there can be arranged a control device that is cooled by the heat sink. The control device is provided for controlling the light-emitting elements.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A heat-conducting member can be arranged at the light-emitting element carrier, wherein the heat-conducting member is connected with the heat sink in such way that heat can be conducted from the light-emitting element carrier into the heat sink. This is for cooling of the light-emitting elements. Especially, the at least one low-light-emitting element and/or the at least one high-light-emitting element produce a lot of heat and should therefore be cooled.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this case, the heat-conducting member can be connected in one piece with the heat sink. This way an especially good heat conduction from the heat-conducting member to the heat sink is guaranteed. Furthermore, the lighting device is constructed more stable this way. The heat-conducting member and/or the heat sink are preferably made of aluminum.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x201c;Connected in one piece&#x201d; can mean &#x201c;integrally&#x201d; connected or &#x201c;made of a consistent component&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The at least one low-light-emitting element and/or the at least one high-light-emitting element and/or the at least one position light-emitting element can be arranged in a recess of the heat-conducting member. They are particularly preferably covered and/or enclosed by the heat-conducting member. This way, heat can be dissipated very efficiently from the light-emitting elements. Furthermore, the light-emitting elements can be arranged in the inside of the heat-conducting member, for example on a circuit board, and protrude to the outside through the recesses.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">If the at least one low-light-emitting element and/or the at least high-light-emitting element are arranged in the longitudinal direction offset to one another, the area opposite of each respective light-emitting element is filled by the heat-conducting member and in particular free of a light-emitting element. The area opposite of each respective light-emitting element can therefore dissipate heat. Because of the offset arrangement, heat can be dissipated more easily by the light-emitting elements.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the area of the at least one low-light-emitting element and/or the at least one high-light-emitting element, the heat-conducting member has a narrowing so that the surface of the light-emitting elements substantially runs even with the surface of the heat-conducting member. This way, light-emitting elements that are arranged in the inside of the heat-conducting member, for example on a circuit board, do not need to project that much to the outside. Therefore, the recesses can be configured in a shorter manner.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, the heat-conducting member in the end zone can have a preferably concave outline which serves as a reflecting optic element for the at least one position light-emitting element. This way, the light efficiency of the at least one position light-emitting element can be increased on the one hand and on the other hand heat can be dissipated from the at least one position light-emitting element. Because of the higher light efficiency, less heat is produced from the beginning.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the lighting device can have a circuit board, wherein the at least one low-light-emitting element and/or the at least one high-light-emitting element and/or the at least one position light-emitting element are arranged on the circuit board. This way, a complicated and error-prone wiring of the light-emitting elements becomes obsolete.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The circuit board can project from the heat sink into the light-emitting element carrier. In particular, the circuit board can extend through the entire light-emitting element carrier in the longitudinal direction. This way, a control device arranged in the heat sink as well as the light-emitting elements arranged at the light-emitting element carrier can be electrically connected without wiring.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Between the circuit board and the heat sink and/or between the circuit board and the heat-conducting member, heat-conducting paste and/or a heat-conducting pad, preferably having a thickness of 0.8 millimeters, can be arranged. This way, heat can be transferred more efficiently form the circuit board to the heat sink and/or the heat-conducting member.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one particularly preferred embodiment, a first heat-conducting component comprises an upper part of the heat sink and an upper part of the heat-conducting member, and a second heat-conducting component comprises a lower part of the heat sink and a lower part of the heat-conducting member. This way, on the one hand a good transport of heat from the heat-conducting member with the light-emitting elements to the heat sink can be achieved. On the other hand, because of the two-part construction, an interior of the heat sink and/or the heat-conducting member becomes accessible. This way, it is possible to have a simple assembly of the lighting device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The circuit board can be arranged between the first heat-conducting component and the second heat-conducting component.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first heat-conducting component and the second heat-conducting component can be attached to each other by means of at least one fixing means, in particular a screw.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The at least one low-light-emitting element is arranged in a first recess of the first heat-conducting component and the at least one high-light-emitting element is arranged in a second recess of the second heat-conducting component. Then, in particular, the first heat-conducting component is arranged on the top and the second heat-conducting component is arranged on the bottom.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the at least one low-light-emitting element, the at least one high-light-emitting element and/or the at least one position light-emitting element are in the form of semi-conductor light sources, in particular light-emitting diodes or laser diodes.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Preferably, the light-emitting elements emit white light during operation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A headlight according to the invention comprises a lighting device according to the present disclosure and has at least one, preferably concave, reflector. During operation, light of the at least one low-light-emitting element and/or of the at least high-light-emitting element and/or of the at least one position light-emitting element is reflected at the reflector.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As already described above, the light distribution can be influenced by the positioning of the light-emitting elements in the reflector. A special advantage here is the positioning according to the invention of the at least one position light-emitting element in the end zone of the light-emitting element carrier, and therefore in an interior generated by the reflector.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The reflector can have a passage, wherein the light-emitting element carrier projects though the passage in the state of being mounted. The light-emitting element carrier can be arranged in an interior generated by the reflector and/or the heat sink can be arranged outside of an interior generated by the reflector. This way, the light-emitting element carrier projects into the interior generated by the reflector, wherein the at least one position light-emitting element projects the most to the front.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the at least one low-light-emitting element is arranged at a first, in particular at a top, side of the light-emitting element carrier so that its light can be reflected exclusively form a first, in particular top, half of the reflector.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The at least one high-light-emitting element can be arranged at a second, in particular at a bottom, side of the light-emitting element carrier so that its light can be reflected exclusively from a second, in particular bottom, half of the reflector.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The at least one position light-emitting element can be arranged at a first, in particular at a top, side, and at a second, in particular at a bottom, side of the light-emitting element carrier so that its light can be reflected from a first, in particular top, half of the reflector and from a second, in particular bottom, half of the reflector.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Differing, in particular not overlapping, reflector areas are provided, wherein one area each is used for one light function. This way, the light distribution can be individually adapted to each light function.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The at least one low-light-emitting element can be reflected, in particular exclusively, from a reflector area for the low beam. The at least one high-light-emitting element can be reflected, in particular exclusively, from a reflector area for the high beam. The at least one position light-emitting element can be reflected, in particular exclusively, from a reflector area for the position light.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A one-track vehicle according to the invention, in particular a motorcycle, has a headlight according to the disclosure of the present application.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this case, the headlight can preferably be used as a front headlight. This way the longitudinal direction of the light-emitting element carrier points essentially into the forward direction of driving of the one-track vehicle. This way, the at least one position light-emitting element is arranged in the front in forward direction of driving.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A method according to the invention for manufacturing a lighting device has the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0055">the first heat-conducting component is arranged at a first side of the circuit board,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0056">the second heat-conducting component is arranged at a second side opposite of the first side of the circuit board,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0057">the first heat-conducting component is attached to the second heat-conducting component, preferably by means of a fixing means, wherein the circuit board is held between the two heat-conducting components.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0056" num="0058">This way, a lighting device can be simply manufactured having the described, advantageous features. Furthermore, the lighting device can be easily disassembled for maintenance purposes or for error analysis in order to get, for example, access to the circuit board with the control device and the light-emitting elements.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0059">When using a method according to the invention for manufacturing a headlight, the light-emitting element carrier is led through a passage in the reflector and attached at a fixing interface at the reflector.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0060">In this case, the fixing interface is suitable for further lamps, especially halogen lamps.
