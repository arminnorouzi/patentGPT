However, despite the increase in both the availability and functionality of mobile devices, some tasks are still difficult to perform using mobile technology. In particular, while sharing data through mobile devices has become easier, ensuring the security of that data has become more difficult.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some example embodiments, methods, systems, and devices are disclosed herein for facilitating joint submissions in a secure and private manner. Specifically, example methods, systems, and devices innovate by segmenting data into multiple categories and applying different security or privacy protections. As functionality of devices, and in particular mobile technology, advances to allow users more collaborative experiences, a need to provide a more refined approach to protections is needed. This is especially true in instances where sensitive data may need to be transmitted securely and privately from point A to point B, but with intermediate users accessing and/or viewing portions of the data between point A and point B.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, a system according to an example embodiment may facilitate joint submissions for multiple devices (e.g., a primary device and a peripheral device). The primary device may receive a first user input initiating a joint submission with the peripheral device. For example, the primary and/or the peripheral devices may constitute mobile devices operated by two users. The primary device may be associated with a user profile for a primary user (e.g., a user account of the primary user) and the peripheral device may be associated with a user profile for a peripheral user (e.g., a user account for the peripheral user). The joint submission may require a first portion of submission data associated with the primary user and a second portion of submission data associated with the peripheral user. For example, the primary user and peripheral user may be collaborating on a project that requires both users to submit sensitive data that they may want to protect from third parties as well as each other.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In response to the first user input, the primary device may generate for display a Quick Response Code (QR code) code. The QR code may act as a first security measure for facilitating the joint submission. This initial security measure can facilitate joint submissions between mobile devices as the QR code can be generated to include specific details about the joint submission and can transfer those details through the use of a QR code scanner on the peripheral device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In response to the peripheral device interpreting the QR code associated with the joint submission using a QR code scanner, the system can activate a temporary device session between the primary device and the peripheral device based on the QR code. In some embodiments, either the primary or peripheral user may additionally or alternatively input data into their respective devices to activate the temporary device session. For example, in response to interpreting the QR code (or receiving a confirmation that the QR code has been received and/or accepted), the primary and/or peripheral device may query its respective users regarding activating the temporary device session. This query may introduce an additional security measure (e.g., a request for a joint submission or temporary device session password).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the temporary device session is active, the primary device may receive a second submission package from the peripheral device for combination with a first submission package for the primary device. The second submission package may include peripheral user data included in the required second portion of submission data and the required second portion of submission data may be segmented into sensitive data associated with the peripheral user and non-sensitive data associated with the peripheral user. In some embodiments, the sensitivity of this data may differ depending on the particular user. For example, while data may be required for the joint submission, the peripheral user may not wish to share this data with the primary user. Because of the collaborative nature of the joint submission, it may be necessary for the peripheral user to first share this information with the primary user (or at least the primary device) prior to completion of the joint submission. Because of this, the system may tag the sensitive data in one or more ways to designate for whom this data is sensitive, what device can receive, what device can display, what device may modify, etc. By segmenting the data (or categories of data), and tagging the data (or categories of data) in this manner, the devices may participate in a joint submission while ensuring both the security of the data and privacy of the users to third-parties (whether authorized or unauthorized) and each other. For example, the sensitive data associated with the peripheral user may (e.g., based on the assigned tags) not be viewable by the primary device, but may still be receivable by the primary device (e.g., for incorporation into the joint submission). Likewise, the non-sensitive data associated with the peripheral user may (e.g., based on the assigned tags) both be receivable and viewable by the primary device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The primary device may then receive primary user data from the primary user. For example, the primary device may receive data inputted by the primary user into a user interface of the primary device and/or may retrieve information about the primary user from a user profile of the primary user. The primary device may then verify that the primary user data includes the required first portion of submission data. For example, in order to facilitate the joint submission in which the receipt of, and/or ability to view, the data may be limited by its sensitivity, the primary device may verify that the primary user data includes the required first portion. Likewise, the peripheral device may verify that the peripheral user data includes the required second portion of submission data. By requiring each device to self-verify, or off-loading this operation to a third party (e.g., a server with access to any sensitive information), both the security and privacy concerns of the primary and peripheral users are met.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The primary device may then generate a first submission package for the primary device. The first submission package may include the required first portion of submission data included in the first data, and the first submission package may be combined (e.g., either at the primary device or at a remote server) with the second submission package to create a joint submission package. The primary device may then submit (or initiate the submission if the joint submission package is already remotely stored) the joint submission package. By combining the first submission package and the second submission package, while maintaining the individual security and privacy of the primary and peripheral users (even from each other), the system has facilitated a more collaborative experience without sacrificing the security or privacy of the users.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the primary device may generate a notification for the peripheral device that indicates that the second submission package has been received. This notification may include non-sensitive data associated with the primary user and may be transmitted to the peripheral device. Additionally, this notification may end the temporary device session. Alternatively, the temporary device session may be ended by the primary device upon receipt of the second portion of submission data or upon submission of the joint submission package. By ending the temporary device session following the notification, receipt, or submission, any potential security or privacy concern regarding an open device session is ended. If the temporary device session needs to be re-opened (e.g., in order to receive modification to the second submission package from the peripheral device) or a new temporary device session needs to be created, the primary device may generate a new QR code as discussed above. This QR code may contain the same information as the previous QR code and/or additional information that adds or restricts the actions of the temporary device session.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the primary device may be further configured to aggregate data in corresponding categories of the first submission package and the second submission package. For example, the joint submission may require data entered by the primary and peripheral user to be aggregated. If this data is sensitive (and thus not accessible and/or viewable) by the other user, this operation may not be possible unless the data needed to be aggregated has been previously segmented and/or tagged. Accordingly, the peripheral device (or a remote server) may segment the sensitive data associated with the peripheral user into a first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user and a second portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user, in which the first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user is in a category of sensitive data that requires its values to be aggregated with values of sensitive data associated with the primary user in a respective category, and in which the second portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user is in a category of sensitive data that does not require its values to be aggregated with values of sensitive data associated with the primary user in a respective category. The primary device may then identify (e.g., based on tags) the first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user and the second portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user. In response to identifying sensitive data associated with the peripheral user in the first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user, the primary device (or a remote server) may aggregate a value of the first portion of sensitive data with a value of sensitive data associated with the primary user. By segmenting, tagging, and aggregating in this manner (which does not involve displaying the underlying data), the security and privacy concerns of the users are maintained even in instances where sensitive data requires aggregation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various other aspects, features, and advantages will be apparent through the detailed description and the drawings attached hereto.

The computing devices may include additional communication paths linking a plurality of hardware, software, and/or firmware components operating together. For example, the computing devices may be implemented by a cloud of computing platforms operating together as the computing devices.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, system <b>100</b> is initiating a joint submission (e.g., the application for a joint bank account) between multiple devices (e.g., primary device <b>104</b> and a peripheral device <b>102</b>). For example, users of primary device <b>104</b> and a peripheral device <b>102</b> may be collaborating to fill out a joint bank account application. Using primary device <b>104</b> and a peripheral device <b>102</b>, each user may enter information necessary to complete the joint bank account. For example, the primary device may receive a first user input initiating a joint submission with the peripheral device. For example, a primary user that is operating primary device <b>104</b> may select a link displayed on primary device <b>104</b> that initiates a joint submission of an application for a joint bank account with a peripheral user operating peripheral device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The primary device may be associated with a user profile for a primary user (e.g., a user account of the primary user) and the peripheral device may be associated with a user profile for a peripheral user (e.g., a user account for the peripheral user). The joint submission may require a first portion of submission data associated with the primary user and a second portion of submission data associated with the peripheral user. For example, in order to complete the joint submission (e.g., the joint bank account application), the primary user and peripheral user may need to enter personal information such as name, social security number, annual income, demographic information, etc. Some of this information may be sensitive data. As referred to herein, sensitive data includes data the owner of which does not wish to be publicly disclosed to third-parties and/or to the other user for security and/or privacy reasons. For example, while the peripheral user may not be concerned with disclosing his name to the other user, the peripheral user may be concerned with disclosing his social security or annual income to the other user.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the categories of data that are considered &#x201c;sensitive&#x201d; may be designated by the owner of the data (e.g., the user operating primary device <b>104</b> or peripheral device <b>102</b>), designated by user preference or settings (e.g., as found in a user profile or user account for the user operating primary device <b>104</b> or peripheral device <b>102</b>), designated by a third party (e.g., a service that provides the joint submission platform and/or receives the joint submission), and/or based on predetermined application settings (e.g., the application to which the joint submission is submitted may automatically categorize some information as sensitive). In some embodiments, any data that could potentially identify a specific individual, any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another, and/or any information that can be used for de-anonymizing anonymous data may be considered sensitive.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In response to a first user input (e.g., requesting to begin a joint submission), the primary device may generate for display a Quick Response Code (QR code) such as QR code <b>114</b>. It should be noted that any alphanumeric, matrix-based, or other code scheme may be suitable. QR code <b>114</b> may be converted into a useful form by peripheral device <b>102</b>. For example, in response to peripheral device <b>112</b> scanning QR code <b>114</b> on primary device <b>104</b>, peripheral device <b>102</b> can interpret QR code <b>114</b> and convert it into instructions for facilitating the joint submission and/or opening a temporary device session. For example, in response to the first user input, primary device <b>104</b> may have launched a temporary device session. Peripheral device <b>102</b> may convert QR code <b>114</b> into a URL that, when accessed, provides instructions, login credentials, access to a downloadable content (e.g., a joint submission application) and/or other information related to the joint submission and/or joining the device session launch by primary device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Upon interpreting QR code <b>114</b> with a QR code scanner, peripheral device <b>102</b> can activate (e.g., join) the temporary device session primary device <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, either the primary or peripheral user may additionally or alternatively input data into their respective devices to activate the temporary device session. For example, in response to interpreting the QR code (or receiving a confirmation that the QR code has been received and/or accepted), the primary and/or peripheral device may query its respective users regarding activating the temporary device session. This query may introduce an additional security measure (e.g., a request for a joint submission or temporary device session password).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a system for facilitating joint submissions in user devices, in accordance with one or more embodiments. In particular, system <b>200</b> illustrates the state of the system after the temporary device session is active.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, while the temporary device session is active, primary device <b>104</b> and peripheral device <b>102</b> may share information related to the joint submission. For example, primary device <b>104</b> may receive a second submission package from peripheral device <b>102</b>, and primary device <b>104</b> may combine the second submission package with a first submission package. Additionally, primary device <b>104</b> and peripheral device <b>102</b> may gain access to other devices (e.g., server <b>106</b>). For example, while temporary device session is active, primary device <b>104</b> and peripheral device <b>102</b> may be able to securely transfer encrypted data (e.g., the respective submission packages and/or other data) between each other and/or server <b>106</b>. It should be noted that primary device <b>104</b>, peripheral device <b>102</b>, and/or server <b>106</b> may encrypt data using public key or symmetric key encryption and may use 56-bit or higher encryption.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, server <b>106</b> may store drafts of the joint submission as data related to the joint submission is received from primary device <b>104</b> and peripheral device <b>102</b>. Server <b>106</b> may store the joint submission as a draft, and the draft may be accessible by primary device <b>104</b> and peripheral device <b>102</b> while the temporary device session remains active. In some embodiments, certain operations may be off-loaded to server <b>106</b> (e.g., data verification steps as discussed below).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally or alternatively, while the temporary device session is active, primary device <b>104</b> may receive a second submission package from peripheral device <b>102</b> for combination with a first submission package for primary device <b>104</b>. For example, as part of the joint submission, primary device <b>104</b> may receive a portion of data (e.g., the portion of the joint submission feature the data from the peripheral user) from peripheral device <b>102</b> for incorporation into the joint submission.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, the second submission package may include peripheral user data included in the required second portion of submission data. It should be noted that depending on the algorithm used, the required portions of submission data may refer to the underlying values or the categories of values. For example, in some embodiments, verification of the required portion of submission data may include validating that a required category of data has been received. That is, the verification may require ensuring that a required field is populated with a data value. Alternatively or additionally, the verification of the required portion of submission data may include validating both the presence of data value, and also the accuracy of the data value. For example, the verification step performed by primary device <b>104</b>, peripheral device <b>102</b>, and/or server <b>106</b> may include verifying that a value in the social security number field is the correct social security number of a user associated with the portion of submission data.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The required second portion of submission data may also be segmented into sensitive data associated with the peripheral user and non-sensitive data associated with the peripheral user. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, peripheral device <b>102</b> has received sensitive data <b>120</b> and non-sensitive data <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the sensitivity of this data may differ depending on the particular user. For example, the designation of sensitive data <b>120</b> as sensitive may have come from a user operating peripheral device <b>102</b>. Because of this, the system may tag the sensitive data in one or more ways to designate to whom this data is sensitive, what device can receive, what device can display, what device may modify, etc. By segmenting the data (or categories of data), and tagging the data (or categories of data) in this manner, the devices may participate in a joint submission while ensuring both the security of the data and privacy of the users to third-parties (whether authorized or unauthorized) and each other. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, sensitive data <b>120</b> is not displayed on primary device <b>104</b> (although non-sensitive data <b>118</b> is displayed).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the sensitive data associated with the peripheral user may not be viewable by primary device <b>104</b> but may still be receivable by the primary device (e.g., for incorporation into the joint submission). For example, while sensitive data <b>120</b> may have been received by primary device <b>104</b>, it is not necessarily viewable and/or accessible by a user of primary device <b>104</b>. Likewise, non-sensitive data <b>118</b> is both receivable and viewable by primary device <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, primary device <b>104</b> has used non-sensitive data <b>118</b> to generate notification <b>116</b> on primary device <b>104</b>. Notably, because sensitive data <b>120</b> is not accessible and/or viewable by a user operating primary device <b>104</b>, sensitive data <b>120</b> is not used for generating notification <b>116</b>. Additionally, a user operating primary device <b>104</b> could not view and/or access this data while reviewing the joint submission or data relating to the joint submission received from peripheral device <b>102</b>. That is, while the required second portion of submission data may be stored on primary device <b>104</b>, the joint submission application or encryption scheme prevents a user from accessing sensitive data <b>120</b> from primary device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Primary device <b>104</b> may then receive primary user data from the primary user. For example, primary device <b>104</b> may receive data inputted by the primary user into a user input interface of primary device <b>104</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, primary device <b>104</b> is a touchscreen smartphone and thus primary device <b>104</b> may receive user inputs via the touchscreen display. Alternatively or additionally, primary device <b>104</b> may retrieve information about the primary user from a user profile of the primary user. For example, as part of the joint submission process, the users of primary device <b>104</b> and peripheral device <b>102</b> may have (or be required to create) user profiles. These user profiles may be linked to a user account for the respective user of the service provider of the joint submission application (or the service provider to which the joint submission is to be submitted). Primary device <b>140</b>, peripheral device <b>102</b>, and/or server <b>106</b> may access this profile and/or account to retrieve data to complete the joint submission. For example, using the user profile and/or user account for each respective user, the joint submission application may autofill the respective portions of required submission data to create the respective submission packages.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Primary device <b>104</b> may then verify that the primary user data includes the required first portion of submission data. For example, in order to facilitate the joint submission in which the receipt of, and/or ability to view, the data may be limited by its sensitivity, primary device <b>104</b> may verify that the primary user data includes the required first portion. Likewise, peripheral device <b>102</b> may verify that the peripheral user data includes the required second portion of submission data. Alternatively or additionally, each device may self-verify or off-load this operation to a third-party and/or other authorized entity (e.g., server <b>106</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Primary device <b>104</b> may then generate a first submission package for primary device <b>104</b>. The first submission package may include the required first portion of submission data included in the first data, and the first submission package may be combined (e.g., either at primary device <b>104</b> or at server <b>106</b>) with the second submission package to create a joint submission package. Primary device <b>104</b> may then submit (or initiate the submission if the joint submission package is already stored at server <b>106</b>) the joint submission package.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, primary device <b>104</b> may generate a notification (e.g., similar to notification <b>116</b>) for peripheral device <b>102</b> that indicates that the second submission package has been received. This notification may include non-sensitive data associated with the primary user (e.g., the name of the primary user) and may be transmitted to peripheral device <b>102</b>. Additionally, this notification may end the temporary device session. Alternatively, the temporary device session may be ended by the primary device upon receipt of the second portion of submission data (e.g., simultaneously with the generation of notification <b>116</b>) or upon submission of the joint submission package. Notably, if the temporary device session needs to be re-opened (e.g., in order to receive modification to the second submission package from peripheral device <b>106</b>) or a new temporary device session needs to be created, primary device <b>104</b> may generate a new QR code as discussed above. This QR code may contain the same information as the previous QR code and/or additional information that adds or restricts the actions of the temporary device session.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, primary device <b>104</b> may be further configured to aggregate data in corresponding categories of the first submission package and the second submission package. For example, the joint submission may require data entered by the primary and peripheral user to be aggregated. If this data is sensitive (and thus not accessible and/or viewable) by the other user, this operation may not be possible unless the data needed to be aggregated has been previously segmented and/or tagged. Accordingly, peripheral device <b>102</b> (or server <b>106</b>) may segment the sensitive data associated with the peripheral user into a first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user and a second portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user, in which the first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user is in a category of sensitive data that requires its values to be aggregated with values of sensitive data associated with the primary user in a respective category, and in which the second portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user is in a category of sensitive data that does not require its values to be aggregated with values of sensitive data associated with the primary user in a respective category.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally or alternatively, the joint submission application (or peripheral device <b>102</b>) may encrypt the tags and/or data needing to be aggregated differently than other data. For example, primary device <b>104</b> may have the encryption key for the encryption of the tags and use it to decrypt the tags, while the underlying data remains encrypted. With the tags decrypted, primary device <b>104</b> may identify the data that needs to be aggregated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">After primary device <b>104</b> identifies (e.g., based on tags) the first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user and the second portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user, primary device <b>104</b> may process the underlying values. In response to identifying sensitive data associated with the peripheral user in the first portion of sensitive data associated with the peripheral user, primary device <b>104</b> (or server <b>106</b>) may aggregate a value of the first portion of sensitive data with a value of sensitive data associated with the primary user. Processing these values to perform the aggregation may include further decryption and/or may involve other security protocols (e.g., transmitting the data to server <b>106</b> and/or submitting the joint submission package with a notification to aggregate data prior to finalizing the submission) to ensure that the sensitive data is not accessible to the user of primary device <b>104</b>. Notably, even if underlying data is decrypted, the tags still prevent the values of the sensitive data from being displayed on the primary device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a flowchart for transmitting a submission package for combination with another submission package, in accordance with one or more embodiments. For example, process <b>300</b> may represent the steps taken by peripheral device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to receive data from the user operating peripheral device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and transmit a submission package of that data to primary device <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At step <b>302</b>, a first mobile device (e.g., peripheral device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) receives a first user input initiating a joint submission (e.g., a marriage certificate application for two people) with a second mobile device (e.g., primary device <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)). For example, the first mobile device may be associated with a user profile for a first user (e.g., a user profile established for the first person with a local government) and the second mobile device is associated with a user profile for a second user (e.g., a user profile established for the second person with the local government). The joint submission may require a first portion of submission data associated with the first user and a second portion of submission data associated with the second user. For example, the joint submission may require a name, current address, previous address, social security number, height, weight, known alias, etc. To speed up the process of filling out the information for the joint submission, the two people may initiate a joint submission through the use of a joint submission application operating on the first and second mobile devices.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>304</b>, the first mobile device (e.g., peripheral device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) activates a temporary device session in response to a first user input. For example, the first user input may have been the selection of a link on a webpage which opens the joint submission application, a selection of a joint submission application icon on the mobile device, or may have been a link in an electronic communication received from another device (e.g., primary device <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)). In response to the first user input, a temporary device session is activated. In some embodiments, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> below, the mobile device's additional security measures may be introduced (e.g., the user of QR code).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At step <b>306</b>, the first mobile device (e.g., peripheral device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) receives first user data. For example, while the temporary device session is active, a user operating the first mobile device may input first user data into the first mobile device. This data (or the categories of this data) may correspond to at least the first portion of submission data. Additionally or alternatively, the first mobile device may retrieve first user data automatically (e.g., from the user profile established for the first user).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>308</b>, the first mobile device verifies that the first user data includes the required first portion of submission data. For example, the first mobile device may verify that the data about the first user that is required to complete the first submission has been entered. This step may include verifying that the first user has entered values into required fields. Additionally or alternatively, this step may include verifying that a value (e.g., a value entered for the name of the first user) is correct. For example, the first mobile device may compare the name entered by the first user to the name of the first user in the user profile. Additionally or alternatively, the first mobile device may compare the name entered by the first user to a name of the first user entered by a user on the other device (e.g., primary device <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) when the joint submission was being initiated. The first mobile device may then segment the required first portion of submission data into sensitive data associated with the first user and non-sensitive data associated with the first user. For example, the first user may indicate that data related to weight is sensitive and therefore not want the other user to be able to view this data. Additionally or alternatively, the joint submission application may determine that the social security number is personally identifiable information and therefore automatically designate this information as sensitive. Other data (e.g., the name of the first user) may be designated as non-sensitive by the first user, joint submission application, etc. It should be noted that in some embodiments, the verification of data may occur remotely (e.g., as server <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)). In such embodiments, the first mobile device transmits data for verification to the remote device. Alternatively or additionally, the first mobile device may activate another temporary device session between the first mobile device (e.g., peripheral device <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) and the remote device (e.g., server <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) along another communication path (e.g., communication path <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>310</b>, the first mobile device generates a first submission package for the first mobile device in response to verifying that the first user data includes the required first portion of submission data.

Once the first submission package is created, the sensitive data associated with the first user (e.g., sensitive data <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>)) is not viewable by the second mobile device (although it may still be receivable and/or accessible by the joint submission application), whereas the non-sensitive data associated with the first user (e.g., non-sensitive data <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>)) may be viewable by the second mobile device (and still receivable and/or accessible by the joint submission application).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At step <b>312</b>, the first mobile device transmits the first submission package for combination with a second submission package for the second mobile device.

In some embodiments, the second mobile device (e.g., primary device <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) may generate the second submission packages via steps <b>306</b>-<b>310</b> on the second mobile device and/or a remote device (e.g., server <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is contemplated that the steps or descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be used with any other embodiment of this disclosure.

For example, the query may appear as a notification on the first mobile device or a form with various fields requiring data input. In some embodiments, the fields for the required data (i.e., data necessary to complete the first portion of submission data and/or data in a category of the first portion of submission data) may be highlighted as required. Additionally, the first user may be able to designate the types of data, or the data itself, that is sensitive and/or non-sensitive (as well as to whom the data is sensitive).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At step <b>404</b>, the first mobile device verifies whether or not the received first user data includes all of the data needed for the first portion of the submission data.

For example, the first mobile device may be associated with a user profile for a first user (e.g., a sub-lessor) and the second mobile device is associated with a user profile for a second user (e.g., a user profile established for the sub-lessor with the lessor). The joint submission may require a first portion of submission data associated with the first user and a second portion of submission data associated with the second user. For example, the joint submission may require a name, current address, previous address, social security number, etc.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At step <b>504</b>, the first mobile device activates a Quick Response Code (QR code) scanner at the first mobile device in response to the first user input. For example, in order to initiate a temporary device session to share data securely between the first and second mobile device, the first mobile device may be required to scan a QR code displayed on the first mobile device.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At step <b>506</b>, the first mobile device interprets a QR code associated with the joint submission, which is displayed on the second mobile device, with the QR code scanner. For example, the QR code (or another suitable alphanumeric, matrix-based, or other code based scheme) may display a QR code (e.g., QR code <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)) that can be converted into a useful form by the first mobile device.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step <b>508</b>, the first mobile device activates a temporary device session between the first mobile device and the second mobile device based on the QR code. For example, while the temporary device session is active, the first mobile device and second mobile device may share information related to the joint submission. Additionally, the first mobile device and second mobile device may gain access to other devices (e.g., server <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)). For example, while a temporary device session is active, the first mobile device and second mobile device may be able to securely transfer encrypted data (e.g., the respective submission packages and/or other data) between each other and/or other devices.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At step <b>510</b>, the first mobile device receives first user data from the first mobile device. For example, the first user data may be for a first portion of submission data, which is needed to generate a first submission package. In another example, the first mobile device may receive, a second user input modifying the first user data after transmitting the first submission package for combination with a second submission package. For example, after the first user transmits the first submission package, the first user may wish to modify some data. The first mobile device then generates a modified first submission package for transmitting to the second mobile device (e.g., primary device <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of server <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>512</b>, the first mobile device determines whether the temporary device session is active.

In response to determining that the temporary device session is not active, process <b>500</b> continues to step <b>516</b> and activates the QR code scanner at the first mobile device to interpret a new QR code associated with the joint submission that will re-activate the temporary device session. In some embodiments, either the first or second user may additionally or alternatively input data into their respective devices to re-activate the temporary device session. For example, in response to interpreting a new QR code (or receiving a confirmation that the QR code has been received and/or accepted), the first and/or second mobile device may query its respective users regarding re-activating the temporary device session. This query may introduce an additional security measure (e.g., a request for a joint submission or temporary device session password).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It is contemplated that the steps or descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be used with any other embodiment of this disclosure.
