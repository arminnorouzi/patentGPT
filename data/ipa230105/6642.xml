Particularly, among RF components, a filter is one of essential components used in mobile communication technology and enables high-quality communication by selecting a signal needed by a user among a plurality of frequency bands or filtering a signal to be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, a dielectric filter and a surface acoustic wave (hereinafter, referred to as SAW) filter have been used most as RF filters for wireless communication. The dielectric filter has advantages such as a high dielectric constant, a low insertion loss, stability at a high temperature, high vibration resistance, and high shock resistance. However, the dielectric filter has limitations in miniaturization and monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) fields which are recent trends of technology development. Also, in comparison to the dielectric filter, the SAW filter has a small size, easily processes a signal, has a simple circuit, and is manufactured using a semiconductor process so as to facilitate mass production. Also, the SAW filter has an advantage of transmitting and receiving high-grade information due to high side rejection within a passband in comparison to the dielectric filter. However, since an SAW filter process includes an exposure process using ultraviolet (UV), there is a disadvantage in which a line width of an interdigital transducer (IDT) is limited to about 0.5 &#x3bc;m. Accordingly, there is a problem in which it is impossible to cover an ultrahigh frequency band of 3 GHz or more using the SAW filter, and thus, there is a basic difficulty in forming an MMIC structure and a single chip on a semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to overcome such limitations and problems, there has been provided a film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) filter capable of completely implementing a frequency control circuit, which is integrated with other active devices on an existing semiconductor (Si or GaAs) substrate, as an MMIC.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The FBAR is a thin film device which is low-cost, small-sized, and features a high quality factor so as to be applicable to a wireless communication device, a military-use radar, and the like in a variety of frequency bands of 900 MHz to 10 GHz. Also, the FBAR is reduced in size as one-several hundredth of the dielectric filter and a lumped constant (LC) filter and has a very smaller insertion loss than the SAW filter. Accordingly, the FBAR is considered as one of most adequate devices for an MMIC which requires high stability and a high quality factor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An FBAR filter is formed by depositing zinc oxide (ZnO), aluminum nitride (AlN), or the like, which is a piezoelectric-dielectric material, on silicon (Si) or gallium arsenide (GaAs), which is a semiconductor substrate, using an RF sputtering method and thus causes a resonance due to a piezoelectric property. That is, the FBAR may generate a resonance through depositing of a piezoelectric thin film between both electrodes and causing a bulk acoustic wave.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A variety of forms of FBAR structures have been studied until now. In the case of a membrane type FBAR, a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) film is deposited on a substrate and a membrane layer is formed using a cavity formed in an opposite side of the substrate through isotropic etching. Also, a lower electrode is formed above the SiO2 film, a piezoelectric layer is formed by depositing a piezoelectric material above the lower electrode using an RF magnetron sputtering method, and an upper electrode is formed above the piezoelectric layer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above membrane type FBAR has advantages of less power loss and dielectric loss due to the cavity. However, the membrane type FBAR has problems in which a device-occupied area is large due to a directivity of the silicon substrate and a decrease in yield caused by damages due to low structural stability in a follow-up packaging process. Accordingly, recently, in order to reduce a loss caused by the membrane and to simplify a device manufacturing process, an air gap type FBAR and a Bragg reflector type FBAR have appeared.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Bragg reflector type FBAR has a structure in which a reflector layer is formed by alternately depositing materials having a high acoustic impedance difference therebetween on a substrate and a lower electrode, a piezoelectric layer, and an upper electrode are sequentially stacked. Here, acoustic wave energy which has passed through the piezoelectric layer may not be transferred toward the substrate and all reflected by the reflector layer so as to efficiently generate a resonance. Although the Bragg reflector type FBAR is structurally sound and has no stress caused by flexure, there are disadvantages in which it is difficult to precisely form the reflector layer which has a reflective layer with thickness of 4 or more layers for total reflection and much time and great expense for manufacturing are required.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, in the case of conventional FBARs having a structure in which a substrate is isolated from a resonance portion using an air gap instead of a reflector layer, a sacrificial layer is implemented through anisotropic etching on the surface of a silicon substrate and surface-treated through chemical-mechanical polishing, an insulation layer, a lower electrode, a piezoelectric layer, and an upper electrode are sequentially deposited, and the sacrificial layer is removed and the air gap is formed through a via hole so as to implement an FBAR.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the conventional FBAR structure, the piezoelectric layer is formed between the upper and lower electrodes and the upper and lower electrodes are installed only in a necessary area of the piezoelectric layer so that the piezoelectric effect is used. Accordingly, the conventional structure has a great mechanical anchor loss which causes a decrease in mechanical energy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the case of the upper electrode or lower electrode, molybdenum (Mo), ruthenium (Ru), tungsten (W), and the like are used to increase acoustic impedance. Since a skin depth of an electrode material is determined depending on a frequency of the filter and electrodes generally have thicknesses much smaller than the skin depth, charges formed at a resonance point of the piezoelectric layer are not transferred enough through lead and thus a quality factor is decreased.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">RELATED ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0014">Patent Document 0001: Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2004-0102390 (published on Dec. 8, 2004)</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is directed to fixing an increase in electrical loss which is caused by induction hardening and indicated as a problem of thin film electrodes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is also directed to compensating for an electrical loss of a conventional thin film electrode, which is indicated as a problem, through a change in pad position and structural changes of electrodes and a piezoelectric layer in an acoustic resonator.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention is also directed to providing an electrode structure appropriate for removing parasitic capacitance which occurs due to electrodes arranged in proximity to each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is also directed to fixing problems caused by increased resistance due to thinning of electrodes due to increase in signal frequency that the filter must process.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an acoustic resonator including a substrate including a first cavity, a first electrode formed above the substrate, a piezoelectric layer formed on one surface of the first electrode, and a second electrode formed on one surface of the piezoelectric layer.
