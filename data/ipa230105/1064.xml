For example, in congestive heart failure, due to dysfunction of the left side or right side of the heart, or both, the body is unable to pump blood with normal efficiency, leading to the reduction of blood pressure in systemic circulation. In an attempt to increase blood pressure, the body retains sodium (and water), which leads to stasis or pooling of blood or fluid in the lungs or liver, edema and/or cardiac hypertrophy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods, systems and compositions for directly removing excess sodium and water using a no or low sodium infusate instilled into a patient's peritoneal cavity are described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 10,918,778, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. That patent describes a battery-powered pump, designed to be implanted subcutaneously, that includes an inlet catheter configured to be disposed within a patient's peritoneal cavity and an output catheter configured to be coupled to the patient's bladder. The pump is programmed to periodically actuate to move fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder, where the fluid may be voided during urination.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described in the above-incorporated patent, Direct Sodium Removal (&#x201c;DSR&#x201d;) Therapy may be conducted periodically, e.g., daily or once weekly, to remove excess sodium and fluid from a patient to reduce fluid-overload, edema, and to reduce cardiac effort in patients with heart failure, such as Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (&#x201c;HFrEF&#x201d;). To conduct such therapy, a quantity, e.g., up to 2 liters, of a no or low sodium DSR solution is instilled into the patient's peritoneal cavity for a dwell period, which may vary from a couple of hours up to 24 hours, depending on type of DSR infusate used. During the dwell period, the DSR solution creates a sodium gradient that draws excess sodium from the patient's tissues and/or bloodstream into the peritoneal cavity, along with a corresponding volume of ultrafiltrate, e.g., water. At the conclusion of the dwell period, the implantable pump is actuated to move the now sodium-rich DSR solution and ultrafiltrate from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder. As observed in the above-incorporated patent and in initial human clinical testing, DSR therapy can reduce physiologically significant amounts of sodium and fluid from the patient, thereby reducing fluid overload and improving cardiac function.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of DSR therapy, as described in the above patent, is that the dwell period for the DSR solution in the patient's peritoneal cavity may be based on the physician's prior clinical experience and assessment of the specific patient's physiology. In the above incorporated, commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/650,183, in one aspect of that invention an analyte sensor is described as associated with the implantable pump system for monitoring an analyte concentration, such as sodium ions, in the fluid in the patient's peritoneal cavity, and for automatically adjusting the dwell time prior to initiating fluid transfer to the patient's bladder to adapt the general DSR therapy to the physiologic needs of specific patients. For example, some patients may have a high level of excess sodium stored in extravascular spaces, e.g., in interstitial spaces and tissues, whereas others may not. Consequently, the above-incorporated application discloses adjusting a dwell period for a DSR solution in accordance with a monitored analyte concentration, or to transfer a specified amount of analyte from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder for a particular therapy session.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One feature of the implantable pump of the above-incorporated application is that the pump generally is operated at a substantially constant motor speed during actuation. In may occur, however, depending upon the specific patient's physiology and the type of DSR solution used, that fluid or sodium accumulation in the patient's peritoneal cavity may progress faster than anticipated by the physician. In such a case, it may be desirable to provide an implantable system with a variable motor speed, which may be adjusted manually or on a pre-programmed basis to pump fluid from the patient's peritoneal cavity at different flow rates during or subsequent to the DSR therapy session. For example, it may be desirable to accelerate fluid transfer to substantially empty the bulk of the instilled fluid and ultrafiltrate promptly after expiration of a nominal dwell time (or as indicated responsive to monitored analyte concentration) and then employ a lower pump speed to transfer subsequently accumulated fluid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In connection with enabling variable pumping speeds, as mentioned above, it further would be desirable to provide a more robust alarm system for the implantable pump system. For example, whereas the implantable pump described in the above-identified patent employed a single flow rate, with the additional of multiple flow rates as discussed in the preceding paragraph, it would be desirable to monitor the pump speed to ensure that a desired pump speed is attained during a specified interval. If the desired pump speed is not attained, for example, due to proteinaceous buildup within the pump, it would be desirable for the processor controlling the implantable pump to generate an alarm that is communicated to the patient, e.g., via the external charging system or by communication with software loaded onto a patient's smartphone. The patient might then be presented with various options for rectifying the alarm condition.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the implantable pump system described in the above-identified patent included pressure sensors for monitoring intraabdominal pressure, and activating the implantable pump when the pressure exceeds a specified threshold value. In the context of DSR therapy, however, in view of the compliance of the abdominal cavity, it instead may be desirable to monitor and trigger pump actuation based on the time-dependent evolution of pressure within the peritoneal cavity. In this manner, the implantable pump could differentiate between pressure fluctuations caused by the patient coughing or bending over from pressure increases resulting from filling of the peritoneal cavity.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It also may be desirable to employ the catheter used for instilling the DSR fluid into the patient's peritoneal cavity during initiation of the DSR therapy to flush potential blockages from the inlet of the implantable pump.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop provide an implantable pump system for use in conducting DSR therapy sessions in which the implantable pump system provides additional flexibility in ease of use as well as enhanced monitoring and safety features.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is directed to an implantable pump system having enhanced features and programming adapted for conducting DSR therapy for patients suffering from fluid and/or sodium overload, e.g., heart failure patients and patients afflicted with cardio-renal disease. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, an implantable pump system as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 10,918,778 and/or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/650,183 is provided, which in addition provides additional enhancements for use in conducting DSR therapy, including variable programmable pump speeds, a set of more comprehensive set of alarm conditions and trouble-shooting options for resolving such alarm conditions, and increases ease of use for instilling a DSR solution during initiation of the DSR therapy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with the principles of the present invention, an implantable pump system is provided that includes a programmable variable-speed implantable pump coupled to an inlet catheter having an inlet end configured to be disposed in a patient's peritoneal cavity and an outlet catheter having an outlet end configured to be disposed in the patient's bladder. The implantable pump is configured for wireless communication with an external charging and communication system. The external charging and communication system in turn may be configured to communicate with a software application installed on a physician monitoring and control system and optionally, a software application installed on the patient's smartphone, personal computer or tablet. In one preferred embodiment, such as described in the above-incorporated application, the implantable pump system includes sensor for measuring a concentration of an analyte, such as sodium, for detecting a concentration of an infusate component, such as dextrose or icodextrin, or an osmotic pressure or gradient, or for monitoring an amount of sodium removed from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder during a pumping session.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further in accordance with the principles of the invention, the implantable pump includes a positive-displacement gear pump, such that the volume of fluid transferred during a pumping session may be accurately computed based on the number of gear rotations during a specified interval. According to one aspect of the invention, the implantable pump system includes an on-board processor that may be programmed by the patient's physician to operate the gear pump at different speeds. For example, the pump may operate at a first speed to rapidly transfer fluid from a patient's peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder following completion of a predetermined dwell time, or in response to detection by the analyte sensor of an analyte level in the peritoneal cavity above a predetermined threshold. The implantable pump also may be programmed to operate thereafter at a substantially lower speed to periodically remove further fluid accumulations from the peritoneal cavity after the conclusion of the DSR therapy session. Further, the implantable pump may be operated at a selected speed specifically in response to a command transmitted by the patient, his or her caretaker or physician.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the implantable pump system includes an enhanced alarm monitoring and notification capability. In particular, to address the increased pump speed programming complexity, the implantable pump system preferably includes additional alarm monitoring, reporting and resolution capability. For example, a preferred embodiment may include programming for monitoring pump operation that promptly generates an alarm to notify the patient, via the external charging and control system or a smartphone application, that the pump output is below a specified threshold for output for a particular phase of the DSR session. In this case, the patient may be contact his or her physician, who may send commands via the smartphone application to the implantable pump system to increase pump speed for the remainder of the pumping session. Alternatively, if the alarm identifies a blockage in the gear pump due to the presence of particulate matter, the programming may notify the patient to request that the physician remotely activate a boost mode or jog mode to overcome and/or grind and remove the obstruction, as described below. Alternatively, the smartphone application may send such notifications directly to the patient's physician, as well as the patient. In a still further alternative embodiment, the alarm software of the implantable pump system may monitor intraabdominal pressure during instillation of the DSR fluid or during the dwell period, and notify the patient to request cessation of addition of DSR fluid to the peritoneal cavity or to prompt transfer of accumulated fluid to the patient's bladder.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another aspect of the invention, the implantable pump system may include advanced algorithms for determining completion of a dwell period and when to activate the pump to transfer fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder. The above-incorporated patent and application describe that the dwell period for retaining the DSR solution in the peritoneal cavity may be based on a specified time, e.g., 2 hours, attaining a threshold intraabdominal pressure, or attaining an analyte concentration level in the fluid in peritoneal cavity. In accordance with the present invention, actuation of the implantable pump further may be triggered by monitoring the rate of change of pressure within the peritoneal cavity over a specified time interval. In this manner, the pump will not be inadvertently triggered by transient increases in intraabdominal pressure, e.g., due to patient coughing or transient postural changes.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further in accordance with the principles of the invention, the implantable pump system may include an improved fluid transfer set for flushing the peritoneal catheter when instilling DSR fluid into the patient's peritoneal cavity during initiation of the DSR session. In one preferred embodiment, the inlet catheter to the pump includes a tee-shaped junction, wherein a first side of the junction has an instillation line configured to be coupled to a subcutaneous port having a self-healing membrane, a second side of the junction couples to a peritoneal catheter configured to be positioned in the peritoneal cavity and a third port of the junction is configured to be coupled via tubing to the implantable pump inlet port. A valve optionally may be incorporated into the tee-shaped junction, which closes to prevent instilled fluid from flowing into the implantable pump during infusion of DSR solution, and which closes the instillation during pumping of fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this manner, DSR solution, typically 0.5 up to 2 liters, may be instilled via a needle inserted into the subcutaneous port, so that it flows through the instillation line, the tee junction with optional valve and the peritoneal catheter into the peritoneal cavity, thereby flushing the peritoneal catheter of any debris. After instillation of the DSR solution is completed, the needle is withdrawn. Upon completion of the dwell period, as may be determined by expiration of a specified time, analyte concentration, or rate of change of intraabdominal pressure, the implantable pump is actuated so that fluid is withdrawn from the peritoneal cavity via the peritoneal catheter, the tee junction and the inlet catheter to the implantable pump. No fluid is drawn through the instillation line as the self-healing membrane on the subcutaneous port and valve, if present, will seal the instillation line. In this manner, the peritoneal catheter may be used to rapidly deliver DSR fluid into the peritoneal cavity while ensuring that the catheter remains free of blockage.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an alternative embodiment, the improved fluid transfer set for instilling DSR fluid into the patient's peritoneal cavity during initiation of the DSR session may include a Y-shaped connector that may be assembled with the peritoneal catheter during implantation of the implantable device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Other features of the inventive system and methods will be apparent with reference to the following description and figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary system constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention for use in performing DSR therapy.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the electronic components of an exemplary embodiment of the implantable device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are, respectively, a perspective view of the implantable device with the housing shown in outline and a perspective view of the obverse side of the implantable device with the housing and low water permeable filler removed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D</figref> are, respectively, an exploded perspective view of the drive assembly of the implantable device;

No. 10,918,778 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/661,737. As described in that patent and pending application, DSR therapy may be used to treat fluid overload in various forms of heart failure and renal disease. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, enhanced systems and methods are provided for conducting DSR therapy in an implantable pump is employed to instill DSR solution into the patient's peritoneal cavity, monitor ultrafiltrate and sodium accumulation in the peritoneal cavity and remove such accumulations to the patient's bladder. The enhanced implantable pump may include variable programmable pumping speeds, one or more alarms for alerting the patient of potential pump blockages or malfunction, and selectable options for correcting reported alarm conditions. The implantable pump further may include programming for assessing the progress of the DSR therapy session, and for monitoring pressure fluctuations with the peritoneal cavity, which may serve as triggers for actuating the pump to move sodium-laden DSR solution and ultrafiltrate from the peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder. In addition, the enhanced implantable pump system may include catheter sets configured to facilitate infusion and removal of DSR infusate into the patient's peritoneal cavity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described in the above-incorporate patent and application, the no or low sodium concentration in the DSR solution is configured to cause sodium and fluid (osmotic ultrafiltrate) to pass from the patient's body into the peritoneal cavity. As used in this disclosure, a no or low sodium DSR solution has a sodium content of less than 120 meq/L, more preferably, less than 35 meq/L, and includes infusates having virtually zero concentration of sodium. Accordingly, the methods of the present invention specifically contemplate use of the inventive system to monitor the presence of fluid accumulated in the peritoneal cavity, along with sodium, and to trigger actuation of the pump to move the ultrafiltrate and sodium to the patient's bladder for subsequent voiding via urination.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Exemplary DSR solution formulations presented in the incorporated patent and application include one or more solutions including: D-0.5 to D-50 solutions, i.e., from 0.5 to 50 grams of dextrose per 100 ml of aqueous solution; Icodextrin or dextrin solutions having from 0.5 to 50 grams of icodextrin/dextrin per 100 ml of aqueous solution; urea, and high molecular weight glucose polymer solutions (weight average molecular weight Da&#x3e;10,000) having from 0.5 to 50 grams of high molecular weight glucose polymer per 100 ml of aqueous solution, and combinations thereof. The aqueous solution includes at least purified water, and may in addition include electrolytes such as low amounts of magnesium or calcium salts, preservatives, ingredients having antimicrobial or antifungal properties, or buffering materials to control pH of the infusate. Icodextrin, a high molecular weight glucose polymer, or other high molecular weight glucose polymer (weight average molecular weight, Da&#x3e;10,000,) is preferable because it experiences a lower rate of uptake when employed in peritoneal dialysis, and thus lower impact on serum glucose concentrations compared to a dextrose-based solutions.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Overview of an Exemplary System of the Present Invention</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, exemplary system <b>10</b> of the present invention is described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, components of the system are not depicted to scale on either a relative or absolute basis. System <b>10</b> comprises implantable device <b>20</b>, external charging and communication system <b>30</b>, software-based monitoring and control system <b>40</b>, and optionally, smartphone or tablet <b>50</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, monitoring and control system <b>40</b> is configured to be installed and run on a conventional laptop computer, tablet or smartphone, as may be used by the patient's physician. During patient visits, charging and communication system <b>30</b> may be coupled, either wirelessly or using a cable, to monitoring and control system <b>40</b> to download for review data stored on implantable device <b>20</b>, or to adjust the operational parameters of the implantable device. Monitoring and control system <b>40</b> also may be configured to upload and store date retrieved from charging and communication system <b>30</b> to a remote server for later access by the physician or charging and communications system <b>30</b>. Smartphone or tablet <b>50</b> may comprise, for example, the patient's personal smartphone having application software that forms a subset of the capabilities of the software of monitoring and control system <b>40</b>. In particular, smartphone <b>50</b> may include an application configured to communicate with implantable device <b>20</b>, either directly or through external charging and communication system <b>30</b>, to present alarms to the patient and permit the patient to issue a limited number of claims directly to the implantable device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Implantable device <b>20</b> comprises an electromechanical pump having housing <b>21</b> configured for subcutaneous implantation. Implantable device <b>20</b> may include an electrically-driven mechanical gear pump and connectors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> configured to reduce the risk of improper installation and inadvertent disconnection. Bladder catheter <b>25</b> is coupled to pump housing <b>21</b> using connector <b>24</b>. Peritoneal catheter <b>23</b> is coupled to pump housing <b>21</b> using connector <b>22</b>. Peritoneal catheter <b>23</b> has a proximal end configured to be coupled to pump housing <b>21</b> and a distal end configured to be positioned in the peritoneal cavity. Bladder catheter <b>25</b> has a proximal end configured to be coupled to pump housing <b>21</b> and a distal end configured to be inserted through the wall of, and fixed within, a patient's bladder. In a preferred embodiment, both catheters are made of medical-grade silicone and include polyester cuffs at their distal ends (not shown) to maintain the catheters in position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment, implantable device <b>20</b> includes pressure sensors that monitor pressure in one or both of the peritoneal cavity and the bladder. Implantable device <b>20</b> may include at least one analyte sensor for generating an output signal corresponding to concentration of a predetermined analyte, such as sodium, or a concentration of an infusate component, such as dextrose or icodextrin. In this manner, movement of sodium-laden DSR solution and ultrafiltrate fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder may be controlled in accordance with one or more target analyte concentrations determined by the physician. In addition, the output of the pressure sensors may cause pumping of fluid into the bladder to be disabled if the bladder pressure reaches a level indicating insufficient space for the bladder to accommodate additional fluid or if the pressure in the peritoneal cavity falls below preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, implantable device <b>20</b> may include a variable speed gear pump that may be programmed to pump at different speeds at different times during a DSR therapy session. For example, the implantable pump may be programmed to operate at a first speed to rapidly transfer fluid from a patient's peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder following completion of a predetermined dwell time or in response to a detected analyte concentration exceeding a predetermined threshold. The implantable pump further may be programmed thereafter to operate at a substantially lower speed to periodically remove further fluid accumulations from the peritoneal cavity during later intervals of, or after the conclusion of, the DSR therapy session. Further, the implantable pump may be operated at a selected speed specifically in response to a command transmitted by the patient, his or her caretaker or physician at specific times during the DSR therapy session or thereafter. Implantable device <b>20</b> preferably includes multiple separate fail-safe mechanisms, to ensure that urine cannot pass from the bladder to the peritoneal cavity through the pump, thereby reducing the risk of transmitting infection.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the implantable pump system may include an enhanced alarm monitoring and notification capability. In particular, to address the increased pump speed programming complexity, the implantable pump system may include enhanced alarm monitoring, reporting and resolution capability. For example, in one embodiment, the implantable device may include programming for monitoring pump operation and generating an alarm to notify the patient, e.g., via external charging and control system <b>30</b> or directly via an application on smartphone <b>50</b>, that the pump output is below a specified threshold for output for a particular phase of the DSR session. In this case, the patient may be directed to contact his or her physician to request that pump speed be increased for the remainder of the pumping session. Alternatively, if the alarm indicates a blockage in the gear pump, e.g., due to the presence of particulate matter, the alarm transmitted to the patient via smartphone <b>50</b> may prompt the patient to activate, or request the physician to activate, a boost mode or jog mode to overcome and/or grind and remove the obstruction, as described below. Still further, the implantable pump may include software that sends an alarm to smartphone <b>50</b> if the monitored intraabdominal pressure exceeds a preset threshold during instillation of the DSR fluid or during the dwell period. In this case, the patient may request the physician to cease instillation of further DSR fluid into the peritoneal cavity or to transfer fluid accumulated fluid to the peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder to resolve the alarm condition. Alternatively, the physician may enable smartphone <b>50</b> to permit the patient to make such changes in accordance with the physician's oral directions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In yet another aspect of the invention, the implantable pump system may include advanced algorithms for determining completion of a dwell period and when to activate the pump to transfer fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder. For example, the above-incorporated patent and application describe that the dwell period for retaining the DSR solution in the peritoneal cavity may be based on a specified time, e.g., 2 hours, attaining a threshold intraabdominal pressure, or attaining an analyte concentration level in the fluid in peritoneal cavity. In accordance with the present invention, actuation of the implantable pump further may be triggered by monitoring the rate of change of pressure within the peritoneal cavity over a specified time interval. In this manner, the pump will not be inadvertently triggered by transient fluctuations in intraabdominal pressure, e.g., due to patient coughing or transient postural changes. Instead, the implantable pump will begin transferring fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder only after a sustained increase in pressure exceeding a predetermined threshold is detected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, external charging and communication system <b>30</b> of the exemplary system, preferably includes base <b>31</b> and handpiece <b>32</b>. Handpiece <b>32</b> may contain a controller, a radio transceiver, an inductive charging circuit, a battery, a quality-of-charging indicator and a display, and may be removably coupled to base <b>31</b> to recharge the battery. Base <b>31</b> may contain a transformer and circuitry for converting conventional 120V or 220-240V service to a suitable DC current to charge handpiece <b>32</b> when coupled to base <b>31</b>. Alternatively, handpiece <b>32</b> may include such circuitry and a detachable power cord, thus permitting the handpiece to be directly plugged into a wall socket to charge the battery. Preferably, each of implantable device <b>20</b> and handpiece <b>32</b> includes a device identifier stored in memory, such that handpiece <b>32</b> provided to the patient is coded to operate only with that patient's specific implantable device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Handpiece <b>32</b> illustratively includes housing <b>33</b> having multi-function button <b>34</b>, display <b>35</b>, a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs, not shown) and inductive coil portion <b>36</b>. Multi-function button <b>34</b> enables the patient to issue a limited number of commands to implantable device <b>20</b>, while display <b>35</b> provides visible confirmation that a desired command has been input; it also may display battery status of implantable device <b>20</b>. Inductive coil portion <b>36</b> houses an inductive coil that is used transfer energy from handpiece <b>32</b> to recharge the battery of implantable device <b>20</b>. The LEDs, which are visible through the material of housing <b>33</b> when lit, may be arranged in three rows of two LEDs each, and are coupled to the control circuitry and inductive charging circuit contained within handpiece <b>32</b>. The LEDs may be arranged to light up to reflect the degree of inductive coupling achieved between handpiece <b>32</b> and implantable device <b>20</b> during recharging of the latter. Alternatively, the LEDs may be omitted and an analog display provided on display <b>35</b> indicating the quality of inductive coupling.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Control circuitry contained within handpiece <b>32</b> is coupled to the inductive charging circuit, battery, LEDs and radio transceiver, and includes memory for storing information received from implantable device <b>20</b>. Handpiece <b>32</b> also preferably includes a data port, such as a USB port, that permits the handpiece to be coupled to monitoring and control system <b>40</b> during visits by the patient to the physician's office. Alternatively, handpiece <b>32</b> may include a wireless chip, e.g., that conforms to the Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11 wireless standards, thereby enabling the handpiece to communicate wirelessly with monitoring and control system <b>40</b>, either directly or via the Internet.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">External charging and communication system <b>30</b> also may be configured to communicate directly with smartphone <b>50</b>, as well as monitoring and control system <b>40</b>. Thus, implantable device <b>20</b> may be configured to communicate with smartphone <b>50</b> via external charging and control system <b>30</b> when external charging and communication system <b>40</b> is coupled to implantable device <b>20</b>, for example, when charging. Implantable device <b>20</b> also may be configured directly with smartphone <b>50</b>, for example, to communicate alarms to smartphone <b>50</b> and to receive commands to resolve such alarms from smartphone <b>50</b>. Smartphone <b>50</b> also may communicate alarm conditions, and the resolution of such conditions, to external charging and communication system <b>30</b> for storage and later reporting to monitoring and control system <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Monitoring and control system <b>40</b> is intended primarily for use by the physician and comprises software configured to run on a conventional computer, e.g., a laptop as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or a tablet or smartphone. The software enables the physician to configure, monitor and control operation of charging and communication system <b>30</b> and implantable device <b>20</b>. The software may include routines for configuring and controlling pump operation, such as a target analyte concentration at which pumping is actuated, the amount of analyte transferred from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder during a pumping session, pumping speeds for various intervals of the dwell period and post-dwell period, a maximum dwell time for the DSR therapy, and limits on intraabdominal pressure, bladder pressure, pump pressure, and battery temperature. System <b>40</b> also may provide instructions to implantable device <b>20</b> via charging and control system <b>30</b> to control operation of implantable device <b>20</b> so as not to move fluid during specific periods (e.g., at night or when the bladder is full) or to defer pump actuation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">System <b>40</b> also may be configured, for example, to send immediate commands to the implantable device to start or stop the pump, or to operate the pump in reverse or at high power to unblock the pump or associated catheters, a subset of which may be available to the patient using an application installed on smartphone <b>50</b>. The software of system <b>40</b> may be configured to download real-time data relating to pump operation, as well as event logs stored during operation of implantable device <b>20</b>. Based on the downloaded data, e.g., based on measurements made of the patient's analyte concentration, intraabdominal pressure, respiratory rate, and/or fluid accumulation, the software of system <b>40</b> optionally may be configured to analyze such data to alert the physician to the development of potential trends. Such analyses may include generating alerts regarding prediction or detection of heart failure decompensation or a change in the patient's health for which an adjustment to the flow rate, volume, time and/or frequency of pump operation may be required. Finally, system <b>40</b> optionally may be configured to remotely receive raw or filtered operational data from handpiece <b>32</b> over a secure Internet channel.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">The Implantable Device</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a schematic depicting the functional blocks of implantable device <b>20</b> suitable for use in practicing the methods of the present invention is described. Implantable device <b>20</b> includes control circuitry, illustratively processor <b>70</b> coupled to nonvolatile memory <b>71</b>, such as flash memory or electrically erasable programmable read only memory, and volatile memory <b>72</b> via data buses. Processor <b>70</b> is electrically coupled to electric motor <b>73</b>, battery <b>74</b>, inductive circuit <b>75</b>, radio transceiver <b>76</b>, one or more analyte sensors <b>85</b>, and a plurality of other sensors, including humidity sensor <b>77</b>, one or more temperature sensors <b>78</b>, accelerometer <b>79</b>, pressure sensors <b>80</b>, and respiratory rate sensor <b>81</b>. Inductive circuit <b>75</b> is electrically coupled to coil <b>84</b> to receive energy transmitted from charging and communication system <b>30</b>, while transceiver <b>76</b> is coupled to antenna <b>82</b>, and likewise is configured to communicate with a transceiver in charging and communication system <b>30</b> and smartphone <b>50</b>, as described below. Optionally, inductive circuit <b>75</b> also may be coupled to infrared light emitting diode <b>83</b>. Motor <b>73</b> may include a dedicated controller, which interprets and actuates motor <b>73</b> responsive to commands from processor <b>70</b>. All of the components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are contained within a low volume sealed biocompatible housing, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Processor <b>70</b> executes firmware stored in nonvolatile memory <b>71</b> which controls operation of motor <b>73</b> responsive to signals generated by motor <b>73</b>, sensors <b>77</b>-<b>81</b> and <b>85</b>, and commands received from transceiver <b>76</b>. Processor <b>70</b> also controls reception and transmission of messages via transceiver <b>76</b> and operation of inductive circuit <b>75</b> to charge battery <b>74</b>. In addition, processor <b>70</b> receives signals generated by Hall Effect sensors located within motor <b>73</b>, which are used to compute direction and revolutions of the gears of the gear pump, and thus fluid volume transferred and the viscosity of that fluid, as described below. Processor <b>70</b> preferably includes a low-power mode of operation and includes an internal clock, such that the processor can be periodically awakened to handle pumping, pump tick mode, or communications and charging functions, and/or awakened to handle commands received by transceiver <b>76</b> from handpiece <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, processor <b>70</b> comprises a member of the MSP430 family of microcontroller units available from Texas Instruments, Incorporated, Dallas, Tex., and may incorporate the nonvolatile memory, volatile memory, and radio transceiver components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

In a preferred embodiment, processor <b>70</b> generates up to eighty log entries per second prior to activating the pump, about eight log entries per second when the implantable system is actively transferring fluid and about one log entry per hour when not transferring fluid. As discussed above, processor <b>70</b> may be programmed to operate motor <b>73</b> at variable speeds responsive to stored programming or commands received directly via external charging and communication system <b>30</b> or smartphone <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Nonvolatile memory <b>71</b> preferably comprises flash memory or EEPROM, and stores a unique device identifier for implantable device <b>20</b>, firmware to be executed on processor <b>70</b>, configuration set point data relating to operation of the implantable device, and optionally, coding to be executed on transceiver <b>76</b> and/or inductive circuit <b>75</b>, and a separate motor controller, if present.

More preferably, battery <b>74</b> should be sized to permit a minimum current of at least 450 mAh for a period of 10 seconds and 1 A for 25 milliseconds during each charging cycle.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Motor <b>73</b> preferably is a brushless direct current or electronically commuted motor having a splined output shaft that drives a set of floating gears that operate as a gear pump, as described below. Motor <b>73</b> may include a dedicated motor controller, separate from processor <b>70</b>, for controlling operation of the motor, and preferably is capable of operating at different speeds to achieve different fluid transfer rates. Motor <b>73</b> may include a plurality of Hall Effect sensors, preferably two or more, for determining motor position and direction of rotation. Due to the high humidity that may be encountered in implantable device <b>20</b>, processor <b>70</b> may include programming to operate motor <b>73</b>, although with reduced accuracy, even if some or all of the Hall Effect sensors fail.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a preferred embodiment, motor <b>73</b> is capable of driving the gear pump to generate a nominal flow rate of 150 ml/min and applying a torque of about 1 mNm against a pressure head of 30 cm water at 3000 RPM. In this embodiment, the motor preferably is selected to drive the gears at from 1000 to 5000 RPM, corresponding to flow rates of from 50 to 260 ml/min, respectively. The motor preferably has a stall torque of at least 3 mNm at 500 mA at 3 V, and more preferably 6 mNm in order to crush non-solid proteinaceous materials. As discussed above, the motor preferably also supports a boost mode of operation, e.g., at 5 V, when powered directly through inductive circuit <b>75</b>. Motor <b>73</b> preferably also is capable of being driven in reverse as part of a jogging or shaking procedure to unblock the gear pump.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Processor <b>70</b> also may be programmed to automatically and periodically wake up and enter a pump tick mode. In this mode of operation, the gear pump is advanced slightly, e.g., about 120 degrees as measured by the Hall Effect sensors, before processor <b>70</b> returns to low power mode. Preferably, this interval is about every 20 minutes, although it may be adjusted by the physician using the monitoring and control system. Tick mode is expected to prevent the DSR solution and ultrafiltrate from partially solidifying and blocking the gear pump.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Processor <b>70</b> also may be programmed to enter a jog or shake mode when operating on battery power alone, to unblock the gear pump, upon receipt of a command from smartphone <b>50</b> or charging and communication system <b>30</b>. Similar to the boost mode available when charging the implantable device with the handpiece of charging and communication system <b>30</b>, the jog or shake mode causes the motor to rapidly alternate the gears between forward and reverse directions to crush or loosen any buildup of tissue or other debris in the gear pump or elsewhere in the fluid path. Specifically, in this mode of operation, if the motor does not start to turn within a certain time period after it is energized (e.g., 1 second), the direction of the motion is reversed for a short period of time and then reversed again to let the motor turn in the desired direction. If the motor does still not turn (e.g., because the gear pump is jammed) the direction is again reversed for a period of time (e.g., another 10 msec). If the motor still is unable to advance, the time interval between reversals of the motor direction is reduced to allow the motor to develop more power, resulting in a shaking motion of the gears. If the motor does not turn forward for more than 4 seconds, the jog mode of operation ceases, and an alarm is generated and also written to the event log. If the motor was unable to turn forward, processor <b>70</b> may introduce a backwards tick before the next scheduled fluid movement. A backward tick is the same as a tick (e.g., about 120 degrees forward movement of the motor shaft) but in a reverse direction, and is intended to force the motor backwards before turning forward, thus allowing the motor to gain momentum.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Sensors <b>77</b>-<b>81</b> continually monitor humidity, temperature, acceleration, pressure, and respiratory rate, and provide corresponding signals to processor <b>70</b> which stores the corresponding data in memory <b>71</b> for later transmission to monitoring and control system <b>40</b>. In particular, humidity sensor <b>77</b> is arranged to measure humidity within the housing of the implantable device, to ensure that the components of implantable device are operated within expected operational limits. Humidity sensor <b>77</b> preferably is capable of sensing and reporting humidity within a range or 20% to 100% with high accuracy. One or more of temperature sensors <b>78</b> may be disposed within the housing and monitor the temperature of the implantable device, and in particular battery <b>74</b> to ensure that the battery does not overheat during charging, while another one or more of temperature sensors <b>78</b> may be disposed so as to contact fluid entering at inlet <b>62</b> and thus monitor the temperature of the fluid, e.g., for use in assessing the patient's health. Accelerometer <b>79</b> is arranged to measure acceleration of the implant, preferably along at least two axes, to detect periods of activity and inactivity, e.g., to determine whether the patient is sleeping or to determine whether and when the patient is active. This information is provided to processor <b>70</b> to ensure that the pump is not operated when the patient is indisposed to attend to voiding of the bladder.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Implantable device <b>20</b> preferably includes multiple pressure sensors <b>80</b>, which are continually monitored during waking periods of the processor. As described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the implantable device preferably includes four pressure sensors: a sensor to measure the pressure in the peritoneal cavity, a sensor to measure the ambient pressure, a sensor to measure the pressure at the outlet of the gear pump, and a sensor to measure the pressure in the bladder. These sensors preferably are configured to measure absolute pressure between 450 mBar and 1300 mBar while consuming less than 50 mW at 3V. Preferably, the sensors that measure pressure at the pump outlet and in the bladder are placed across a duckbill valve, which prevents reverse flow of urine and/or used DSR solution and ultrafiltrate back into the gear pump and also permits computation of flow rate based on the pressure drop across the duckbill valve.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Respiratory rate monitor <b>81</b> is configured to measure the patient's respiratory rate, e.g., for use in assessing the patient's health. Alternatively, the patient's respiratory rate may be measured based on the outputs of one or more of pressure sensors <b>80</b>, e.g., based on changes in the ambient pressure or the pressure in the peritoneal cavity caused by the diaphragm periodically compressing that cavity during breathing.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, analyte sensor <b>85</b> may be a chemical or biochemical sensor configured to monitor a sodium concentration of sodium-laden DSR solution and ultrafiltrate instilled into and accumulated within the patient's peritoneal cavity. Analyte sensor <b>85</b> may in addition sense a concentration of a component, such as dextrose or icodextrin concentration, in the DSR solution present in the peritoneal cavity, and that information may be used by the processor of implantable device <b>20</b> to trigger starting or stopping of the pump. One exemplary in vivo sensor suitable for monitoring sodium ion concentration is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/033260, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Analyte sensor <b>85</b> may be disposed on catheter <b>23</b>, on catheter <b>25</b>, or may be disposed within the housing of implantable device <b>20</b> so as to contact fluid flowing through the device. Any desired number of additional sensors for measuring the health of the patient also may be provided in operable communication with processor <b>70</b> and may output recordable parameters for storage in memory <b>71</b> and transmission to monitoring and control system <b>40</b>, that the physician may use to assess the patient's health.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an exemplary embodiment, processor <b>70</b> may be programmed to monitor an output of analyte sensor <b>85</b>, for example, indicative of a value of sodium concentration, and to compare that value to a target sodium concentration value selected by the physician at which implantable device <b>20</b> is activated to transfer fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder. Alternatively, or in addition, analyte sensor <b>85</b> could measure a concentration of an infusate component remaining in the peritoneal cavity. Processor <b>70</b> also may be programmed to activate implantable device <b>20</b> to move fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder after that fluid has dwelled in the peritoneal cavity a sufficient period that the measured analyte concentration exceeds or falls below a target value. In addition, fluid transfer may be initiated after infusate has dwelled in the peritoneal cavity for a predetermined maximal amount of time, which may be set by a physician. For this purpose, processor <b>70</b> may include a programmed timer that monitors the dwell time, e.g., elapsed time from when the DSR solution is first introduced into the patient's peritoneal cavity. As a further alternative, processor <b>70</b> may be programmed to compute an estimate of the amount of analyte transferred from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder as function of the measured concentration and the volume of fluid transferred, and to report that amount to the patient, physician or caretaker. Such information may, in turn, be used to determine when the next DSR therapy session should occur or be used in adjusting the volume of DSR solution to be employed during a subsequent DSR therapy session.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The volume of fluid transferred, and pump activation time and frequency may be selected to optimize sodium removal to maintain or improve the patient's health, to alleviate the fluid overload and to ensure a stable serum sodium level. These parameters may be selected based on the patient's symptoms, the activity and habits of the patient, the permeability of the peritoneal membrane and the osmotic characteristics of the DSR solution, and they may be static or changed by the physician on a session-by-session basis. For example, the physician may initially program processor <b>70</b> with a first sodium concentration level, amount of sodium to be removed, maximum dwell time, volume, or frequency based on his perception of the patient's health and habits, and later adjust that initial programming to vary those parameters based on his perception of changes in the patient's health, for example based on changes over time in parameters measured by implantable device <b>20</b> and relayed to the physician via monitoring and control software <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Processor <b>70</b> also may be programmed to monitor the sensors <b>77</b>-<b>81</b> and to generate an alarm condition that is relayed to the patient and/or the clinician indicative of a potential decline in the patient's health. For example, processor <b>70</b> may monitor pressure sensors <b>80</b> to determine whether, over predetermined time intervals, there is an increase in pressure within the peritoneal cavity. Such pressure increases may be the result of an increase in the rate of accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, which may in turn indicate heart failure decompensation. Such alarm condition may inform the patient to seek immediate treatment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Processor <b>70</b> further may be programmed to pump fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder only when the pressure in the peritoneal cavity exceeds a first predetermined value, and the pressure in the bladder is less than a second predetermined value, so that the bladder does not become overfull. To account for patient travel from a location at sea level to a higher altitude, the ambient pressure measurement may be used to calculate a differential value for the peritoneal pressure. In this way, the predetermined pressure at which the pump begins operation may be reduced, to account for lower atmospheric pressure. Likewise, the ambient pressure may be used to adjust the predetermined value for bladder pressure. In this way, the threshold pressure at which the pumping ceases may be reduced, because the patient may experience discomfort at a lower bladder pressure when at a high altitude location.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As yet another alternative, processor <b>70</b> may be programmed to monitor intraabdominal pressure over a specified interval, e.g., one to three minutes or more, and to activate the implantable pump only when the pressure exceeds a specified threshold value for the specified interval. In particular, because the abdominal cavity is compliant, it may be desirable to monitor and trigger pump actuation based on the time-dependent evolution of pressure within the peritoneal cavity. In this manner, the implantable pump could differentiate between short-duration pressure fluctuations, e.g., caused by the patient coughing or bending over, from pressure increases resulting from filling of the peritoneal cavity due to ultrafiltrate accumulation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, processor <b>70</b> may be programmed to permit transfer of fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder to be interrupted, for example if the bladder pressure indicates that the bladder is full, and to resume transferring fluid once the bladder pressure sensor detects that the bladder has been voided. In this case, because the sodium concentration level may fall due to fluid transfer immediately before the bladder was detected to be full, the processor may be programmed to resume fluid transfer once the sodium concentration level has reached the target level during a single DSR therapy session.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Optionally, implantable device <b>20</b> may include a UV lamp (not shown) disposed in operable communication with controller <b>70</b>. The UV lamp may be configured to irradiate and thus kill pathogens in the DSR solution before is instilled into and/or after fluid is extracted from the peritoneal cavity. The UV lamp preferably generates light in the UV-C spectral range (about 200-280 nm), particularly in the range of about 250-265 nm, which is also referred to as the &#x201c;germicidal spectrum&#x201d; because light in that spectral range breaks down nucleic acids in the DNA of microorganisms. Low-pressure mercury lamps have an emission peak at approximately 253.7 nm, and may suitably be used for UV lamp <b>85</b>. Alternatively, the UV lamp may be a UV light emitting diode (LED), which may be based on AlGaAs or GaN.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, further details of an exemplary embodiment of implantable device <b>20</b> are provided.

Sterile DSR solution disposed in bag <b>220</b>, is coupled via tubing <b>221</b> to non-coring needle <b>222</b>, which may be inserted through patient's skin S and self-healing membrane <b>211</b> to place the contents of bag <b>220</b> in fluid communication with the interior of subcutaneous port <b>210</b>. In this manner, DSR solution from bag <b>220</b>, typically 0.5 up to 2 liters, will flow through tubing <b>221</b> and needle <b>222</b> into subcutaneous port <b>210</b>, and then into the peritoneal cavity via instillation line <b>213</b>, tee junction <b>212</b> and peritoneal catheter <b>23</b>. The DSR solution thus instilled with initiate the DSR therapy session while simultaneously flushing peritoneal catheter <b>23</b> of debris that could potentially block the catheter when the DSR and ultrafiltrate subsequently is withdrawn.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">After instillation of the DSR solution from bag <b>220</b> is completed, needle <b>221</b> is withdrawn. Later, upon completion of the dwell period, for example, as may be determined by expiration of a specified time interval, detected analyte concentration, or rate of change of intraabdominal pressure, implantable device <b>20</b> is actuated to suck fluid from the peritoneal cavity via the peritoneal catheter, tee junction <b>212</b> and tubing <b>214</b> to implantable device <b>20</b>. No fluid is drawn through instillation line <b>213</b> as the valve in tee-connector <b>212</b> isolates the instillation line from pump suction. Fluid drawn into peritoneal catheter <b>23</b> is pumped by implantable device <b>20</b> through bladder catheter <b>25</b> and into the patient's bladder.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Alternatively, tee connector <b>212</b> may be employed without a valve. In this case, some DSR solution may be lost as directly flowing into the bladder through implantable device <b>20</b>, and not into the peritoneum. However, it is expected that the gears of the implantable device <b>20</b> will impede fluid loss through the pump, and accordingly the loss would be small. Moreover, the expected DSR loss through the pump during instillation could be empirically determined, and thus taken into consideration for dosing of the DSR solution for a given DSR therapy session. For example, if was empirically known that 100 ml is lost during infusion of 1000 ml into the abdomen, an 1100 ml total dose may be proscribed for infusion. On the other hand, during operation of implantable device <b>20</b> to move fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder, suction induced by the pump would not pose a problem for instillation line <b>213</b> or subcutaneous port <b>210</b> because the subcutaneous port will remain closed via operation of self-healing membrane <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, an alternative arrangement for instilling DSR fluid into a patient's peritoneum is described. As for the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, device <b>20</b> is implanted subcutaneously, preferably outside of the patient's peritoneal cavity as defined by peritoneal membrane P. Implantable device <b>20</b> is placed beneath skin S so that the device may readily be charged by, and communicate with, charging and communication system <b>30</b>. Subcutaneous port <b>230</b> includes a self-healing membrane <b>231</b> and is implanted in the patient's upper abdomen, and is coupled to peritoneal catheter <b>23</b> by Y-connector <b>232</b> and instillation line <b>233</b>. Y-connector <b>232</b> is coupled to the inlet port of implantable device <b>20</b> by tubing <b>234</b>. The outlet port of implantable device <b>20</b> is coupled to bladder catheter <b>25</b>, thereby enabling implantable device <b>20</b> to transfer fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder at the completion of the DSR therapy session.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Y-connector <b>212</b> is configured to permit fluid to flow from subcutaneous port <b>230</b>, through instillation line <b>231</b> and into peritoneal cavity P via peritoneal catheter <b>23</b>, but reduces the amount of instilled DSR solution that can pass to the inlet port of implantable device <b>20</b>. As for the preceding arrangement, sterile DSR solution disposed in bag <b>220</b>, is coupled via tubing <b>221</b> to non-coring needle <b>222</b>, which may be inserted through patient's skin S and self-healing membrane <b>231</b> to place the contents of bag <b>220</b> in fluid communication with the interior of subcutaneous port <b>230</b>. Accordingly, DSR solution from bag <b>220</b>, typically 0.5 up to 2 liters, will flow through tubing <b>221</b> and needle <b>222</b> into subcutaneous port <b>230</b>, and then into the peritoneal cavity via instillation line <b>233</b>, Y-connector <b>232</b> and peritoneal catheter <b>23</b>. DSR solution instilled in this matter at the start of the DSR therapy session simultaneously will flush peritoneal catheter <b>23</b> of debris that could potentially block the catheter when the DSR and ultrafiltrate subsequently is withdrawn.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">After instillation of the DSR solution from bag <b>220</b> is completed, needle <b>221</b> is withdrawn. Later, upon completion of the dwell period, as described above, implantable device <b>20</b> is actuated to suck fluid from the peritoneal cavity via peritoneal catheter <b>23</b>, Y-connector <b>232</b> and tubing <b>234</b> to implantable device <b>20</b>. The configuration of Y-connector <b>232</b> preferably is designed so that during delivery of DSR solution through instillation line <b>233</b>, hydraulic forces induced by the flow through the Y-connector will reduce lost flow to the bladder through implantable device <b>20</b>. In particular, when pressure is applied to instillation line <b>233</b> coupled to the Y-connector, based on fluid dynamics principles, the vast majority of flow and pressure will exit the lower end of Y-connector <b>232</b> towards peritoneal catheter <b>23</b>, which is thus flushed. Relatively little is expected to reach &#x201c;backwards&#x201d; into the other upper end of the Y-connector and thus slip-flow through the pump is reduced. Moreover, as for the embodiment of the tee connector without a valve, it is expected that the gears of the implantable device <b>20</b> will impede fluid loss through the pump, thus further reducing loss of DSR loss through the pump during instillation. In addition, such lost amounts could be empirically determined, such that a slightly larger dose of DSR solution may be proscribed for infusion. Fluid drawn into peritoneal catheter <b>23</b> is pumped by implantable device <b>20</b> through bladder catheter <b>25</b> and into the patient's bladder.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, another aspect of the Y-connector is described. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, the Y-connector may be supplied as a separate component of the catheter arrangement, which is assembled by the implanting surgeon or physician when implantable device <b>20</b> is first implanted in the patient. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, each end of Y-connector <b>232</b> should have circumference protuberances <b>236</b>, <b>237</b> and <b>238</b> which serve to retain line <b>233</b>, tubing <b>234</b> and catheter <b>23</b> installed onto the respective ends of the Y-connector. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>, the physician or surgeon also may apply suture <b>239</b> through line <b>233</b>, tubing <b>234</b> and catheter <b>23</b> during the implantation procedure to tightly close and bind those components to Y-connector <b>232</b>, thus ensuring that the components are not pulled free from the Y-connector during normal expected use. Alternatively, a plastic zip tie or similar device may be used in lieu of sutures to join the various tubing components to the Y-connector. As a still further alternative, the connector may include snap rings or other suitable structure to fasten the tubes to the Y-connector to secure the tubing from separating.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, the implantable device could be programmed to include a flush feature, which could be implemented by a command issued from smartphone <b>50</b>, charging and communication system <b>30</b> or monitoring and control system <b>40</b> to avoid exposing implantable device <b>20</b> to excessive high pressures during instillation for the DSR solution and flushing of peritoneal catheter <b>23</b>. In particular, issuing the command to implantable device <b>20</b> could activate the built-in pressure sensors monitor the applied pressure and report to a connected charging and control system <b>30</b> or smartphone <b>50</b>. If detected pressure is zero or low, a signal indicating acceptable status could be sent to the connected device. However, once a threshold pressure is attained that would be dangerous to the pump mechanics, or the patient, a warning signal could be provided to the connected device. If pressure continued to rise further, an alarm condition could be generated, indicating to the patient that the flushing pressure needs to be immediately reduced.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, methods of using the implantable system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to conduct a DSR therapy session are described. Method <b>250</b> includes introducing no or low sodium DSR solution into the peritoneal cavity, for example, using an arrangement as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b> or <b>12</b></figref>. A sufficient amount of DSR solution, generally 0.5 up to about 2 liters, is introduced into the peritoneal cavity of the patient and allowed to a desired threshold is attained, such as expiration of a specified dwell time, detection of a target analyte concentration, or intraabdominal pressure. As described in the above-incorporated patent and application, the goal of the DSR therapy session is to draw excess fluid and/or sodium from the patient's body tissues into the peritoneal cavity, from which it is removed to the bladder via implantable device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In step <b>254</b>, a number of physiologic parameters may be monitored as indicative of the status of the DSR therapy session, including the analyte concentration in the patient's peritoneal cavity, the intraabdominal pressure and bladder pressure. At step <b>256</b>, the rate of change with time of the measured analyte concentration in the DSR solution and fluid accumulated in the peritoneal cavity may be compared to a target value. For example, if the rate of change of the sodium concentration within the fluid in the peritoneal cavity is initially high but begins to decrease over time, that observed value may indicate further extending the dwell time will not result in significant additional fluid or sodium migration to the peritoneum, and thus the current session should be ended. That determination then may be used to initiate pumping of fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The target value may be downloaded to implantable device by the physician using software monitoring and control system <b>40</b> via external charging and communication system <b>30</b> prior to initiating the DSR therapy session. Alternatively, the target value may be static, i.e., programmed one time, or may be revised prior to each DSR therapy session based on prior results for that patient and titrated to provide a targeted blood sodium serum level by completion of the DSR therapy session. Alternatively, the target value may consist of another value of interest for a particular patient, such as a target quantity of sodium to be removed during the DSR therapy session, or a target value of an infusate concentration at which pumping is to begin and/or cease.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">If at step <b>256</b> the monitored value is less than the target value (&#x201c;No&#x201d; branch at step <b>256</b>), the processor of implantable device <b>20</b> then may evaluate at step <b>258</b> whether the current dwell time for the DSR solution exceeds the maximum dwell time for that DSR therapy session. The maximum dwell time may be a static value that is programmed once, or a value that is set prior to each DSR therapy session as may be determined by the physician. If the current dwell time is less than the maximum value (&#x201c;No&#x201d; branch at step <b>258</b>), the processor may internally set another time interval, e.g., 5 or 10 minutes, after which it will continue to monitor the specified parameter at step <b>254</b> and evaluate whether the target has been attained at step <b>256</b>. If however, the maximum dwell time has been exceeded at step <b>258</b>, then the processor will activate the pump of implantable device <b>20</b> to begin transferring sodium-rich DSR solution and ultrafiltrate from the peritoneal cavity to the patient's bladder, at step <b>260</b> (&#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch at step <b>258</b>). Referring back to the decision box at step <b>256</b>, if the monitored value equals or exceeds the target value (the &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch at step <b>256</b>), the processor also will activate the pump of implantable device <b>20</b> at step <b>260</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Once the pump of implantable device <b>20</b> is activated, it will transfer fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder via bladder catheter <b>25</b>. To ensure that the pump motor does not overheat from continuous operation, the pump may run for a predetermined specified interval, e.g., 5 or 10 minutes, then rest for a brief interval, e.g., 2-5 minutes, and then resume operation. Alternatively, the pump may run at different speeds for different intervals of the pumping period. If the pump is actuated periodically in this manner to complete removal of the DSR solution and accumulated ultrafiltrate from the peritoneal cavity, for example, as determined by the pressure in the peritoneal cavity falling below a target value, the processor may no longer require that the detected physiologic parameter(s) exceed the target level for that particular DSR therapy session. Accordingly, once the threshold is satisfied or the dwell time exceeded for a particular DSR therapy session, the pump will be actuated intermittently until drainage of the peritoneal cavity is determined to be complete.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Apart from intermittent operation to permit brief periods for the pump to rest, or operation at different flow rates, as described above, the processor also monitors the patient's bladder pressure to ensure that transfer of fluid to the bladder is interrupted when the bladder is deemed to be full. Fullness may be determined by the physician receiving oral feedback of discomfort from the patient during initial set-up and programming of implantable device <b>20</b>. Accordingly, at step <b>262</b>, bladder pressure is monitored, particularly at times when fluid is being transferred to the bladder. If the bladder pressure is lower than the level associated with bladder fullness, as initially programmed (&#x201c;No&#x201d; branch at step <b>262</b>), the processor next evaluates whether the pressure in the peritoneal cavity is greater than a predetermined target pressure at step <b>264</b>. The target pressure at step <b>264</b> is a pressure determined to correspond to fluid accumulation in the patient's peritoneal cavity, which value may set during initial implantation and then periodically updated by the physician using monitoring and control system <b>40</b> during the course of multiple DSR therapy sessions. If at step <b>264</b> that peritoneal pressure indicates that peritoneal cavity still contains fluid to be transferred to the bladder, the pump of implantable device <b>20</b> may remain active, change speeds, or if at rest, resume operation to transfer fluid to the bladder (&#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch at step <b>264</b>). If the peritoneal cavity pressure is determined at step <b>264</b> to be less than target pressure (&#x201c;No&#x201d; branch at step <b>264</b>), the processor will deactivate the pump and store a record reflecting completion of that DSR therapy session in the non-volatile memory for eventual transmission to event log <b>182</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring again to step <b>262</b>, if the processor of implantable device <b>20</b> detects that the pressure of fluid in the patient's bladder exceeds the target value (&#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch at step <b>262</b>), the processor will cease pumping and movement of fluid to the patient's bladder. The processor then will set a timer, at step <b>266</b>, during which implantable device <b>20</b> waits until the patient voids his bladder. Once the patient voids his bladder and the bladder pressure drops below the target level, the processor again activates the pump to transfer remaining fluid in the peritoneal cavity to the bladder.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As described above, actuation of the pump transfers sodium-laden DSR solution and ultrafiltrate from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder, thereby reducing the level of sodium in the body and causing elimination of excess fluid by i) enhancing normal kidney function through urination and ii) removal to the bladder of osmotic ultrafiltrate that accumulates in the peritoneal cavity. It is expected that by configuring to activate the pump responsive to a monitored parameter of the fluid in the peritoneal cavity, better control of serum sodium concentration may be maintained than could be achieved by basing the action of the DSR solution on dwell time alone.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Energy may be wirelessly transferred to the implantable device, and data received from the device, using charging and communication system <b>30</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the implantable device may record parameters reflective of the health of the patient and the operation of the device, which parameters may be communicated to the charging and communication system or patient's smartphone. The data, e.g., parameters recorded by the implantable device, also may be provided to monitoring and control software <b>40</b>, via the charging and communication system. Based on those parameters, the health of the patient may be assessed using the software, and the physician may remotely communicate any modifications to the target analyte concentration, target pressures, flow rates, volume, dwell time, or frequency with which the implantable device is activated to transfer DSR solution and ultrafiltrate containing the extracted sodium to the bladder. Such communication may be performed via the charging and communication system.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">While various illustrative embodiments of the invention are described above, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention. For example, the implantable device may be ordered differently and may include additional or fewer components of various sizes and composition.
