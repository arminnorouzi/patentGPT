Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrode composition, an electrode sheet for an all-solid state secondary battery, and an all-solid state secondary battery, and manufacturing methods for an electrode sheet for an all-solid state secondary battery and an all-solid state secondary battery</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an all-solid state secondary battery, all of a negative electrode, an electrolyte, and a positive electrode consist of solid, and the all-solid state secondary battery can greatly improve safety and reliability, which are said to be problems to be solved in a battery in which an organic electrolytic solution is used. It is also said to be capable of extending the battery life. Furthermore, all-solid state secondary batteries can be provided with a structure in which the electrodes and the electrolyte are directly disposed in series. As a result, it becomes possible to increase the energy density to be high as compared with a secondary battery in which an organic electrolytic solution is used, and thus the application to electric vehicles, large-sized storage batteries, and the like is anticipated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The constitutional layers (a solid electrolyte layer, a negative electrode active material layer, a positive electrode active material layer, and the like) of such an all-solid state secondary battery are formed of solid particles (an inorganic solid electrolyte, an active material, a conductive auxiliary agent, and the like). As a result, the interfacial contact state between the solid particles is restricted, and the interface resistance tends to increase (the ion conductivity decreases). Moreover, in a case where repeatedly charged and discharged, voids are generated between the solid particles, which causes an increase in interface resistance and causes a deterioration in the cycle characteristics of an all-solid state secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In response to such an increase in interface resistance, it is expected to use a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte that exhibits high ion conductivity, which is comparable to that of an organic electrolytic solution, among inorganic solid electrolytes. In addition, it has also been reported that an active material having a large specific surface area can suppress an increase in interface resistance and, consequently, can improve the cycle characteristics of an all-solid state secondary battery. As a material (an active material layer forming material) that forms a constitutional layer of an all-solid state secondary battery, using such a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte and an active material having a large specific surface area, for example, JP2019-186212A describes a mixed powder (Comparative Example 1) containing 45.7% by mass of Si spherical particle powder having a specific surface area of 20 m<sup>2</sup>/g as a negative electrode active material, 45.7% by mass of a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte, and 5% by mass of acetylene black as a conductive auxiliary agent.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, as a result of studies by the inventors of the present invention, it was found that a new problem arises in a case where the specific surface area of an active material is increased in an active material layer forming material containing a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte and an active material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">That is, in a case where the specific surface area of an active material that is difficult to be dispersed in a dispersion medium is increased, the dispersibility of the active material immediately after preparation is further decreased, and in addition, the characteristic (the dispersion stability) of stably maintaining the dispersibility immediately after preparation also deteriorate significantly. Further, as the surface area of the active material is increased, the interfacial contact state with not only other solid particles but also the collector is remarkably restricted, and thus the adhesion to these is also reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, although the active material itself having a large specific surface area is promising as a material capable of suppressing an increase in interface resistance, no study was carried out in JP2019-186212A from the above viewpoint. As a result, it was found that it is important to solve the above problems in order to realize an all-solid state secondary battery that exhibits excellent battery performance by fully utilizing the characteristics of an active material having a large specific surface area.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide an electrode composition that exhibits excellent dispersion stability while containing an active material having a large specific surface area, where the electrode composition is capable of forming an electrode layer (an active material layer) that realizes excellent cycle characteristics as well while exhibiting strong adhesion to a collector. In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide an electrode sheet for an all-solid state secondary battery and an all-solid state secondary battery, and manufacturing methods for an electrode sheet for an all-solid state secondary battery and an all-solid state secondary battery, in which the above electrode composition is used.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result of continuing studies on the electrode composition, the inventors of the present invention found that in the presence of a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte, in a case of using a binder consisting of a polymer having a constitutional component derived from a (meth)acrylic monomer or the like having an SP value of 19.0 MPa<sup>1/2 </sup>or more, in combination with an active material having a specific surface area of 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more, it is possible to suppress temporal reaggregation or sedimentation, and it is possible to maintain excellent dispersibility immediately after preparation even in a case of an active material having a large specific surface area of 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more. In addition, it was also found that in a case of using this electrode composition as an active material layer forming material, it is possible to realize an all-solid state secondary battery in which a strong adhesion to a collector is exhibited and the decrease in discharge capacity due to charging and discharging is effectively suppressed (which exhibits excellent cycle characteristics). The present invention has been completed through further studies based on these findings.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">That is, the above problems have been solved by the following means.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">&#x3c;1&#x3e; An electrode composition for an all-solid state secondary battery, comprising:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte having an ion conductivity of a metal belonging to Group 1 or Group 2 in the periodic table;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a polymer binder;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">an active material; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a dispersion medium,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">in which the active material has a specific surface area of 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more, and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a polymer that forms the polymer binder has a constitutional component derived from a (meth)acrylic monomer or vinyl monomer, which has an SP value of 19.0 MPa<sup>1/2 </sup>or more.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">&#x3c;2&#x3e; The electrode composition according to &#x3c;1&#x3e;, in which the polymer binder is dissolved in the dispersion medium.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">&#x3c;3&#x3e; The electrode composition according to &#x3c;1&#x3e; or &#x3c;2&#x3e;, in which the active material has a silicon element as a constitutional element.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">&#x3c;4&#x3e; The electrode composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;3&#x3e;, in which the constitutional component has a polar group containing active hydrogen, or a heterocyclic group.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">&#x3c;5&#x3e; The electrode composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;4&#x3e; in which the constitutional component has a structure represented by Formula (M1) or Formula (M2),</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="51.39mm" wi="56.22mm" file="US20230006245A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">in Formula (M1) and Formula (M2), R, R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, and R<sup>3 </sup>represent a hydrogen atom or a substituent,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">L represents a linking group, L<sup>1</sup>, L<sup>2</sup>, and L<sup>3 </sup>represent a single bond or a linking group,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">X represents &#x2014;O&#x2014;, &#x2014;S&#x2014;, or &#x2014;NR<sup>M</sup>&#x2014;, where R<sup>M </sup>represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent, and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">Z represents &#x2014;OH or &#x2014;COOH.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">&#x3c;6&#x3e; The electrode composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;5&#x3e; in which a polymer that forms the polymer binder is a (meth)acrylic polymer or a vinyl polymer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">&#x3c;7&#x3e; The electrode composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;6&#x3e;, further comprising a conductive auxiliary agent.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">&#x3c;8&#x3e; An electrode sheet for an all-solid state secondary battery, comprising a layer formed of the electrode composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;7&#x3e;, on a surface of a collector.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">&#x3c;9&#x3e; An all-solid state secondary battery comprising, in the following order, a positive electrode active material layer; a solid electrolyte layer; and a negative electrode active material layer,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">in which at least one layer of the positive electrode active material layer or the negative electrode active material layer is formed of the electrode composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;7&#x3e;.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">&#x3c;10&#x3e; A manufacturing method for an electrode sheet for an all-solid state secondary battery, comprising forming a film of the electrode composition according to any one of &#x3c;1&#x3e; to &#x3c;7&#x3e;, on a surface of a collector.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">&#x3c;11&#x3e; A manufacturing method for an all-solid state secondary battery, comprising manufacturing an all-solid state secondary battery through the manufacturing method according to &#x3c;10&#x3e;.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">According to the present invention, it is possible to provide an electrode composition that can form an electrode layer that exhibits excellent dispersion stability while containing an active material having a large specific surface area and is capable of realizing excellent cycle characteristics while exhibiting strong adhesion to a collector.

Accordingly, even in a case where a YYY group is simply described in the present invention, this YYY group includes not only an aspect having a substituent but also an aspect not having a substituent.

In addition, unless specified otherwise, in a case where a plurality of substituents or the like are adjacent to each other, the substituents may be linked or fused to each other to form a ring.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In the present invention, the polymer means a polymer; however, it is synonymous with a so-called polymeric compound. Further, a polymer binder means a binder constituted of a polymer and includes a polymer itself and a binder formed by containing a polymer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In the present invention, a composition containing an active material and used as a material (an active material layer forming material) that forms an active material layer of an all-solid state secondary battery is referred to as an electrode composition. On the other hand, a composition containing a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte and used as a solid electrolyte layer forming material of an all-solid state secondary battery is referred to as a (sulfide-based) inorganic solid electrolyte-containing composition, where this composition generally does not contain an active material.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In the present invention, the electrode composition includes a positive electrode composition containing a positive electrode active material and a negative electrode composition containing a negative electrode active material. For this reason, any one of the positive electrode composition and the negative electrode composition or both of them may be collectively referred to simply as an electrode composition. In addition, in the present invention, any one of the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer, or collectively both of them may be simply referred to as an active material layer or an electrode active material layer, and any one of the positive electrode active material and the negative electrode active material, or collectively both of them may be simply referred to as an active material or an electrode active material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">[Electrode Composition]</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">An electrode composition according to the embodiment of the present invention contains a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte having an ion conductivity of a metal belonging to Group 1 or Group 2 in the periodic table, a polymer binder, an active material, and a dispersion medium.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In this electrode composition, the polymer binder is preferably adsorbed to the active material in terms of initial dispersibility and dispersion stability (collectively referred to as dispersion characteristics) immediately after the preparation of the electrode composition (particularly the active material); however, it may be or may not be adsorbed to the sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte. The electrode composition according to the embodiment of the present invention is preferably a slurry in which an active material as well as a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte is dispersed in a dispersion medium. In this case, the polymer binder preferably has a function of dispersing solid particles in the dispersion medium.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The polymer binder functions in the active material layer as a binder that binds solid particles such as an active material, a sulfide-based inorganic solid electrolyte, and a co-existable conductive auxiliary agent. Further, it also functions as a binder that binds a collector to solid particles. In the electrode composition, the polymer binder may have or may not have a function of causing solid particles to mutually bind therebetween.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The electrode composition according to the embodiment of the present invention is excellent in dispersion stability while containing an active material having a large specific surface area. In a case of using this electrode composition as an active material layer forming material, it is possible to realize an electrode sheet for an all-solid state secondary battery, having, on a surface of the collector, an active material layer capable of realizing excellent cycle characteristics as well while exhibiting strong binding force (adhesion) to a collector, as well as an all-solid state secondary battery having excellent cycle characteristics.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Although the details of the reason for the above are not yet clear, they are conceived to be as follows. That is, in an active material layer containing an active material having a large specific surface area of 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more, a large number of conduction paths of lithium ions by the active material are constructed. Therefore, even in a case where some conduction paths are blocked (collapsed) by repeated charging and discharging, most of the remaining conduction paths are connected.

Next, a film of the solid electrolyte composition for forming a solid electrolyte layer is formed on the positive electrode active material layer to form the solid electrolyte layer. Furthermore, a film of the electrode composition containing a negative electrode active material as a negative electrode material (a negative electrode composition) is formed on the solid electrolyte layer to form a negative electrode active material layer. A negative electrode collector (a metal foil) is overlaid on the negative electrode active material layer, whereby it is possible to obtain an all-solid state secondary battery having a structure in which the solid electrolyte layer is sandwiched between the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer.

Specifically, immediately after allowing the standing, the liquid down to 1 cm below the slurry liquid surface was taken out and dried by heating in an aluminum cup at 120&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. Then, the mass of the solid content in the cup was measured to determine the solid content before and after allowing standing.
