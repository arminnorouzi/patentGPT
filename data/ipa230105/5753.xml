Although not shown in the drawing, a lower structure, such as a substrate or a peripheral circuit, may be formed below the etching target layer <b>100</b>. The etching target layer <b>100</b> may be an interlayer insulating layer. For example, the etching target layer <b>100</b> may be formed of silicon oxide. In order to form a trench TC or a contact hole in the etching target layer <b>100</b>, the mask pattern <b>110</b> in which an opening is formed in an etching target region may be formed on the top of the etching target layer <b>100</b>. The mask pattern <b>110</b> may be formed of carbon. For example, the mask pattern <b>110</b> may be formed of amorphous carbon. The mask pattern <b>110</b> may include openings that expose portions of the etching target layer <b>100</b>. Although the mask pattern <b>110</b> in which an opening with a line shape is formed has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the opening may be implemented in various shapes, such as a circular shape and a polygonal shape.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When an etching process that uses the mask pattern <b>110</b> as an etching mask is performed, the trench TC may be formed as the etching target layer <b>1100</b> that is exposed through the openings of the mask pattern <b>110</b> is etched. The etching process may be performed through a dry etching process by using plasma. The etching process may be performed by using, as an etching gas ETC, a gas with a high etching selectivity with respect to the etching target layer <b>100</b>. For example, when the etching target layer <b>100</b> that is formed of silicon oxide is etched by using the mask pattern <b>110</b> that contains carbon as an etching mask, the etching process may be performed by using the etching gas ETC that contains fluorine. For example, CF<sub>4 </sub>or CHF<sub>3 </sub>gas may be used as the etching gas ETC.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the etching process, using the etching gas ETC that contains fluorine, is performed, the fluorine that is contained in the etching gas ETC may be ionized by plasma, and fluorine (F) ions may be introduced into the etching target layer <b>100</b> through the mask pattern <b>110</b>. Since the fluorine has a high etching selectivity with respect to the etching target layer <b>100</b>, a defect DF that is caused by the fluorine may occur outside of a region in which the trench TC is formed. For example, when a defect DF occurs in a region in which etching of the etching target layer <b>100</b> is inhibited, a portion of the etching target layer <b>100</b> may be etched due to the defect DF.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the defect DF that occurs in the etching target layer <b>100</b> may occur in the etching process that uses the etching gas ETC and may remain after the mask pattern <b>110</b> is removed. A region in which the defect DF occurs may be further removed even in a cleaning process performed after the etching process is performed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, when the trench TC is filled with a conductive layer <b>120</b> in a state in which a defect DF occurs in the etching target layer <b>100</b>, the conductive layer <b>120</b> may spill into a region in which the defect DF occurs. Therefore, although a polishing process that allows the conductive layer <b>120</b> to remain only in the trench TC is performed, the conductive layer <b>120</b>, which spills into the region in which the defect DF occurs, may remain and hence a bridge BG may be formed. For example, a bridge BG may be formed between a line that is formed in the trench TC and adjacent lines to be electrically blocked from the line. When the bridge BG is formed between the lines to be electrically blocked from each other, a malfunction may occur in an operation of the memory device, and therefore, the reliability of the memory device may deteriorate.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>D</figref> are views illustrating a method of forming a mask in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a first mask layer <b>210</b><i>a </i>and a compensation layer <b>220</b> may be formed on the top of an etching target layer <b>200</b>.

For example, the compensation layer <b>220</b> may be formed to prevent a bridge from forming, which may occur in the etching target layer <b>200</b> due to the first mask layer <b>210</b><i>a</i>. To this end, the compensation layer <b>220</b> may be formed of a material that is easily chemically bonded to the first mask layer <b>210</b><i>a</i>. When the first mask layer <b>210</b><i>a </i>is formed of a material that contains carbon (C), the compensation layer <b>220</b> may be formed of a material that includes hydrogen (H), which is easily ion-bonded to carbon (C).
