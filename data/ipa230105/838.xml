id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for treating multiple sclerosis, and more particularly, to a pharmaceutical composition for treating multiple sclerosis based on AMPK inhibitory function and zinc homeostasis control function.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that occurs due to abnormal control of the immune system in the human body and destruction of the myelin sheath surrounding the axon of neurons and is known to be involved in various neurotoxicities. Steroids and immunosuppressants have been mainly used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, which is based on the fact that the main mechanism of multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune mechanism. It is an attempt to control the disease by weakening the body's immune function. However, studies to date have shown that, although these treatments have a prominent effect in the acute phase of the disease, they do not play a role in inhibiting or reducing the recurrence of the disease in the long term. Therefore, to this date, the most known effective therapy is injecting a large amount of steroids or immunosuppressants at regular intervals over several days in the acute phase. In recent years, many attempts have been made to inject beta-globulin through the spinal fluid or the skin to alleviate chronic degeneration by preventing recurrence of this disease. However, a drawback is that one should continue to receive the treatment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, it has been reported that excessive zinc accumulation or severe deficiency in the body is toxic to neurons, and the homeostatic loss of zinc may cause multiple sclerosis. Recently, various research groups have been conducting research on zinc homeostasis in multiple sclerosis, and various results have been published, but most of them have been results of changes in the phenomenon of homeostatic loss of zinc, and accurate mechanical research is insufficient. In addition, due to methods of measuring zinc and sample diversity, researches on zinc in multiple sclerosis needs to be conducted more closely. In this regard, Korean Patent No. 1324647 discloses a composition for the treatment or prevention of multiple sclerosis and a screening method thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the prior art is drawn to inhibiting functions of NADPH oxidase and/or MMP using LeuSH (L-Leucinethiol) and thus therapeutics for multiple sclerosis based on inhibiting AMPK and controlling zinc neurotoxicity is still untapped.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is to solve various problems including the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for treating multiple sclerosis based on AMPK inhibition function and zinc homeostasis control function for effectively treating multiple sclerosis without a side effect. However, this problem is exemplary, and the scope of the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition for treating multiple sclerosis or encephalomyelitis, containing a compound having a structure of Formula I below as an active ingredient:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="38.10mm" wi="70.61mm" file="US20230000839A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">(In the above Formula, R<sub>1 </sub>to R<sub>5 </sub>are each independently hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, a halogen, a C1-7 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, an amine group, a carboxyl group, and R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3 </sub>together form an &#x2014;O&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014; ring (n is an integer of 1 to 3), or a substituted or unsubstituted C6 aromatic ring, R<sub>6 </sub>is hydrogen or methyl, and R<sub>7 </sub>is hydrogen or halogen and <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.22mm" wi="14.14mm" file="US20230000839A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> is a single bond or a double bond.)</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for treating multiple sclerosis in a subject suffering from multiple sclerosis, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having the structure of Formula I below:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="38.10mm" wi="70.61mm" file="US20230000839A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">(In the above Formula, R<sub>1 </sub>to R<sub>5 </sub>are each independently hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, a halogen, a C1-7 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, an amine group, a carboxyl group, and R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3 </sub>together form an &#x2014;O&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014; ring (n is an integer of 1 to 3), or a substituted or unsubstituted C6 aromatic ring, R<sub>6 </sub>is hydrogen or methyl, and R<sub>7 </sub>is hydrogen or halogen and <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="3.22mm" wi="14.14mm" file="US20230000839A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> is a single bond or a double bond.)</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="38.10mm" wi="70.61mm" file="US20230000839A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a compound having the structure of Formula I below for use in the treatment of multiple sclerosis:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="38.10mm" wi="70.61mm" file="US20230000839A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0016" num="0011">(In the above Formula, R<sub>1 </sub>to R<sub>5 </sub>are each independently hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, a halogen, a C1-7 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, an amine group, a carboxyl group, and R<sub>2 </sub>and R3 together form an &#x2014;O&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014; ring (n is an integer of 1 to 3), or a substituted or unsubstituted C6 aromatic ring, R<sub>6 </sub>is hydrogen or methyl, and R<sub>7 </sub>is hydrogen or halogen and <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="3.22mm" wi="14.14mm" file="US20230000839A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> is a single bond or a double bond.)</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0012">The pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of multiple sclerosis based on the AMPK inhibitory function and zinc homeostasis control function according to the present invention made as described above can be used for the development of new therapeutic agents that can overcome spinal cord damage and behavioral disorders due to multiple sclerosis by administrating a novel compound having AMPK activity inhibitory function and zinc homeostasis control function.

AMPK is phosphorylated and activated when cellular energy levels are low, and in turn regulates cellular metabolism, thereby regulating gene expression over a long period of time to restore ATP levels. Increases in the AMP/ATP ratio, changes in cellular pH and redox state, and increases in the creatine/phosphocreatine ratio are known to activate AMPK.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">As used herein, &#x201c;zinc&#x201d; is a metal element abundantly present throughout the body, including the central nervous system, and plays a very important role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory of neurons. However, it is well known that excessive zinc accumulation or severe deficiency is toxic to neurons. Intracellular accumulation of zinc is a major cause of nerve damage that occurs after acute neurological diseases such as stroke, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and hypoglycemia and it causes the formation of plaques generated in Alzheimer's brain, a chronic disease.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0062">According to one

Recently, many researchers have been conducting researches on how to prevent harmful immune cell infiltration into the brain as one of the phenomena that appears in multiple sclerosis. Interest in the correlation between zinc and multiple sclerosis is increasing as results of inhibiting symptoms of multiple sclerosis and tissue damage of spinal white matter are reported in mice that genetically remove zinc transport 3 (ZnT3), which controls synaptic vesicle movement at the end of the nerve and administrating zinc chelatores. In addition, it has been reported that in this process, the production of active oxygen species due to activation of NADPH oxidase is involved in the secondary damage of meylin occurring in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, according to the results of several recently published studies, it is known that zinc is secreted from the cell terminal and then accumulated in the cytoplasm, thereby damaging myelin due to the toxicity of zinc released from protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). In the previous study of the present inventors, it was reported that demyelination and microglia activity were reduced and T cell infiltration that cause encephalitis was inhibitored, which are symptoms of EAE in animals in which the gene encoding zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3), which is involved in zinc transport into synaptic vesicles, was genetically removed, or when Clioquinol (CQ), a zinc chelator was administrated. The preceding studies are as follows, respectively: Choi, B. Y. et al., <i>Neurobiol. Dis. </i>54: 382-391, 2013; Choi, B. Y. et al., <i>J. Neuroinflammation. </i>12: 104, 2015; Choi, B.

W. et al., <i>Mol. Brain. </i>9: 14, 2016). The present inventors conducted a study to identify the cell death mechanism related to AMPK in the process of brain nerve cell damage, and reported the related mechanism in Molecular Brain (IF: 3.410) in 2016. In addition, according to the results of several recently published studies, it has been reported that AMPK activity is associated with damage and pathological involvement of the central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, and multiple sclerosis. Accordingly, the present inventors have conducted a study on the AMPK-based neurotoxic mechanism, which is the most essential for metabolic regulation. Based on the previous research, the present inventors conducted research on the development of a novel AMPK inhibitor and screened a new compound to obtain an AMPK inhibitor ((Z)-5-((1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-2-((3-hydroxyphenyl)amino)thiazol-4(5H)-one, named &#x201c;1H10&#x201d;, Formula II) was discovered, and thereafter from the studying the mechanism of action (MOA) of drugs, the present inventors reported that 1H10 reduced neuronal cell death caused by zinc toxicity, excitory toxicity, and oxidartive damage, etc. after stroke by regulating the concentration of free zinc in the cell (Eom J.

In addition, it was confirmed that demyelination of the spinal cord, immune cell activity was reduced, and infiltration of immune cells into the area where demyelination has progress was suppress. These results suggest that the effect is related to the mechanism of inhibiting AMPK activity of the 1H10 compound. In addition, it was confirmed that zinc accumulation in the spinal cord white matter was reduced according to 1H10 treatment, thereby inhibiting MMP-9 and preventing accumulation of immune cells accordingly, and it was observed that 1H10 could act directly on zinc and chelate it.

As a result, it was observed that the expression of IFN gamma in the spinal cord white matter was increased in the experimental group administered with 1H10 after EAE induction compared to the group administrated with vehicle only, whereas the expression of TNF alpha was decreased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Experimental Example 6: Abnormal Accumulation of Zinc, Damage of BBB and Activity of MMP-9</heading><p id="p-0123" num="0147">The present inventors investigated EAE-induced abnormal accumulation of zinc in the spinal cord white matter, damage of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and activity of MMP-9 by administration of 1H10.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0148">As a result, no signal due to TSQ staining was observed in the white matter of normal tissues, but as a result of performing TSQ staining on the 21st day after EAE-induction, abnormal &#x201c;patch like&#x201d; fluorescence was observed in the white matter region of the spinal cord. The above pattern was not observed in the spinal cord of normal animals or vehicle-administered animals without EAE-induction, and it was confirmed that patch-like TSQ abnormal staining was significantly reduced by administration of 1H10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>). In addition, it has been reportet that after EAE-induction, the activity of MMP-9 is increased, and T-cells, B-cells, and other immune cells infiltrate into the central nervous system due to damage of BBB thereby and the infiltration of immune cells may destroy myelin sheath by disturbing immune system of central nerve system. Based on the previous researches, the present inventors conducted histological analysis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) leakage and measured MMP-9 activity to observe BBB damage. As a result, IgG staining due to damage of BBB was not detected in white matter or gray matter in either the mice administrated with vehicle only or the mice administrated with 1H10 (Sham group). However, in mice 3 weeks after MOG injection, IgG infiltration was significantly increased in both white matter and gray matter, and this phenomenon was significantly reduced by administration of 1H10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>C to <b>4</b>E</figref>). In addition, since the activity of MMP-9 is increased by zinc, it is thought that the observed increase of zinc in the white matter and the increase in the activity of MMP-9 are closely related to each other. It was confirmed that the activity of MMP-9 in the spinal cord white matter was inhibited in the experimental group administered with 1H10 compared to the control group administrated with vehicle only (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>F and <b>4</b>G</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Experimental Example 7: Verification of Homeostasis Regulation of Zinc</heading><p id="p-0125" num="0149">As a result of verifying the possibility of zinc chelation according to 1H10 treatment using FluoZin-3, a material emitting fluorescence upon binding to free zinc, it was confirmed that the increase of intracellular zinc level was significantly reduced in experimental group administrated with 1H10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). In addition, after reacting various concentrations of (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 &#x3bc;M) 1H10 or clioquinol with 1 &#x3bc;M zinc and 5 &#x3bc;M fluorescent labeled drug for free zinc (FluoZin-3) in a test tube and fluorescence values were measured. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of each drug were determined as 4.234 &#x3bc;M and 10.06 &#x3bc;M, but the final FluoZin-3 fluorescence value was lower in clioquinol. 1H10 of the present invention binds zinc even at a lower concentration than clioquinol, but at a high concentration, zinc binding strength is considered to be lower than that of clioquinol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>).

Specifically, 40 &#x3bc;M of each of the drugs was treated in a mouse cortical neuron culture, and LDH cytotoxicity was observed after 24 or 48 hours.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0160">As a result, it was confirmed that 1H10 had intrinsic toxicity of 7.81&#xb1;2.77% after 24 hours of drug treatment and 60.72&#xb1;8.28% after 48 hours of drug treatment, but 4B01 had stronger intrinsic toxicity than 1H10 after 48 hours of drug treatment. In addition, 4B08 and 4C01 showed intrinsic toxicity with insignificant difference from 1H10, but 4C08 did not show intrinsic toxicity until 48 hours of drug treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0161">In conclusion, the compounds according to an embodiment of the present invention have a protective effect on various toxic mechanisms such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and zinc neurotoxicity related to conventional multiple sclerosis. In addition, it was demonstrated that by reducing MMP-9 activity through zinc chelation, it was possible to inhibit the occurrence of multiple sclerosis disease by preventing the infiltration and accumulation of immune cells in the spinal cord white matter, thereby reducing the autoimmune response. Therefore, 1H10 of the present invention can be used to develop drugs that can replace steroids and immunosuppressants, which have serious side effects due to long-term administration, and control the underlying problem.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0162">Although the present invention has been described with reference to the above-described examples and experimental examples, these are merely exemplary, and those of ordinary skill in the art can will understand that it is possible to make various modifications and equivalent other examples and experimental examples therefrom. Therefore, the true scope of the present invention should be determined by the technical spirit of the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description"
