Increasing compute drives ever higher memory performance needs which directly puts stress on memory bandwidth and power. Since the power budget for a memory subsystem remains roughly constant there is constant pressure to reduce memory power at matched or better performance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Memory may have an operating temperature of approximately 85-100 C, which is actively managed by the memory controller in the compute unit. Increased access by the compute unit to the memory increases the memory temperature as the memory draws more power. A system can cool the system to reduce the amount of heat generated by the increased memory operation and eventually throttle its performance when it hits its max temperature limit as specified by the memory vendor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While cooling may be important for removing heat from the system, low temperature cooling (e.g., below 25 C) can have a negative performance impact on memory, which includes integrated transistor devices. The transistor performance can be described by its drain current, which is (in the active/saturation region):</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Id</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>&#x3bc;</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>T</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>*</mo>        <mi>Cox</mi>       </mrow>       <mn>2</mn>      </mfrac>      <mo>*</mo>      <mfrac>       <mi>W</mi>       <mi>L</mi>      </mfrac>      <mo>*</mo>      <msup>       <mrow>        <mo>(</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>Vgs</mi>         <mo>-</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>Vth</mi>          <mo>&#x2061;</mo>          <mo>(</mo>          <mi>T</mi>          <mo>)</mo>         </mrow>        </mrow>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mn>2</mn>      </msup>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">where Id is the transistor drain current, &#x3bc;(T) is the carrier mobility which depends on the temperature, T, Cox is the dielectric capacitance, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Vgs is the gate to source voltage, and Vth(T) is the threshold voltage which depends on temperature.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Operating temperature increases will decrease the threshold voltage, which increases drain current.

There are emerging exa-scale computing systems. A move to scale computing past exa-scale (e.g., toward zetta-scale computing) can involve low temperature cooling of the memory devices. As mentioned above, the inverse temperature dependence (ITD) inherent in the device physics of transistors can have an inverse performance impact on standard memory devices. Designing the memory devices and the system for low temperature operation not only can compensate for the performance impact of ITD, but it can also enable the use of the low temperature environment to improve memory performance and overall system performance.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">The low temperature memory can be customized for low temperature operation, having a gate stack to adjust a work function of the memory cell transistors to reduce the threshold voltage (Vt) relative to a standard memory device. The reduced temperature can improve the conductivity of other components within the memory, enabling increased memory array sizes, fewer vertical ground channels for stacked devices, and reduced operating power. Based on the differences in the memory, the memory controller can manage access to the memory device with adjusted control parameters based on lower leakage current for the memory cells and lower line resistance for the memory array.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example of a transistor designed for low temperature applications. Circuit <b>100</b> represents a transistor device. It will be understood that the elements illustrated are not necessarily drawn to scale. Elements of circuit <b>100</b> can have multiple layers or portions, where circuit <b>100</b> is generally representative of the elements of a transistor.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">A p-type transistor can be referred to as a p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) device, and an n-type transistor can be referred to as an n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) device. A p-type transistor (or PMOS) refers to a transistor that has majority holes as the electrical carriers in the induced channel. An n-type transistor (or NMOS) refers to a transistor that has a majority electrons as the electrical carriers in the induced channel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Circuit <b>100</b> includes a substrate, which represents a semiconductor substrate on which the transistor is formed. Circuit <b>100</b> can be a p-type transistor or an n-type transistor. For a p-type transistor, the substrate is an n-type material (i.e., a semiconductor doped with an element having a valence band that is nearly empty, having only a small number of electrons in the outer band). For an n-type transistor, the substrate is a p-type material (i.e., a semiconductor doped with an element having a valence band that is nearly full, lacking only a small number of electrons in the outer band). The example illustrated in circuit <b>100</b> is an n-type transistor, with a p-well <b>110</b> representing the transistor substrate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">N-diffusion <b>112</b> represents a region of p-well <b>110</b> doped with the opposite carriers (e.g., since the substrate is p-type, the source region is n-doped) as the substrate. Contact <b>134</b> is a metal or highly doped polysilicon material that electrically contacts n-diffusion <b>112</b>. Contact <b>134</b> and n-diffusion <b>112</b> represent the source of the transistor for circuit <b>100</b>, as indicated by source <b>132</b>. However, it will be understood that reversing the voltages described below can reverse the flow of current through circuit <b>100</b>. Generally, the source and drain are identified by the current flow through the transistor, with current <b>126</b> flowing from source to drain.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">N-diffusion <b>114</b> represents a region of p-well <b>110</b> doped with the opposite carriers as the substrate. Contact <b>138</b> is a metal or highly doped polysilicon material that electrically contacts n-diffusion <b>114</b>. Drain <b>136</b> is the transistor terminal represented by contact <b>138</b> and n-diffusion <b>114</b>. Channel <b>116</b> represents a region of carriers induced in the depletion region (which is not explicitly shown) between n-diffusion <b>112</b> and n-diffusion <b>114</b>. For simplicity, channel <b>116</b> is illustrated with uniform depth between n-diffusion <b>112</b> and n-diffusion <b>114</b>, which is an idealization for purposes of discussion.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">Circuit <b>100</b> can include contact <b>144</b> connected to p-well <b>110</b>. Circuit <b>100</b> illustrates contact <b>144</b> on the back side of p-well <b>110</b>. However, contact <b>144</b> can be on the back side or on the top side of the substrate. The back side refers to the side of p-well <b>110</b> opposite the surface on which the transistor source, drain, and gate are disposed. Contact <b>144</b> represents body <b>142</b>. In one example, p-well <b>110</b> is tied to source <b>132</b> to avoid body effects. If the body effect is used, body <b>142</b> is the control terminal to bias p-well <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">Circuit <b>100</b> includes gate <b>130</b>, which includes a gate stack. The gate stack refers to metal <b>122</b> and dielectric <b>124</b>, which make up the materials above channel <b>116</b>. Metal <b>122</b> represents the metal, polysilicon, or the combination of metal and polysilicon that make up the composition of the conductive contact for gate <b>130</b>. The composition of metal <b>122</b> can be referred to as the work function of the gate metal or gate conductor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">The composition of the electrode has an impact on how the transistor acts when source <b>132</b>, drain <b>136</b>, and gate <b>130</b> are biased to induce channel <b>116</b>. Metal <b>122</b> represents the electrode conductor. Seeing that the metal layer work function can be or include doped polysilicon in addition to or instead of metal, metal <b>122</b> could alternatively be referred to as a conductor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">Metal <b>122</b> is separated from the depletion region of p-well <b>110</b> that is between n-diffusion <b>112</b> and n-diffusion <b>114</b> by dielectric <b>124</b>. In one example, dielectric <b>124</b> is made of oxide, such as a semiconductor oxide formed on the semiconductor of p-well <b>110</b>. In one example, dielectric <b>124</b> is an insulating layer that includes a non-oxide material.

In one example, memory controller <b>230</b> includes command (CMD) logic <b>232</b> to generate access commands to send to DRAM <b>240</b>. The command is represented as CMD over a command bus to DRAM <b>240</b>. The command can be any type of command.

Column decoder (DEC) <b>252</b> represents decoding hardware to select columns or bitlines. Sense amps (amplifiers) <b>256</b> represent sense amplifiers to stage data for access to array <b>250</b>. For a write, write data is written into sense amps <b>256</b> and then into array <b>250</b>. For a read, data is read from array <b>250</b> into sense amps <b>256</b>, to return to memory controller <b>230</b> over the data bus. The decoding circuitry can represent control circuitry that selectively drives voltage on an access line to bias the memory cell.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">In one example, not just the transistors of array <b>250</b>, but the transistors of decoder and control circuitry are also in accordance with an example of circuit <b>100</b>. Thus, not only do the transistors of array <b>250</b> have a design specific to low temperature operation, but the other circuitry in DRAM <b>240</b> can be designed for low temperature operation. Thus, the entire device can be designed for low temperature operation.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">The overlay over DRAM <b>240</b> represents cooling <b>270</b>. Cooling <b>270</b> provides cooling for DRAM <b>240</b>. In one example, cooling <b>270</b> is limited to cooling the memory. In one example, cooling <b>270</b> cools processor <b>220</b> in addition to the memory. Cooling <b>270</b> can represent ultra-low temperature cooling, such as sub 0 C cooling.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">With low temperature operation, signal lines, such as wires, traces, or other carriers of control signals, data signals, and power, with have lower impedance (resistive-capacitive (RC) impedance). With lower impedance on the signal lines, array <b>250</b> can be larger by approximately 10-20% relative to standard memory devices. The array can be larger without drawing additional power and without affecting the communication speed (no degradation in timing) because of the lower RC values. In one example, the RC values can be reduced by approximately 25% relative to a standard device. With lower RC values, for the same power, memory controller <b>230</b> can access a larger array <b>250</b>. Additionally, with the same timing, memory controller <b>230</b> can provide commands and receive data from a larger array. In one example, DRAM <b>240</b> supports a larger bit access for the reasons stated above.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">In one example, DRAM <b>240</b> represents a stacked die device. The stacked die device, such as an HBM, has multiple dies in a vertical stack connected with through-silicon vias (TSVs). DRAM <b>240</b> designed for lower temperature enables the use of fewer power TSVs because of the lower impedance in the power path. The number of power TSVs can be approximately 10-20% lower than a standard stacked device.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">In one example, the low temperature enables array <b>250</b> to have a higher bit density relative to a standard device. The low temperature memory cell <b>244</b> can provide improved short channel control, enabling the higher bit density. The increased bit density allows more memory cells <b>244</b>, having a larger array.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">In one example, row hammer control <b>234</b> of memory controller <b>230</b> enables memory controller <b>230</b> to manage row hammer for DRAM <b>240</b>. In one example, memory cells <b>244</b> have a lower leakage as compared to standard devices. The lower leakage allows the device to retain a determinate state for longer. Thus, DRAM <b>240</b> can have a longer refresh time. More specifically, the time between row refresh cycles (tRFC) and the time for maximum average periodic refresh (tREFI) can be longer as compared to standard devices.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">With longer refresh times, when memory controller <b>230</b> determines the timing to use to schedule refresh times, the memory controller can schedule refresh times farther apart as compared to standard devices. In one example, the refresh time is not completely controlled by the device physics. Rather than being completely determined by how long the memory device can retain charge due to lower leakage, the system can account for row hammer conditions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Row hammer refers to a condition in which repeated access to a target row or target wordline can cause unintentional programming of a victim row, which is a row physically adjacent the target row. Depending on device physics, the victim row does not need to be directly adjacent to the target row. Row hammer conditions can be resolved by refreshing the victim rows. The need to refresh the victim rows can end up refreshing rows more frequently than the tRFC and tREFI parameters would dictate. Thus, in general the rows can be refreshed less frequently, but the system can refresh the rows when a row hammer condition is detected, refreshing the rows more often than the time than would be supported by memory cells <b>244</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example of a memory cell with components designed for low temperature applications.

While shown as coupling I/O <b>1022</b> from memory controller <b>1020</b> to I/O <b>1042</b> of memory device <b>1040</b>, it will be understood that in an implementation of system <b>1000</b> where groups of memory devices <b>1040</b> are accessed in parallel, multiple memory devices can include I/O interfaces to the same interface of memory controller <b>1020</b>. In an implementation of system <b>1000</b> including one or more memory modules <b>1070</b>, I/O <b>1042</b> can include interface hardware of the memory module in addition to interface hardware on the memory device itself. Other memory controllers <b>1020</b> will include separate interfaces to other memory devices <b>1040</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">The bus between memory controller <b>1020</b> and memory devices <b>1040</b> can be implemented as multiple signal lines coupling memory controller <b>1020</b> to memory devices <b>1040</b>. The bus may typically include at least clock (CLK) <b>1032</b>, command/address (CMD) <b>1034</b>, data (DQ) <b>1036</b>, and zero or more other signal lines <b>1038</b>. In one example, a bus or connection between memory controller <b>1020</b> and memory can be referred to as a memory bus. In one example, the memory bus is a multi-drop bus. The signal lines for CMD can be referred to as a &#x201c;C/A bus&#x201d; (or ADD/CMD bus, or some other designation indicating the transfer of commands (C or CMD) and address (A or ADD) information) and the signal lines for write and read DQ can be referred to as a &#x201c;data bus.&#x201d; In one example, independent channels have different clock signals, C/A buses, data buses, and other signal lines. Thus, system <b>1000</b> can be considered to have multiple &#x201c;buses,&#x201d; in the sense that an independent interface path can be considered a separate bus. It will be understood that in addition to the lines explicitly shown, a bus can include at least one of strobe signaling lines, alert lines, auxiliary lines, or other signal lines, or a combination. It will also be understood that serial bus technologies can be used for the connection between memory controller <b>1020</b> and memory devices <b>1040</b>. An example of a serial bus technology is 8B10B encoding and transmission of high-speed data with embedded clock over a single differential pair of signals in each direction. In one example, CMD <b>1034</b> represents signal lines shared in parallel with multiple memory devices. In one example, multiple memory devices share encoding command signal lines of CMD <b>1034</b>, and each has a separate chip select (CS_n) signal line to select individual memory devices.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0130">It will be understood that in the example of system <b>1000</b>, the bus between memory controller <b>1020</b> and memory devices <b>1040</b> includes a subsidiary command bus CMD <b>1034</b> and a subsidiary bus to carry the write and read data, DQ <b>1036</b>. In one example, the data bus can include bidirectional lines for read data and for write/command data. In another example, the subsidiary bus DQ <b>1036</b> can include unidirectional write signal lines for write and data from the host to memory, and can include unidirectional lines for read data from the memory to the host. In accordance with the chosen memory technology and system design, other signals <b>1038</b> may accompany a bus or sub bus, such as strobe lines DQS. Based on design of system <b>1000</b>, or implementation if a design supports multiple implementations, the data bus can have more or less bandwidth per memory device <b>1040</b>. For example, the data bus can support memory devices that have either a &#xd7;4 interface, a &#xd7;8 interface, a &#xd7;16 interface, or other interface. The convention &#x201c;xW,&#x201d; where W is an integer that refers to an interface size or width of the interface of memory device <b>1040</b>, which represents a number of signal lines to exchange data with memory controller <b>1020</b>. The interface size of the memory devices is a controlling factor on how many memory devices can be used concurrently per channel in system <b>1000</b> or coupled in parallel to the same signal lines. In one example, high bandwidth memory devices, wide interface devices, or stacked memory configurations, or combinations, can enable wider interfaces, such as a &#xd7;128 interface, a &#xd7;256 interface, a &#xd7;512 interface, a &#xd7;1024 interface, or other data bus interface width.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">In one example, memory devices <b>1040</b> and memory controller <b>1020</b> exchange data over the data bus in a burst, or a sequence of consecutive data transfers. The burst corresponds to a number of transfer cycles, which is related to a bus frequency. In one example, the transfer cycle can be a whole clock cycle for transfers occurring on a same clock or strobe signal edge (e.g., on the rising edge). In one example, every clock cycle, referring to a cycle of the system clock, is separated into multiple unit intervals (UIs), where each UI is a transfer cycle. For example, double data rate transfers trigger on both edges of the clock signal (e.g., rising and falling). A burst can last for a configured number of UIs, which can be a configuration stored in a register, or triggered on the fly. For example, a sequence of eight consecutive transfer periods can be considered a burst length eight (BL8), and each memory device <b>1040</b> can transfer data on each UI. Thus, a &#xd7;8 memory device operating on BL8 can transfer 64 bits of data (8 data signal lines times 8 data bits transferred per line over the burst). It will be understood that this simple example is merely an illustration and is not limiting.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132">Memory devices <b>1040</b> represent memory resources for system <b>1000</b>. In one example, each memory device <b>1040</b> is a separate memory die. In one example, each memory device <b>1040</b> can interface with multiple (e.g., 2) channels per device or die. Each memory device <b>1040</b> includes I/O interface logic <b>1042</b>, which has a bandwidth determined by the implementation of the device (e.g., &#xd7;16 or &#xd7;8 or some other interface bandwidth). I/O interface logic <b>1042</b> enables the memory devices to interface with memory controller <b>1020</b>. I/O interface logic <b>1042</b> can include a hardware interface, and can be in accordance with I/O <b>1022</b> of memory controller, but at the memory device end. In one example, multiple memory devices <b>1040</b> are connected in parallel to the same command and data buses. In another example, multiple memory devices <b>1040</b> are connected in parallel to the same command bus, and are connected to different data buses. For example, system <b>1000</b> can be configured with multiple memory devices <b>1040</b> coupled in parallel, with each memory device responding to a command, and accessing memory resources <b>1060</b> internal to each. For a Write operation, an individual memory device <b>1040</b> can write a portion of the overall data word, and for a Read operation, an individual memory device <b>1040</b> can fetch a portion of the overall data word. The remaining bits of the word will be provided or received by other memory devices in parallel.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0133">In one example, memory devices <b>1040</b> are disposed directly on a motherboard or host system platform (e.g., a PCB (printed circuit board) or substrate on which processor <b>1010</b> is disposed) of a computing device. In one example, memory devices <b>1040</b> can be organized into memory modules <b>1070</b>. In one example, memory modules <b>1070</b> represent dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). In one example, memory modules <b>1070</b> represent other organization of multiple memory devices to share at least a portion of access or control circuitry, which can be a separate circuit, a separate device, or a separate board from the host system platform. Memory modules <b>1070</b> can include multiple memory devices <b>1040</b>, and the memory modules can include support for multiple separate channels to the included memory devices disposed on them. In another example, memory devices <b>1040</b> may be incorporated into the same package as memory controller <b>1020</b>, such as by techniques such as multi-chip-module (MCM), package-on-package, through-silicon via (TSV), or other techniques or combinations. Similarly, in one example, multiple memory devices <b>1040</b> may be incorporated into memory modules <b>1070</b>, which themselves may be incorporated into the same package as memory controller <b>1020</b>. It will be appreciated that for these and other implementations, memory controller <b>1020</b> may be part of host processor <b>1010</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134">Memory devices <b>1040</b> each include one or more memory arrays <b>1060</b>. Memory array <b>1060</b> represents addressable memory locations or storage locations for data. Typically, memory array <b>1060</b> is managed as rows of data, accessed via wordline (rows) and bitline (individual bits within a row) control. Memory array <b>1060</b> can be organized as separate channels, ranks, and banks of memory. Channels may refer to independent control paths to storage locations within memory devices <b>1040</b>. Ranks may refer to common locations across multiple memory devices (e.g., same row addresses within different devices) in parallel. Banks may refer to sub-arrays of memory locations within a memory device <b>1040</b>. In one example, banks of memory are divided into sub-banks with at least a portion of shared circuitry (e.g., drivers, signal lines, control logic) for the sub-banks, allowing separate addressing and access. It will be understood that channels, ranks, banks, sub-banks, bank groups, or other organizations of the memory locations, and combinations of the organizations, can overlap in their application to physical resources. For example, the same physical memory locations can be accessed over a specific channel as a specific bank, which can also belong to a rank. Thus, the organization of memory resources will be understood in an inclusive, rather than exclusive, manner.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0135">In one example, memory devices <b>1040</b> include one or more registers <b>1044</b>. Register <b>1044</b> represents one or more storage devices or storage locations that provide configuration or settings for the operation of the memory device. In one example, register <b>1044</b> can provide a storage location for memory device <b>1040</b> to store data for access by memory controller <b>1020</b> as part of a control or management operation. In one example, register <b>1044</b> includes one or more Mode Registers. In one example, register <b>1044</b> includes one or more multipurpose registers. The configuration of locations within register <b>1044</b> can configure memory device <b>1040</b> to operate in different &#x201c;modes,&#x201d; where command information can trigger different operations within memory device <b>1040</b> based on the mode. Additionally or in the alternative, different modes can also trigger different operation from address information or other signal lines depending on the mode. Settings of register <b>1044</b> can indicate configuration for I/O settings (e.g., timing, termination or ODT (on-die termination) <b>1046</b>, driver configuration, or other I/O settings).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">In one example, memory device <b>1040</b> includes ODT <b>1046</b> as part of the interface hardware associated with I/O <b>1042</b>. ODT <b>1046</b> can be configured as mentioned above, and provide settings for impedance to be applied to the interface to specified signal lines. In one example, ODT <b>1046</b> is applied to DQ signal lines. In one example, ODT <b>1046</b> is applied to command signal lines. In one example, ODT <b>1046</b> is applied to address signal lines. In one example, ODT <b>1046</b> can be applied to any combination of the preceding. The ODT settings can be changed based on whether a memory device is a selected target of an access operation or a non-target device. ODT <b>1046</b> settings can affect the timing and reflections of signaling on the terminated lines. Careful control over ODT <b>1046</b> can enable higher-speed operation with improved matching of applied impedance and loading. ODT <b>1046</b> can be applied to specific signal lines of I/O interface <b>1042</b>, <b>1022</b> (for example, ODT for DQ lines or ODT for CA lines), and is not necessarily applied to all signal lines.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">Memory device <b>1040</b> includes controller <b>1050</b>, which represents control logic within the memory device to control internal operations within the memory device. For example, controller <b>1050</b> decodes commands sent by memory controller <b>1020</b> and generates internal operations to execute or satisfy the commands. Controller <b>1050</b> can be referred to as an internal controller, and is separate from memory controller <b>1020</b> of the host. Controller <b>1050</b> can determine what mode is selected based on register <b>1044</b>, and configure the internal execution of operations for access to memory resources <b>1060</b> or other operations based on the selected mode. Controller <b>1050</b> generates control signals to control the routing of bits within memory device <b>1040</b> to provide a proper interface for the selected mode and direct a command to the proper memory locations or addresses. Controller <b>1050</b> includes command logic <b>1052</b>, which can decode command encoding received on command and address signal lines. Thus, command logic <b>1052</b> can be or include a command decoder. With command logic <b>1052</b>, memory device can identify commands and generate internal operations to execute requested commands.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0138">Referring again to memory controller <b>1020</b>, memory controller <b>1020</b> includes command (CMD) logic <b>1024</b>, which represents logic or circuitry to generate commands to send to memory devices <b>1040</b>. The generation of the commands can refer to the command prior to scheduling, or the preparation of queued commands ready to be sent. Generally, the signaling in memory subsystems includes address information within or accompanying the command to indicate or select one or more memory locations where the memory devices should execute the command. In response to scheduling of transactions for memory device <b>1040</b>, memory controller <b>1020</b> can issue commands via I/O <b>1022</b> to cause memory device <b>1040</b> to execute the commands. In one example, controller <b>1050</b> of memory device <b>1040</b> receives and decodes command and address information received via I/O <b>1042</b> from memory controller <b>1020</b>. Based on the received command and address information, controller <b>1050</b> can control the timing of operations of the logic and circuitry within memory device <b>1040</b> to execute the commands. Controller <b>1050</b> is responsible for compliance with standards or specifications within memory device <b>1040</b>, such as timing and signaling requirements. Memory controller <b>1020</b> can implement compliance with standards or specifications by access scheduling and control.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0139">Memory controller <b>1020</b> includes scheduler <b>1030</b>, which represents logic or circuitry to generate and order transactions to send to memory device <b>1040</b>. From one perspective, the primary function of memory controller <b>1020</b> could be said to schedule memory access and other transactions to memory device <b>1040</b>. Such scheduling can include generating the transactions themselves to implement the requests for data by processor <b>1010</b> and to maintain integrity of the data (e.g., such as with commands related to refresh). Transactions can include one or more commands, and result in the transfer of commands or data or both over one or multiple timing cycles such as clock cycles or unit intervals. Transactions can be for access such as read or write or related commands or a combination, and other transactions can include memory management commands for configuration, settings, data integrity, or other commands or a combination.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0140">Memory controller <b>1020</b> typically includes logic such as scheduler <b>1030</b> to allow selection and ordering of transactions to improve performance of system <b>1000</b>. Thus, memory controller <b>1020</b> can select which of the outstanding transactions should be sent to memory device <b>1040</b> in which order, which is typically achieved with logic much more complex that a simple first-in first-out algorithm. Memory controller <b>1020</b> manages the transmission of the transactions to memory device <b>1040</b>, and manages the timing associated with the transaction. In one example, transactions have deterministic timing, which can be managed by memory controller <b>1020</b> and used in determining how to schedule the transactions with scheduler <b>1030</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0141">In one example, memory controller <b>1020</b> includes refresh (REF) logic <b>1026</b>.
