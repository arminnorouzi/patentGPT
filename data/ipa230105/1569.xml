Another time and cost saving measure will be in the manufacture of the intelligent robot. Not having to build and develop each robot as a whole, but rather only the individual modules themselves, may reduce manufacturing time and cost. It will also allow the dispersal of the production of the robot as a &#x2018;module A&#x2019; may be manufactured in a &#x2018;facility X&#x2019; in &#x2018;country J&#x2019; while a &#x2018;module B&#x2019; may be manufactured in a &#x2018;facility Y&#x2019; in &#x2018;country I&#x2019; contemporaneously.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">The technical execution may be done in many ways known in the industry. According to the invention, the major point is that, upon connecting a functional module to base modules, either directly or indirectly, data stored on the functional module may be sent to the base module with the information needed to properly operate the functional module. Thereafter, the base module may use this information and may self-configure to operate properly. This allows for a customizable plug and play robot which may be built fast.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077">Reference is now made to the Flow Chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">The following is given as a general example of data flow during the assembly and initiation phase of robot production, and is provided for illustrative purposes only and not intended for limitation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">Step <b>501</b>: The data may be preloaded onto the functional module <b>104</b>, for example, onto a chip or part of a chip, a Solid-State Drive (SSD), Hard-Disk Drive (HDD), a QR code, Near-Field Communication (NFC) chip, bar code, etc. As may be appreciated, this process may be preferably done when the module is created, so it may be effected some time before the module is actually mounted on the robot.

(This example has a single base module <b>102</b> for the sake of clarity, but broader examples exist)</p><p id="p-0081" num="0105">Step <b>504</b>: A functional module <b>104</b> may either be directly connected to the base module(s) <b>102</b> or indirectly connected. In the case of designated ports, this may not likely be an issue as all connections are to the base module(s) are direct in some manner</p><p id="p-0082" num="0106">Step <b>505</b>: In the case of the connection list, a robot may have multiple indirectly connected modules, and each module may have multiple ports. There may be indirect connections and data internally from module port to module port will have to be transferred until it reaches the base module(s) <b>102</b>. This may be done in a multitude of ways known in the industry by any wired or wireless means. As an example, this data may be held like a linked list (linear/non-linear linked data structure) in C programming (A Linked List is a very commonly used linear data structure which comprises of group of nodes in a sequence. Each node holds its own data and the address of the next node hence forming a chain like structure). This may be an extremely simple and non-data intensive way of storing connection data.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0107">Step <b>506</b>: The data may eventually be received by the base module(s) <b>102</b>; and, if it is encoded, it may be decoded (based on the method of encoding) in this step to executable data. Note that encoding and decoding here may have broad terms. Encoding here may be as simple as the data being stored in step <b>501</b> and decoding may be the interpretation of that data into useable information.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0108">Step <b>507</b>: Once the data is executable, the base module <b>102</b> may process the data and may configure the robot by looking up from a data library (by an internal means for example downloaded data on an SSD or HHD or similar) or an external means (for example external drive plugged in or by the internet Wi-Fi, the cloud, ethernet plug). The base module(s) <b>102</b> may mark the important data and may additionally create/store a subset of the data library that the robot requires for quick look-up or access to operate the robot based on the ID/config/connection data.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0109">Step <b>508</b>: (This step is not shown in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) In the case where the module comprises verification data, the base module(s) <b>102</b> may verify that the module is authorized or not unauthorized, unlicensed, or pirated. After this, the robot may be permitted to function. Note that this step may take place during step <b>506</b>, after step <b>506</b> and before step <b>507</b>, during step <b>507</b>, and after step <b>507</b> without loss in function.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0110">It will be appreciated that smart connectors and smart hubs may play a role in non and post-initialization features and operation. The smart connector may further comprise a smart connector chip that holds the information discussed in step <b>501</b>. The initial specification details are similar to those in the initialization of the smart connector, as described hereinabove, but here we will add post initialization features for long term usability and example uses.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0111">The smart connector chip may be used to, for example, aid in the data transfer between functional modules, initiate connection of functional modules, verify the authenticity of functional modules, verify the authenticity of functional module's functions and features, or any other data listed in the spec.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0112">In the example of the smart connector chip comprising verification data, the chip may further be used to verify on a periodic basis that the robot or functional module or functional module feature is licensed, proper, or paid for. This may be done by requiring an internet access at the start or end of a period to check that the robot is licensed, proper, or paid for. Examples of periods may include a day, a week, a month, a year, or any appropriate time interval. This may be similar to how an online subscription is operated to an offline product. The function may operate normally offline, but at certain periods requires the user to connect to the internet and verify that the subscription is still active, so the user cannot pay for a single month of a subscription and keep it indefinitely.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0113">In addition, the smart connector chip may provide diagnostics data for repair or development personnel, such as power usage, data usage, frequency of use, times of highest use volumes. The chips may also feature indicator lights for maintenance, similar to a car dashboard, providing signals for data connection errors, low power transfer, and other diagnostic issues. For example, if there is less than a threshold amount of power passing through the connector, a light on the chip will blink indicating a possible connection error. Similarly, if data signals are not being passing through the connector properly (I.e., somehow the signal may be disrupted or distorted), a light may blink</p><p id="p-0090" num="0114">In preferred embodiments, means for autonomous movement, as is known in the industry, may be included.

This objective may be achieved by using a variety of environmental sensors:<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0136">Microphone array&#x2014;for Command &#x26; Speech recognition;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0137">12 MP camera &#x26; 3D Camera&#x2014;for Face &#x26; Object Recognition, as well as other image and video processing needs;</li>        <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0138">Emergency sensors such as Smoke and Gas detectors; and/or</li>        <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0139">Lidar, Cliff, Infra-red sensors for navigation and collision avoidance abilities.<br/>Each sensor may be upgraded for the specific customer's needs.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0109" num="0140">The second layer in the base module(s) <b>102</b> may be the ability to define the different behaviors the robot performs. Behaviors are the way we simplify every task needed from one system to a set of state machines type commands (based on FlexBE2). Every behavior may use any of the available sensors to complete a basic task the robot may perform. Each state in the state machine may consist of a node&#x2014;which may be essentially a thread that runs a specific compiled program/script written in any language the OS supports, such as C++, Python, and Java, to implement the different nodes.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0141">According to the invention, the third layer in the base module(s) <b>102</b> may use Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to better understand the robot's surroundings and assist the operator with its work. There may be sensing capabilities. Deep Learning algorithms for object recognition and face recognition are already implemented on many different devices.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0142">Object recognition&#x2014;the already mature YOLOv43/Faster R-CNN4 and tested algorithms may be in the herein disclosed modular robot. Even though both algorithms are similar in their basis&#x2014;using anchor box-based network structure and bounding box regression&#x2014;Faster R-CNN usually fails on real-time detection, while YOLO has a problem of detecting smaller objects. The herein modular robot may detect 50 different objects with high confidence, these objects may be daily essentials for a resident.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0143">For face recognition&#x2014;the herein modular robot may use DLIB library, which extract a 128 features vector, each point represents a point of interest on the subject's face. Using K-NN, it calculates the resemblance of a new face that the robot sees, to the ones it already knows. HOG or Resnet models may be used for the feature extraction process&#x2014;the main difference would be the number of features to be extracted.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0144">Fall detection&#x2014;the herein modular robot detects a fall using built in sensors&#x2014;mainly cameras.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0145">It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrative embodiments and that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof.
