Vehicle door handle assembly <b>10</b> includes a handle portion <b>14</b> that is disposed at the door and that is fixedly mounted at the door or to a bracket mounted to the door.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The door handle assembly may include a lighting module that is operable to illuminate the pocket or recess at the door behind the handle portion <b>14</b>. When actuated, the lighting module (that comprises one or more light emitting diodes) provides illumination at the pocket region. The door handle assembly and lighting module may utilize aspects of the assemblies and modules described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,569,697 and/or U.S. Publication No. US-2020-0130646, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The module may be disposed at the inside portion of the handle. For example, and such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the lighting module <b>16</b> is disposed along the inside portion of the handle portion <b>14</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the lighting module <b>16</b> includes one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>17</b> disposed at a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) <b>20</b> with a translucent or transparent cover element <b>18</b> (i.e., a light guide) that forms part of the inside surface of the handle portion. When activated, light emitted by the LEDs passes through the cover element to illuminate the pocket region. The cover element <b>18</b> may also include a diffusion material behind it in order to disperse the light so that the user does not see light hot spots. The diffusion material may be uniform or may have different patterns of diffusion, such as, for example, a hex pattern, to display the light at the door handle in different patterns. The LEDs are located in the door handle strap and arranged so as to face approximately perpendicular to the door sheet metal or pocket, with light guide portions provided along the inner part of the door handle to facilitate illumination of the pocket region when the LEDs are energized (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Optionally, instead of a plurality of LEDs, the pocket light may comprise a single LED or light source, with a light pipe that transmits light across the inside portion of the door handle, with light guide portions provided along the inner part of the door handle to facilitate illumination of the pocket region when the LED or LEDs is/are energized (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The LED or LEDs may be disposed at either the forward end or rearward end (or one or more LEDs at each end) of the door handle strap and aimed or oriented so as to direct or emit light toward the pocket region.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Optionally, the lighting module may be disposed at the door handle bracket and at the pocket region. The light emitted by the LED or LEDs (when energized) provides illumination at the pocket region and may reflect off of the inside surface of the handle portion or strap and toward the ground to provide ground illumination. Optionally, the inside surface of the handle portion may comprise a reflective surface, such as a metallic or chrome plated surface, and/or may be shaped to direct light downward, to enhance reflection of light toward the ground region at the side of the vehicle. The light emitted by the LED or LEDs may provide more direct viewing of the light and may provide enhanced viewability in all ambient lighting conditions and with all vehicle and door handle paint colors.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The lighting module <b>16</b> may be incorporated into various handle types such as strap handles and paddle handles. Optionally, the light guide <b>18</b> is exposed at the door handle portion or handle region of the door. The light guide may be welded or may be formed via a two shot molding process that forms the colored plastic at the inside of the door handle or may be formed separate from the colored plastic of the inside of the door handle. The light guide <b>18</b> distributes light evenly over a length, for example, greater than 50% of the inside of the door handle. The LEDs <b>17</b> may hidden behind the colored plastic with use of the light guide.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Optionally, the LEDs and/or the light guide <b>18</b> may distribute light along the perimeter of the handle or along the edge of handle. The light guide <b>18</b> may be not visible or easily or readily viewable to a person viewing the door handle under normal circumstances (e.g., when the LEDs are deactivated). For example, the light guide may comprise a dark and/or translucent material that blends in with the surroundings (e.g., the paint or molded door handle of the vehicle).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the vehicular door handle of the present invention includes a one or more touch pads <b>22</b> disposed at the printed circuit board (PCBA) <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the touch pads <b>22</b> with the inner part of the door handle removed, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the touch pads <b>20</b> with the outer part of the door handle removed. The touch pads are disposed along the inner surface of the door handle <b>14</b> (e.g., a paddle or strap door handle) such that a user, when gripping the door handle, contacts one or more of the touch pads <b>22</b> with one or more fingers. When the user contacts one or more of the touch pads <b>22</b>, the PCBA <b>20</b> may generate a signal to control an aspect of the vehicle. For example, the door may lock or unlock. The multiple touch pads <b>22</b> (e.g., instead of a single touch pad) improve response and performance and increase the contact area (e.g., increase the size of the lock and/or unlock area) at which the user makes contact to lock/unlock/open the door.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Optionally, the door handle includes between four and eight touch pads. Each touch pad may, for example, be between 10 mm and 20 mm in length. Smaller pad size reduces the size of the accompanying electric field which helps to prevent unwanted interference/noise and unintentional touch signals.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Gaps <b>24</b> may be provided in between each touch pad <b>22</b> and the gaps may accommodate LEDs <b>17</b> or other components on the PCBA <b>20</b>. The plurality of touch pads <b>22</b> may form a line or &#x201c;string&#x201d; of pads that runs along a majority of the length of the door handle. The plurality of touch pads may be used to detect non-hand contact or touch noise (e.g., precipitation). Some or all of the string may be used to create a large area to control an aspect of the vehicle such as locking or unlocking the one or multiple doors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Optionally, two or more touch pads <b>22</b> may form a group either via physical location (i.e., located near each other) or via software (i.e., logically grouped). The touch pads may form a plurality of groups, with each group including one or more touch pads. Groups of touch pads may be assigned different functionality or sensitivity or otherwise processed differently from each other. Optionally, touch pads disposed at the end of the line or string may processed differently than touch pads located on the interior of the line or string.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the door handle may also include a large touch pad <b>24</b>. The large touch pad may detect a user as they are approaching the door or reaching for the door handle. The large touch pad may thus provide a faster response time than the smaller touch pads <b>22</b>. Optionally, the large touch pad may enter a low power mode when not in use and wake up from the lower power mode when a user is near the vehicle or reaches for the door handle to reduce power consumption. The smaller touch pads or string of touch pads may be powered down or in a low power mode until awakened responsive to the large touch pad determining approach of the user's hand toward the door handle. Optionally, and such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the touch pads <b>24</b> may be larger (i.e., wider) in lieu of the large touch pad <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The door handle may comprise several touch pads (e.g., 2 to 12 pads) of varying length (e.g., each pad may be 10 mm to 75 mm in length). The touch pads need not be limited to defined segmented lengths. Instead, the touch pads may overlap (e.g., on different layers of the PCB) and/or may include pad shapes of various polygons (e.g., rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.). Additionally, the touch pads may include portions that taper up or down towards the next touch pad in the string.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, touch sensors or touch pads implement a touch algorithm to determine when a touch event has occurred (i.e., a user has touched the touch sensor). As illustrated by plot <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), a touch algorithm determines a touch when the sensor output reaches a threshold level <b>31</b> and stops increasing or climbing. That is, such a touch algorithm determines a user has touched the touch sensor when the sensor output reaches and maintains a threshold value. However, plot <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows that a modified algorithm of the present invention allows a tolerance <b>34</b> to be specified to allow the sensor output or signal to continue to increase during a touch event. That is, as long as the signal remains above a first threshold value but below a second threshold value (i.e., within the tolerance), the modified touch algorithm registers a touch event.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> includes a plot <b>36</b> that illustrates that a typical touch algorithm allows an output of the touch sensor to fall any amount as long as the signal remains above a touch recognition zone (TRZ) <b>38</b>. The modified algorithm, however, provides a tolerance <b>42</b> where, when the signal output drops out of the tolerance band, but is still above the TRZ, the modified touch algorithm does not register the signal as a touch event. That is, even when the signal output remains above the TRZ <b>38</b>, when the signal falls below the threshold <b>42</b> before maintaining a level above the TRZ for a threshold amount of time, the modified touch algorithm determines that a touch event did not occur.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a plot <b>42</b> illustrates that the touch algorithm allows for an immediate re-detection of a touch event after a failed touch event. For example, when the signal output exceeds the TRZ <b>38</b>, but then falls below it before a sufficient amount of time has passed, a failed touch event occurred. However, shortly afterward, the signal again surpasses the TRZ and the touch algorithm determines a valid touch event occurred. In contrast, the modified touch algorithm, as shown by plot <b>44</b>, allows for the specification of a delay between detections. That is, after a failed detection, the modified touch algorithm may ignore any potential touch events for a threshold period of time <b>45</b>. The amount of delay may be configurable (e.g., 1 ms, 10 ms, 100 ms, 1000 ms, etc.).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a touch algorithm, as illustrated by plot <b>46</b>, considers any change in signal value as an &#x201c;approach&#x201d; (i.e., the user's hand approaching the sensor) and thus a near instantaneous increase in signal value will still register as a touch event to the touch algorithm. As shown in plot <b>46</b>, the first change in signal value causes the touch algorithm to being touch monitoring, and then a subsequent rapid increase in signal value registers as a touch event despite this change in signal value likely resulting from an error (e.g., noise, interference, etc.). In contrast, the touch algorithm shown in plot <b>48</b> requires a minimum climb threshold <b>49</b> prior to beginning touch monitoring. That is, the modified touch algorithm requires the signal value to ramp to a threshold value before monitoring so that a valid &#x201c;approach&#x201d; phase is ensured. Put another way, the modified touch algorithm may require a threshold rate of change for a threshold period of time prior to beginning touch monitoring.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, optionally, the touch algorithm allows for detection of simultaneous events across multiple sensors (i.e., multiple touch pads <b>22</b>) when the magnitude of each event is different. This allows for filtering of &#x201c;system wide&#x201d; stimuli that may indicate extraneous interference (e.g., water, etc.) instead of an event similar in proportion to the size of a human finger and/or hand. For example, events that simultaneously begin climbing and simultaneously begin leveling off may both be registered as touch events even when the magnitudes of the signal values differ. The difference in magnitudes may be the result of, for example, precipitation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, the door handle assembly of the present invention include a lighting module and one or more touch pads and implements a modified touching algorithm. The modified touching algorithm includes tolerances to more accurately determine touch events that may be associated with, for example, a user approaching or grabbing the door handle with their hand.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lighting module may emit the selected or desired light color or pattern as a steady illumination, and/or may intermittently emit light or blink or flash at various rates depending on the particular event or input or trigger. For example, the lighting module may flash or emit a red light once to indicate the doors have been locked and may flash a red light intermittently to indicate a panic or hazard input or detection of a break in or the like. Optionally, the lighting module may provide fading and dimming of the light to ramp up the lighting intensity at activation and ramp down or fade the lighting intensity at deactivation of the lighting module.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Optionally, the lighting module and door handle assembly may provide various illumination patterns or logos or the like.
