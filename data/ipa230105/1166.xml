Specifically, the present invention relates to a selective guide sheath dilator with multiple stiffness sections.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In today's medical field, many medical procedures require entry into a patient's blood vessel for purposes of accessing a desired site, e.g., angioplasty and stenting. In order to gain access to the desired site, a sheath is usually advanced through the blood vessel. Once in place within the patient's vessel, various types of medical instrumentation can be fed through the sheath and positioned at the desired site so that the procedure may be performed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To initially gain access to a particular site within a patient, a needle is used to puncture the patient's skin and gain entry to a desired blood vessel. A guide wire is then inserted into a lumen in the needle and is fed into the blood vessel. The needle is then removed, with the guide wire being left in place.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A dilator/sheath assembly is then placed over the guide wire and advanced to a position inside the blood vessel. The distal end of the dilator may be tapered to a relatively small diameter and extend beyond the distal end of the sheath. The tapered distal end of the dilator allows the dilator/sheath assembly to be introduced into a patient's vessel in a manner that gradually increases the size of the opening in the vessel so that the vessel can ultimately accommodate the larger sized sheath without causing trauma, injury or other difficulties to the patient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Once the guide wire and the dilator/sheath assembly are advanced within the blood vessel to the desired site, the dilator is removed. The guide wire and sheath are now used to introduce and guide medical instrumentation to the desired site within the blood vessel.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disadvantage of the above system and method is that the dilator typically used as a mechanism for guiding the sheath into a blood vessel is made from a uniform material designed primarily for the initial access. Often the dilator must be replaced with a more flexible, shaped catheter to track the sheath through very torturous anatomy to the desired site in the vessel. A need thus exists for a dilator that has flexibility but retains the rigidity needed for advancement of the sheath assembly.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome the short-comings of the prior art, the dilator of the present invention offers multiple stiffness sections. Specifically, this dilator includes a shaft that has a distal end, a proximal end and at least two stiffness sections. These stiffness sections become less rigid and may taper as they approach the distal end.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The stiffness sections are fused together thereby creating varying stiffness and/or flexibility in the dilator. The dilator further includes a lumen that traverses an interior of the shaft from the proximal end to the distal end as well as a hub that is located on the proximal end of the shaft.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The dilator may also include an atraumatic tip (i.e., a tip that does not cause trauma or damage) that may be connected to the distal end of the shaft. If this tip is used, the tip preferably would be the softest and least rigid section of the shaft.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the dilator has three sections. The preferred lengths for each of these sections are as follows: the first stiffness section may be approximately 25-90 cm, the second stiffness section may be approximately 1-70 cm and the third stiffness section may be approximately 1-70 cm. In most cases, the third stiffness section would start from approximately 15 cm from a distal end of the sheath and extend beyond the distal tip of the sheath.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The dilator may also contain one or more radiopaque markers in the distal area to improve visibility under fluoroscopy and possibly be used for measurement approximations. The dilator may also have a shaped distal end to allow easier vessel selection. Further, the distal end may have apertures located near the tip of the dilator so as to deliver contrast media to a work-destination area.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Each stiffness section is manufactured from different material blends and/or grades. In the preferred embodiments, the material of the stiffness sections are preferably manufactured of polypropylene (PP) and elastomer and may contain sufficient radiopaque filler to allow visibility under fluoroscopy. It is noted that other medical grade materials that retain there shape while being displaced within the vascular system, such as TPE, homopolymers and copolymers, may be used as a substitute for one of the above materials.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the three sections may be manufactured with (1) the first stiffness section being be made from a blend of between 20% and 80% high performance elastomer (TPV) and between 20% and 80% PP impact copolymer (preferably 50% of each), (2) the second stiffness section being be made from a blend of between 20% to 60% high performance elastomer (TPV) and 40% to 80% PP impact copolymer (preferably a 60/40 high performance elastomer (TPV)/PP impact copolymer blend) and (3) the third stiffness section being be made from between 0% to 25% PP impact copolymer and 75% to 100% high performance elastomer (TPV) (preferably 100% high performance elastomer (TPV)).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The dilator is used as part of a sheath assembly. The assembly includes a guide wire, the dilator and a sheath. As explained above, the dilator may have a distal end, a proximal end, a lumen and at least two stiffness sections, the stiffness sections becoming less rigid as they approach the distal end.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The guide wire extends through the lumen of the dilator and is used as a guide for advancing the sheath assembly. In a preferred embodiment, the guide wire is a 0.038&#x2033; diameter stainless steel or nitinol type wire of appropriate length.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The sheath also has a distal end, a proximal end and a lumen. The dilator extends through the lumen of the sheath with the distal end of the dilator extending beyond the distal end of the sheath. The sheath, when used at a femoral access point, is approximately 90 cm in length and connected to a housing provided with a hemostatic valve. A rotatable cap may also be operatively associated with the hemostatic valve for operating the valve upon rotation of the cap.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A method of using the sheath assembly comprises the steps of: inserting a needle into a patient to puncture a patient's skin and gain entry to a desired blood vessel; inserting a guide wire into a lumen in the needle; feeding the guide wire into the blood vessel; removing the needle and leaving the guide wire in place; placing a dilator that is generally coaxially disposed within a sheath over the guide wire, the dilator having a distal end, a proximal end and a lumen, the dilator having at least two stiffness sections, the stiffness sections becoming less rigid as they approach the distal end, the dilator tapering from the proximal end to the distal end; advancing the guide wire, followed by the dilator followed by the sheath through vascular to a specific point; removing the dilator when the specific point is reached; performing a procedure at the specific point using tools that are advanced through the sheath.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The dilator is used to assist in procedures such as angioplasty and stenting by, e.g., accessing the vascular system beyond the aortic arch from a femoral access point or accessing a lower extremity on a patient (an area near and/or below the knee) via a femoral artery. The latter uses the dilator to extend downward from the access point to an area near the knee or to extend above the access point around the iliac arch and down towards near and/or below the knee of the other leg.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Trauma caused by the access is reduced due to the varying stiffnesses of the dilator because the stiffnesses allow the dilator to move easier through the vasculature. When the dilator is removed from the sheath, the sheath retains a uniform rigidity which allows for placement of medical equipment at the distal end of the sheath.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the apparatus and methods of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description and accompanying drawings where:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a prospective view of an unassembled sheath assembly according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a prospective view of a dilator according to a second embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a prospective view of a dilator according to a third embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a prospective view of an assembled sheath assembly according to a first embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i></figref>are side views of a distal end of the dilator having apertures.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention enhances the characteristics of dilators by providing a dilator that has multiple stiffness sections meaning that each section of the dilator has a different durometer hardness. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an unassembled sheath assembly <b>10</b> that includes the dilator <b>30</b> of the present invention as well as a guide wire <b>20</b> and a sheath device <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the guide wire <b>20</b> to first access a blood vessel, an insertion tool known in the art, but not shown, is used. The insertion tool has a puncture needle. The puncture needle punctures an appropriate point in the vascular vessel. The guide wire <b>20</b> is then inserted through the needle and into the vascular vessel. Once inside the vessel, a distal end of the guide wire <b>20</b> is manipulated by a push-pull and turn technique by hand or with a torque device at an operations assembly <b>21</b> located on the proximal end of the guide wire <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To achieve a smooth manipulation when inserting the guide wire <b>20</b> into the vascular vessel, it is required for the guide wire <b>20</b> to have certain multi-mechanical properties. The multi-mechanical properties include flexibility, the ability to remain straight in an unrestricted free state and good restitution when returning from a deformed state.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The guide wire <b>20</b> of this type is also preferred at its distal end portion to have high flexibility properties, while at the same time, preferred at its proximal portion to have functionally gradient rigidity. The distal end should have high maneuverability to properly respond to the manipulation which is to be done at the operations assembly <b>21</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the guide wire <b>20</b> is a 0.038&#x2033; diameter stainless steel or nitinol type wire of appropriate length but any size guide wire may be used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The dilator device <b>30</b> is comprised of an elongated tubular shaft/dilator <b>32</b> and a hub <b>31</b>. The elongated tubular shaft <b>32</b> is used to access a vessel while the hub <b>31</b> is used to interact with the sheath <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The dilator <b>32</b> and the hub <b>31</b> are fixedly secured to one another in a manner that prevents axial and rotational movement of the dilator <b>32</b> relative to the hub <b>31</b>. Both the dilator <b>32</b> and the hub <b>31</b> are provided with a centrally extending lumen, the lumen traversing an interior of the dilator <b>32</b> from a distal end <b>36</b> and a proximal end <b>37</b>, with the lumen's distal end <b>36</b> in the dilator <b>32</b> communicating with the lumen's proximal end <b>37</b> in the hub <b>31</b>. The lumen's proximal end <b>37</b> in the hub <b>31</b> is open at the proximal end of the hub <b>31</b> while the lumen's distal end <b>36</b> in the dilator <b>32</b> opens to the distal end of the dilator <b>32</b>. Thus, the lumen extends completely through the dilator device <b>30</b> and opens to the outside at opposite ends of the dilator device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first embodiment of the dilator device <b>30</b> of the present invention offers multiple stiffness sections <b>32</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. That is, the dilator device <b>30</b> includes a shaft <b>32</b> that has a distal end <b>33</b>, a proximal end <b>34</b> and two stiffness sections <b>32</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. These stiffness sections <b>32</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>become less rigid as they approach the distal end <b>33</b>. In other words, the shaft is the softest at the distal end (approximately 30 shore D to 70 shore D) and transitions to the stiffest section at the proximal end (approximately 50 shore D to 80 shore D). The varying stiffness sections <b>32</b> <i>a</i>-<i>b </i>allow the dilator device <b>30</b> to slightly bend around twisted and bent vasculature, so as the dilator <b>32</b> is advanced and the stiffness is changed, the bent vasculature is straightened. The varying stiffness sections also provide for greater pushability when advancing through the vasculature.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The dilator <b>32</b> may also taper along the length the dilator <b>33</b>. That is, the dilator may taper along the full length of the dilator or the dilator may taper between two specific points along the dilator. For example, the dilator may taper from the proximal end to an approximately the midpoint of the dilator or the dilator may taper from a finite distance from the proximal tip to a finite distance from the distal tip.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dilator may also be provided in a pre-shaped form to allow easier vessel selection. These shapes may include, but are not limited to, straight, angle, angle taper, multipurpose, cobra, simmons, headhunter, mani, JB, hockey stick, LIMA, RDC, vertebral, J-curve and vitek</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The stiffness sections may vary in length based upon application as well as the length of the sheath <b>40</b> to be utilized. In a preferred embodiment, a 90 cm sheath is used which usually results in a dilator <b>32</b> that is at least 95 cm in length. The dilator <b>32</b> has two stiffness sections <b>32</b> <i>a</i>-<i>b </i>with the first stiffness section <b>32</b><i>a </i>being approximately 25-90 cm in length and the second stiffness section <b>32</b><i>b </i>be approximately 1-70 cm in length. Usually, the second stiffness section <b>32</b><i>b </i>starts from approximately 15 cm from a distal end of the sheath <b>40</b> and will extend beyond the distal tip of the sheath <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The material blends of these stiffness sections vary significantly depending on application and length of the dilator. The stiffness sections <b>32</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can be made from a blend of between 0-95% PP impact copolymer and between 5-100% high performance elastomer (TPV). In a preferred embodiment, the first section is about 50/50 high performance elastomer (TPV)/PP impact copolymer blend and the second section is about 20/80 PP impact copolymer/high performance elastomer (TPV) blend. In this embodiment, high performance elastomer (TPV) and PP impact copolymer were used but other polypropylene and elastomer choices can be substituted for the high performance elastomer (TPV)/PP impact copolymer blend. Such choices may include polypropylene and impact polypropylene copolymers, thermoplastic elastomers (e.g., TPO, TPU, TPV, polyester elastomers (Hytrel), polyamide elastomers (PEBAX), and the like), nylon, polyethylene, fluoropolymer (FEP, PFA, ETFE and the like), homopolymers, copolymers, ect.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The dilator may also contain one or more radiopaque markers in the distal area to improve visibility under fluoroscopy and possibly be used for measurement approximations. The radiopaque markers may be formed from bismuth subcarbonate or barium sulfate, as well as additional colorants.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i></figref>, the distal end <b>33</b> of the shaft <b>32</b> may also include straight apertures <b>71</b>-<b>78</b> and/or angled apertures <b>81</b>-<b>86</b> that traverse the dilator tubing wall <b>70</b>, <b>80</b>. These straight and angled apertures <b>71</b>-<b>78</b> and <b>81</b>-<b>86</b> may assist in delivering contrast media to the site where a medical procedure is to be performed by visually enhancing the site in which a practitioner will work as well as aspiration of the work site. The number, angle and size of the apertures will vary depending on the procedure being performed and other varied aspects of the dilator and work site.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The stiffness sections <b>32</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are usually fused/joined together with RF energy or a hot air gun, thereby creating varying stiffness and/or flexibility in the dilator <b>30</b>, although other methods of joining the materials may be used.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the shaft <b>51</b> may have three stiffness sections <b>51</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. The first stiffness section <b>51</b><i>a </i>may be approximately 25-90 cm in length with a durometer of approximately 50 shore D to 80 shore D, the second stiffness section <b>51</b><i>b </i>may be approximately 1-70 cm in length with a durometer of approximately 30 shore D to 70 shore D and the third stiffness section <b>51</b><i>c </i>may be approximately 1-70 cm in length with a durometer of approximately 40 shore A to 40 shore D.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The material blends of these stiffness sections also vary significantly depending on application and length of the dilator. The stiffness sections <b>51</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can also be made from a blend of between 0-95% PP impact copolymer and between 5-100% high performance elastomer (TPV). In a preferred embodiment, the first stiffness section <b>51</b><i>a </i>may be made from an approximate blend of 50% high performance elastomer (TPV) and 50% PP impact copolymer containing approximately 30% Bi<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the second stiffness section <b>51</b><i>b </i>may be made from an approximate blend of 60% PP impact copolymer and 40% high performance elastomer (TPV) containing approximately 30% Bi<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and the third stiffness section <b>51</b><i>c </i>may be made from approximately 100% high performance elastomer (TPV) containing approximately 30% Bi<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a third embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a tip <b>62</b> can be connected to the distal end of the shaft <b>61</b>. The tip would be the softest and least rigid section of the shaft <b>61</b> resulting in an atraumatic tip <b>62</b>. In this embodiment, the tip is attached to a dilator <b>60</b> having three stiffness sections <b>61</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. But the tip may be used in conjunction with a shaft having any number of stiffness sections including a shaft that has a substantially even gradient of stiffness.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The dilators <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> are all used in conjunction with the sheath device <b>40</b>. These dilators <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> are coaxially disposed within a lumen <b>41</b> of the sheath device <b>40</b>. The sheath <b>40</b> is approximately 90 cm long when used with a femoral access point but longer (approximately 120 cm) and shorter (approximately 30 cm) sheaths and dilators may be used when accessing a vessel.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sheath device <b>40</b> includes an elongated tubular sheath <b>42</b>, a hub <b>43</b> and a valve <b>44</b>. The sheath <b>42</b> can be secured to the hub <b>43</b> by way of a fitting provided at the proximal end of the sheath <b>42</b>. The proximal end portion of the hub <b>43</b> is provided with an externally threaded portion (not shown) that may be threadably engaged by internal threads (not shown) on the valve <b>44</b>. The valve <b>44</b> can thus be rotated relative to the hub <b>43</b>, thus rendering the valve removable from the sheath/hub assembly.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The valve <b>44</b> is also preferably provided with an integrally formed branch port <b>45</b> connected to a tubing <b>46</b>. The tubing can <b>46</b> be connected to a three-way stop cock (not shown) to allow fluids to be injected into or withdrawn from the patient during the procedure. For example, the tubing <b>46</b> and the stop cock can be used to sample blood or inject a contrast agent in conjunction with the apertures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>-<i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The elongated sheath <b>42</b> and the hub <b>43</b> together are both provided with a lumen <b>41</b>. The tubing <b>46</b> also communicates with the lumen <b>41</b>. The lumen <b>41</b> opens to the proximal end of the hub <b>43</b> and opens to the distal end of the sheath <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another embodiment for the valve <b>44</b> may be a housing (not shown). The housing may be provided with a hemostatic valve (not shown). The hemostatic valve is in the form of a cylindrical plastic element having a generally centrally located through hole. The hemostatic valve is positioned within a chamber in the housing. The valve has a slit style opening that allows a catheter or other device to be inserted through it and hugs the inserted device to provide hemostatis. The rotatable cap <b>44</b> is operatively associated with the hemostatic valve. That is, by rotating the cap <b>44</b> so that the cap <b>44</b> moves axially with respect to the hub <b>43</b> in a direction towards the elongated sheath <b>42</b>, an internal portion of the cap <b>44</b> engages the cylindrical element forming the hemostatic valve and thus compresses the cylindrical element causing the through hole in the cylindrical member to be closed. Thus, by suitably rotating the cap <b>44</b> on the hub <b>43</b>, the hemostatic valve can be moved between an opened position and a closed position.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The hemostatic valve can also be used to prevent blood loss during a procedure involving use of the sheath assembly <b>40</b> by providing a tight seal around the outer surface of the dilator device <b>30</b>. The hemostatic valve also allows dilators of different sizes and profiles to pass through the hemostatic valve. And the elongated sheath <b>40</b> is adapted to be inserted into the lumen in the valve and then advanced so that the elongated sheath <b>40</b> extends through the lumen in the valve.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, the tapered distal end portion of the dilator device <b>30</b> extends beyond the distal end of the elongated sheath <b>40</b> such that a smooth transition exists between the tapered distal end portion of the dilator <b>30</b> and the distal end portion of the sheath <b>40</b>. It is worthy to note that the majority of the dilator <b>30</b> is stiff to allow support of the sheath <b>40</b> as the sheath <b>40</b> is advanced through vascular system. And when the dilator <b>30</b> is removed from the sheath <b>40</b>, the sheath <b>40</b> retains a substantially uniform and consistent rigidity throughout its length.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the distal end portion of the sheath <b>40</b> can be configured as a formed tip (e.g., having a slightly tapered end) to further facilitate the smooth transition between the tapered distal end portion of the dilator <b>30</b> and the distal end portion of the sheath <b>40</b>. To maintain contact between the sheath <b>40</b> and the dilator <b>30</b>, a retaining device, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,719,772, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, may be used.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">To assemble the guiding sheath assembly <b>10</b>, the elongated dilator <b>30</b> is inserted into the open end of the valve. The elongated dilator <b>30</b> is then advanced so that the elongated dilator <b>30</b> extends through the lumen in the sheath. In an assembled state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the tapered distal end portion of the dilator <b>30</b> extends beyond the distal end of the elongated sheath <b>40</b> such that a smooth transition exists between the tapered distal end portion of the dilator <b>30</b> and the tapered distal end portion of the sheath <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">To use the sheath assembly <b>10</b>, a needle is first used to puncture a patient's skin and gain access to the patient's vessel. This is typically a blood vessel but may be others types of body vessels. Once access to the blood vessel has been gained with the needle, a guide wire <b>20</b> is inserted into the needle and is positioned in the blood vessel. The needle can then be removed. The sheath assembly <b>10</b> is then positioned over the guide wire <b>20</b>, with the guide wire <b>20</b> passing through the lumen in the dilator <b>30</b> and the hub <b>31</b>. In this way, the sheath assembly <b>10</b> can be introduced into the vessel. The guide wire <b>20</b> is then fed to the desired site within the blood vessel. The sheath assembly <b>10</b> is then advanced over the guide wire <b>20</b> to the desired location.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">During introduction of the sheath assembly <b>10</b> into the vessel, the exposed tapered distal end portion of the dilator <b>30</b> allows the size of the opening into the vessel to be gradually increased so that the vessel is ultimately able to accommodate the larger diameter size of the sheath <b>40</b>. In addition, the smooth transition between the tapered distal end portion of the elongated dilator <b>30</b> and the formed distal end portion of the sheath <b>40</b> facilitates a smooth introduction of the distal end portion of the sheath assembly. Further, the varying stiffness sections allow the dilator to slightly bend around twisted and bent vasculature so as the dilator is advanced and the stiffness is changed, the bent vascular is straightened allowing the sheath to be unimpeded during its advancement through the vessel. Another benefit of the varying stiffness is that the stiffness is transitioned smoothly for easier sheath advancement and tracking over the wire.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once the distal end of the elongated sheath <b>40</b> is located at the desired position in the vessel (e.g., by identifying the location of a radiopaque marker embedded within the distal end of the elongated sheath <b>40</b> or dilator device <b>30</b>), the dilator device <b>30</b> comprised of the elongated dilator <b>30</b> and the hub <b>31</b> is axially withdrawn from the sheath assembly. The elongated sheath <b>40</b> and the guide wire <b>20</b> are thus left in place in the blood vessel. The elongated sheath <b>40</b> can then be used, for example, as a guiding sheath or introducer for guiding or introducing various medical instrumentation into the vessel at the desired site.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The main purpose of the dilator device <b>30</b> of the present invention includes but is not limited to accessing the vasculature beyond the aortic arch from a femoral access point and the stiffness sections allowing the dilator <b>30</b> to move easier through the vascular as well as straightening any vasculature that is bent or twisted. An additional application may be accessing a lower extremity on a patient (an area near and/or below the knee) via a femoral artery. The dilator may be used to extend downward from the access point or may extend above the access point around the iliac arch and down towards near and/or below the knee (e.g. the popletiel artery) of the other leg.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">While there has been shown and described what is considered to be preferred embodiments of the invention, it will, of course, be understood that various modifications and changes in form or detail could readily be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be not limited to the exact forms described and illustrated, but should be constructed to cover all modifications that may fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
