Accordingly, processes, elements, and techniques that are not necessary to those having ordinary skill in the art for a complete understanding of the aspects and features of the inventive concept may not be described. Unless otherwise noted, like reference numerals denote like elements throughout the attached drawings and the written description, and thus, descriptions thereof may not be repeated.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the drawings, the thicknesses, ratios, dimensions, and relative sizes of elements, layers, and regions may be exaggerated and/or simplified for clarity.
