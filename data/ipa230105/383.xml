This can happen, for example, if one or more of the electrode elements has a flaw, such as a defect in the dielectric layer of the electrode element or if the hydrogel beneath an electrode element dries out.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The embodiments described herein advantageously provide the ability to detect the condition of the transducer array electrode elements so that good electrical contact with the patient's body can be maintained to improve TTFields treatment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another source of treatment variance is the person's body and its tolerance for long-term treatment. For example, the transducer arrays are positioned on the person's body in order to target a tumor with TTFields, however the person's skin under the transducer arrays can experience changes (e.g., rash, irritation, etc.) as a result of the treatments, or other factors can impact a person's tolerance for the treatment (e.g., underlying skin conditions).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The embodiments described herein advantageously provide the ability to detect the condition of skin on the patient's body and, if necessary, to adjust the treatment characteristics so that the patient is able to better tolerate the treatment.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Some embodiments detect transducer array electrode conditions and/or patient skin conditions by receiving impedance measurements using the same electrodes that are used to deliver TTFields. Embodiments can sequentially apply the AC signal to pairs or groups of electrode elements to receive a plurality of impedance measurements. These impedance measurements can indicate the condition of participating electrode element(s) and/or the condition of the patient's skin that underlies the participating electrode element(s).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Embodiments can include a single system with at least two modes of operations, where a) in a first mode the system delivers TTFields treatment to a patient's body, and b) in a second mode the system measures impedance values that indicate the condition of participating electrode elements and/or the condition of the patient's skin. The same transducer array configuration can implement both modes of operation based on control signals issued by a controller. In an example implementation, at least two transducer arrays are positioned on different sides of a patient's body. In the first mode (e.g., TTFields treatment mode), an AC signal is applied to the positioned transducer arrays to deliver targeted TTFields treatment to the patient. However, the administration of the TTFields treatment may be improved by determining certain conditions, such as the condition of skin under the positioned arrays and/or the condition of the arrays' individual electrode elements. In the second mode, the electrodes of at least one positioned transducer array are used to measure impedance values indicative of the skin conditions and/or electrode conditions. The administration of the TTFields treatment (i.e., the first mode of operation) can be adjusted to optimize results based on the conditions detected in the second mode. For example, electrode integrity can be determined prior to use of a new transducer array, to ensure the integrity of electrodes from a previously used transducer array, and generally to ensure that good electrical contact is maintained for the TTFields treatment. In addition or alternatively, the skin condition can be determined to ensure that the patient's body is tolerating the long term application of TTFields treatment and/or to change characteristics of the treatment to ensure the patient's skin health. Based on detected conditions, treatment characteristics such as transducer array positioning, participating electrodes, AC signal characteristics, and other characteristics can be adjusted to optimize treatment. In some instances, electrode conditions and/or skin conditions may call for a pause of the TTFields treatments, for example to safeguard the health and safety of the patient.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Embodiments can measure the impedance values using a variety of techniques. For example, in a first technique at least one first electrode of a first polarity is positioned proximate to at least one second electrode of a second polarity such that the first and second electrodes are directly coupled (e.g., by the subject's body). An AC signal is then applied between the positioned first and second electrodes and the impedance is measured. In a second technique, at least one first electrode of a first polarity is positioned on a first side of a subject's body and at least one second electrode of a second polarity is positioned on a second side of the subject's body such that the first and second electrodes are capacitively coupled. An AC signal is then applied between the positioned first and second electrodes and the impedance is measured.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Some embodiments that measure impedance using the first technique or second technique have an individual conductor for each of the plurality of electrode elements in each of the transducer arrays. Unlike the prior art configuration, in which all of the electrode elements E in each of the transducer arrays <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> are wired in parallel, the individual conductor per electrode element makes it possible to independently switch the current on and off for any given individual electrode element in any one of the arrays. For example, in either the first technique or the second technique, embodiments can sequentially apply an AC signal between different pairs or groups of electrode elements, and this can be achieved by the ability to independently switch the current on and off to individual electrode elements.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a first embodiment of a transducer array <b>50</b> that provides an individual conductor for each individual electrode element <b>52</b>.

An example of suitable hardware and procedures that incorporate thermistors is described in U.S. application Ser.

And in the illustrated embodiment, there is only a single second pin, labeled C, which is provided for making temperature measurements.

Embodiments use transducer arrays <b>50</b> positioned on different sides of a patient's body to induce an electric field through the patient's body. For example, in a first mode of operation the transducer arrays can deliver TTFields treatment (e.g., using a target frequency between 100 and 500 kHz). In a second mode of operation the transducer arrays can induce an electric field through the patient's body using a lower frequency (e.g., below 20 kHz), and impedance measurements can be taken to detect a) conditions of the transducer arrays' electrode elements and/or b) conditions of the patient's skin.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of a system that uses four copies of the transducer array <b>50</b> (described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to a) apply TTFields to a subject; and b) take impedance measurements.

But it is expected that practical systems will have a larger number (e.g., between 9 and 30) of electrode elements, and will also have a larger number of certain other components (e.g., switches, conductors, etc.), depending on the number of electrode elements <b>52</b> that are actually used in each of the transducer arrays <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> system can measure impedances to AC signals applied between pairs or among groups of electrode elements <b>52</b>. For example, controller <b>34</b> can apply AC signals to any of transducer array <b>50</b>L's electrode elements <b>52</b> by controlling the electronically-controlled switches in switch bank <b>1</b>L (which may be implemented using bidirectional analog switches) to energize one or more of the electrode elements in turn. Similarly, controller <b>34</b> can apply AC signals to any of transducer array <b>50</b>R's electrode elements <b>52</b> by controlling the electronically-controlled switches in switch bank <b>1</b>R to energize one or more of the electrode elements in turn. In some embodiments, controller <b>34</b> can apply an AC signal to pairs or groups of electrode elements <b>52</b> positioned on two sides of the subject's body, such as by issuing control signals that electronically control switch banks <b>1</b>L and <b>1</b>R.

In the first mode of operation the electrode elements can deliver TTFields treatment (e.g., using a target frequency between 100 and 500 kHz) while in the second mode of operation the electrode elements can induce an electric field through the patient's body using a lower frequency (e.g., below 20 kHz) such that impedance measurements can be taken. The impedances measurements are used to detect a) conditions of the transducer arrays' electrode elements and/or b) conditions of the patient's skin. The administration of the TTFields treatment (i.e., the first mode of operation) can be adjusted to optimize results given the detected conditions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In both the first mode of operation (e.g., TTFields treatment mode) and the second mode of operation (e.g., impedance measurement mode), an electric field can be induced between the electrode elements positioned on the first side and the second side of the subject's body, however in the first mode the AC signal has a frequency range between 100 and 500 kHz (e.g., TTFields are administered) and in the second mode, the AC signal has a frequency below 20 kHz. The frequency range for the first mode of operation induces TTFields in the subject's body, while the frequency for the second mode of operation is selected so that impedance can be effectively measured. Using the lower frequency for the second mode of operation improves the quality of the electrode element integrity and/or skin condition measurements because it increases the impedances of capacitive portions of the circuit without increasing the impedances of any resistive portions of the circuit. It therefore pulls the desired signal (i.e., the contribution from the capacitive elements) up out of the background noise (i.e., the contribution from the resistive elements).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, during the second mode of operation, controller <b>34</b> can issue control signals that change the state of switch banks <b>1</b>L and <b>1</b>R to sequentially apply an AC signal between different pairs and/or among different groups of left and right electrode elements <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">One approach for obtaining an impedance measurement that corresponds to each of the electrode elements in the transducer arrays <b>50</b>L and <b>50</b>R is as follows: (a) close all switches in bank <b>1</b>L, close only switch <b>1</b> in bank <b>1</b>R, and take one impedance measurement; (b) leave all the switches in bank <b>1</b>L closed, open switch <b>1</b> in bank <b>1</b>R, close switch <b>2</b> in bank <b>1</b>R, then take another impedance measurement; (c) continue this process by stepping through each of the switches in bank <b>1</b>R individually until an impedance measurement is obtained for each of the electrode elements in transducer array <b>50</b>R; (d) close all switches in bank <b>1</b>R, close only switch <b>1</b> in bank <b>1</b>L, and take one impedance measurement; (e) leave all the switches in bank <b>1</b>R closed, open switch <b>1</b> in bank <b>1</b>L, close switch <b>2</b> in bank <b>1</b>L, then take another impedance measurement; and (f) continue this process by stepping through each of the switches in bank <b>1</b>L individually until an impedance measurement is obtained for each of the electrode elements in transducer array <b>50</b>L.

In some embodiments, the comparing comprises comparing the measured impedances to a constant.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">At step <b>716</b>, a condition of the region of skin is determined based on the comparison. For example, it can be determined that the region of skin is in a first condition when the stored impedance values fall within an acceptable range of the criteria or meet a threshold of the criteria, and that the region of skin is in a second condition when the stored impedance values are outside of the acceptable range of the criteria or fail to meet (e.g., greater than or less than) the threshold of the criteria. In another embodiment, it can be determined that the region of skin is in a first condition when a delta between the stored impedance values and the historic impedance values or a metric based on the historic impedance values is less than or equal to a threshold delta, and that the region of skin is in a second condition when the delta between the stored impedance values and the historic impedance values or a metric based on the historic impedance values is greater than the threshold delta.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In these examples, the first condition can indicate generally healthy skin and the second condition can indicate damaged skin. Optionally, if the condition of the region of skin meets a criteria, the method can continue at step <b>718</b>, where a majority of the first electrode elements are used to induce an electric field through the subject's body. For example, when the impedance comparisons indicate that the region of skin is in the first condition, the criteria is met and a second AC signal is applied to a majority of the first electrode elements and to a majority of the second electrode elements to induce an electric field through the subject's body (e.g., to administer TTFields to the subject). For example, the second AC signal can have a frequency between 100 and 500 kHz.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Based on the determined condition for the region of skin, the application of TTFields can be adjusted. For example, the current at any given electrode element positioned at the damaged skin can be reduced when applying the TTFields, or the TTFields therapy can be paused for a period of time so that the damaged skin can heal. Other suitable characteristics of the TTFields treatment can be adjusted based on the determined condition of the region of skin.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart of one example for detecting electrode element integrity using electrode elements positioned on two sides of a body.

For example, at least four first electrode elements can be positioned on a first side of a body and at least four second electrode elements can be positioned on a second side of the body. The first electrode elements are positioned so that each of the first electrode elements is coupled to a respective region of skin on the body. Similarly, the second electrode elements are positioned so that each of the second electrode elements is coupled to a respective region of skin on the body. In some embodiments, the first electrode elements are part of an array (e.g., transducer array <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>); and, in some embodiments, the second electrode elements are also part of an array.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">At step <b>804</b>, control signals are issued that select a subset of the first and second electrode elements. For example, a controller (e.g., controller <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) issues control signals to configure switches (e.g., switch banks <b>1</b>L and <b>1</b>R of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) so that an electrically conductive path is formed from an AC signal generator to the selected pair or group of electrode elements. In embodiments, the subset comprises one or more of the first electrode elements and one or more of the second electrode elements.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">At step <b>806</b>, a low frequency AC signal is applied to the selected subset (e.g., pair) of electrode elements. For example, the AC signal can have a frequency below 20 kHz. The applied AC signal causes an electric field to be induced through the body by the first electrode elements and second electrode elements that comprise the selected subset of electrode elements. At step <b>808</b>, during the application of the AC signal to the selected subset (pair), an impedance is measured and stored.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">At step <b>810</b> it is determined whether more measurements are required. For example, it may be determined whether all subsets from a set of subsets of electrode elements has had an impedance measurement taken, whether any additional subsets of first electrode elements and second electrodes elements is eligible for measurement, whether a threshold number of impedance measurements have been taken, or any other suitable criteria. When more measurements are required, the flowchart progresses along a loop to step <b>812</b>.

From step <b>812</b> the flowchart loops back to steps <b>806</b> and <b>808</b>, where the AC signal is applied to the new subset of electrode elements and during this application impedance measurements are taken and stored.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> loops through steps <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, and <b>812</b> until more measurements are not required at step <b>810</b>. Once this loop break condition is achieved, the flowchart progresses to step <b>814</b>, where a condition of one or more of the electrode elements is determined based on a comparison of the stored impedances with an impedance criteria. For example, an impedance criteria can be a range of values or a threshold value, and the stored impedance values can be compared to this threshold or range. Stored impedance values can be associated with the individual electrode elements that were selected (e.g., switched on) when the measurement was taken. The condition for these individual electrode elements can be determined by comparing their associated impedance value(s) to the impedance criteria. In some embodiments, the impedances can be compared to previously stored impedance values (e.g., historic values measured over time for multiple electrode elements or historic values measured over time for an individual electrode element), or a metric calculated based on these historic values. In some embodiments, the comparing comprises comparing the measured impedances to a constant.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">At step <b>816</b>, a condition of electrode elements is determined based on the comparisons.

In another embodiment, it can be determined that the given electrode element is in a first condition when a delta between the stored impedance value(s) associated with the given electrode and historic impedance values or a metric based on the historic impedance values is less than or equal to a threshold delta, and that the given electrode element is in a second condition when the delta between the stored impedance value(s) associated with the given electrode and historic impedance values or a metric based on the historic impedance values is greater than the threshold delta.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In these examples, the first condition can indicate an operable condition for the given electrode element while the second condition can indicate a flawed condition for the given electrode element.

For example, when the impedance comparisons indicate that the one or more electrode elements (e.g., a majority of the electrode elements) are in the first condition, the criteria is met and a second AC signal is applied to a majority of the first electrode elements and to a majority of the second electrode elements to induce an electric field through the body (e.g., to administer TTFields to the body).

This, in turn, can advantageously reduce or eliminate the decrease in strength of the electric field at the tumor. For example, the controller <b>34</b> can be programmed to alternately switch the current on and off for individual electrode elements during TTFields treatment without affecting the current that passes through the remaining electrode elements. In some embodiments, the controller <b>34</b> may be configured to increase the current through the remaining electrode elements in order to compensate for the reduction in current through a single electrode element during TTFields treatment.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">One can differentiate between an improper set-up for the transducer arrays due to a defective electrode (such as a defect in the dielectric layer of the electrode element, or if the hydrogel beneath an electrode element dries out) as opposed to a skin defect because all impedance measurements that include the defective electrode will register as similarly falling outside of the threshold of the impedance criteria, and repositioning the array will not correct the unacceptable impedance measurements. On the other hand, an improper set-up for the transducer arrays due to a skin defect will likely show variance, especially when the array is relocated to different positions since the skin will not be defective in all locations, or at least will be variably defective.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a circuit that is suitable for implementing each of the switches in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref> embodiments described above, as well as the corresponding switches or banks of switches for the anterior and posterior channels (not shown).
