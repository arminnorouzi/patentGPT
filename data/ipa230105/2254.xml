invention relates to systems and methods for cleaning materials, such as flooring and upholstery. In some cases, the systems and methods use an electrolytic cell to electrolyze a solution comprising sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium acetate, sodium percarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, and/or any other suitable chemical to generate electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water. In some cases, the cell comprises a recirculation loop that recirculates anolyte through an anode compartment of the cell.

Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems and methods for cleaning materials and surfaces, such as flooring, furniture, drapery, upholstery, and any other suitable materials and surfaces. In particular, some implementations of the present invention relate to systems and methods for using an electrolytic cell to generate electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water by electrolyzing a solution comprising sodium carbonate, soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, washing soda, soda crystals, crystal carbonate, sodium acetate, sodium percarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and/or any other suitable salt and/or other electrolyte (e.g., any suitable electrolyte comprising one or more alkali ions). In some cases, the cell comprises a recirculation loop that recirculates anolyte through an anode compartment of the cell. In some cases, the cell further comprises a senor and/or a processor, where the processor is configured to automatically change an operation of the cell, based on a reading from the sensor. In some cases, a fluid flows past a magnet before entering the cell. In some additional cases, fluid from the cell is conditioned by being split into multiple conduits that run in proximity to each other. While the electrolyzed alkaline and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water can be used for any suitable purpose, in some implementations, they are used to clean and/or disinfect carpets, rugs, tile, stone, linoleum, flooring surfaces, furniture, walls, drywall, plaster, countertops, blinds, appliances, woods, metals, vehicles, upholstery, drapes, fabrics, clothing, cloth, bedding, beds, laminates, surfaces which are touched by humans (e.g., door knobs, handrails, chairs, tables, light switches, remote controls, windows, etc.), wounds, and/or any other suitable surface, object, or material.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background and Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0003">In accordance with many conventional carpet cleaning techniques, one or more soaps and/or detergents are applied to a carpet, either alone or with water and/or steam. In some cases, the soaps and/or detergents are then agitated into the carpet to allow them to act as emulsifiers; to form micelles around oils, grease, dirt, and other debris; and/or to otherwise capture and/or loosen up debris in the carpets. In some cases, the carpet is then rinsed and/or vacuumed to remove the soaps, detergents, water, and/or debris from the carpets.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">While such carpet cleaning techniques can be quite effective at cleaning carpets, such techniques are not necessarily without their shortcomings. Indeed, in some such techniques, it can often be very difficult to remove all of the soaps and/or detergents from the carpet. In some such cases, as soap and/or detergents are left in the carpet, such cleaning agents continue to capture dirt, oil, and/or other debris. As result, carpets that still contain soap and/or detergent residue after being cleaned can actually become and look dirtier faster than similar carpets that are free from soap and/or detergent residue. As an additional shortcoming, some conventional carpet cleaning techniques employ soaps and/or detergents that are, in and of themselves, somewhat ineffective at removing stains and other debris from carpets. As a result, much effort can be spent in attempting to clean a carpet with such soaps and/or detergents, without the carpet ever truly becoming clean.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Thus, while techniques currently exist that are used to clean carpets and other materials, challenges still exist, including those listed above. Accordingly, it would be an improvement in the art to augment or even replace current techniques with other techniques.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The present invention relates to systems and methods for cleaning materials and surfaces, such as flooring, furniture, drapery, upholstery, and any other suitable materials and surfaces. In particular, some implementations of the present invention relate to systems and methods for using an electrolytic cell to generate electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water by electrolyzing a solution comprising sodium carbonate, soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, washing soda, soda crystals, crystal carbonate, sodium acetate, sodium percarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and/or any other suitable salt and/or other electrolyte (e.g., any suitable electrolyte comprising one or more alkali ions). In some cases, the cell comprises a recirculation loop that recirculates anolyte through an anode compartment of the cell. In some cases, the cell further comprises a senor and/or a processor, where the processor is configured to automatically change an operation of the cell, based on a reading from the sensor. In some cases, a fluid flows past a magnet before entering the cell. In some additional cases, fluid from the cell is conditioned by being split into multiple conduits that run in proximity to each other. While the electrolyzed alkaline and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water can be used for any suitable purpose, in some implementations, they are used to clean and/or disinfect carpets, rugs, tile, stone, linoleum, flooring surfaces, furniture, walls, drywall, plaster, countertops, blinds, appliances, woods, metals, vehicles, upholstery, drapes, fabrics, clothing, cloth, bedding, beds, laminates, surfaces which are touched by humans (e.g., door knobs, handrails, chairs, tables, light switches, remote controls, windows, etc.), wounds, and/or any other suitable surface, object, or material</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">While the described systems can comprise any suitable component, in some implementations, the described system includes a water source, an electrolyte, an electrolytic cell, one or more pieces of cleaning equipment (e.g., one or more sprayers, heaters, wands, carpet agitators, suction devices, pieces of tubing, pieces of hosing, reservoirs, counter rotating brush devices, water softeners, and/or any other suitable piece of cleaning equipment), water conditioners, magnets, modified electrolyzed waters, wipes and/or other cleaning implements comprising an electrolyzed water, and/or any other suitable element or feature.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">With respect to the water source, the water source can comprise any suitable water source, including, without limitation, potable water, non-potable water, reverse osmosis water, deionized water, distilled water, water from a tank, water from a tap, softened water (i.e., water that has been treated with a salt-based ion exchange water softener, a salt-free water softener, a dual-tank water softener, a magnetic water softener or descaler, and/or any other water softener), and/or any other suitable type of water from any other suitable water source.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">With regards to the electrolyte source, the electrolyte can comprise any suitable electrolyte, including, without limitation, sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), soda ash, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), potash, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate, and/or any other suitable electrolyte (e.g., any suitable electrolyte comprising sodium, potassium, and/or lithium). In some implementations, however, the electrolyte comprises sodium carbonate and/or sodium bicarbonate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">In some cases, prior to (and/or during) electrolysis, the electrolyte is added to water at any suitable concentration that allows the resultant electrolyte solution to be electrolyzed to form electrolyzed oxidizing water (acidic) and/or electrolyzed alkaline water (basic). In some implementations, the electrolyte (e.g., sodium carbonate and/or any other suitable electrolyte) is added to water at a concentration of between about 0.1% and about 60% by weight (or within any subrange thereof). Indeed, in some implementations, the electrolyte (e.g., sodium carbonate) is added to water at a concentration of between about 10% and about 30% by weight (e.g., at a concentration of about 20%&#xb1;5%).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">With regards to the electrolytic cell, the electrolyte (and its resultant electrolyte solution or solutions) can be electrolyzed in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, by being added to and/or being electrolyzed in an anode compartment and/or a cathode compartment of an electrolytic cell. Indeed, in some implementations, an electrolyte solution is added to both the anode compartment and the cathode compartment. In some other implementations, however, the electrolyte solution is added to the anode compartment, while water (and/or any other suitable material) is added to the cathode compartment, with the two compartments being separated by an ion permeable membrane (e.g., an alkali ion permeable membrane). In some such implementations, as the electrolytic cell is operated, sodium ions (and/or any other suitable alkali cations) from the electrolyzed electrolyte in the anode compartment (or the anolyte) are transferred through the membrane to combine with hydroxide ions in the solution in the cathode compartment (or the catholyte) to form sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (or electrolyzed alkaline water), which can then be used as a cleaning agent. Indeed, in some such implementations, the electrolyte in the anode compartment (or the anolyte) is selectively recycled through the anode compartment, released for use as a sanitizing agent, and/or otherwise used or discarded. In some cases, however, the anolyte is recycled through the anode compartment such that the described system can selectively produce a relatively large amount of cleaning solution (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water) from the cathode compartment, while producing relatively little solution from the anode compartment (e.g., electrolyzed oxidizing water). Thus, in some cases, the described system can significantly reduce water consumption, without necessarily reducing the amount of electrolyzed alkaline water that it produces.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">In some implementations, the described electrolytic cell comprises one or more sensors, control units, and/or processors that are used to gather information regarding cell operation and to vary the cell's operation based on the gathered data. In this regard, the cell can comprise (and/or otherwise be associated with) any suitable type of sensor, including, without limitation, one or more pH sensors, pressure sensors, flowrate sensors, conductivity sensors, current sensors, amperage sensors, voltage sensors, thermometers, oxidation-reduction potential (&#x201c;ORP&#x201d;) sensors, water quality sensors, magnesium and/or calcium sensors, electrolyte concentration sensors, and/or any other suitable sensor or sensors that can be used to gather information on the cell and/or its operation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">Indeed, in some implementations, the cell comprises one or more conductivity sensors amperage sensors, concentration sensors, and/or flowrate sensors. In some such implementations, when the cell determines that conductivity of the electrolyte solution in the cell (e.g., in the anode compartment, the cathode compartment, an anolyte recirculation line, a storage tank, a fluid outlet, and/or any other suitable portion of the system) is below a desired threshold (e.g., because the solution does not have enough electrolyte, the amperage is too low, and/or for any other suitable reason), the cell (e.g., via one or more variable amperage power supplies, variable speed pumps, valves, dosing mechanisms, and/or any other suitable component) is configured to: increase the operating amperage of the electrodes (e.g., via the variable amperage power supply, to increase ion formation); slow the flowrate of electrolyte solution through the cell (e.g., through the anode compartment and/or any other suitable portion of the cell, so as to give the electrolyte more time to react and/or ionize); stabilize fluid pressures between the two flow channels (e.g., compartments)in the cell to allow the electrolyte to ionize and/or otherwise react more efficiently and maintain separation of the polarity of the ionic solutions; have more electrolyte introduced (e.g., into the anode compartment and/or the cathode compartment, as applicable) through the use of one or more pumps, variable pumps, valves, variable valves, droppers, dosing mechanisms, and/or any other suitable mechanism; and/or to otherwise vary operation of the cell to compensate for (and/or to otherwise attempt to correct) the low conductivity measurement.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">In some cases, when one or more sensors determine that: the conductivity level of the electrolyte solution going through the cell (e.g., in the anode compartment, the cathode compartment, an anolyte recirculation line, a storage tank, a fluid outlet, and/or any other suitable portion of the system) is above a desired level; amperage is in the cell is too high; a flowrate is too low; an electrolyte concentration in the cell is too high; and/or that another parameter of the cell's operation is outside of a set ranges, some implementations of the cell are configured to: decrease the operating amperage of the electrodes (e.g., via a variable amperage power supply and/or in any other suitable manner to decrease ion formation); increase the flowrate of electrolyte solution through the cell (e.g., through the anode compartment and/or any other suitable portion of the cell, so as to give the electrolyte the optimal time and opportunity to ionize and/or otherwise react); increase flowrate through either side of the cell to maintain equal internal cell fluid pressure in the cell to reduce cross mixing between the catholyte and anolyte (and/or to perform any other suitable purpose); stop or have less electrolyte introduced (e.g., into the anode compartment and/or the cathode compartment) through the use of one or more pumps, variable pumps, valves, variable valves, droppers, dosing mechanisms, and/or any other suitable mechanism; and/or to otherwise vary operation of the cell to compensate for (and/or to otherwise attempt to correct) the high and/or other undesirable conductivity measurement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">In still other implementations, the cell is configured to (in near real time or otherwise): monitor amperage with the anode compartment and/or the cathode compartment and to automatically raise, lower, and/or to otherwise vary such amperage; monitor pressure within the anode compartment and/or the cathode compartment and to raise, lower, and/or to otherwise vary such pressure (e.g., by modifying variable pump speed, by varying a valve opening, by controlling a dropper and/or other electrolyte delivery device, and/or in any other suitable manner) to keep pressure within the cell at desired levels; monitor pH within the cell and to vary electrolyte levels, amperage, flowrates, introduction of a base and/or acid, and/or to otherwise modify cell operation to maintain a desired pH level in one or more portions of the cell; monitor flowrate and to increase, decrease, and/or otherwise vary flowrate to keep flowrate in the cell within a desired range; monitor temperature and to heat, cool, introduce cool fluid into, introduce hot fluid into, and/or to otherwise control temperature within the cell; monitor ORP of one or more solutions produced within the cell (e.g., the electrolyzed alkaline and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water) and to change cell operating amperage, increase and/or decrease an amount of electrolyte that is added to the cell, vary a flowrate of the electrolyte solution through the cell, and/or to otherwise vary cell operation; monitor electrolyte concentration in the anode compartment, the cathode compartment, and/or any other suitable portion of the system and to vary such concentration (e.g., via introduction of additional electrolyte through a dosing mechanism, a feeder, a valve, and/or in any other suitable manner; introduction of water and/or any other suitable diluent through a dosing mechanism, a feeder, a valve, and/or any in other suitable manner); and/or to otherwise monitor one or more characteristics of the cell and/or its contents and to vary cell operation and/or such contents based on the monitored readings.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Thus, in some implementations, the described electrolytic cell is configured to provide high-quality cleaning reagents under a wide variety of circumstances. For instance, some implementations of the cell are configured to automatically (and/or otherwise) modify cell operating conditions to account for: influent water with different characteristics (e.g., mineral content, temperature, pH, conductivity, and/or any other suitable characteristics); differing humidity levels, air pressures, temperatures, vibration levels, and/or other characteristics in places of the cell's operation; and/or any other suitable characteristic that can affect the cell's function and the quality of the product or products it produces.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Although in some cases, the cell is configured to provide information about its operating conditions to one or more users (e.g., via a display; lights; audible sounds; visual communications; wireless communications to a phone, tablet, computer, and/or any other suitable device; and/or in any other suitable manner), in some other cases, the system is configured to automatically and/or dynamically make adjustments to its operation parameters to produce desired products with desired characteristics. In some cases, the system is also configured to receive input regarding a desired product and to then automatically vary its operating parameters to produce the desired product. For instance, when a user indicates that a user would like an electrolyzed alkaline water and/or an electrolyzed oxidizing water to have a desired pH (or a pH in a desired range), the cell is configured to automatically modify its operating parameters (e.g., amperage, electrolyte dosing, electrolyte solution flowrate, and/or any other suitable parameter) to produce the desired product.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Some implementations of the described electrolytic cells are configured to automatically adjust their operating parameters to produce one or more products (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water, electrolyzed oxidizing water, bleach, and/or any other suitable product) to have a wide range of characteristics. Indeed, in some cases, the described cells are configured to be able to automatically and selectively use one stream of feed water to produce electrolyzed alkaline waters (and/or electrolyzed oxidizing waters) having pHs that vary by more than about 0.25, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more pH units. In some cases, the described cells are configured to be able to automatically and selectively use one stream of feed water to produce electrolyzed alkaline waters (and/or electrolyzed oxidizing waters) having pHs that vary by more than 3 pH units (e.g., by more than 3.5 pH units).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">The electrolytic cell can be any suitable size and can be configured to be used in any suitable location. Indeed, in some embodiments, the cell is configured to: fit within a vehicle (e.g., a van, truck, car, bus, tractor, forklift, trailer, and/or any other suitable vehicle), be placed on a skid, be worn as a backpack, roll around on a cart or with wheels, be located in one location and be used to fill containers with cleaning agents that are taken to various locations for use, and/or to be used in any other suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">Although in some implementations, the cathode compartment and the anode compartment are separated by one or more membranes, in some other implementations, the cell lacks a membrane between the two compartments. While such a cell can function in any suitable manner, in some cases, the cell is configured to move anolyte and catholyte past the corresponding electrodes at a relatively high rate of speed (e.g., at a rate that is variable based on: a strength of the solution or solutions being produced by the cell, the amperage of the cell, and/or any other suitable feature). Additionally, in some such embodiments, the cell comprises one or more spacer frames that are at least partially disposed between the anode and cathode compartments. In some such embodiments, the spacer frames comprise one or more channels and/or other topographic features that are configured to help mix and direct electrolytes past the corresponding electrodes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">Indeed, in accordance with some implementations, the electrolytic cell comprises an anode compartment comprising an anode; a cathode compartment comprising a cathode; a first spacer that is disposed between the anode compartment and the cathode compartment; a fluid inlet that is configured to channel an electrolyte solution to both the anode compartment and the cathode compartment; and a fluid outlet that is configured to combine and channel product from both the anode compartment and the cathode compartment. In some such implementations, the cell lacks an ion selective membrane that is disposed between the anode and cathode compartments. In some such cases, however, the anode and cathode compartments are at least partially separated by the spacer. Additionally, in some cases, the cell comprises a single fluid inlet, at one end of the cell, and a single fluid outlet, at an opposite side of the cell. Thus, in some embodiments, fluid (e.g., an electrolyte solution) flows through the inlet, into the cell, and into the two compartments, with the spacer serving (in some cases) to direct the fluid into the two compartments and/or across the corresponding electrode.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">In some implementations, the cell is configured in such a manner that gas bubbles are configured to be removed from the anode and/or cathode to increase the effectiveness of such electrodes. In this regard, such gas bubbles can be removed in any suitable manner. Indeed, in some cases, the cell comprises one or more spacer frames that contact and/or that are otherwise in close proximity to a corresponding electrode, with the spacer frames each comprising a topography (e.g., raised features, lowered features, holes, channels, pores, and/or other topographical features) that is configured to churn and otherwise mix such fluids and to direct such fluids across the electrodes to help force gas bubbles off the electrodes and/or to constantly expose new portions of such fluids to the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">In some additional cases, the electrodes are directly in the flow path of the electrolyte solution into the anolyte and/or catholyte compartments. For instance, in some cases, one or more fluid inlets to the cell are disposed at a bottom end of the cell and one or more fluid outlets from the cell are disposed at a top of the cell. In some such cases, as fluids flow from the bottom end to the top end of the cell, the fluids help push gas bubbles off of the electrodes. In some cases, to further help off gassing from the electrodes and/or to ensure that most (if not all of the fluid is exposed to a surface of one of the electrodes, one or more electrodes is disposed directly in the flow path of one or more fluid inlets and/or outlets to the cell. As gas bubbles on the electrodes can (in some cases) make the electrodes less effective at forming ions, some embodiments of the described cell are configured to increase electrode productivity by aiding in cell off gassing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">In accordance with some implementations, the cell is further used with one or more sensors that are configured to determine a quality of water (and/or electrolyte solution) that is being added to the cell. In this regard, such sensors can identify magnesium, calcium, and/or other mineral levels; debris; bacteria; pathogens; and/or other undesirable materials in the water. In some such cases, the system is further configured such that when the sensors determine that influent's quality falls outside of one or more set parameters, the system is configured to stop the flow of water and/or the electrolyte solution into the cell (e.g., by closing a valve, diverting the fluids from flowing into the cell, and/or in any other suitable manner) and/or to stop the cell from functioning (e.g., by stopping or reducing the charge that is passed between the electrodes and/or in any other suitable manner). Thus, in some implementations, the described systems and methods are configured to prevent low quality water and/or electrolyte solution from causing undue damage to the electrodes (e.g., via scaling, pitting, etc.).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">In some implementations, the described systems and methods comprise a wand (which can be used with the described systems and methods and/or with any other suitable systems and methods). In this regard, the described wand can comprise any suitable component or characteristic that allows it to be used to clean flooring (and/or any other suitable surface). Indeed, in some implementations, the wand includes a wand head and a vacuum tube.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">With respect to the wand head, the wand head can comprise any suitable component that allows it to apply a fluid (e.g., electrolyzed water and/or any other suitable fluid) to a flooring surface and that allows the fluid to be sucked from the surface. Indeed, in some implementations, the wand head comprises a shroud that houses at least a portion of one or more jets, jet streams, and/or vacuum ports. While the jets and vacuum ports can be disposed in any suitable location, in at least some cases, the jets are disposed behind the vacuum port (e.g., closer to a user), such that the wand is configured to spray fluids and to suck up such fluids as the wand is pulled towards the user.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Additionally, in some cases, one or more of the vacuum ports include a breaker bar that is recessed within the shroud such that a portion of the shroud extends down past the breaker bar. Thus, in at least some implementations, the shroud is configured to form at least a partial seal with the flooring surface on which the shroud rests, and the shroud allows water and/or a cleaning agent that is sprayed from the jets to contact the flooring and to flow past the breaker bar and into the vacuum port.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In some implementations, the breaker bar's position is optionally adjustable within the shroud such that the breaker bar can be adjusted for flooring of a variety of textures and/or for any other suitable purpose. In such implementations, the breaker bar can be adjusted in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, via one or more threaded fasteners that are configured to be selectively tightened and loosened to respectively lock and release the breaker bar to and from a desired location.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In some implementations, the wand head comprises one or more air inlets that are configured to allow air to enter into the shroud when the shroud is forming a seal (or at least a partial seal) with a flooring surface (and/or any other suitable surface). While such inlets can perform any suitable function, in some embodiments, the inlets are sized, shaped, and placed to allow air to flow into the inlets to improve a spray pattern of the jets. Additionally, in some cases, the air inlets allow air to flow through the air inlets, across a surface being cleaned, then up into the vacuum tube while the shroud head is forming a seal with a surface that is being cleaned. As a result, in some such embodiments, the inlets allow the wand to provide high level of suction when the bottom surface of the shroud is in contact with a surface that is being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In some implementations, the wand head is optionally coupled to one or more rollers that are configured to facilitate movement of the wand head across flooring and/or any other suitable surface. In such implementations, the roller is optionally adjustable such that the roller can be raised or lowered on the wand head to allow the wand to be adjusted for users of various heights while still allowing the shroud and/or wand head to make a partial (and/or complete) seal with the flooring (or other surface) that is being cleaned. As an additional feature, in some implementations, the roller (and/or a plurality of rollers coupled side to side) extends across a substantial width of the wand head. While such a roller (or rollers) can perform any suitable function, in some cases, they act to lay down a portion of carpet and/or other material that is being cleaned such that a larger portion of the strands of carpet (or other material) can be exposed to the spray and/or vacuum forces provided through the wand head.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">With respect to the vacuum tube, the vacuum tube can comprise any suitable component or characteristic that allows a user to use the vacuum tube to direct the wand head and to allow liquids and/or debris sucked from the surface being cleaned to pass through the tube to a container, drain, and/or any other suitable depository.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In some implementations, the vacuum tube is shaped such that a user can easily slide the wand head across flooring (e.g., back and forth, side to side, and/or in any other suitable manner). In some implementations, however, the vacuum tube includes a first section that couples to the wand head, a second section that is configured to couple with a vacuum (e.g., via a hose or otherwise), and/or a third, elongated section that is disposed between the first section and the second section. Although, in some cases, the various sections are discrete sections that are joined together (e.g., via frictional engagement, mechanical engagement, threaded engagement, and/or in any other suitable manner), in other cases, the various sections are integrally formed together as a monolithic piece. In any case, while the various sections of the vacuum tube can have any suitable relation with respect to each other, in some implementations, a longitudinal axis of the first section runs at an angle between about 35 degrees and about 70 degrees (or within any subrange thereof, such as between about 40 degrees and about 44 degrees) with respect to a longitudinal axis of the third, elongated section, and the longitudinal axis of the third, elongated section runs at an angle between about 35 degrees and about 60 degrees (or within any subrange thereof, such as between about 41 degrees and about 45 degrees) with respect to a longitudinal axis of the second section.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">The vacuum tube can also have any suitable inner diameter. Indeed, in some cases, the vacuum tube has an inner diameter that is between about 2 cm and about 8 cm (or any subrange thereof). For instance, some implementations of the tube have an inner diameter between about 4 cm and about 5 cm (e.g., about 4.445 cm) . Accordingly, in some embodiments, the vacuum tube is easy to hold (e.g., fitting well within a user's hand) while being able to move relatively large amounts of air, fluids, and other materials through it.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">In some cases, the wand head (or shroud) is swept forward with respect to the vacuum tube, such that a face and/or a longitudinal axis of the wand head runs at an angle that is not perpendicular with respect to a longitudinal axis of the first section. Indeed, in some cases, the front face and/or longitudinal axis of the shroud runs at an angle that is between about 89 degrees and about 60 degrees (or within any subrange thereof) with respect to the longitudinal axis of the first section. In some implementations, in addition to and/or in place of the rollers, the wand head (e.g., the shroud) includes one or more skis, glides, or other lips that are configured to make it easier for a user to move the wand head across a flooring surface. While such a lip can be disposed in any suitable location (including, without limitation, at a lower front, rear, side, and/or any other suitable portion of the shroud), in some implementations, the lip is disposed at (and extends from) a lower back side of the shroud (e.g., a side of the shroud facing a user operating the wand) so as to allow a front side (and/or right or left sides) of the shroud to be pushed close to objects (e.g., a wall, furniture, and/or other objects) that are adjacent to and/or placed on the flooring. Additionally, while some implementations of the wand head comprise a lip but do not include any additional wheels or rollers, in some other implementations, the lower back side of the wand head comprise both a lip and one or more rollers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">In some implementations, the described wand further includes one or more filters. While such filters can be disposed in any suitable location, in some implementations, a filter is disposed on the wand adjacent to the wand head. In some other implementations, however, a filter is disposed on the vacuum tube closer to a trigger assembly than to the head. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the wand head is able to remain relatively light in weight (e.g., to help the head to easily slide across flooring surfaces).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">In some implementations, the described systems and methods (and/or any other suitable systems and methods that produce or use electrolyzed water) comprise one or more magnets that are configured to improve the effectiveness of the cell and/or electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water produced by the cell (e.g., by affecting minerals and/or their charge to help prevent the minerals in the water from plating out and/or precipitating and leaving residue on the electrolytic cell's electrodes, spacers, and/or ion permeable membrane (which can damage the membrane and/or reduce its effectiveness); by affecting minerals and/or their charge to help prevent the minerals from leaving residue on the surface being cleaned; by improving the ability of the electrolyzed water to penetrate cleaning surfaces and/or to dissolve dirt and/or other debris; and/or by otherwise improving the effectiveness of the system and/or its products). In this regard, the system can comprise any suitable type of magnet, including, without limitation, one or more neodymium magnets; neodymium iron boron magnets; aluminum nickel cobalt alloy magnets; samarium cobalt magnets; electromagnets; ceramic magnets; ferrite magnets; barium ferrite magnets; sintered composite magnets comprising powdered iron oxide and barium or strontium carbonate; magnetite magnets; lodestone magnets; magnets comprising gadolinium and/or dysprosium; iron alloy magnets; steel magnets; rare earth metal magnets; sintered magnets, cast magnets; plastic bonded magnets; isotropic magnets; anisotropic magnets; electronic de-scalers; magnets having a variable magnetic pole; and/or any other suitable type of materials or devices that have (or that are configured to have) magnetic properties (e.g., to produce a magnetic field).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">Indeed, in some cases, the described systems and methods comprise one or more rare-earth magnets.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">Where the described system comprises one or more magnets, the magnets can be used in any suitable location that allows them to protect the cell and/or to improve the shelf life, the cleaning properties, and/or the effectiveness of the electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water produced by the system. Indeed, in some implementations, the described systems comprise one or more magnets that are coupled to or that are otherwise associated with one or more: fluid inlets into an electrolytic cell (e.g., the described cell and/or any other suitable cell), compartments of the electrolytic cell, fluid outlets from the electrolytic cell, hoses to the wand (and/or a sprayer or other cleaning tool) and/or storage tank, the wand (and/or any other suitable wand), the wand head, the rollers, hosing to the wand, a storage tank, and/or any other suitable component of the described system. Indeed, in some embodiments, the described systems comprise one or more magnets (e.g., two opposing magnets) disposed at (and/or prior to) the fluid inlet into the electrolytic cell. In this regard, the magnets can be any suitable length, width, thickness, and/or diameter, including, without limitation, having one or more such measurements that are between about 0.001 cm and about 10 m (or any subrange thereof). Indeed, in some implementations, the magnets are between about 4 cm and about 40 cm (or any subrange thereof) in diameter. In some cases, the magnets are between about 3 mm and about 2 cm thick. In some additional cases, the described systems include multiple magnets that are disposed at different places along and/or within the inlet line.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In accordance with some implementations, the described systems and methods (and/or any other suitable system and/or methods) are configured to allow one or more fluids (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water) to flow past each other (and/or themselves) and/or to obtain a vortex flow to improve the shelf life, cleaning effectiveness, binding strength, chemical reactivity, the emulsifying characteristics, and/or any other suitable characteristic of the electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water. In this regard, it is theorized that as one or more fluids (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water, electrolyzed oxidizing water, and/or mixtures thereof) flow past each other and/or themselves, energy is passed (e.g., via electrons or otherwise) between the fluids; molecules in the fluids are caused to reorient as a result of interacting charges; and/or the fluids are otherwise modified to help them penetrate deeper into cleaning surfaces, to release dirt from cleaning surfaces, to hold on to debris, and/or to otherwise perform their cleaning and/or disinfecting functions more effectively.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Where one or more fluids (e.g., electrolyzed water) flow past each other or themselves (e.g., in the described system <b>10</b>, in a conventional or novel electrolytic system, in a floor cleaning system, and/or in any other suitable location), the fluids can flow past each other in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, by flowing through tubing and/or any other suitable conduit that: is wrapped in a helix, is wrapped in a double helix, is wrapped in a triple helix, is coiled upon itself, includes multiple channels, twisted, has a portion of a fluid separated from another portion of the fluid by a single wall or membrane of the conduit, comprises internal features that cause the fluids to swirl and/or mix, comprises one or more inserts, and/or by otherwise running one portion of a conduit in proximity to another portion of the conduit (and/or another conduit) that comprises a fluid.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Indeed, in some implementations, the described systems and methods include conditioning electrolyzed water (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water, electrolyzed oxidizing water, and/or mixtures thereof) by splitting the electrolyzed water solution into two streams; running a first stream of the electrolyzed water solution through a first conduit; running a second stream of the electrolyzed water solution through a second conduit (wherein a length of the first conduit and a length of the second conduit run in close proximity to each other); mixing the first and second streams of the electrolyzed water together to form a mixture; then applying the mixture to a material that is to be cleaned; and/or vacuuming up the mixture and debris from the material that is being cleaned. In some such implementations, the first and second conduits are twisted together.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">In accordance with some other implementations, the described systems and methods relate to one or more cleaning agents that are configured to help improve cleaning processes. While the cleaning agent can comprise any suitable ingredient, in some cases, it includes sodium carbonate, sodium percarbonate, orange oil, orange peel terpene, citrus terpene, water, limonene, D-limonene, soy-based surfactants, soybean protein, and/or one or more: natural oil extracts, petroleum additives, bio organic materials, enzymes, synthetic materials, and/or any other suitable ingredient and/or ingredients.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The various ingredients in the cleaning agent can be present in the cleaning agent in any suitable concentration that allows the cleaning agent to be used to clean, pre-treat, and/or otherwise help remove stains, residue, and/or debris from any suitable surface or object. Indeed, in some cases, the various active ingredients in the cleaning agent (e.g., sodium carbonate, sodium percarbonate, orange peel terpene, soybean protein, etc.) are each present in the cleaning agent at concentration between about 0.1 and about 99% by molecular weight. In some embodiments, each of the active ingredients in the cleaning agent is present at between about 0.1% and about 60% by molecular weight (or within any subrange thereof). Indeed, in some implementations, an active ingredient is added to the cleaning agent at a concentration of between about 5% and about 30% by weight (e.g., at a concentration of about 20%&#xb1;5%).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The cleaning agent can be used in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, by being sprayed on a surface (e.g., as a pre-spray for application of the electrolyzed water, being sprayed with the electrolyzed water, being applied to a surface after application of the electrolyzed water, and/or at any other suitable time), misted on a surface, wiped on a surface, painted on a surface, and/or otherwise applied to a surface or material. Indeed, in some implementations, the described cleaning agent is applied to a surface (e.g., flooring and/or any other suitable material) as a pre-spray (e.g., via a motorized sprayer, a hand pump sprayer, and/or in any other suitable manner). In some cases, after the cleaning agent has been applied (e.g., as a pre-spray), electrolyzed water, water, and/or a vacuum is used to rinse and/or otherwise remove the cleaning agent from the material that is being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Some implementations of the described systems and methods relate to the addition of one or more chemicals to the electrolyzed alkaline water, the electrolyzed oxidizing water, and/or mixtures thereof.

Indeed, in some cases, the wipes comprise cloth-like wipes that are partially wetted or saturated with electrolyzed water (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In some implementations, the described systems and methods include a package of cleaning implements, the package comprising multiple cleaning implements that each comprise an absorptive material; and an electrolyzed water solution, wherein the electrolyzed water solution is disposed within the absorptive material. In some such implementations, the cleaning implements are selected from wet wipes, sponges, cloths, brushes, towelettes, rags, swabs, mops, sponges, scrubbers, microfiber cloths, scouring pads, pieces of steel wool, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In addition to comprising electrolyzed alkaline water (and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water), the described wipes (or other cleaning implements) can comprise any other suitable ingredient that allows them to be used for any suitable cleaning purpose. Some non-limiting examples of such ingredients include one or more diluents, carriers, moisturizing agents, fragrances, surfactants (e.g., sodium diamphoacetate, coco phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride, and/or any other suitable surfactants), humectants (e.g., propylene glycol, glycerine, and/or any other suitable humectants that are capable of helping to prevent the wipes from drying out too quickly), coloring agents, alcohols, water, sterile water, deionized water, distilled water, reverse osmosis water, softened water, and/or other suitable ingredients.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Some implementations of the described systems and methods further relate to an agitator comprising two or more rug beaters, brushes, and/or other agitators that are configured to pull hair, dust, and other debris from surfaces being cleaned. Indeed, in some cases, the agitator comprises at least two brushes having relatively soft and/or stiff bristles, where the two brushes are substantially cylindrically shaped, and are configured to spin about an axis that runs substantially horizontally to a surface (e.g., flooring surface) being cleaned. In some such implementations, the brushes counter rotate.

INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0096">The present invention relates to systems and methods for cleaning materials and surfaces, such as flooring, furniture, drapery, upholstery, and any other suitable materials and surfaces. In particular, some implementations of the present invention relate to systems and methods for using an electrolytic cell to generate electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water by electrolyzing a solution comprising sodium carbonate, soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, washing soda, soda crystals, crystal carbonate, sodium acetate, sodium percarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and/or any other suitable salt and/or other electrolyte (e.g., any suitable electrolyte comprising one or more alkali ions). In some cases, the cell comprises a recirculation loop that recirculates anolyte through an anode compartment of the cell. In some cases, the cell further comprises a senor and/or a processor, where the processor is configured to automatically change an operation of the cell, based on a reading from the sensor. In some cases, a fluid flows past a magnet before entering the cell. In some additional cases, fluid from the cell is conditioned by being split into multiple conduits that run in proximity to each other. While the electrolyzed alkaline and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water can be used for any suitable purpose, in some implementations, they are used to clean and/or disinfect carpets, rugs, tile, stone, linoleum, flooring surfaces, furniture, walls, drywall, plaster, countertops, blinds, appliances, woods, metals, vehicles, upholstery, drapes, fabrics, clothing, cloth, bedding, beds, laminates, surfaces which are touched by humans (e.g., door knobs, handrails, chairs, tables, light switches, remote controls, windows, etc.), wounds, and/or any other suitable surface, object, or material</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">In the disclosure and in the claims the terms surface, flooring, floor, flooring surface, and variations thereof, may refer to any suitable form of flooring, walls, carpet, rug, tile, stone, wood, slate, cement, laminate, vinyl, vinyl asbestos, plaster, metal, wood, mosaic, terracotta, terrazzo, ceramic, unglazed ceramic, brick, paver, porcelain, glass, cork, linoleum, rubber, grout, composite, synthetic, natural, cultured, and/or other floor surface, upholstery, furniture, draperies, blinds, walls, clothing, object, and/or material that can be cleaned and/or otherwise treated by the described electrolyzed water, wand, and/or other systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">The following disclosure of the present invention is grouped into seven subheadings, namely &#x201c;Electrolytic System&#x201d;, &#x201c;Electrolytes&#x201d;, &#x201c;Wand&#x201d;, &#x201c;Magnets&#x201d;, &#x201c;Electrolyzed Water Conditioning&#x201d;, &#x201c;Cleaning Agent&#x201d;, &#x201c;Modified Electrolyzed Water&#x201d;, &#x201c;Wipes and Cleaning Implements&#x201d;, &#x201c;Counter Rotating Device&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Representative Methods and Operating Environment&#x201d;. The utilization of the subheadings is for convenience of the reader only and is not to be construed as limiting in any sense.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Electrolytic System</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0099">In accordance with some embodiments, the described systems and methods comprise one or more electrolytic systems that are configured to produce an electrolyzed alkaline solution (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water comprising NaOH and/or any other suitable base), an electrolyzed oxidizing solution (e.g., electrolyzed oxidizing water comprising HOCl and/or any other suitable acid), bleach, and/or any other suitable chemical that can be used for any suitable purpose, including, without limitation, for: cleaning and/or disinfecting floors, walls, countertops, living surfaces, ventilation systems, and/or any other suitable surface or material; washing clothes, textiles, and/or fabrics; washing furniture, drapes, and/or any other suitable object; sterilizing healthcare facilities; and/or for any other suitable purpose. In some embodiments, the described electrolytic system is configured to produce electrolyzed alkaline water (or alkaline water) for cleaning, electrolyzed oxidizing water (or oxidizing water) for disinfecting, bleach, and/or a variety of other chemicals. In some cases, as the electrolyzed alkaline water is used more than electrolyzed oxidizing water, the system is configured to produce more alkaline water than oxidizing water. Indeed, in some embodiments, the system is configured to produce relatively large amounts of alkaline water, while recirculating oxidizing water (and/or anolyte) through the system to dramatically reduce the amount of oxidizing water that is produced (e.g., as compared to some competing devices).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">While the described electrolytic system can comprise any suitable component that allows it to produce an electrolyzed alkaline solution, an electrolyzed oxidizing solution, and/or any other suitable product, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows that in at least some embodiments, the electrolytic system <b>10</b> comprises one or more electrolytic cells <b>12</b>, anodes <b>14</b>, cathodes <b>16</b>, ion exchange membranes <b>18</b>, water inlets <b>20</b>, filters <b>22</b>, water softeners and/or other water treatment systems <b>24</b>, valves <b>26</b>, pumps <b>28</b>, fluid mixers <b>30</b>, electrolyte inlets <b>32</b>, electrolyte feeders <b>34</b>, fluid outlets <b>36</b>, control systems <b>38</b>, containers <b>40</b>, dispensing tools <b>42</b>, vacuums <b>44</b>, waste tanks/drains <b>46</b>, heaters <b>48</b>, sensors <b>50</b>, power supplies <b>51</b>, and/or other suitable components.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">In this regard, while the electrolytic system <b>10</b> can function in any suitable manner, in some embodiments, water and/or any other suitable solution ((e.g., a brine solution, a NaCl solution, and/or a non-NaCl solution), and/or any other suitable solution that allows for an electrolytic reaction to occur in the electrolytic cell <b>12</b>) is added to an anode (or anolyte) compartment <b>52</b> and/or to a cathode (or catholyte) compartment <b>54</b>. Indeed, although in some embodiments, water and an electrolyte (e.g., NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and/or any other suitable ionic substance) are added to both the anode and cathode compartments, in some other embodiments, water and one or more electrolytes (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) are added to the anode compartment, while water is added to the cathode compartment. In some cases, current is then passed between the anode <b>14</b> and the cathode <b>16</b>, such that the electrolyte is ionized to release alkali cations (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, L<sup>+</sup>, and/or any other suitable cation), which are passed from the anode compartment <b>52</b>, through the membrane <b>18</b>, and to the cathode compartment <b>46</b>. Additionally, as the as the cell operates, water is electrolyzed to create OH&#x2212; and H+ ions. Thus, as cations (e.g., N<sup>+</sup>) leave the anode compartment, the solution in the anode compartment becomes acidic (e.g., forming an electrolyzed oxidizing solution comprising HOCl, and/or any other suitable chemical) and the solution in the cathode compartment becomes basic (e.g., forming an electrolyzed alkaline solution comprising sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and/or any other suitable chemical).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">In some embodiments, the solution in the anode compartment <b>52</b> (or the anolyte) is optionally recirculated through the anode compartment (and/or in any other suitable manner) with additional electrolyte (e.g., soda ash and/or any other suitable electrolyte) being added as appropriate (e.g., as needed to produce a suitable amount (and/or desired concentration) of an electrolyzed alkaline solution in the cathode compartment). In some cases, however, a portion of the solution in the cathode compartment (e.g., the electrolyzed alkaline solution) is drained, pumped, and/or otherwise removed from the cathode compartment (e.g., for use in cleaning surfaces and/or any other suitable objects). By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows that, in some embodiments, electrolyzed alkaline water (not shown) is released from the cathode compartment <b>54</b> into a container <b>40</b> to then be applied to an object (e.g., carpet and/or any other suitable material) via one or more dispensing tools <b>42</b> (e.g., wands, sprayers, agitators, and/or other suitable dispensers). Indeed, in some embodiments, the electrolyzed alkaline solution is sprayed through a wand <b>100</b> to a desired object (e.g., flooring, walls, etc.) with the solution and debris then being sucked up through the wand (e.g., via the vacuum <b>48</b>) to a waste tank <b>46</b> and/or a drain. To provide a better understanding of the described electrolytic system <b>10</b>, some of the various optional elements of the system are described below in more detail.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">With respect to the electrolytic cell <b>12</b>, the electrolytic cell can have any suitable characteristic that allows it to function as described herein. For instance, the cell <b>12</b> and its various compartments (e.g., <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>) and components can be any suitable size that allows the cell to function as described herein. By way of example, some embodiments of the cell have a footprint that is less than about 4 m by about 4 m (or within any subrange thereof). Indeed, some embodiments of the cell have a footprint that is less than about 1 m by about 1 m. For instance, some implementations of the cell have a footprint that is about 2 cm by about 0.76 m. Thus, while some embodiments of the cell are configured to be stationary, some other embodiments are configured to be mobile (e.g., carried by a truck, trailer, van, skid, cart, dolly, backpack, sling, and/or in any other suitable manner). Additionally, in some embodiments, the cell is easily configured to be used in homes, in vehicles, slings, backpacks, carts, wheeled structures, and/or in any other suitable manners and/or locations.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">Additionally, the cell <b>12</b> can comprise any suitable material that allows it to function as described herein. Some non-limiting examples of such materials include one or more: metals or alloys (e.g., stainless steel, steel, carbon steel, titanium, and/or any other suitable metal), types of glass, plastics, polymers, ceramics, synthetic materials, and/or other suitable materials. In some embodiments, however, the cell comprises stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">With respect to the anodes <b>14</b> and cathodes <b>16</b>, such electrodes <b>17</b> can comprise any suitable material that allows them to function as described herein to form electrolyzed alkaline, electrolyzed oxidizing water, and/or any other suitable chemical. In this regard, some examples of suitable electrode materials include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: stainless steel; dimensionally stable anode materials; ruthenium coated on a conductive material; ruthenium oxide coated titanium, lead, tungsten, tungsten carbide, titanium diboride, nickel, cobalt, nickel tungstate, nickel titanate, graphite, ceramic electrode material, platinum, silver, titanium carbide, a porous electrode material, a foamed electrode material, and/or other suitable materials; and/or any other suitable electrode materials. Indeed, in some embodiments, the anode and/or cathode comprise stainless steel (e.g., stainless steel having one or more electrode coatings).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">The anode <b>14</b> and cathode <b>15</b> can also have any suitable shape that allows them to function as described herein. Indeed, in some embodiments, the electrodes comprise one or more wires, plates, rods, meshes, blocks, screens, and/or any other suitable shape and configuration. By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>C</figref> show some embodiments in which the anode <b>14</b> and cathode <b>16</b> comprise a rod and/or block. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> shows an embodiment in which the anode <b>14</b> and cathode <b>16</b> each comprise a plate that has a relatively large amount of surface are on which electrolytic reactions can take place. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref> shows an embodiment in which the electrode <b>17</b> (e.g., cathode and/or anode) comprises a coated object having a substantially flat surface. While such plates (and/or coated objects) can perform any suitable purpose, in some embodiments, the plates are configured to help hold the membrane <b>18</b> in place, while allowing for a continuous flow of fluid through the cell <b>12</b>. Moreover, while such electrodes can perform any suitable function, including, without limitation, ionizing ionic materials in the electrolytes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>K</figref> shows that, in some embodiments, the electrodes (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>K</figref>) form hexamer water clusters from normal water clusters (e.g., shown in <b>1</b>J).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">With respect to the ion exchange membrane <b>18</b>, the cell <b>12</b> can comprise any known or novel ion exchange membrane and/or diaphragm that is suitable for use in the described system <b>10</b> and that is configured to allow alkali ions (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup> and/or any other suitable alkali ion) to be transferred from the anode compartment <b>52</b>, through the membrane <b>18</b>, and to the cathode compartment <b>54</b>, while helping to separate the solutions in the anode and cathode compartments. In this regard, some non-limiting examples of suitable membranes comprise one or more porous membranes, non-porous membranes, NaSICON&#x2122; membranes, sodium ion and proton selective membranes, cation-permeable membranes, sodium phosphotungstate membranes, soda glass membranes, and/or other suitable cation permeable membranes. In some embodiments, however, the membrane comprises a non-porous, sodium selective membrane. With reference to the water inlets <b>20</b>, the electrolytic cell <b>12</b> can receive water from any suitable source (including, without limitation, from one or more water tanks, potable water sources, non-potable water sources, irrigation water sources, distilled water, and/or other water sources) and can allow such water to be added to the anode compartment <b>52</b> and/or the cathode compartment <b>54</b> through one or more conduits, pipes, openings, spouts, valves, variable valves, variable speed pumps, and/or other inlets. Indeed, in some embodiments, potable water is added to the electrolytic cell through one or more inlets (e.g., an inlet for the anode compartment and an inlet for the cathode compartment). In some other embodiments, however, (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>) a single fluid inlet <b>20</b> is configured to provided fluid (e.g., electrolyte) to both the anode compartment <b>52</b> and the cathode compartment <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">Although, in some embodiments, water is added to the anode <b>52</b> and/or cathode <b>54</b> compartments manually, in some embodiments, water is added to the various compartments when a valve <b>26</b> is opened (e.g., manually and/or automatically, completely and/or partially), when a pump <b>28</b> is actuated (e.g., one or more desired pumping rates), and/or in any other suitable manner. Indeed, in some embodiments, the system <b>10</b> is configured to activate one or more valves and/or pumps (e.g., via the control system <b>38</b> and/or otherwise) to add more water (and/or electrolyte solution) to one or more compartments of the cell as needed. In this regard, as some embodiments of the cell are configured to recycle fluids through (and/or within) the anode compartment while fluids from the cathode compartment are used as cleaning agents, the described system is configured to selectively add water (and/or to allow water and/or an electrolyte solution to be selectively added) to the cathode compartment at a faster rate than an electrolytic solution (or the electrolyte and/or water) is added to the anode compartment.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">With respect to the filters <b>22</b>, the system <b>10</b> can comprise any suitable type and number of filters that allow debris, chemicals, and/or minerals to be removed from the water that is added into the cell <b>12</b>. In this regard, some non-limiting examples of suitable filters include one or more screen filters, carbon filters, activated carbon filters, reverse osmosis filters, membrane filters, mechanical filters, ultraviolet light filters, deionization filters, paper filters, and/or any other suitable type of filter.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">With respect to the water softeners and/or other water treatment systems <b>24</b>, the system <b>10</b> can be used with any suitable system that is capable of softening and/or otherwise treating water that is introduced into the cell <b>12</b>. Indeed, in some embodiments, the described system comprises one or more ion-exchange polymer systems; salt, water softeners; magnets (e.g., permanent magnets, electromagnets, temporary magnets, etc.); reverse osmosis systems; water distillation systems; and/or other suitable water treatment systems. In some embodiments, however, the system comprises a water softening system. Where the water treatment system <b>24</b> is configured to soften the water, the water can be softened to have any suitable water hardness measurement. Indeed, in some embodiments, the water treatment system is configured to cause water that is supplied to the cell <b>12</b> to have less than about a 15 grain hardness (or any lower level).

By way of non-limiting example, some embodiments of the control system are configured to cause the system (e.g., via user controls, one or more programs, as directed by the operator, and/or in any other suitable manner) to: add more electrolyte, water, and/or any other suitable material to the anode compartment <b>52</b> (and/or elsewhere) as needed to produce desired product; release fluid from the anode compartment and/or cathode compartment <b>54</b>; add fluid (e.g., water, electrolyte, and/or any other suitable material) to the cathode compartment; raise (e.g., via one or more heaters <b>48</b>) and/or lower a temperature of fluid in the anode compartment, the cathode compartment, the container <b>40</b>, the dispensing tool <b>42</b>, and/or any other suitable location; add any other material (e.g., base or acid) to the anode or cathode compartment (e.g., to adjust pH levels); mix the contents of the anode and/or cathode compartments; recirculate fluids through the anode compartment; adjust water softening and/or water treatment operations of the system; adjust a voltage and/or current (e.g., amperage) of the power supply <b>51</b> (e.g., flowing between the electrodes <b>17</b>); operate one or more valves <b>26</b> and/or pumps <b>28</b> of the system; vary fluid speed through one or more portions of the cell; switch between electrolytes; turn off and/or otherwise alter operating parameters of the cell when water and/or electrolyte levels and/or voltage levels drop too low (and/or otherwise vary from set parameters); and/or for any other suitable purpose. Thus, in some embodiments, the system comprises (as mentioned above) a &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d; system that is configured to automatically adjust for different operating conditions (e.g., for operating with waters with different pH levels and/or mineral content), to produce products with different characteristics, and/or for different parameters desired by a particular operator and/or needed for a particular application. In some embodiments, the system is also configured to monitor fluid levels within the various portions of the cell. Thus, in some embodiments, as off gassing occurs, as fluids leave the cell, and/or as fluid levels otherwise drop in the anode compartment <b>52</b> and/or the cathode compartment <b>54</b>, the cell is configured to automatically compensate for such fluid loss (e.g., by adding more electrolyte, electrolyte solution, recirculated anolyte, and/or any other suitable material to one or more compartments of the cell).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">In some embodiments, the system's <b>10</b> ability to monitor and dynamically adjust operating parameters is constant during cell operation (e.g., taking place in near-real time). That said, in some other embodiments, such monitoring and adjusting takes place in any other suitable manner (including, without limitation, intermittently, during a startup process of the system, randomly, repeatedly, at a set time, as determined by a program, continuously, continually, and/or in any other suitable manner). Additionally, in some embodiments, such monitoring and adjusting takes place at the cell and/or in any other suitable location (e.g., over a network, as described below).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">Moreover, some embodiments of the described electrolytic cell <b>12</b> (e.g., controller <b>38</b>) are configured to automatically adjust their operating parameters to produce one or more products (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water, electrolyzed oxidizing water, bleach, and/or any other suitable product) to have a wide range of characteristics. Indeed, in some cases, the described cells are configured to be able to automatically and selectively use one stream of feed water to produce electrolyzed alkaline waters (and/or electrolyzed oxidizing waters) having pHs that vary by more than about 0.25, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more pH units. In some cases, the described cells are configured to be able to automatically and selectively use one stream of feed water to produce amounts of electrolyzed alkaline water (and/or electrolyzed oxidizing waters) (for instance, by varying electrolyte levels, varying cell operating amperage, varying flowrate within the cell, and/or in any other suitable manner) that have pHs that vary by more than 3 pH units (e.g., by more than 3.5 pH units). In contrast, some competing devices may only be able to take one stream of water and produce final products that vary less than 0.5 pH units from each other.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">In accordance with some embodiments, by having the system <b>10</b> automatically vary one or more operating parameters of the cell <b>12</b>, the cell cannot only produce products with desired characteristics, but the cell can further increase its own lifespan. Indeed, while many cells are known to provide a substantially constant level of amperage, despite actual conductivity levels within the electrolytic cells, such cells can greatly over drive cells as electrolyte levels increase and/or decrease within the cell. In contrast, as some embodiments of the described cells are configured to modify amperage levels and/or electrolyte levels, some such embodiments can use 40% to 50% less amperage (or even less) than do some competing devices. In some cases, when one or more sensors <b>50</b>, valves <b>26</b>, pumps <b>28</b>, and/or other components of the cell <b>12</b> fail to function properly, the system is configured to diagnose such a problem, to function without such component, to stop functioning (e.g., to protect the cell, depending on the failure) and/or to otherwise react to such failure. Indeed, in some embodiments, even with a sensor is broken, the cell is configured to operate to the best of its ability without such sensor.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">In some embodiments, the system <b>10</b> comprises one or more power supplies <b>51</b> that are configured to run a current (e.g., a DC current) between the anode <b>14</b> and the cathode <b>16</b> to produce the electrolyzed alkaline water, oxidizing water, and/or any other suitable chemical (e.g., NaOH, H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc. in the cathode compartment <b>54</b>; Cl<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, HOCl, etc. in the anode compartment <b>52</b>). In this regard, the power supply can comprise any suitable characteristic that allows the system to function as described herein. Indeed, although some embodiments of the power supply are configured to provide a relatively static voltage and/or current to the cell <b>12</b>, in some other embodiments, the power supply is configured to vary the voltage and/or current that it provides to the cell (e.g., as determined by the control system <b>38</b>, the operator, and/or otherwise). In this regard, while voltage and/or current levels of some embodiments of the power supply are manually controlled, in some embodiments, the control system <b>38</b> is configured to modify the voltage and/or current levels provided by the power supply based on measurements from the sensors <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In some embodiments (e.g., as discussed above), the system <b>10</b> is configured to measure cell <b>12</b> conductivity to determine the electrical power needed by the cell to cause a desired level of ionic breakdown of the water (e.g., in the cathode compartment <b>54</b>) and the electrolyte (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>and/or any other suitable electrolyte) in the anode compartment <b>52</b>. In some other embodiments, however, based on sensor <b>50</b> readings, the system (e.g., the control system <b>38</b>) is configured to calculate cell conductivity (instead of simply measuring it). Thus, in some such embodiments, the system is configured to function without conductivity meters so as to save costs and prevent the maintenance associated with such meters.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">In some embodiments, the system <b>10</b> (e.g., the control system <b>38</b>) is configured (e.g., based on calculated and/or measured cell conductivity, NaOH concentrations in the cathode compartment <b>54</b>, inlet water conditions, anolyte conductivity, catholyte conductivity, and/or any other suitable factor) to continuously adjust power settings of the power supply <b>51</b> to perform ionization at the electrodes (e.g., as discussed above), regardless of the flow parameters and/or the concentration of electrolyte in solution (e.g., in the anode compartment <b>52</b>).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">In some embodiments (e.g., as mentioned), the system <b>10</b> (e.g., the control system <b>38</b>) is configured to monitor and control mixtures and amounts of electrolyte (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>and/or any other suitable electrolyte) being sent to the cell <b>12</b> (e.g., to the anode compartment <b>52</b> and/or elsewhere). Additionally, in some embodiments, the system manages the valves <b>26</b> and pumps <b>28</b> to ensure the correct flow of fluids through the cell to maximize electrochemical reactions at the electrodes (e.g., at the anode <b>14</b> and/or cathode <b>16</b>). Moreover, in some embodiments, the system uses calculated and/or measured cell conductivity levels and/or any other suitable information to determine fluid flow levels in the cell and/or to selectively vary (e.g., increase, decrease, and/or stop) fluid flowrate to balance, adjust, and/or optimize fluid flow and/or pressure in the cell.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">Turning now to the containers <b>40</b>, some embodiments of the described system <b>10</b> optionally comprise one or more containers to store fluid from the cathode <b>54</b> and/or anode <b>52</b> compartments. By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an embodiment in which the system <b>10</b> comprises a container <b>40</b> that is configured to receive electrolyzed alkaline water from the cathode compartment <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">In some embodiments, the system <b>10</b> comprises one or more heaters <b>48</b>. While such heaters can perform any suitable function, in some embodiments, they are configured to help:</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">increase the cleaning effectiveness of fluids produced by the system (e.g., the electrolyzed alkaline water), to generate steam, to help chemical reactions in the system <b>10</b> to take place at an optimal rate and temperature, and/or for any other suitable purpose. In this regard, the heaters can comprise any suitable heat sources (e.g., heat coils, inductive heaters, boilers, flame heaters, radiators, and/or any other suitable heat sources) and can be disposed in any suitable location, including, without limitation, in the anode compartment <b>52</b>, the cathode compartment <b>54</b>, the container <b>40</b>, the dispensing tool <b>42</b>, the fluid inlets <b>20</b>, the fluid outlets <b>36</b>, and/or in any other suitable location. By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a representative embodiment of heater <b>48</b> placement.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">In addition to the aforementioned components, the described system <b>10</b> can be modified in any suitable manner. In one example, instead of being permanently installed in place, some embodiments of the described electrolytic cell <b>12</b> and/or container <b>40</b> are configured to be mobile (e.g., being disposed on one or more carts, dollies, hand trucks, trucks, vans, vehicles, backpacks, pallets, trailers, and/or other suitable items). By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>L-<b>1</b>O</figref> show some embodiments in which the system <b>10</b> is configured to fit within a vehicle <b>99</b>.

Additionally, those drawings show that, in some embodiments, although the anode <b>14</b> and/or cathode <b>16</b> can be disposed in any suitable locations, in some embodiments, such electrodes are disposed near a wall of the cell <b>12</b>. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> shows that, in some embodiments, the anode <b>14</b> and/or cathode <b>16</b> are configured to extend substantially along a full length of the cell <b>12</b> so as to allow fluids in the various compartments (e.g., the anolyte and catholyte) to have an increased opportunity to contact the various electrodes and to react. Moreover, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> shows that, in some embodiments, the anode <b>14</b> and/or cathode <b>16</b> are placed directly in the flow path of fluids into the various compartments through the inlets. Again, while such placement can perform any suitable function, in some cases, such placement allows fluids to have a higher likelihood of contacting the electrodes and reacting. Additionally, in some cases, by having the electrodes in the fluid flow paths, the flow of fluid across the electrodes can help to remove gas bubbles (which can cause inefficiencies) from the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">As another example of a suitable modification, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>F, <b>1</b>G, and <b>1</b>I</figref> show that, in some embodiments, the cell <b>12</b> comprises one or more spacer frames <b>101</b>. In this regard, the spacer frames can perform any suitable function that allows the cell to function as intended. Indeed, in some embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref> shows that a spacer frame (e.g., the spacer frame <b>101</b> in the middle of the cell <b>12</b> is configured to help direct influent (e.g., an electrolyte solution) into both the anode compartment <b>52</b> and the cathode compartment <b>54</b>. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>F and <b>1</b>G</figref> show that, in some embodiments, one or more spacers <b>101</b> are in close proximity to one or both of the electrodes <b>17</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>F and <b>1</b>G</figref> show some embodiments in which each electrode is sandwiched between two spacer frames <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">Where the cell <b>12</b> comprises one or more spacer frames <b>101</b>, the spacers can be disposed any suitable distance from the electrodes <b>17</b>. Indeed, in some embodiments, each electrode is sandwiched between two spacer frames, with such frames contacting a side of the corresponding electrode.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">While the spacer frames <b>101</b> can have any suitable component and/or characteristic, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref> shows that, in some embodiments, the spacers <b>101</b> comprise a plate (and/or any other suitable object that is configured to have a substantial portion of one surface to be held in close proximity to a corresponding surface of a corresponding electrode <b>17</b>). In this regard, some embodiments of the spacers comprise one or more holes that extend through the spacers (e.g., to allow electrons and ions to readily move through the spacers). In some embodiments, the spacers also comprise one or topographical features that are configured to channel, mix, churn, agitate, blend, stir, and/or otherwise direct fluid past a corresponding electrode. By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref> shows that in some embodiments, the spacers <b>101</b> comprise one or more channels, raised surfaces <b>103</b>, recesses, protrusions, and/or other suitable topographical features that are configured to help ensure that more of the fluid in the cell is run past and is reacted by at least one of the electrodes. Indeed, in some embodiments, when a spacer is in close proximity to a corresponding electrode and fluid flows between the two, the topographical features of the spacer force the fluid to mix, thereby ensuring more (if not complete) exposure of the fluid to the electrode and its electrical fields.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">In accordance with some embodiments, one or more surfaces of one or more of the electrodes <b>17</b> is matched in size and/or shape (e.g., precisely or otherwise) with a corresponding spacer <b>101</b>. In some such embodiments, one or more flow paths, channels, openings, and/or other features of each spacer (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>H and <b>1</b>I</figref>) are aligned with the corresponding surface of the corresponding electrode to ensure substantial (if not complete) contact with the electrolyte solution (i.e., its various ionic materials) and the charged electrode surface (e.g., to optimize ionization). In some such elements, a distance between (and/or contact with) the spacers and electrodes is maintained throughout cell operation.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">As another example of a suitable modification, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref> shows that, in some embodiments, the cell <b>12</b> comprises a single inlet <b>20</b> and a single outlet <b>36</b> (though more could be used). Additionally, that drawing shows that, in some embodiments, instead of having an ion selective membrane (e.g., membrane <b>18</b>) be disposed between the anode compartment <b>52</b> and the cathode compartment <b>54</b>, in some embodiments, a spacer <b>101</b> is at least partially disposed between the two compartments. In this regard, such a cell can perform any suitable function including, without limitation, producing bleach (NaClO), HOCl, ClO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and/or any other suitable product. Indeed, in some embodiments, such cell is capable of forming a concentrated bleach, with bleach molecules found in the product at a concentration of between 400 and about 8,000 parts per million (ppm). In this regard, while some competing devices that are configured differently are capable of forming bleach at 20-300 ppm, some embodiments of the described cell are capable of producing bleach at a concentration greater than 1,000 ppm (e.g., about 7,500 ppm&#xb1;1,000 ppm). In this regard, it should be noted that the cells <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D-<b>1</b>G and <b>1</b>L</figref> can comprise any of the components and/or features of the other cells described herein (e.g., comprising any suitable valve <b>26</b>, feeder <b>34</b>, pump <b>28</b>, control system <b>38</b>, and/or other component described herein); being able to monitor operational parameters; being able to modify amperage, electrolyte concentration, pH, flowrate, and/or any other suitable operating parameter (or condition) of the cell in near real time; being able to use any suitable electrolyte and/or combination of electrolytes (e.g., NaCl, a non-NaCl electrolyte (such as soda ash), and/or any other suitable electrolyte); being able to recirculate anolyte through the anode compartment <b>52</b> (and/or the cell), and/or any other feature described herein).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">As another example of a suitable modification, instead of being used to clean carpets and/or other flooring, some embodiments of the system are configured to be used with one or more clothes washing machines, dish washers, street sweepers, high pressure washers, floor cleaners, parking lot cleaners, disaster cleanup devices, and/or any other suitable devices. Indeed, in some embodiments, in place of (or in addition to) adding soap to a clothes washing machine, a dish washer, and/or any other suitable device, some embodiments of the described system are configured to provide such a device with electrolyzed alkaline and/or oxidizing water for use as a cleaning and/or disinfecting agent.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">The described system <b>10</b> can be used in any suitable manner and for any suitable purpose. Indeed, in some embodiments, a user (and/or the system) adds an electrolyte solution to the anode compartment <b>52</b> and water (and/or any other suitable chemical, including without limitation, and/or any other suitable chemical) to the cathode compartment <b>54</b>. In some such embodiments, the user (and/or the system) then runs the electrolytic cell <b>12</b> to generate electrolyzed alkaline water in the cathode compartment. In some cases, as electrolyzed oxidizing water is produced in the anode compartment <b>52</b>, such fluid is recirculated through the anode compartment, with additional electrolyte and/or water being added to the anode compartment as necessary (e.g., by the control system <b>38</b>, the electrolyte feeder <b>34</b>, an operator, and/or in any other suitable manner). Thus, while some embodiments of the system produce relatively large amounts of electrolyzed alkaline water (e.g., for use as a cleaning agent), in some cases, the system produces and/or releases relatively little (or no) electrolyzed oxidizing water. In some embodiments, however, the system is easily modified (e.g., by automatically and/or manually opening and/or closing one or more valves <b>26</b>, actuating one or more pumps <b>28</b>, and/or otherwise) to allow an operator (and/or the system) to selectively release (and/or produce a larger quantity of) the electrolyzed oxidizing water (e.g., to be used to sanitize a surface and/or for any other suitable purpose). In this regard, it should be noted that where the system automatically monitors and updates its operating parameters, the system can function far more efficiently and with much less input from an operator that would be required in some embodiments in which control of the various operating parameters of the cell are required to be manually changed.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">Additionally, although some embodiments of the system are configured to use a first electrolyte (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>and/or any other suitable electrolyte), in some other embodiments, the system is configured to be switched to use a second electrolyte (e.g., NaCl and/or any other suitable electrolyte) at any suitable time (e.g., on demand). In this regard, while some embodiments of the system are configured to operate with only the first or the second electrolyte, in some embodiments, the system is configured to selectively use two or more electrolytes (or combinations thereof).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">As mentioned, fluids from the system <b>10</b> can be used in any suitable manner. Indeed, in some embodiments, fluids from the cathode compartment <b>54</b> (e.g., alkaline water) and/or the anode compartment <b>52</b> (e.g., oxidizing water) are discharged into one or more containers <b>40</b> (e.g., a container on a truck, van, backpack, a base of operations, and/or any other suitable location), a drain, a dispensing tool <b>42</b>, and/or any other suitable location. In some embodiments, however, the electrolyzed alkaline water (and/or, in some embodiments, the electrolyzed oxidizing water) are passed through one or more dispensing tools <b>42</b> (e.g., to clean a surface and/or material), and a vacuum <b>44</b> is then used to suck up the used fluid with any debris, with the recovered fluid and debris being sent to a holding tank <b>46</b>, a drain, and/or any other suitable location.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">Additionally, (as previously mentioned) while some embodiments of the system <b>10</b> are configured to recycle electrolyzed oxidizing water (and to thereby release little to no oxidizing water from the system), in some other embodiments, the system can be switched to produce and/or release electrolyzed oxidizing water for any suitable purpose (e.g., sanitizing stains left by pets). In one non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>L-<b>1</b>O</figref> show some embodiments in which the system <b>10</b> is disposed in a vehicle <b>99</b>. In some such embodiments, the system is configured to recirculate anolyte through the anode compartment <b>52</b>, without releasing anolyte. As a result, such a system requires relatively less water, requires relatively less electrolyte, produces relatively less waste, and requires relatively less space than some competing systems. Accordingly, some embodiments of the current system are relatively inexpensive to operate and transport. Some embodiments of the described system <b>10</b> are configured to include or provide some beneficial features. Indeed, in some embodiments, electrolyzed oxidizing water is recycled through the anode compartment <b>52</b>. As a result, some such embodiments may use (and/or waste) substantially less water than do some conventional electrolytic devices. For instance, some conventional devices create as much oxidizing water as alkaline water. Indeed, in some conventional devices it is not possible (or at least not easy) to produce more alkaline water than oxidizing water. In this regard, as the oxidizing water is typically not considered (at least by some) to be as useful or needed (e.g., in cleaning carpets and other flooring or objects) as alkaline water, the oxidizing water is often times wasted and simply poured down a drain, where it can cause environmental issues. Accordingly, in some cases, almost half of the fluid produced by some conventional devices is typically wasted. In contrast, as some embodiments of the described system produce and release relatively little (or no) oxidizing water (e.g., unless otherwise desired), the described system can be environmentally friendly, be relatively inexpensive to operate, be relatively convenient to use, and can produce relatively small amounts of corrosive, smelly, acidic water that is discharged.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">As yet another example, some embodiments of the membrane <b>18</b> are relatively non-porous. Indeed, unlike some conventional electrolytic devices that comprise a relatively porous membrane, which allows mixing of the acidic fluids from the anode compartment <b>52</b> with alkaline fluids of the cathode compartment <b>54</b>, some embodiments of the described system comprise one or more non-porous membranes that allow alkali ions (e.g., N<sup>+</sup>) and protons (e.g., H<sup>+</sup>) to pass through the membrane while separating the electrolyzed oxidizing water in the anode compartment from the alkaline water in the cathode compartment. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the electrolyzed alkaline water produced in the system's cathode compartment is relatively pure, and free from acids, salts, and/or other contaminants that are able to pass through the porous membrane of some conventional devices.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">In still another example, as some embodiments of the described system <b>10</b> recycle fluid (e.g., electrolyzed oxidizing water and electrolyte solution) through the anode compartment <b>52</b>, alkali ions (e.g., N<sup>+</sup>) (which in some conventional devices is discarded or are otherwise passed through an anode compartment one time) are recirculated and given additional opportunities to pass through the membrane <b>18</b> into the cathode compartment <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">In some embodiments, by recirculating fluids through the anode compartment <b>52</b> (and/or the anolyte recirculation tank <b>64</b>) and thus allowing a greater portion of alkali ions (e.g., N<sup>+</sup>) in the anode compartment to pass through the membrane <b>18</b> and into the cathode compartment <b>54</b> than occurs in some conventional devices, and as some embodiments reduce and/or completely prevent mixing between the acid solutions of the anode compartment and the basic solutions of the cathode compartment, some embodiments of the described system <b>10</b> are configured to produce higher and purer concentrations of NaOH in the cathode compartment than do some conventional devices. Indeed, while some conventional devices may produce less than about 100 ppm or even 50 ppm or less of NaOH (e.g., in the electrolyzed alkaline water), some embodiments of the described system produce electrolyzed alkaline water having an NaOH concentration of between 100 ppm and about 700 ppm (or any subrange thereof). Indeed, some embodiments of the system are configured to produce electrolyzed alkaline water having a NaOH concentration of above about 200 ppm (e.g., above about 250 ppm).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">As another example, some embodiments of the system <b>10</b> are easily reconfigured (e.g., by flipping a switch, opening and/or closing one or more valves <b>26</b>, by actuating one or more pumps <b>28</b>, by selecting a different operation mode for the system, and/or in any other suitable manner) to selectively switch from releasing electrolyzed alkaline water (e.g., for delivery through a dispensing tool <b>42</b> or otherwise) to releasing electrolyzed oxidizing water on demand (and/or combinations thereof) (e.g., for use as a sanitizer and/or for any other suitable purpose). In some such embodiments, the system is also easily selectively changed back to releasing alkaline water on demand. Thus, in some embodiments, the system (on demand) can pass more fluids through the anode compartment and/or produce more electrolyzed oxidizing water upon demand. Additionally, in some embodiments, instead of just being able to switch between releasing a larger amount of alkaline water than oxidizing water (or vice versa), some embodiments of the system are configured to release alkaline water and oxidizing water simultaneously (e.g., via two different dispensing tools <b>42</b>, to two different tanks, and/or in any other suitable manner).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">In even another example, some embodiments of the described system <b>10</b> are configured to be mostly, if not completely, automated (e.g., as discussed above). Accordingly, such embodiments can be relatively easy to use and can automatically adjust for different situations (e.g., feed water compositions, uses, etc.). Indeed, some such embodiments can automatically compensate (e.g., adjust operating parameters) for the characteristics (e.g., pH and/or any other suitable characteristic) of water from a variety of sources. Similarly, some embodiments of the system are configured to automatically adjust operating parameters to produce electrolyzed alkaline water with one or more desired concentrations of NaOH.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">In still another example, some embodiments of the described system can be relatively small (e.g., as discussed above). In some other embodiments, however, the system is easily scaled up in size to produce higher volumes of electrolyzed alkaline water, with higher concentrations of NaOH.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">In still another example, some embodiments of the system <b>10</b> comprise a stainless steel, open frame design that provides for superior maintenance access over some conventional devices.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">In even another example, as some embodiments of the described system <b>10</b> place water in the cathode compartment <b>54</b> (instead of an electrolyte solution), and as some embodiments of the system comprise a relatively non-porous membrane <b>18</b>, some embodiments of the described system produce electrolyzed alkaline water that is substantially if not completely free from NaCl (and/or other electrolytes). This is especially true in some embodiments in which the anolyte comprises a non-sodium chloride electrolyte (e.g., soda ash), as discussed hereinafter. In contrast, in some conventional devices, a NaCl solution is added to both the anode and cathode compartment, with most of the salt passing straight through the cell, with only a small fraction of the salt ultimately producing NaOH in the catholyte. Indeed, in some conventional devices, unreacted chlorides account for 1,500 ppm or even 2,000 ppm in the produced oxidizing water and often even higher concentrations in the electrolyzed alkaline water. This excess chloride and NaCl often has no cleaning effect, but instead tends to leave NaCl in the cleaned materials.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">Thus, some embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and methods for producing electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water by electrolyzing a solution comprising one or more electrolytes. While the electrolyzed alkaline and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water can be used for any suitable purpose, in some embodiments, they are used to clean and/or disinfect carpets, rugs, tile, stone, linoleum, flooring surfaces, furniture, walls, drywall, plaster, countertops, blinds, appliances, woods, metals, vehicles, upholstery, drapes, fabrics, clothing, cloth, bedding, textiles, and/or any other suitable surface, object, or material. Additionally, in some embodiments, the described system is configured to produce different ratios of electrolyzed alkaline and oxidizing water. Moreover, in some embodiments, the described system is configured to selectively switch between using a first electrolyte (e.g., sodium carbonate) and a second electrolyte (e.g., sodium chloride), and vice versa, on demand.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Electrolytes</heading><p id="p-0172" num="0170">The described system <b>10</b> can be used with any suitable electrolyte that allows the system to produce electrolyzed alkaline water, electrolyzed oxidizing water, and/or any other suitable product.

In this regard, some embodiments of the described system (and/or any other suitable device) are configured to use sodium chloride (NaCl) as the electrolyte. In some other embodiments, however, the electrolyte comprises a non-sodium chloride or at least a non-sodium chloride based electrolyte. In this regard, where the electrolyte comprises a non-sodium chloride electrolyte, the electrolyte can comprise any suitable alkali salt that is capable of allowing the described systems <b>10</b> to produce electrolyzed water and/or any other suitable chemical, and that do not comprise or that comprise a relatively small amount of sodium chloride (again, if any). Some non-limiting examples of suitable non-sodium chloride electrolytes include, but are not limited to, sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), soda ash, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), potash, potassium carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO<sub>3</sub>), sodium chloride, potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), potassium chloride (KCl), potassium chlorate (KClO<sub>3</sub>), sodium phosphate, and/or any other suitable electrolyte (e.g., any suitable alkali ion containing electrolyte).

In some embodiments, the electrolyte (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is added to water (e.g., that is in and/or that is to be added to) the anode compartment <b>52</b> at a concentration of between about 0.1% and about 60% by weight (or within any subrange thereof). Indeed, in some embodiments, the electrolyte (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is added to water at a concentration of between about 10% and about 30% by weight (e.g., at a concentration of about 20%&#xb1;5%). Additionally (as described above), in some embodiments, as the system <b>10</b> operates, additional electrolyte is added (e.g., automatically and/or manually, as discussed above) to the anode compartment and/or the cathode compartment <b>54</b> (e.g., via the electrolyte feeder <b>34</b>, the control system <b>38</b>, and/or otherwise) to keep the electrolyte at a desired concentration (e.g., in the anode compartment).

Accordingly, in some embodiments, the use of such electrolytes is relatively safe (e.g., by not exposing users to toxic chlorine gas and/or noxious chlorine chemicals) and does not expose surrounding structures (e.g., vehicles) the highly corrosive effects of chlorine gas. Additionally, in some embodiments in which the electrolyte solution is added to the anode compartment <b>52</b> while water is added to the cathode compartment, the described system can produce electrolyzed alkaline water that is substantially free from salts (e.g., NaCl). Thus, unlike some conventional devices that produce electrolyzed alkaline water with a relatively high salt content (which can leave salt in carpets and other materials that are cleaned with the alkaline water), some embodiments of the described system are able to produce a relatively pure aqueous NaOH solution (which leaves no salt or other residue on cleaned objects). Furthermore, as some embodiments of the electrolyzed alkaline water are relatively (if not completely) salt (e.g., NaCl) free, such liquids can be substantially less corrosive (e.g., to sewers, containers <b>40</b>, equipment, etc.) than are some conventional electrolyzed alkaline waters that comprise NaCl.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0174">Once Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(sodium carbonate), NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(sodium bicarbonate), and/or another suitable non-NaCl electrolyte is used to create electrolyzed alkaline water, electrolyzed oxidizing water, and/or any other suitable product (e.g., via the system <b>10</b> and/or any other suitable device), the various chemicals produced by such an electrolysis process can be used for any suitable purpose and in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, for cleaning and/or sanitizing. Indeed, in some embodiments, the electrolyzed alkaline water is used to clean flooring (e.g., carpets, rugs, tile, stone, and other flooring surfaces), furniture, walls, countertops, vehicles, upholstery, and/or any other suitable surface or material, and the electrolyzed alkaline water (if released from the system at all) can be used to sanitize objects.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0175">Where Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(sodium carbonate), NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(sodium bicarbonate), and/or another suitable non-NaCl electrolyte is used to create electrolyzed alkaline water and/or electrolyzed oxidizing water, the various fluids produced can have any suitable characteristic.

In this example, the various bent and/or other sections can be coupled to the vacuum tube in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, via one or more detent mechanisms, friction fittings, mechanical connection mechanisms, fasteners, adhesives, welds, and/or any other suitable mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0201">In another example of a method for modifying the shape of the vacuum tube <b>102</b>, some embodiments of the vacuum tube comprise one or more flexible components (e.g., a flexible tube with an adjustable rigid scaffolding that is configured to selectively lock in and be released from a desired orientation, a flexible exhaust-pipe-like tube, and/or any other suitable component) that allows an angle between two or more portions of the vacuum tube to be selectively adjustable and selectively maintained.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0202">With reference now to the wand head <b>104</b>, the wand head can comprise any suitable feature that allows it to apply a fluid (e.g., via one or more nozzles, orifices, sprayers, and/or other jets <b>108</b>) to flooring being cleaned and to allow such fluid and/or debris to be drawn from the flooring (e.g., via one or more vacuum ports <b>110</b> that are configured to funnel and/or otherwise direct fluid, debris, air, and/or other materials to the vacuum tube <b>102</b>). In this regard, some embodiments of the wand head comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more jets and/or vacuum ports. Indeed, in some embodiments, the head comprises 3-6 jets (e.g., coupled to a jet manifold <b>109</b> or otherwise connected to one or more feed lines <b>118</b>) and one vacuum port.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0203">Where the wand head <b>104</b> comprises one or more jets <b>108</b> and vacuum ports <b>110</b>, the jets and vacuum ports can be disposed in and/or on the head with any suitable relation to each other. Indeed, although some embodiments of the head comprise jets in front of the vacuum port (e.g., distal to the vacuum port or the operator), in some other embodiments, the jets <b>108</b> (and/or jet manifold <b>109</b>) are disposed (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>) behind the vacuum port (e.g., proximal to the port or the operator). In some of these latter embodiments, the wand is configured to be a pull wand&#x2014;allowing fluid that is sprayed from the jets to be rapidly sucked up when the wand is being pulled (e.g., backwards).</p><p id="p-0208" num="0204">In some embodiments, the jets <b>108</b> and/or the vacuum port <b>110</b> are at least partially disposed in and/or in fluid communication with a shroud <b>106</b>. In other words, some embodiments of the head <b>104</b> comprise a sealed loop (or at least partially sealed loop) system in which fluid sprayed from the jets within the shroud is allowed to contact the flooring being cleaned and to then be sucked up into the vacuum port in a relatively short period of time. By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> shows an embodiment in which the shroud <b>106</b> is configured to extend around a portion of the head <b>104</b> so as to extend around a spray, mist, curtain, and/or other effluent <b>107</b> of the jets <b>108</b> and to form a seal (or at least a partial seal) with a flooring surface (not shown) upon which the head rests.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0205">In some cases, the vacuum port is referred to herein as a first chamber in the wand head (the first chamber being disposed in proximity to the vacuum tube <b>102</b>), and the portion the shroud <b>106</b> to which the jets <b>108</b> are coupled is referred to as the second chamber, with the first and second chambers being at least partially separated by a breaker bar <b>112</b>, as referred to below.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0206">Indeed, in some embodiments, to help fluid flow from the jets <b>108</b>, across the flooring, and into the vacuum port <b>110</b>, the wand head <b>104</b> comprises a recess, surface, and/or other form of breaker bar <b>112</b> that is recessed within the shroud <b>106</b> (e.g., between a space of the shroud (the second chamber) and the vacuum port the first chamber) such that one or more surfaces of the shroud extend past (e.g., below) the breaker bar. In some such embodiments, by having the breaker bar be recessed within the shroud, the shroud (and/or head) is able to contact and form at least a partial seal with the flooring surface while the breaker bar is held slightly higher up above the flooring to allow fluid to rapidly pass from the flooring into the vacuum port. Thus, in some embodiments, the recessed breaker bar allows fluid leaving the jets and contacting the flooring to rapidly change direction (e.g., doing a U-turn) and to pass into the vacuum port. As a result of this sealed (or semi-sealed) loop system, some embodiments of the wand are configured to force the fluid across the flooring (e.g., through carpet) and then to suck such fluid up into the vacuum port without allowing the fluid to flood the flooring and/or to settle into flooring (e.g., the carpet backing and/or padding). Thus, some embodiments of the described systems are capable of cleaning flooring with high-pressure fluid and then allowing such flooring to dry significantly faster than do some other conventional methods and devices.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0207">Where the wand head <b>104</b> comprises a recessed breaker bar <b>112</b>, the breaker bar (or a portion thereof) can terminate and/or be disposed at any suitable distance from (e.g., above) the bottom end <b>214</b> of the wand head <b>104</b> and/or the shroud <b>106</b> that allows the wand head to function as described herein. Indeed, in some embodiments, the breaker bar is disposed at a distance (as shown by d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>) between about 2 mm and about 3 cm (or any subrange thereof) above the head's bottom end. Indeed, in some embodiments, the breaker bar is disposed between about 0.5 cm and about 1.5 cm above the head's bottom end.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0208">In some embodiments, to allow the wand head <b>104</b> to be adjusted and/or optimized for various types of flooring (e.g., tile, shag carpet, etc.) with various characteristics, the breaker bar <b>112</b> is adjustably attached to the wand head such that the breaker bar (or a portion thereof) can be selectively raised and lowered in the head (and/or such that a portion of the shroud and/or head can be raised and lowered with respect to the bar). In such embodiments, the breaker bar (and/or shroud and head) can be adjustable in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, by being coupled to one or more threaded fasteners, detent mechanisms, sliding ratchet mechanisms, grooves into which portions of the head (or an attached object) slidably fit, one or more lever mechanisms that cause the bar (and/or the shroud and/or head) to move when a lever is moved, and/or any other suitable mechanism that allows at least a portion of the breaker bar (and/or the shroud/head) to be raised and/or lowered in the head. Indeed, in some embodiments, the breaker bar is slidably coupled within the head via one or more threaded fasteners that can be loosened to move, and tightened to secure, the bar.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0209">With reference now to the roller <b>114</b>, some embodiments of the wand <b>100</b> optionally comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more wheels, bearings, casters, and/or other rollers that are configured to help the wand head <b>104</b> be moved across a flooring surface with relatively little effort. While the rollers can be disposed in any suitable location on the wand (e.g., in front, behind, and/or to the side of the vacuum port <b>110</b>), in some embodiments, the roller is disposed behind the vacuum port, the jets <b>108</b>, and the shroud <b>106</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B</figref>. <b>2</b>F, <b>2</b>G, <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>10</b>). In some such embodiments, by placing the roller behind the port (e.g., proximal to the operator), the wand can be used to clean right up next to walls and other objects.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0210">Where the wand <b>100</b> comprises one or more rollers, the rollers can have any suitable width. In some embodiments, however, the roller (and/or a plurality of rollers coupled side to side) extends across a substantial width of the wand head <b>104</b>. While such a roller (or rollers) can perform any suitable function, in some cases, they act to lay down a portion of the flooring (e.g., carpet and/or other material) that is being cleaned such that a larger portion of strands of the flooring (e.g., carpet or other material) is exposed to the spray and/or vacuum forces provided through the wand head.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0211">In some embodiments, the roller <b>114</b> is optionally adjustable such that it can be moved up or down on the wand head <b>104</b>. In this manner, the wand <b>100</b> can be adjusted to allow operators of various heights to use the wand in a position that is comfortable to the individual operators while allowing such operators to maintain at least a partial seal between the shroud <b>106</b> and/or the head and the flooring being cleaned. Indeed, in some embodiments in which the roller's height is fixed, a relatively tall operator may hold the wand at such an angle that the roller does not contact the flooring throughout the operator's full stroke of the wand&#x2014;thus making it hard for the operator to force the wand head across the flooring. In contrast, in some embodiments in which the roller's height is fixed (e.g., at the same height as it was for the relatively tall operator), an operator that is relatively short may hold the wand at such an angle that the roller contacts the flooring and acts as a fulcrum that lifts the front of the head off the flooring and prevents the shroud from forming a desirable seal with the flooring. Thus, in some embodiments, the adjustable roller can allow an operator to tailor the wand to the operator's size and needs, while allowing the wand to clean flooring surfaces.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0212">Where the roller <b>114</b> is selectively adjustable, the roller can be adjusted in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, via one or more detent mechanisms, ratchet mechanisms, level mechanisms, the loosening and tightening of one or more screws, by being able to attach the roller to the head at more than one position (e.g., in a variety of connection points), and/or in any other suitable manner. Indeed, in some embodiments, the roller is coupled to one or more brackets that can be coupled to the rear of the head in multiple positions (e.g., via the tightening and/or loosening of one or more screws, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0217" num="0213">In place of, or in addition to, the roller <b>114</b>, some embodiments of the wand head <b>104</b> comprise one or more angled surfaces, rounded surfaces, glides, skis, and/or any other suitable lips <b>116</b> that extend from the head and/or the shroud <b>106</b> that help the head to easily slide across flooring surfaces (e.g., without skipping across the flooring surface and/or requiring undue amounts of force to move the head). While such lips can extend from any suitable portion of the wand head and/or the shroud, including, without limitation, from a front side, back side, right side, left side, corner, and/or any other suitable portion of the wand head and/or the shroud, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>D-<b>2</b>G</figref> show some embodiments in which the lip <b>116</b> extends from a back side of the shroud <b>106</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, the wand head is able to slide across flooring relatively easily, due to the lip, while still having a front side of the wand head (and/or sides) be able to clean up to one or more walls, pieces of furniture, and/or any other suitable object. Additionally, as mentioned above, while some embodiments of the wand head comprise a lip but do not include any additional wheels or rollers, in some other implementations, the lower back side of the wand head comprise both a lip and one or more rollers.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0214">With respect now to the trigger assembly <b>120</b>, the trigger assembly can comprise any suitable mechanism that allows a user to selectively start, stop, increase, decrease, and/or otherwise control the flow of fluid through the feed line <b>118</b> and jets <b>108</b>. Indeed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>D, <b>4</b>A, and <b>5</b></figref> show some embodiments in which the trigger mechanism <b>120</b> comprises a manually controlled valve that is opened when the trigger lever <b>123</b> is squeezed and closed when the trigger lever is released. In some other embodiments that are not shown, the trigger mechanism comprises one or more catches, detents, and/or other mechanisms that are configured to selectively catch and/or otherwise retain the trigger lever in a desired position so as to provide a desired flow of fluid through the feed line. Indeed, in some embodiments, the trigger mechanism functions much like a gas pump trigger that is configured to have a lever (e.g., the trigger lever <b>123</b> and/or another lever) be selectively captured in one or more catches and then to be released from such catches when the trigger lever is squeezed (and/or as otherwise determined, for instance, when the system determines that a sufficient or exorbitant amount of fluid has been disposed in the flooring, as discussed below).</p><p id="p-0219" num="0215">In still other embodiments, the trigger mechanism <b>120</b> comprises one or more electronically controlled valves, pneumatically actuated values, solenoids, and/or other valve mechanisms that are that are configured to allow a user to easy control fluid flow through the feed line <b>118</b>. Thus, in some such embodiments, the described systems and methods reduce user fatigue (e.g., fatigue associated with gripping the trigger lever <b>123</b> for long periods of time).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0216">In accordance with some embodiments, the wand <b>100</b> is configured to provide fluid through one or more of the jets <b>108</b> in a pulsed, pulsated, sonicated, choppy, shockwave, turbulent, vibrated, and/or other pulsated manner that does not provide the spray to the surface that is being cleaned in a steady flow. In this regard, the wand (and/or system <b>10</b>) can comprise any suitable pump, valve, sonicator, pulsing device, solenoid, actuator, oscillating valve, and/or other device that is configured to provide fluid to the surface being cleaned in a pulsated or sonicated manner. Indeed, in some embodiments, the valve comprises a spring loaded ball valve that is configured to have the ball move back and forth in the valve to oscillate pressure of the liquid passing through the valve. In any case, a mechanism for pulsating fluid through the wand and/or jets can be powered and/or actuated in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, hydraulically (e.g., by flow of fluid from the cell), electrically (e.g., powered by the mains, a battery, and/or in any other suitable manner), pneumatically, and/or in any other suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0217">While any suitable mechanism can be used to pulse fluids through wand <b>100</b> (e.g., the jets <b>108</b>), in some embodiments, the trigger assembly <b>120</b> is used with one or more pulsing valves (e.g., pulse valve, pulse jet valve, pulse solenoid valve, and/or other valves) and/or other mechanisms that are configured to pulse the spray that is applied to flooring (and/or any other surface being cleaned). In some such embodiments, such pulsing can allow the wand to apply fluid to the flooring at relatively high, pulsated pressures, and to thereby help dislodge debris and to otherwise clean such flooring.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0218">With reference now to the filter <b>122</b>, some embodiments of the described wand <b>100</b> comprise one or more filters that are configured to perform any suitable purpose, including, without limitation, preventing debris in the feed line <b>118</b> from clogging a jet <b>108</b>. In such embodiments, the wand can comprise any suitable number of filters (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more) that are disposed in any suitable location. Indeed, in accordance with some embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows the wand <b>100</b> comprises a single filter <b>122</b> that is disposed adjacent to the wand head <b>104</b> (e.g., coupled to the first section <b>200</b>). In accordance with some other embodiments, however, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> shows an embodiment in which the filter <b>122</b> is disposed at or between the first bend <b>206</b> and the end <b>212</b> of the vacuum tube <b>102</b>. Indeed, while the filter can be disposed in any suitable location (e.g., between a midpoint of a length of the third section <b>204</b> and the tube's end <b>212</b>), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> shows an embodiment in which the filter <b>122</b> is coupled to the second section <b>202</b> (e.g., at and/or near the second bend <b>208</b>). In this regard, while there may be several reasons to place the filter adjacent to the wand head, in some cases, placing the filter near the second section <b>202</b> can make the wand head lighter and easier to move and may result in less fatigue to the user (especially, where the second and/or third sections of vacuum tube are strapped (e.g., via a shoulder strap, a belt loop strap, etc.) and/or otherwise connected to the user to reduce user fatigue).</p><p id="p-0223" num="0219">With reference now to the handle <b>124</b>, the wand <b>100</b> can comprise any suitable gripping surface and/or handle that allow a user to grab and maneuver the wand as desired. By way of non-limiting illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an embodiment in which the wand <b>100</b> comprises a gripping surface <b>222</b> disposed on the second section <b>202</b> and a handle <b>124</b> that is coupled to the third section <b>204</b> of the vacuum tube <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0220">Where the handle <b>124</b> is coupled to the third section <b>204</b> of the vacuum tube <b>102</b>, the handle can be coupled to the tube in any suitable manner and in any suitable orientation.

In still other embodiments (not shown) the handle support is angled towards the front end of the vacuum tube (e.g., at an acute angle) and/or is shaped such that the handle is disposed closer to the wand head <b>104</b> (along a length of the tube) than is the point at which the handle support couples to the tube.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0221">In addition to the aforementioned components, the described wand <b>100</b> can comprise any other suitable component or characteristic that allows it to function as described herein. Some examples of such components include, but are not limited to, one or more jet manifolds <b>109</b> that are configured to direct fluid from the feed lines to the jets <b>108</b>; plastic, metal, and/or any other suitable clips <b>131</b>; ties; belts; straps; fasteners; mechanical engagements; frictional engagements; and/or other mechanisms that are configured to selectively and/or permanently couple the jet manifold to the wand head <b>104</b>, caps, manifold covers, fittings, connectors, valve connectors, disconnects (e.g., quick disconnects or otherwise), check valves, filter housings, bushings (e.g., for the roller <b>114</b>), bearings, jet housings, pressure valves (e.g., to allow air into the shroud when pressure drops below a set level and/or for any other suitable purpose), shells, lights, pressure gauges (e.g., to determine vacuum pressure in the vacuum tube <b>102</b> or for any other suitable purpose), agitators, and/or other suitable components.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0222">As another example of a suitable component, some embodiments of the described wand <b>100</b> (and/or a system comprising the wand) include one or more sensors that determine how much fluid has been applied to (and/or remains at) a flooring surface. Indeed, in some embodiments, the wand comprises one or more moisture sensors that determine the moisture level of the flooring over which the wand passes. In some such embodiments, the wand and/or a system comprising the wand is configured to provide an indication of the moisture level of the flooring (e.g., via one or more lights, sounds, displays, and/or other signals) and/or to automatically increase, decrease, start, stop, and/or otherwise control the amount of fluid that is sprayed from the wand head based on such moisture level.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0223">In some other embodiments, the wand <b>100</b> (and/or a system comprising the wand) is configured to determine how much fluid the wand lets out and how much fluid the wand sucks up (e.g., to determine how much fluid is left in the flooring and/or for any other suitable purpose). In such embodiments, the wand and/or its system can make such determinations in any suitable manner. Indeed, in some embodiments, the wand comprises one or more sensors that determine how much fluid is dispensed through the head (e.g., one or more flow meters, fluid level sensors, electric eyes, mass sensors, scales, moisture sensors, fluid sensors, and/or any other suitable sensors that are capable of determining how much fluid is dispensed from the jets) and one or more sensors that determine how much fluid has been sucked up through the vacuum tube <b>102</b> (e.g., one or more flow meters, fluid level sensors, electric eyes, mass sensors, scales, moisture sensors, fluid sensors, and/or any other suitable sensors that are capable of determining how much fluid has been sucked up through the vacuum tube).</p><p id="p-0228" num="0224">As still another example, some embodiments of the wand <b>100</b> are configured to provide additional strength to the connection between the vacuum tube <b>102</b> and the wand head <b>104</b>. While this can be accomplished in any suitable manner, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows that, in some embodiments, a collar <b>240</b> with one or more gussets <b>242</b> and/or other supports is welded, adhered, riveted, and/or otherwise coupled between the wand head <b>104</b> and the vacuum tube <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0225">As another example, some embodiments of the wand head <b>104</b> and/or the shroud comprise a lower section that is adjustably coupled to the wand head (e.g., via one or more mechanical fasteners, mechanical mechanisms, frictional engagements, detents, clamps, and/or other suitable mechanisms) such that an angle of such lower section can be adjusted with respect to an upper portion of the head and/or the vacuum tube. In some such embodiments, the head can be adjusted such that the back end <b>212</b> of the vacuum tube can be raised or lowered while the head is able to keep a seal (or at least a partial seal) with the flooring being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0226">As an additional example of another suitable component, some embodiments of the described wand head <b>104</b> and/or the shroud <b>106</b> comprise one or more air inlets that allow air to enter into the head and/or the shroud when the head is forming (or substantially forming) a seal with a flooring surface. Accordingly, in some such embodiments, the head is able to form a seal with the flooring while still having enough air flow to suck fluid and/or debris up into the vacuum tube <b>102</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, such inlets allow the head to form a relatively tight seal with a surface (e.g., flooring) without placing undue strain on a vacuum's motor. Indeed, while such inlets can perform any suitable function, in some embodiments, the inlets are sized, shaped, and placed to allow air to flow into the inlets to improve a spray pattern of the jets <b>108</b>. Additionally, in some cases, the air inlets allow air to flow through the air inlets, across a surface being cleaned, then up into the vacuum tube <b>102</b> while the shroud head <b>104</b> is forming a seal with a surface that is being cleaned. As a result, in some such embodiments, the inlets allow the wand to provide high level of suction when the bottom surface of the shroud is in contact with a surface that is being cleaned. In any case, while such vents can be disposed in any suitable location, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref> show that, in some embodiments, the shroud <b>106</b> defines one or more apertures <b>226</b> and/or openings <b>228</b> around the jets <b>108</b> (e.g., at a top side, back side, right side, left side, upper portion, lower portion, and/or at any other suitable portion of the shroud) that are configured to allow a desired amount of air to flow into the shroud <b>106</b> while allowing the shroud to form a seal (or partial seal) with a flooring surface (not shown). Indeed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the air inlets or apertures <b>226</b> are disposed between the jets <b>108</b> at an upper back side of the shroud.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0227">As an additional example of a suitable characteristic, in addition to, or in place of, the lip <b>116</b>, any other suitable portion of the wand head <b>104</b> and/or the shroud <b>106</b> (e.g., a portion that is configured to contact a flooring surface when the head is in use and/or any other suitable portion of the wand head, such as the breaker bar <b>112</b>) may be rounded. While such rounding can perform any suitable function, in some embodiments, such rounding helps reduce friction between the wand head and a flooring surface.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0228">In addition to the aforementioned characteristics, the described wand <b>100</b> can have any other suitable characteristic that allows it to operate as intended. Indeed, in some embodiments, the vacuum tube <b>102</b> is (as described here) ergonomically shaped to be more comfortable and easy to use than some conventional cleaning attachments.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0229">Additionally, in some embodiments, the described head is configured to deliver a high-pressure controlled spray that loosens dirt and allows the dirt to be removed through a relatively powerful extraction wand. Moreover, in some embodiments, the described wand is configured to prevent flooring surfaces from being flooded with excess fluid. As a result, some embodiments of the described wand are configured to leave flooring surfaces cleaner (e.g., by removing more water, soap, detergent, debris, etc.) than some conventional cleaning devices. Furthermore, as some embodiments of the described wand leave less fluid in flooring than do some conventional devices; such embodiments are able to allow flooring to dry faster than do some conventional devices.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0230">Additionally, in some embodiments, the wand <b>100</b> (and/or any other suitable portion of the system <b>10</b>) comprises or is otherwise associated with one or more sonic valves. While such valves can function in any suitable manner, in some embodiments, they are configured to stop and allow fluid flow in such a manner so as to cause mechanical abrasion as fluid is sprayed through the wand (e.g., the jets) to further loosen dirt and debris in the surface being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0231">As another example of a suitable modification, in some embodiments, the wand comprise one or more brushes, agitators, carpet beaters, and/or other objects that are configured to manipulate the flooring surface and to help remove debris therefrom. Indeed, in some embodiments, the roller comprises one or more processes, members, brushes, and/or other objects that extend from the roller and the roller is powered (e.g., via a vacuum powered mechanism, motor, and/or any other suitable mechanism) to rotate.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0232">As another example of a suitable modification, some embodiments of the wand <b>100</b> comprise one or more vibrating mechanisms that are configured to vibrate the wand head <b>104</b> (e.g., to help agitate the surface being cleaned).

Indeed, in some embodiments, one or more portions of the system <b>10</b> are disposed on a vehicle <b>99</b> (e.g., a truck, van, trailer, car, bus, tractor, forklift, and/or any other suitable vehicle). For instance, in some embodiments, the vehicle comprises one or more cells <b>12</b> (e.g., cells comprising a soda ash and/or any other suitable non-NaCl electrolyte, cells that recirculate anolyte, cell that lack a membrane separating their electrode compartments (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>), cells that monitor and adjust one or more of their operating parameters based on sensor readings, and/or any other suitable cells), vacuums, wands <b>100</b>, pumps (e.g., to pump product from the cell to a wand and/or other delivery and/or extraction device), tanks <b>40</b> and/or <b>46</b>, power supplies <b>51</b>, water softeners <b>24</b>, and/or any other suitable components (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>L-<b>1</b>O</figref>). Thus, in some embodiments, electrolyzed water (e.g., alkaline water and/or any other suitable product) is produced on the vehicle for delivery to a surface to be cleaned (e.g., via the wand <b>100</b> and/or in any other suitable manner). In some such cases, such water is delivered from the vehicle to a surface to be cleaned (e.g., via one or more pumps, hoses, wands <b>100</b>, and/or other suitable components). In some such cases, such electrolyzed water is then sucked up and returned to the vehicle (e.g., tank <b>46</b>), to a drain, and/or to any other suitable location. Accordingly, in some cases, the described system is substantially contained in and/or on the vehicle and/or is otherwise portable. In this regard, while the vehicle can carry its own water, in some embodiments, it receives some water at its point of use (e.g., from a municipal water supply and/or from any other suitable source). Additionally, as some embodiments of the system recirculate anolyte and/or use a non-NaCl electrolyte, some such embodiments, can produce relatively little waste and leave little to no NaCl residue in the material being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0294">In some cases, the systems and methods further comprise using a counter rotating brush device (e.g., as described herein) to pull up hair and other debris from the surface being cleaning. In this regard, the counter rotating brush can be used at any suitable time, including, without limitation, before or after the application of the electrolyzed water to such surface.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0295">In some cases, the systems and methods further comprise applying the cleaning agent (e.g., as described above) to the surface being cleaned. In this regard, such cleaning agent can be applied at any suitable time (e.g., prior, during, and/or after: use of the counter rotating device on the material, application of the electrolyzed water to the material, removal of the electrolyzed water to the mater, and/or at any other suitable time). Indeed, in some embodiments, such cleaning agent is applied to the material being cleaned (e.g., flooring) before such material is cleaned with the electrolyzed water.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0296">While the described system <b>10</b> (e.g., cell <b>12</b>) can function in any suitable manner, an example of a suitable method is described herein. In this regard, it is noted that all of the methods described herein (and each and every portion thereof) can be changed, repeated, omitted, performed partially, mixed with another portion, substituted, replaced, reordered, reconfigured, and/or can otherwise be modified in any suitable manner. In this regard, in some embodiments, the cell is turned on as part of the method (e.g., via one or more switches, by being plugged into a power source, via the control system <b>38</b>, by a user, and/or in any other suitable manner).</p><p id="p-0301" num="0297">In some embodiments, once the cell is turned on, the cell is in an idle position.

Additionally, in some embodiments, the system does not produce product (e.g., electrolyzed water) when an emergency stop or reset is engaged. Accordingly, in some cases, the system checks to ensure that an emergency stop or reset is not engaged.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0298">In some cases, when the system starts up, it either receives supply water pressure through the cell's fluid inlet <b>20</b> (e.g., via a municipal water supply, a pump, and/or in any other suitable manner). In some cases, as the system is set up to produce product (e.g., electrolyzed alkaline water and/or any other suitable product), an operator and/or the control system <b>38</b> verifies that an amperage limit of the cell <b>12</b> is set to value to produce NaOH (and/or any other suitable product) at a desired levels.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0299">In some cases, the operator and/or control system <b>38</b> verifies (e.g., by looking and/or via one or more sensors and/or measurement mechanisms) that an electrolyte storage take (e.g., a storage tank <b>62</b> comprising sodium carbonate and/or any other suitable electrolyte) has an adequate amount (e.g., level) of electrolyte and/or electrolyte solution. In some cases, the method also includes having an operator and/or the control system verify (e.g., by looking and/or via one or more sensors and/or measurement mechanisms) that a level of fluid (e.g., anolyte) in the acid recirculation tank <b>64</b> is at or above a minimum level.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0300">In some cases, when the user activates the cell <b>12</b>, the system <b>10</b> (e.g., the control device <b>38</b>) is configured to reset any active alarms in the system (e.g., indicating that product pH is outside of a set range, indicating that electrolyte conductivity is outside of a set range, etc.). Additionally, in some cases, when the cell is activated, the system allows one or more fluids to flow through the cell. In this regard, the system can allow fluid to flow into one or more compartments of the cell in any suitable manner, including, without limitation, by opening one or more valves on the inlet <b>20</b>, actuating one or more pumps <b>28</b>, and/or in any other suitable manner. Moreover, in some cases, as the cell begins to function one or more recirculation pumps <b>29</b> start and/or valves <b>26</b> open to recirculate electrolyte (e.g., anolyte, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>F</figref>) through the cell. In some cases, the system <b>10</b> also checks anolyte and catholyte flows to ensure they are at a set level and/or to modify the flows to meet a desired rate.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0301">In some cases, the power supply <b>51</b> (e.g., a variable power supply and/or any other power supply) also provides electricity to the electrodes <b>17</b> to cause electrolysis within the cell. In some such cases, the system is then configured to automatically provide additional electrolyte and/or electrolyte solution to the cell (e.g., the anolyte flow) via one or more pumps <b>28</b>, feeders <b>34</b>, valves <b>26</b>, and/or in any other suitable manner. Indeed, in some embodiments, the system is configured to add additional electrolyte into the cell until the power supply's amps reach a set limit and/or voltage in the cell begins to drop. In some such cases, the system is configured to tailor (e.g., in near real time, intermittently, constantly, and/or in any other suitable manner) the amount of electrolyte that is added to the cell to help the cell maintain a desired voltage within the cell. Indeed, in accordance with some embodiments, product quality (e.g., the quality of the produced electrolyzed alkaline water and/or any other product) is determined by keeping catholyte inlet flow, and/or anolyte flow within expected limits and/or the power supply voltage at a desired set point.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0302">In some embodiments, the system <b>10</b> is configured to keep the amperage supplied by the power supply <b>51</b> substantially constant and to vary the electrolyte concentration in the cell so as to compensate for fluctuations in fluid conductivity in one or more portions of the cell.
