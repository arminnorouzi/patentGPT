id="p-0031" num="0030">Although specific configurations and arrangements are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustrative purposes only. As such, other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Also, the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications. Functional and structural features as described in the present disclosures can be combined, adjusted, and modified with one another and in ways not specifically depicted in the drawings, such that these combinations, adjustments, and modifications are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be readily understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest manner such that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; something but also includes the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something with an intermediate feature or a layer therebetween, and that &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; not only means the meaning of &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something but can also include the meaning it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something with no intermediate feature or layer therebetween (i.e., directly on something).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a material onto which subsequent material layers are added. The substrate itself can be patterned. Materials added on top of the substrate can be patterned or can remain unpatterned. Furthermore, the substrate can include a wide array of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, etc. Alternatively, the substrate can be made from an electrically non-conductive material, such as a glass, a plastic, or a sapphire wafer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layers thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers. For example, an interconnect layer can include one or more conductors and contact layers (in which interconnect lines and/or vertical interconnect access (via) contacts are formed) and one or more dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With the development of 3D memory devices, such as 3D NAND Flash memory device, the more stacked layers (e.g., word lines) require more peripheral circuits for operating the 3D memory devices. In particular, the number and/or size of page buffers need to increase to match the increased number of memory cells. In some cases, the chip area occupied by page buffers can become dominating in a 3D NAND Flash memory, for example, more than 50% of the total chip area. Moreover, in some 3D memory devices in which the memory cell array and peripheral circuits are fabricated on different substrates and bonded together, the continuous increase of peripheral circuits' areas, particularly page buffers' area, makes it the bottleneck for reducing the total chip size.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">One way to reduce the size of the peripheral circuits is to shrink the transistor area by gate width and length shrinkage, which, however, can cause channel leakage degradation, thereby limiting the device area shrinkage percentage. Thus, the reduction of the peripheral circuits in 3D memory devices without sacrificing much performance has become more and more challenging.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To address the aforementioned issues, the present disclosure introduces a solution in which the recess gate transistors replace the flat gate transistors in forming some of the peripheral circuits in a memory device, such as a 3D NAND Flash memory device. That is, the peripheral circuits can have a mixed type of transistors (both recess gate transistors and flat gate transistors), which can balance the device size shrinkage and the performance degradation. Consistent with the scope of the present disclosure, in some implementations, the page buffer, the dominating factor of chip size, has recess gate transistors instead of flat gate transistors in order to shrink the device size while maintaining the comparable or even better device leakage performance. The peripheral circuits other than the page buffer can still use flat gate transistors, which can reduce the fabrication complexity and device structure and performance variations compared to using recess gate transistors.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a schematic view of a cross-section of an exemplary 3D memory device <b>100</b>, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. 3D memory device <b>100</b> represents an example of a bonded chip. The components of 3D memory device <b>100</b> (e.g., memory cell array and peripheral circuits) can be formed separately on different substrates and then jointed to form a bonded chip. 3D memory device <b>100</b> can include a first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> including an array of memory cells (memory cell array). In some implementations, the memory cell array includes an array of NAND Flash memory cells. For ease of description, a NAND Flash memory cell array may be used as an example for describing the memory cell array in the present disclosure. But it is understood that the memory cell array is not limited to NAND Flash memory cell array and may include any other suitable types of memory cell arrays, such as NOR Flash memory cell array, phase change memory (PCM) cell array, resistive memory cell array, magnetic memory cell array, spin transfer torque (STT) memory cell array, to name a few.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">First semiconductor structure <b>102</b> can be a NAND Flash memory device in which memory cells are provided in the form of an array of 3D NAND memory strings and/or an array of two-dimensional (2D) NAND memory cells. NAND memory cells can be organized into pages, which are then organized into blocks in which each NAND memory cell is electrically connected to a separate line called a bit line (BL). All cells with the same vertical position in the NAND memory cell can be electrically connected through the control gates by a word line (WL). In some implementations, a plane contains a certain number of blocks that are electrically connected through the same bit line. First semiconductor structure <b>102</b> can include one or more planes, and the peripheral circuits that are needed to perform all the read/write/erase operations can be included in a second semiconductor structure <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, the array of NAND memory cells is an array of 2D NAND memory cells, each of which includes a floating-gate transistor. The array of 2D NAND memory cells include a plurality of 2D NAND memory strings, each of which includes a plurality of memory cells (e.g., 32 to 128 memory cells) connected in series (resembling a NAND gate) and two select transistors, according to some implementations. Each 2D NAND memory string is arranged in the same plane on the substrate (in 2D), according to some implementations. In some implementations, the array of NAND memory cells is an array of 3D NAND memory strings, each of which extends vertically above the substrate (in 3D) through a memory stack. Depending on the 3D NAND technology (e.g., the number of layers/tiers in the memory stack), a 3D NAND memory string typically includes 32 to 256 NAND memory cells, each of which includes a floating-gate transistor or a charge-trap transistor.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, 3D memory device <b>100</b> can also include second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> including the peripheral circuits of the memory cell array of first semiconductor structure <b>102</b>. The peripheral circuits (also known as control and sensing circuits) can include any suitable digital, analog, and/or mixed-signal circuits used for facilitating the operations of the memory cell array. For example, the peripheral circuit can include one or more of a page buffer, a decoder (e.g., a row decoder and a column decoder), a sense amplifier, a driver (e.g., a word line driver), a charge pump, a current or voltage reference, or any active or passive components of the circuit (e.g., transistors, diodes, resistors, or capacitors). In some implementations, the peripheral circuits in second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> use metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology, e.g., which can be implemented with advanced logic processes (e.g., technology nodes of 90 nm, 65 nm, 45 nm, 32 nm, 28 nm, 20 nm, 16 nm, 14 nm, 10 nm, 7 nm, 5 nm, 3 nm, 2 nm, etc.) to achieve high speed. It is understood that in some examples, other processing units (also known as &#x201c;logic circuits&#x201d;) besides the peripheral circuits may be formed in second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> as well, such as a memory controller or a processor. It is further understood that second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> may also include other memory devices that are compatible with the fabrication process of the logic circuits (e.g., using MOS technology), such as static random-access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRM).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, 3D memory device <b>100</b> further includes a bonding interface <b>106</b> vertically between first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and second semiconductor structure <b>104</b>. As described below in detail, first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> can be fabricated separately (and in parallel in some implementations) such that the thermal budget of fabricating one of first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> does not limit the processes of fabricating another one of first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Moreover, a large number of interconnects (e.g., bonding contacts) can be formed through bonding interface <b>106</b> to make direct, short-distance (e.g., micron-level) electrical connections between first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and second semiconductor structure <b>104</b>, as opposed to the long-distance (e.g., millimeter or centimeter-level) chip-to-chip data bus on the circuit board, such as printed circuit board (PCB), thereby eliminating chip interface delay and achieving high-speed input/output (I/O) throughput with reduced power consumption. Data transfer between the memory cell array in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and the peripheral circuits in second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> can be performed through the interconnects (e.g., bonding contacts) across bonding interface <b>106</b>. By vertically integrating first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, the chip size can be reduced, and the memory cell density can be increased. Furthermore, as a &#x201c;unified&#x201d; chip, by integrating multiple discrete chips (e.g., various processors, controllers, and memories) into a single bonded chip (e.g., 3D memory device <b>100</b>), faster system speed and smaller PCB size can be achieved as well.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is understood that the relative positions of stacked first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are not limited. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a schematic view of a cross-section of another exemplary 3D memory device <b>101</b>, according to some implementations.

Data transfer between the memory cell array in first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and the peripheral circuits in second semiconductor structure <b>104</b> can be performed through the interconnects (e.g., bonding contacts) across bonding interface <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic circuit diagram of an exemplary memory device <b>200</b> including peripheral circuits having a page buffer, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. Memory device <b>200</b> can include a memory cell array <b>201</b> and peripheral circuits <b>202</b> coupled to memory cell array <b>201</b>. 3D memory devices <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> may be examples of memory device <b>200</b> in which memory cell array <b>201</b> and peripheral circuits <b>202</b> may be included in first and second semiconductor structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively. Memory cell array <b>201</b> can be a NAND Flash memory cell array in which memory cells <b>206</b> are provided in the form of an array of NAND memory strings <b>208</b> each extending vertically above a substrate (not shown). In some implementations, each NAND memory string <b>208</b> includes a plurality of memory cells <b>206</b> coupled in series and stacked vertically. Each memory cell <b>206</b> can hold a continuous, analog value, such as an electrical voltage or charge, that depends on the number of electrons trapped within a region of memory cell <b>206</b>. Each memory cell <b>206</b> can be either a floating gate type of memory cell including a floating-gate transistor or a charge trap type of memory cell including a charge-trap transistor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations, each memory cell <b>206</b> is a single-level cell (SLC) that has two possible memory states and thus, can store one bit of data. For example, the first memory state &#x201c;0&#x201d; can correspond to a first range of voltages, and the second memory state &#x201c;1&#x201d; can correspond to a second range of voltages. In some implementations, each memory cell <b>206</b> is a multi-level cell (MLC) that is capable of storing more than a single bit of data in more than four memory states. For example, the MLC can store two bits per cell, three bits per cell (also known as triple-level cell (TLC)), or four bits per cell (also known as a quad-level cell (QLC)). Each MLC can be programmed to assume a range of possible nominal storage values. In one example, if each MLC stores two bits of data, then the MLC can be programmed to assume one of three possible programming levels from an erased state by writing one of three possible nominal storage values to the cell. A fourth nominal storage value can be used for the erased state.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each NAND memory string <b>208</b> can include a source select gate (SSG) <b>210</b> at its source end and a drain select gate (DSG) <b>212</b> at its drain end.

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a plan view and a side view of cross-sections of an exemplary flat gate transistor, according to some aspects of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates a plan view and a side view of cross-sections of an exemplary recess gate transistor, according to some aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, for a flat gate transistor, the effective channel length Leff is the same as the gate length L, whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, for a recess gate transistor, the effective channel length Leff=Lb+2Ld&#x2212;2xj, where Lb represents the gate length at the bottom of the gate structure protruding into the substrate, Ld represents the depth of the gate structure protruding into the substrate (considering the slope for better accuracy if the slope is not 90 degrees), and xj represents the junction depth of the source/drain. For a flat gate transistor, the reduction of device area can be achieved by reducing the gate length L (and also gate width W in some cases), which in turn reduces the effective channel length. As a result, channel leakage can be degraded. In contrast, for a recess gate transistor, the reduction of the device area (e.g., by reducing the gate length L) may not reduce the effective channel length Leff due to the addition of Ld. Moreover, better gate control can be realized due to the protrusion shape of the recess gate structure. Thus, the device area can be reduced while keeping comparable or even better device leakage performance. On the other hand, the protrusion shape of the recess gate structure in recess gate transistors may also introduce higher fabrication complexity and device variations compared with the flat gat transistors.
