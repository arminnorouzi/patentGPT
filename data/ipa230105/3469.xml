This may be due to people or machines inside the building. The heat may be from external sources, such as the sun, or internal sources such as server rooms that generate heat within the building. Regardless of the source, heat may need to be reduced. It is common to lower heat within a building using a cooling tower. It is also possible to use a refrigeration system, referred to as an HVAC. This invention is for use with a cooling tower for use in cooling the building down.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The general functionality of a cooling tower is to circulate cool water from the cooling tower to the building, where it acts as a heat sink&#x2014;heat from the building is reduced by it warming the cool water. The warm water is then circulated back to the cooling tower where it is cooled and the pumped to the building again in a constant cycle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cooling tower systems are widely used to provide cooling in industrial and commercial applications such as building HVAC, cold storage, and industrial cooling. Open recirculating cooling towers save tremendous amounts of energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to air cooled systems. The basic parts of such a cooling system are the cooling tower, a water pump, and a heat exchanger. There are one or more pipes that carry warm water from the building and connect with piping in the cooling tower, at or near the top of the cooling tower. Likewise, there are one or more pipes that carry cool water from piping in the cooling tower, at or near the bottom of the cooling tower, and connect to the building. So, the water being supplied to the building comes from the lower pipes. It is desirable to supply the building with cold water. Warm water will be returned to the cooling tower because it will pick up some of the heat out the building to carry the heat away. Then the cooling tower will get rid of that heat and once the heat is removed the then cooled water can be sent back again to the building. The process will continue in order that heat can continually be removed from the building. Cooled water from the cooling tower is pumped through the heat exchanger in the building to be cooled and the cool water picks up heat. The now warm water is distributed over the top of a plurality of plates, the plurality of plates collectively called fill, in the tower. Relatively cool air moves past the warm water, cooling the water which is then recirculated through the building in a cycle. The basin water level drops due to these losses and more makeup water is added to maintain level.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">HPC is a combination splash/film fill that is available with a standard wetted surface area of 35.3 ft<sup>2</sup>/ft<sup>3</sup>. It has a high specific surface area.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">HPC is durable and is unaffected by the harsh environments encountered in cooling towers.

HPC introduces ceramic materials into this well-known vertical flow design to produce a low-fouling media with an expected service life of 50 years and more.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">HPC performs similar to traditional cellular ceramic fill blocks; however, in a significantly reduced plan area and with less total fan horsepower to result in valuable real estate and energy savings. When compared to cross-corrugated PVC film fill, HPC produces similar performance without the thermal performance degradation that is normally associated with the high fouling rate and shorter useful operating life of PVC film fills.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Plate spacing for HPC can be readily varied for custom design configurations to address the dirtiest water applications.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">HPC, in normal configuration, weighs about half that of traditional cellular ceramic block fill, which results in lower structure, basin and foundation costs.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specification for Full Size Plates shown as one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">300 mm&#xd7;600 mm&#xd7;4 mm Unglazed Tiles</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">1.

In order to function, warmed water <b>102</b><i>b </i>from the building <b>100</b> runs through top pipes <b>14</b> and into upper pipes <b>12</b> to enter into the top, or near the top, of the cooling tower <b>10</b>. The cooled water <b>102</b><i>c </i>from the cooling tower <b>10</b> exits the cooling tower <b>10</b> at the bottom, or near the bottom, of the cooling tower <b>10</b> through the bottom pipes <b>16</b> and into lower pipes <b>18</b> into the building <b>100</b>. One or more pumps <b>20</b> may be in operative communication with the top pipes <b>14</b>, upper pipes <b>12</b>, bottom pipes <b>16</b>, or lower pipes <b>18</b> in order to cause, or help to cause, water to flow through the cooling system.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Thus, warmer water enters the cooling tower <b>10</b> through one or more upper pipes <b>12</b>. The warmer water is distributed, or flows, through a piping system <b>28</b>. The piping system <b>28</b> distributes the warm water about the upper area of the cooling tower <b>10</b>. Sprayers <b>30</b> are in operative communication with the piping system <b>28</b>. The warm water moves through the piping system <b>28</b> and is sprinkled out of the sprayers <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Below the piping system <b>28</b> and the sprayers <b>30</b> is the fill <b>32</b>. The fill <b>32</b> is made up of a plurality of ceramic plates <b>34</b>, and consists of a plurality of individual ceramic plates <b>34</b> which are arrayed in fill bundles <b>36</b> using retainers <b>60</b>. Generally, a cooling tower <b>10</b> has multiple fill bundles <b>36</b> placed next to one another in a layer <b>46</b> of fill bundles <b>36</b>. And, multiple layers <b>46</b> stacked on top of one another. The fill bundles <b>36</b> hold the faces <b>66</b> of the individual plates <b>34</b> generally vertically such that the water <b>102</b><i>a </i>dropping down hits the plates <b>34</b> on the plate top edge <b>40</b> or on the plate face <b>38</b> near the plate top edge <b>40</b>, and runs down the face <b>38</b> to the plate bottom edge <b>42</b>. Water <b>102</b><i>a </i>is sprayed over the top layer <b>46</b>, and the water <b>102</b><i>a </i>runs down the plate faces <b>38</b> of the bundles <b>36</b> and layers <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The plates <b>34</b> are generally rectangular, having a top edge <b>40</b>, two (2) opposing side edges <b>44</b>, and a bottom edge <b>42</b> opposite the top edge <b>40</b>. The top <b>40</b>, side <b>44</b>, and bottom <b>42</b> edges bound two (2) faces <b>38</b>. The edges (<b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>44</b>) may be linear but may also be curved, angled, or scalloped. Consequently, the faces <b>38</b> are generally planar, but may not be absolutely planar, and are not necessarily planar. Therefore, herein, reference to a face <b>38</b> being &#x201c;planar&#x201d; does not mean that the face <b>38</b> is absolutely flat, because while it can be flat, it may also be angled or curved.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In order to cool the warm water <b>102</b><i>b</i>, the warm water <b>102</b><i>b </i>sprays onto the fill <b>32</b> and plates <b>34</b>. The water <b>102</b><i>a </i>on the fill plates <b>34</b> trickles down into the gaps between the plates <b>34</b>. The water <b>102</b><i>a </i>drops form a film or thin layer of water <b>102</b><i>a </i>on the plate <b>34</b> and the water <b>102</b><i>a </i>tends to run down the faces <b>38</b>. The plate <b>34</b> acts as a heat exchanger because the drops of water <b>102</b><i>a </i>forms a film of water <b>102</b><i>a </i>on the face <b>38</b>. The area of the faces <b>38</b> is relatively large to the thickness of the film of water <b>102</b><i>a</i>. The cooling tower <b>10</b> actually has two ways of cooling. The first is that the water <b>102</b><i>b </i>sprays out of the sprayer <b>30</b> and lands on the plate <b>34</b> (which is effectively a heat exchanger), the air then comes in contact with the water <b>102</b><i>b </i>and takes the heat away. The second mechanism is that some of that water <b>102</b><i>b </i>will also evaporate and that also creates an additional cooling effect.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In order to get rid of the heat that the warm water <b>102</b><i>b </i>contains, air is drawn in from air outside of the cooling tower <b>10</b> through vents <b>48</b> generally near the bottom of the cooling tower <b>10</b>. The air moves up through the layers <b>46</b> of fill <b>32</b> to the top or near the top of the cooling tower <b>10</b> where it exits the cooling tower <b>10</b> through ports <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Generally near the top of the cooling tower <b>10</b> is a fan <b>56</b>, or fans <b>56</b>. The fan <b>56</b> is positioned so as to pull air upward from the bottom of the cooling tower <b>10</b> and push the air out of the cooling tower <b>10</b> at or near the top. This type of cooling tower <b>10</b> is called an &#x201c;induced mechanical draft cooling tower.&#x201d; If the fan <b>56</b> was installed at the bottom of the cooling tower <b>10</b> and pushed the air up through the fill <b>32</b>, then it is called a &#x201c;forced mechanical draft cooling tower.&#x201d; There are other types and mechanisms for cooling towers <b>10</b>, but all work generally the same&#x2014;air traveling across the wet plates <b>34</b> in order to cool the warm water <b>102</b><i>b </i>&#x2014;even though they may have different embodiments.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Between the fill <b>32</b> and the ports <b>52</b> (in addition to the piping system <b>28</b> and sprayers <b>30</b>), the cooling tower <b>10</b> may have drift eliminators <b>54</b>. There is a loss of water <b>102</b><i>a </i>to the environment due to the evaporative cooling process. A drift eliminator <b>54</b> is designed to capture large water droplets caught in the cooling tower <b>10</b> air stream. The drift eliminator <b>54</b> helps prevent the water <b>102</b><i>a </i>droplets and mist from escaping the cooling tower <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Because of the shape of the plate face <b>38</b>, the water <b>102</b><i>b </i>is spread out over a very large cross-sectional area. Thus, the warm water <b>102</b><i>b </i>is coming into contact with the air. The air is relatively cooler than the warm water <b>102</b><i>b</i>. The large face <b>38</b> area in contact with the thin film of warm water <b>102</b><i>b </i>causes a large heat transfer rate. The air takes away as much heat as possible in as short amount of time as possible, and the warm water <b>102</b><i>b </i>is cooled, becoming cool water <b>102</b><i>c</i>. Thus, as air exits the fill <b>32</b>, it is warmer. Conversely, as the water <b>102</b><i>a </i>exits the bottom of the fill <b>32</b>, it is cooler. The cool water <b>102</b><i>c </i>then drops off of the fill <b>32</b> and into a reservoir <b>58</b>. The cool water <b>102</b><i>c </i>then can exit the cooling tower <b>10</b> through the bottom pipes <b>16</b> and on to the building <b>100</b> through the lower pipes <b>18</b>. Water <b>102</b><i>c </i>flow may be helped by pumps <b>20</b>. Once in the building <b>100</b>, the cool water <b>102</b><i>c </i>flows through interior pipe <b>22</b> and through a heat exchanger <b>26</b> where the cool water <b>102</b><i>c </i>cools the air for distribution through in the building and the consequently warmed water <b>102</b><i>b </i>begins the process again.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows side view of a portion of a fill bundle <b>36</b> and retainer <b>60</b>. The fill bundle <b>36</b> is made up of a multiplicity of plates <b>34</b> which are held in place by a retainer <b>60</b>. The retainers <b>60</b> hold the plates <b>34</b> upright and separated from each other. The retainer <b>60</b> may be generally described as &#x201c;S&#x201d; shaped. The upper, alpha portion of the retainer <b>34</b> is mirrored by the lower, beta portion of the retainer <b>34</b>. The retainer <b>34</b> from top to bottom is comprised of a first end <b>62</b> connected to a first arm <b>66</b>. The first arm <b>66</b> is angled outwardly between the first end <b>62</b> and a first peak <b>70</b>.

Along the retainer <b>60</b>, there are a multiplicity of first beta slots <b>64</b>. The first alpha slot <b>68</b> is an opening that extends between the first arm <b>66</b>, the first peak <b>70</b>, and the second arm <b>72</b>. Along the retainer <b>60</b>, there are a multiplicity of first alpha slots <b>68</b>.

Along the retainer <b>60</b>, there are a multiplicity of second alpha slots <b>74</b>. The second beta slot <b>80</b> is an opening that extends between the third arm <b>78</b> and the second end <b>82</b>. Along the retainer <b>60</b>, there are a multiplicity of second beta slots <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The first beta slot <b>64</b> is in line with the second alpha slot <b>74</b>, such that a plate <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> may be inserted into both the first beta slot <b>64</b> and the second alpha slot <b>74</b>, and held generally upright. Likewise, the first alpha slot <b>68</b> is in line with the second beta slot <b>80</b>, such that a plate <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> may be inserted into both the first alpha slot <b>68</b> and the second beta slot <b>80</b>, and held generally upright. The first beta slot <b>64</b> and the second alpha slot <b>74</b> combination is offset from the first alpha slot <b>68</b> and the second beta slot <b>80</b> combination. This allows the retainer <b>60</b> to hold a first multiplicity of plates <b>34</b> on a first side and a second multiplicity of plates <b>34</b> opposite the first multiplicity of plates on a second side. Each of the slots <b>64</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>80</b>, are sized in width to be just larger than the width of the plates <b>34</b> such that a plate <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> may be urged into the first beta slot <b>64</b> and the second alpha slot <b>74</b> combination and a plate <b>34</b>-<b>2</b> may be urged into the first alpha slot <b>68</b> and the second beta slot <b>80</b> combination. Because there are a multiplicity of these slot combinations along the length of the retainer <b>60</b>, the retainer <b>60</b> can hold a multiplicity of plates <b>34</b> in an upright position on the retainer's <b>60</b> first and second sides.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective front view of a portion of a fill bundle <b>36</b> and retainers <b>60</b>.

The fill plate <b>34</b> has a top edge <b>40</b> opposite a bottom edge <b>42</b>, end a first side edge <b>44</b>-<b>1</b> opposite a second side edge <b>44</b>-<b>2</b>. The top edge <b>40</b>, bottom edge <b>42</b>, first side edge <b>44</b>-<b>1</b>, and the second side edge <b>44</b>-<b>2</b> outline, or define, a first face <b>38</b>-<b>1</b> and an opposing, or backing, second face <b>38</b>-<b>2</b>. The plates <b>34</b> feature scalloped top and bottom edges (<b>40</b> and <b>42</b>) which reduce flow restrictions between layers. The ribbed surface pattern of veins <b>50</b> on the faces (<b>38</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>38</b>-<b>2</b>) of the fill plate <b>34</b> may be cross-hatched and promotes uniform water distribution over the faces (<b>38</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>38</b>-<b>2</b>) of the fill plate <b>34</b>. The veins <b>50</b> increase water dwell time and increases airflow turbulence. All of these attributes increase heat transfer between the air and the warm water <b>102</b><i>b </i>on the faces (<b>38</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>38</b>-<b>2</b>) of the fill plate <b>34</b>. It is expected that the plates <b>34</b> will be made of HPC as described herein. The scalloped top and bottom edges (<b>40</b> and <b>42</b>) may be offset in adjoining plates <b>34</b>.

Conventional technology requires multiple copper tubes, with each copper tube &#x201c;crimped&#x201d; at each plate to provide the uniform plate <b>34</b> spacing. This spacing method is disadvantageous due to &#x201c;racking and misalignment&#x201d; of the plates over time. Further, the conventional technology requires that if a single plate needs to be replaced, the entire fill bundle <b>36</b> must be removed due to the continuous multiple crimped copper tubes that act as the uniform spacers for an entire assembled unit bundle. The retainer <b>60</b> eliminate the &#x201c;racking and misalignment&#x201d; possibilities, and very importantly allow for removal of single ceramic plates in a &#x201c;fill bundle&#x201d; without disturbing adjacent plates. Entire fill bundle replacement is eliminated. The retainer <b>60</b> design preserves the original plate <b>34</b> spacing to maintain the original thermal performance, if plate <b>34</b> removal is ever required over time. Thus, the overall plate bundle integrity for continued &#x201c;original&#x201d; thermal performance capability is preserved.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Additionally, the offset, scalloped plates <b>34</b> provide for an &#x201c;egg crate&#x201d; installation.
