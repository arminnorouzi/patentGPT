However, control of playing game of chance is difficult to monitor when game play is on a mobile device and in a movable environment, such as a cruise ship. There are national and international laws, as well as any other user desired criteria that need to be considered.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention provides for the control of mobile game play on a mobile vessel. In one embodiment, a determination of whether to permit or deny play of the on-board game of chance may be based upon at least a global and local device position of the mobile gaming device. In another embodiment, determination of whether to permit or deny play of the on-board game of chance may be based upon other predefined rules such as a time rule, captain's rule, user defined rules, and other criteria. For example, determination of whether to permit or deny play of the on-board game of chance may be based upon whether the vessel is in international or national waters.

Other embodiments will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure. Reference will now be made in detail to implementations as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference indicators will be used throughout the drawings and the following detailed description to refer to the same or like parts.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the interest of clarity, not all of the routine features of the implementations described herein are shown and described. It will, of course, be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention provides for the control of on-board game of chance play on a mobile device while on a vessel. A vessel may be any movable transport device such as an airplane, car, bus, and any vehicle in the water, such as cruiseliners, riverboats, and the like. In one embodiment, a determination of whether to permit or deny play of the on-board game of chance may be based upon at least a global and local device position of the mobile gaming device. In another embodiment, determination of whether to permit or deny play of the on-board game of chance may be based upon other predefined rules such as a time rule, captain's rule (e.g. any user desired defined rules), and other criteria. For example, determination of whether to permit or deny play of the on-board game of chance may be based upon whether the vessel is in international or national waters. In another example, determination of whether to permit or deny play of the on-board game of chance may be based upon the current time.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example block diagram of a game control system. The game control system<b>100</b> may have a mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> configured to communicate with a location server <b>104</b>, a gaming server <b>106</b>, and a vessel server <b>108</b>. The mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may be designed as an intermediary server to store data or information such as mobile gaming device information, gaming rules database, player gaming accounts, and any other desired data or information. The mobile gaming device information may be stored in the mobile gaming device database <b>110</b> and may include information such as the mobile gaming device identification, information of the user using the mobile gaming device <b>116</b>, programs on the mobile gaming device <b>116</b>, and other mobile gaming device data. The mobile gaming device <b>116</b> may be any type of portable mobile gaming device such as a mobile phone, a portable media player, a personal digital assistant, a portable gaming device, or any other similar device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The user of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> may also have a player gaming account <b>112</b>. The player gaming account <b>112</b> may store any information such as user contact information, available funds in the player gaming account, and any other player information. In one embodiment, any wins from a game of chance played by the user of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> may be stored in the player gaming account <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Gaming rules may be stored in the gaming rules database <b>114</b>. The rules may be any criteria used to determine whether to permit or deny play of the game of chance on the mobile device. For example, the determination of whether to permit or deny play of the game of chance may be based on at least the device position of the mobile gaming device and the location of the vessel. If the device is, for example, located near the childcare center and the vessel is in international waters, play of the game of chance may be denied. However, if the user is sitting at a bar and the vessel is in international waters, play of the game of chance may be granted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another example, determination to permit or deny play of the game of chance may also be based upon a time rule that may be predetermined by the vessel. For example, the vessel may set games of chance to be played between 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. Thus, if the request to play a game of chance is made at 3 a.m., play of the game of chance may be denied. If the request to play a game of chance is made at 12 p.m., play of the game of chance may be permitted.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may be configured to communicate with a gaming server <b>106</b>, which may be configured to communicate with the mobile gaming device <b>116</b>. The mobile gaming device <b>116</b> may transmit a request to the gaming server <b>106</b> to play at least one game of chance on the mobile gaming device. The gaming server <b>106</b> may transmit the request to play the game of chance to the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b>. The mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may then obtain a device position and a vessel position from the location server <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The location server <b>104</b> may be configured to determine the location of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> and the vessel. The location server <b>104</b> may have a global position server <b>118</b> to determine the location of the vessel relative to the globe, earth, or world. Global position server <b>118</b> may use any known position or location method to determine the location of the vessel such as cellular positioning, triangulation, global positioning systems, or any other location or positioning determining method.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The location server <b>104</b> may also have a device position server <b>120</b> designed or configured to determine the location of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> relative to the vessel. The device position of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> may be the position of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> relative to the vessel. The device position server <b>120</b> may use any known position or location method to determine the location of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> such as cellular positioning, triangulation, global positioning systems, or any other location or positioning determining method.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The location server <b>104</b> may have a location database <b>113</b> to store the global vessel position of the vessel and the device position of the mobile gaming device. The vessel position and device position may be associated with a mobile gaming device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may also be configured to communicate with a vessel server <b>108</b>. Vessel server <b>108</b> may be configured to store customer information in the passenger main account database <b>122</b>. The vessel server <b>108</b> may store information such as customer credit card information, address, username and password, date of birth, and any other desired information.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In use, when boarding a vessel, the passenger's information may be stored in the passenger main account <b>122</b> in the vessel server <b>108</b>. The passenger's information may include financial information such as credit card information, address, birth date, family members, room number, room key number, username and password, and any other desired or relevant passenger information.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The passenger may be associated with a mobile gaming device <b>116</b> used to play the game of chance. In one embodiment, the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> may be provided to the passenger. In another embodiment, the passenger may utilize his own mobile gaming device <b>116</b>. The passenger may request to play a game of chance on the mobile gaming device <b>116</b>. The passenger may also be authenticated and/or verified by including the passenger's username and password with the request. However, any other authentication and/or verification method may be used to authenticate and/or verify the user of the mobile gaming device such as biometric verification (i.e. voice recognition, retinal scan, fingerprint verification, and the like).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The request to play a game of chance may be transmitted from the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> to the gaming server <b>106</b>. The gaming server <b>106</b> may transmit the request to the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b>. The mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may determine whether the passenger has a player gaming account <b>112</b>. If the passenger does not have a player gaming account <b>112</b>, a player gaming account <b>112</b> may be created for the passenger.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may obtain location information from the location server <b>104</b>. The global position server <b>118</b> may determine a global vessel position of the vessel. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, an example diagram of a vessel position of a cruise ship, the global position server may use any location or position determination methods to determine the position of the cruise ship <b>202</b>. Although example embodiments illustrate the vessel as a cruise ship, this is not intended to be limiting as any vessel may be used such as a riverboat, and any other movable transport device. The cruise ship <b>202</b> may be positioned or located in international waters <b>206</b> or national waters <b>204</b>. Thus, the vessel position may be a global position relative to the world <b>200</b>. As illustrated, the cruise ship <b>202</b> is located in international waters <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the device position server <b>120</b> of the location server <b>104</b> may determine a device position of the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> relative to the vessel. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, an example layout of a cruise ship, the cruise ship <b>210</b> may have a main pool <b>212</b>, pool bar <b>214</b>, children's pool <b>216</b>, restaurant <b>218</b>, night club/bar <b>220</b>, kids club or childcare center <b>222</b>, reception <b>224</b>, and gift store <b>226</b> on its main deck. Although example embodiments illustrate the vessel as a cruise ship, this is not intended to be limiting as the vessel may be a car, bus, airplane, train, riverboat, and any other movable transport device. Specific gaming areas may be predetermined on the cruise ship <b>210</b>. For example, games of chance may be played at the main pool <b>212</b>, pool bar <b>214</b>, and night club/bar <b>220</b> on the main deck. Games of chance may not be permitted to be played at the children's pool <b>216</b>, restaurant <b>218</b>, kids club or childcare center <b>222</b>, reception <b>224</b>, and gift store <b>226</b>. In one example, passenger A <b>228</b> may want to play a game of chance while lounging at the main pool <b>212</b>. The location server may determine that the device position of the mobile gaming device is at or around the main pool area <b>212</b>. In another embodiment, passenger B <b>230</b> may want to play a game of chance while at the kids club or childcare center <b>222</b>. The location server <b>104</b> may determine that the device position of the mobile gaming device is at or around the childcare center <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, once the vessel position and device position are determined, the information may be associated with the mobile gaming device and stored in the location database <b>113</b>. The mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may request and obtain location information for each mobile gaming device from the location server <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once obtained, the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may determine whether play of the game of chance is permitted on the mobile gaming device. The determination may be based upon the gaming rules stored in the gaming rules database <b>114</b>. For example, since passenger A is located at the main pool area where playing games of chance are permitted, the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may determine that the game of chance may be played on the mobile gaming device <b>116</b> of passenger A.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, since passenger B is located at the childcare center where playing games of chance are not permitted, the request to play the game of chance will be denied. In this embodiment, a denial message may be transmitted to the mobile gaming device of passenger B. The denial message may also include at least one reason for the denial of the transfer fund request. For example, the denial message may display that games are chance are not permitted to be played in the childcare center.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since passenger A is permitted to play the game of chance, the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> the game of chance may be enabled on the mobile gaming device <b>116</b>. The gaming server <b>106</b> may transmit the requested game of chance to the mobile gaming device <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment, the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may also user other criteria to determine whether to permit or deny play of a game of chance. For example, one criterion may be a time rule. A time stamp on the request to play the game of chance may be used to determine whether the game of chance may be played on the mobile gaming device. If the time stamp was at 3 a.m., the game of chance may not be permitted to be played. If the time stamp was at 10 a.m., the game of chance may be permitted to be played. The time rule may also be updated based on different time zones.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another example, one criterion may be the age of the passenger. If the user information obtained from the passenger main account <b>122</b> indicates that the passenger is only 18 years old, based upon certain gaming rules, the game of chance may not be permitted to be played. It will now be appreciated that the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may use any other desired criteria to determine whether or not to permit play of the game of chance on the mobile gaming device <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates an example gaming rules table. The gaming rules table may be stored, for example, in the gaming rules database <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The gaming rules table <b>240</b> may include criteria used to determine whether to permit play of the game of chance <b>252</b> on the mobile gaming device. Each criterion may be associated with a device <b>242</b>. As illustrated, the criteria may be based on device position <b>244</b>, vessel position <b>246</b>, and time <b>248</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Device 1 <b>254</b> may be located at the main pool in international waters. A request to play a game of chance may be received at 11 a.m. Based on the device position, vessel position, and time rule, the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may determine that the game of chance may be played on the mobile gaming device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Device 2 <b>256</b> may be located at the childcare center in international waters. A request to play a game of chance may be received at 3 p.m. Based on the device position, vessel position, and time rule, the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may determine that the game of chance may not be played on the mobile gaming device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Device 3 <b>258</b> may be located at the night club in international waters. A request to play a game of chance may be received at 11 p.m. Based on the device position, vessel position, and time rule, the mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> may determine that the game of chance may be played on the mobile gaming device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example method for controlling play of a game of a chance on a cruise ship. The method <b>300</b> may begin with receiving a request to play a game of chance from a mobile gaming device at <b>302</b>. The request may be transferred to a gaming server, e.g. such as gaming server <b>106</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The gaming server may transmit the request to an intermediary server, e.g. such as mobile gaming management server <b>102</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The intermediary server may determine whether the passenger has a player gaming account at <b>304</b>. If the passenger does not have a player gaming account, a player gaming account may be created for the passenger <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The intermediary server may obtain a vessel position of the vessel and device position of the mobile gaming device at <b>308</b>. The vessel position and device position may be obtained from, for example, a location server e.g. such as location server <b>104</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The vessel position of the vessel may be a position relative to the world. The device position of the mobile gaming device may be a position relative to the vessel.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once obtained, the intermediary server may determine whether to permit or deny play of the game of chance at <b>310</b>. The determination may be based upon the gaming rules stored in a gaming rules database, e.g. such as gaming rules database <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the determination whether to permit or deny play of the game of chance may be based on at least the device position and the vessel position. In another embodiment, the determination whether to transfer permit or deny play of the game of chance may be based on at least time rules, user information, or any other predetermined criteria.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the intermediary server determines that play of the game of chance is not permitted at <b>310</b>, the method <b>300</b> may end. If the intermediary server determines that play of the game of chance is permitted at <b>310</b>, the game of chance may be enabled on the mobile gaming device at <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates another example method for controlling play of a game of a chance on a vessel. The method <b>400</b> may begin with the vessel position and device position being periodically updated at <b>402</b>. The vessel position and device position may be periodically updated by a location server, e.g. such as location server <b>104</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Updating the vessel position and device position ensures that play of the games of chance, are carried out only in allowable areas, environments and times. The intermediary server may determine whether the game of chance may be permitted to be played on the mobile gaming device at <b>404</b>. In one embodiment, the determination of whether the game of chance may be permitted to be played on the mobile gaming device may be based upon the updated vessel position and updated device position. For example, although the original device position may have been in an area where playing games of chance is permitted, the updated device position may now indicate the mobile gaming device is located at a location where playing games of chance is not permitted. In one embodiment, the determination of whether the game of chance may be permitted to be played on the mobile gaming device may also be based upon an updated time as well. For example, although the time may have been a time when playing games of chance is permitted (e.g. 7 am-3 am), the updated time may now indicate the mobile gaming device is being played at a time when playing games of chance is not permitted (e.g. 3 am-7 am).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">If it is determined that the game of chance of is permitted to be played at <b>404</b>, the method may continue at <b>402</b>. If it is determined that the game of chance is not permitted to be played at <b>404</b>, a termination notification may be transmitted to the mobile gaming device at <b>406</b>. In one embodiment, the termination notification may include at least one reason for termination of the game of chance. For example, the reason for termination may be based on the vessel position. The vessel may be entering into national waters from international waters. In another example, the reason for termination may be because the mobile gaming device entered an unauthorized location where playing games of chance are not permitted. In still another example, the reason for termination may be because the time restriction to end play of the game of chance is imminent. The game of chance may be terminated on the mobile gaming device within a predetermined time period at <b>408</b>. The predetermined time period may allow the player to complete play of the game of chance, cash out, and perform any other functions prior to ending play of the game of chance.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates another example method for controlling play of a game of a chance on a vessel.

However, since the access time to the file system <b>604</b> can be relatively slow, the computing device <b>600</b> can also include the cache <b>606</b>. The cache <b>606</b> is, for example, Random-Access Memory (RAM). The relative access time to the cache <b>606</b> is typically shorter than for the file system <b>604</b>. However, the cache <b>606</b> does not have the large storage capacity of the file system <b>604</b>. The computing device <b>600</b> also includes a RAM <b>620</b> and a Read-Only Memory (ROM) <b>622</b>. The ROM <b>622</b> can store programs, utilities or processes to be executed in a non-volatile manner. The RAM <b>620</b> provides volatile data storage, such as for the cache <b>606</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The computing device <b>600</b> may also include a user input device <b>608</b> that allows a user of the computing device <b>600</b> to interact with the computing device <b>600</b>. For example, the user input device <b>608</b> can take a variety of forms, such as a button, keypad, dial, touch-sensitive surface, joystick, and the like. Still further, the computing device <b>600</b> includes a display <b>610</b> (screen display) that can be controlled by the processor <b>602</b> to display information to the user. A data bus <b>611</b> can facilitate data transfer between at least the file system <b>604</b>, the cache <b>606</b>, the processor <b>602</b>, an audio coder/decoder (CODEC) <b>612</b> and/or a video CODEC <b>615</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, for example, if the computing device <b>600</b> (e.g. mobile gaming device <b>116</b>, cruise ship server <b>108</b>, mobile gaming management server <b>102</b>, location server <b>104</b>, gaming server <b>106</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is a mobile gaming device, the computing device <b>600</b> may store a plurality of games of chance in the file system <b>604</b>. When a user desires to have the computing device play a particular game of chance, a list of available games of chance is displayed on the display <b>610</b>. Then, using the user input device <b>608</b>, a user can select one of the games of chance to play. The processor <b>602</b>, upon receiving a selection of a particular media item, supplies the game of chance data to one or more appropriate output devices. If the particular media item is encrypted, the particular media item is first decrypted as noted above, which could involve one or more layers of encryption. As an example, for audio output, the processor <b>602</b> can supply the media data (e.g., audio file) for the particular media item to the audio CODEC <b>612</b>. The audio CODEC <b>612</b> can then produce analog output signals for a speaker <b>614</b>. The speaker <b>614</b> can be a speaker internal to the computing device <b>600</b> or external to the computing device <b>600</b>. For example, headphones or earphones that connect to the computing device <b>600</b> would be considered an external speaker. As another example, for video output, the processor <b>602</b> can supply the media data (e.g., video file) for the particular media item to the video CODEC <b>615</b>. The video CODEC <b>615</b> can then produce output signals for the display <b>610</b> and/or the speaker <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The computing device <b>600</b> also includes a network/bus interface <b>616</b> that couples to a data link <b>618</b>. The data link <b>618</b> allows the computing device <b>600</b> to couple to another device (e.g., a host computer, a power source, or an accessory device). The data link <b>618</b> can be provided over a wired connection or a wireless connection. In the case of a wireless connection, the network/bus interface <b>616</b> can include a wireless transceiver.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The various aspects, features, embodiments or implementations of the invention described above can be used alone or in various combinations.
