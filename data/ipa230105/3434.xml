If the outside temperature is high enough, the freezing agent is above the freezing temperature. If the outside temperature, however, drops, then the refrigerant circuit can be operating at a temperature below the freezing temperature and the water which has condensated on the evaporator is starting to freeze such that a hoar frost build-up is starting at the evaporator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, the water which is present between the fins of the evaporator starts to freeze such that the distance between adjacent fins, through which typically air is streaming, is reduced and the amount of air which can stream there through is reduced. In the worst case, the air stream is blocked such that no air can stream through the evaporator. In such a situation, a deicing or defrosting is required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For deicing or defrosting the evaporator, the compressor can be switched on and off in a cyclic manner. During the deicing or defrosting, the compressor is stopped such that the freezing agent is not flowing any more through the refrigerant circuit. On the other hand, the fan of the evaporator is still operating such that air is streaming through the evaporator and the ice between the fins is deiced or defrosted by the energy which is still present in the outside air. This deicing operation is only possible if the air temperature is above the freezing temperature. On the other hand, if the air is below 2&#xb0; C. (35.6&#xb0; F.), the defrosting operation can have a negative impact on the comfort of the user of the heat pump device as the ability of the heat pump device to produce sufficient hot water is reduced, i.e., the time required to heat sufficient water is increasing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It should further be noted that the rate at which ice or hoar frost build-up is present at the fins of the evaporator is not only dependent on the temperature of the outside air, but also the humidity of the air. In other words, the heat pump device must react differently to low temperatures which have a low air humidity than compared to low temperatures which also have a high air humidity. In the first case, the heat pump device may initiate a defrosting of the evaporator while a defrosting is not yet required.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed in more detail below is a method and system of defrosting or deicing a heat pump device which enables an effective deicing or defrosting.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a heat pump device according to an embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, many other elements which are conventional in this art. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other elements are desirable for implementing the present invention. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention will now be described in detail on the basis of exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a heat pump device according to an embodiment of the invention. The heat pump device HP is implemented as an air/water heat pump device <b>1</b>, HP. The heat pump device <b>1</b> comprises a storage tank <b>7</b> adapted for tap water or drinking water, a plate heat exchanger, in particular a roll bond (plate) heat exchanger <b>8</b> which can be arranged around the storage tanks <b>7</b>. Inside the storage tank <b>7</b>, an electrical heating element <b>5</b>, HE, can be arranged. The heat pump device <b>1</b> furthermore comprises an evaporator <b>3</b> with a fan <b>4</b>. A compressor, an expansion valve and a filter dryer are not disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the heat pump device <b>1</b> comprises a first temperature sensor T<b>1</b> which is measuring the temperature of the air in or at the evaporator which is sucked in by the fan <b>4</b> as well as a second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> which is arranged adjacent to or at the evaporator <b>3</b>. The second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is used to detect a hoar frost or ice build-up at the evaporator <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The heat pump device <b>1</b> furthermore comprises a control unit <b>9</b> which is adapted to control the operation of the electrical heating element <b>5</b> in order to control the temperature of the water inside the storage tank <b>7</b>. Optionally, the heat pump device <b>1</b> may comprise a user interface or an operating element <b>10</b>. By means of the user interface or the operating element <b>10</b>, the user can choose the set value of the temperature of the water inside the storage tank. Moreover, the user interface or the operating unit <b>10</b> can be used by the user to initiate an additional heating of the water inside the storage tank by means of the heating element <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electrical heating element <b>5</b> can be implemented as a tubular heating element or as a heating rod. The roll bond heat exchanger <b>8</b> (as part of the heat pump) is used as primary heating source for heating the water inside the storage tank <b>7</b>. The heating element <b>5</b> is used as secondary heating element e.g., for situations where the roll bond heat exchanger <b>8</b> is not able to provide sufficient energy to sufficiently heat the water inside the storage tank <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be noted that the primary heating via the roll bond heat exchanger <b>8</b> is more energy sufficient than the heating via the secondary electrical heating element, namely the heating element <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The heat pump device can be operated in different operating modes. The different operating modes can for example be activated by the control unit <b>9</b> in particular depending on the temperature as detected by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> as well as the first temperature sensor T<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is used to detect the hoar frost build-up at the evaporator. The temperature as sensed by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is compared in the control unit <b>9</b> with a stored set value. If the temperature as detected by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is below the set value, the heating operation of the heat pump device is stopped and the defrosting operation is initiated. The defrosting operation is continued until the hoar frost build-up at the evaporator is removed. This is in particular performed by melting the ice on the evaporator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As mentioned above, the defrosting or deicing can be performed by deactivating the compressor while the fan <b>4</b> of the evaporator <b>3</b> is still in operation until the temperature as detected by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is above 0&#xb0; C. For example, if the temperature as detected by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is for example 3&#xb0; C., then the compressor can be activated again and thus the heating operation of the heat pump device can be activated again. The time required for defrosting or deicing the evaporator will depend on the amount of ice or hoar frost build-up on the evaporator.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The normal operating mode can be considered as the first operating mode. During this operating mode (heating operating mode), the heat pump device is heating the water inside the storage tank <b>7</b> via the roll bond heat exchanger <b>8</b> and the heating element <b>5</b> is deactivated.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a second operating mode, the user may manually activate the operation of the heating element <b>5</b> for example via the user interface or operating unit <b>10</b>. Via the heating element <b>5</b>, a part of the water inside the storage tank is heated one time. If the water temperature inside the storage tank <b>7</b> corresponds to the desired value, then the heating element <b>5</b> is deactivated again and only the heat pump device is heating the water inside the storage tank <b>7</b> via the roll bond heat exchanger <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><b>100221</b> The control unit <b>9</b> activates a third operating mode if the temperature as detected by the first temperature sensor T<b>1</b> is below a set value which can be for example 6&#xb0; C. In the third operating mode, the operation of the heating element <b>5</b> is controlled by the control unit <b>9</b>. The control unit <b>9</b> controls the operation of the heating element <b>5</b> in particular if a second condition is fulfilled. The heating element <b>5</b> is only then activated automatically by the control unit <b>9</b> if the heat pump device <b>1</b> is not able to produce sufficient hot water via the roll bond heat exchanger <b>8</b>. In addition or alternatively, the heating element <b>5</b> is activated via the control unit <b>9</b> if the time during which the deicing operation is activated exceeds a time limit, for example like 30 minutes. If this time limit has lapsed, then the control unit <b>9</b> activates the operation of the heating element <b>5</b> and the operation is continued until the heating requirement is fulfilled. Accordingly, the heating requirement may relate to a normal operation of the heat pump device with an increased requirement for hot water or alternatively if the deicing operation is continued beyond a set time period.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition or alternatively, the control unit <b>10</b> can also activate the operation of the heating element <b>5</b> if the defrosting operation is activated several times within a set time period. For example, if the defrosting operation is activated five times during two hours, the control unit <b>10</b> activates the operation of the heating element <b>5</b> to heat the water inside the storage tank. This activation of the heating element can continue until the number of activations of the defrosting unit within a set time limit has decreased.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">If the control unit <b>9</b> deactivates the heating operation of the heat pump device via the roll bond heat exchanger <b>8</b>, the automatic operation of the heating element <b>5</b> via the control unit <b>9</b> is also deactivated.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the air temperate as determined by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> has increased for example up to 8&#xb0; C., the third operating mode (automatic operation of the heat element) is deactivated such that the heating element can only be manually activated via the user interface or operating unit <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Therefore, the on and off switching of the manual and automatic operation of the heating element includes a hysteresis of for example 2&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The control unit <b>9</b> activates a fourth operating mode if the air temperature as determined by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is below 2&#xb0; C. and the necessity of a defrosting operation is detected. If the defrosting operation is continuing for more than <b>30</b> minutes, the fan <b>4</b> of the evaporator <b>3</b> is deactivated and the control unit <b>9</b> activates the operation of the heating element <b>5</b> until a temperature control device (thermostat) of the heat pump device together with the control unit <b>9</b> deactivates the operation of the heating element <b>5</b>. During this operating mode, the operation of the heat pump device is deactivated for a predetermined time interval. The deactivation of the heat pump device operation starts with the deactivation of the fan <b>4</b>. The time period of this deactivation can be for example up to <b>4</b> hours. If the temperature of the air flowing through the evaporator <b>3</b> as determined by the first temperature sensor T<b>1</b> is above 6&#xb0; C., the time period for the deactivation of the heat pump device <b>1</b> is reduced. If the air temperature as determined by the second temperature sensor T<b>2</b> is above 8&#xb0; C. or if a power outage occurs, the heating operation of the heat pump device is activated again.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the temperature of the air as determined by the first temperature sensor T<b>1</b> is below &#x2212;2&#xb0; C., the heating operation of the heat pump device is deactivated and the automatic operation of the heating element <b>5</b> is activated. This operation is deactivated again when the temperature as determined by the first temperature sensor T<b>1</b> is &#x3e;0&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an aspect of the invention, the fan <b>4</b> is activated for 5 to 10 seconds before the temperature sensor T<b>1</b> determines the temperature of the air flowing through the evaporator. This is advantageous as this will allow a more accurate measuring of the air temperature. The temperature as measured by the temperature sensor T<b>1</b> is used to decide whether or not the compressor can be activated again and the heating operation of the heat pump device can be reactivated again.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an aspect of the invention, the fan <b>4</b> can be activated before the temperature sensor Tl detects the air temperature of the air flowing through the evaporator in case the heat pump device has been deactivated.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a further aspect of the invention, the last temperature value which was measured by the temperature sensor T<b>1</b> during an active operation of the fan can be used when the heating operation of the heat pump has been deactivated in order to determine whether or not the compressor is to be activated again.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the following table, different operating modes of the heat pump device HP and the electrical heating element HE are depicted:</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>HP</entry><entry>HP</entry><entry>HE</entry><entry>HE</entry><entry>HP blocked =</entry><entry>HP</entry></row><row><entry>Air temperature</entry><entry>heating</entry><entry>defrosting</entry><entry>manual</entry><entry>auto</entry><entry>f(defrosting)</entry><entry>blocked</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x3e;6&#xb0;</entry><entry>C.</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x3e;6&#xb0; C., &#x3e;2&#xb0; C.</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x3c;3&#xb0; C. &#x3e;0&#xb0; C.</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x3c;&#x2212;2&#xb0;</entry><entry>C.</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>X</entry><entry>X</entry><entry/><entry>X</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">While this invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments outlined above, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
