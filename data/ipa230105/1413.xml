Plastic packages degrade in UV light, but since the device is a single-use disposable, long term degradation of the package is not a concern. The LED can be a laser diode emitting a laser or coherent light. The LED can emit light with narrowband wavelength. The center frequency of emission of the LED can be anywhere in the ultra-violet, visible and infra-red spectrum. The LED can emit light with a spectral line half width of less than 50 nm, 25 nm, 20 nm, 15 nm, 10 nm, 5 nm, 2 nm or 1 nm.

The reflector can be incorporated in a housing. The reflector can be composed of multiple optical elements, optical splitters, combiners, mirror surface, lenses, apertures and other features to control or direct light from one or more diodes.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0213">An alternative implementation can be a device in which the filter is mounted on top of the AOW. In this case a filter capillary can traverse the AOW and can deliver plasma from the bottom of the filter into a surface capillary.

The width of the vent can be less than 1 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.025 mm, 0.01 mm, 0.005 mm, or 0.001 mm. The vent can be an annulus around the top rim of the well.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0216">The assay measurement can begin when the plasma contacts the lens or protrusion. The amount of light that reaches the photodetector at the bottom of the well can increase, decrease or change arbitrarily when plasma contacts the lens or protrusion. The change in the amount of light that reaches the photodetector when plasma contacts the lens or the protrusion can be measured and used to begin the assay measurement in the well. The assay measurements in different wells can begin at different times. The change or lack thereof in the amount of light that reaches the photodetector when plasma contacts the lens or the protrusion can be used to indicate under-fill situations where not enough sample was applied to the filter.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0217">The lens or the protrusion can be above the plasma and avoid contacting it.

The device can be configured so that ALT and AST measurements are performed separately and concurrently in two wells.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0221">A reaction for measuring ALT can comprise 1) ALT in plasma catalyzing the transfer of an amino group from L-alanine to alpha-ketoglutarate to form L-glutamate and pyruvate, and 2) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and the oxidation of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD+. A reaction for measuring AST can comprise 1) AST catalyzing the conversion of L-aspartate and alpha-ketoglutarate into oxaloacetate and L-glutamate, and 2) Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) catalyzing the conversion of oxaloacetate into malate and the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. The substrates for measuring AST and ALT can be introduced in abundance so the rate of the reactions can be limited by the rate of endogenous AST and ALT in plasma.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0222">The reporter reagent for both ALT and AST measurements can be NADH. NADH has an absorption peak at 340 nm, so the amount or rate of NADH consumed in the reaction can be measured by illuminating the wells, with light from a first LED with an emission peak at 340 nm. In a rate measurement, the rate of change of the absorbance at 340 nm can be due to the conversion of NADH to NAD+ and can be proportional to the amount of ALT or AST present in the plasma. A photodetector can measure the change in the amount of light transmitted through plasma in the well over time, and can determine from calibration values stored on the IC the corresponding concentration of endogenous ALT.

The well can be used as a NADH-blank well to measure the natural oxidation of NADH, or NADH-blank measurement. The NADH-blank measurement can be subtracted from the ALT, AST measurements in the wells, respectively, or from other chemistry measurements, to eliminate the contribution of the natural oxidation of NADH or other sources of noise.

The area of the photodetector can be smaller than the aperture at the bottom of the well to ensure that light incident on the edges of the photodetector does not travel a path length this is difference from the path length traveled by light incidence on the center of the photodetector by more than 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% or 0.5%.
