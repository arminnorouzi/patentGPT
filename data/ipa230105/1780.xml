The present invention also relates to a method of controlling a coolant system. Although the invention will mainly be directed to a vehicle in the form of a truck using a fuel cell for generating electric power to an electric traction motor, the invention may also be applicable for other types of vehicles in which a coolant system can be implemented for e.g. cooling a vehicle battery, etc.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The propulsion systems of vehicles are continuously developed to meet the demands from the market. A particular aspect relates to the emission of environmentally harmful exhaust gas. Therefore, vehicles propelled by electric machines and/or electric machine receiving electric power from hydrogen fuel cells have been increasingly popular, in particular for trucks and other heavy duty vehicles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicles using a fuel cell system for generating electric power often struggles with obtaining sufficient coolant for the operating the fuel cell system at optimum levels, in particular for fuel cell systems arranged in heavy duty vehicles. Also, the fuel cell systems require an active pressure control to avoid different pressure levels on each side of a fuel cell membrane in the fuel cell system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore a desire to further improve the coolant systems for vehicle using a fuel cell system for generating electric power.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is thus an object of the present invention to at least partially overcome the above described deficiencies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, there is provided a coolant system for a vehicle at least partly propelled by an electric traction motor, the coolant system being configured to supply coolant to a coolant circuit for an electric source arranged to supply electric power to the electric traction motor, wherein the coolant system comprises a first coolant tank configured to contain a coolant fluid, a coolant supply conduit connected to the first coolant tank, the coolant supply conduit being connectable to the coolant circuit for supply of coolant from the first coolant tank to the coolant circuit, a second coolant tank comprising a filling portion for admitting coolant fluid into the second coolant tank, a first coolant feeding conduit arranged in fluid communication between the first coolant tank and the second coolant tank, and a fluid pump arranged in the first coolant feeding conduit for controllable supply of coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wording &#x201c;electric source&#x201d; should be construed as a source generating electric power, or an electric power supply e.g. one or more batteries or battery modules. The electric source may preferably be a fuel cell or fuel cell system. Such fuel cell or fuel cell system comprises one or more fuel cell stacks arranged to generate electric power by a chemical process including hydrogen and oxygen. The electric source can either supply electric power directly to the electric traction motor, or via an energy storage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, the wording &#x201c;coolant circuit&#x201d; should be understood as a coolant arrangement configured to deliver coolant to the electric source. The coolant circuit may, for example, comprise one or more coolant conduits.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An advantage of the present invention is that the use of a first and a second coolant tank can actively control the pressure levels such that different pressure levels on each side of a fuel cell membrane in the fuel cell system is more or less avoided. This is advantageously achieved by controlling the fluid pump arranged in the first coolant feeding conduit. Also, using two coolant tanks enable for positioning the first coolant tank at an elevated position relative to the second coolant tank. Hereby, coolant supplied to the coolant system is provided to the lower positioned second coolant tank, whereby the coolant can, by using the fluid pump, subsequently be provided to the first coolant tank. For a vehicle comprising a fuel cell system, it is advantageous to position the coolant tank at an elevated position so that it is arranged above e.g. a radiator of the fuel cell system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In further detail, providing the fluid pump to the coolant system enables for pumping additional coolant into the first coolant tank, which during operation will increase the pressure in the system and the fluid pump can be used when certain safety conditions are fulfilled, for example when the vehicle is not operating, to fill up the coolant system from the lower, elevated position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the electric source is preferably connected to an additional fluid pump. The second coolant tank can hereby advantageously be arranged to, from its lower position relative to the first coolant tank, ensure that the additional fluid tank receives a sufficient amount of coolant, preferably soaking the additional fluid pump in coolant.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an example embodiment, the coolant system may further comprise a second coolant feeding conduit arranged in fluid communication between the first coolant tank and the second coolant tank.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Hereby, coolant can be controlled to be supplied from the first coolant tank to the second coolant tank. This is advantageous when, for example, the amount of coolant in the second coolant tank falls below a predetermined minimum threshold level, and/or when the amount of coolant in the first coolant tank exceeds a predetermined maximum threshold level.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an example embodiment, the coolant system may further comprise a valve arranged in the second coolant feeding conduit, wherein the valve is controllable between a first state in which coolant fluid is supplied from the first coolant tank to the second coolant tank, and a second state in which coolant fluid in the first coolant tank is prevented from reaching second coolant tank. Hence, the valve controls the flow of coolant from the first coolant tank to the second coolant tank. The valve may be a pressure control valve, which is arranged to assume the first state when the pressure level in the second coolant feeding conduit exceeds a predetermined pressure threshold level, which pressure is increased in response to an increase amount of coolant in the first coolant tank. However, and advantageously, the valve may be connected to, and controlled by, a control unit as will be described further below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, and according to an example embodiment, the coolant system may further comprise a control unit connected to the fluid pump, the control unit comprising control circuitry configured to control operation of the fluid pump. Hereby, the fluid pump can be controlled during specific operating conditions, as will be described further below.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The control unit may include a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable digital signal processor or another programmable device. The control unit may also, or instead, include an application specific integrated circuit, a programmable gate array or programmable array logic, a programmable logic device, or a digital signal processor. Where the control unit includes a programmable device such as the microprocessor, microcontroller or programmable digital signal processor mentioned above, the processor may further include computer executable code that controls operation of the programmable device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an example embodiment, the control circuitry may be configured to receive a signal indicative of a pressure level in the coolant circuit, compare the pressure level with a predetermined pressure threshold level, and control the fluid pump to supply a flow of coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank when the pressure level is below the predetermined pressure threshold level.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The signal indicative of the pressure level may preferably be received from a pressure sensor arranged in the coolant system. The signal may also be received from a coolant level sensor, whereby the coolant level is determined. The coolant level in the first coolant tank should thus preferably be at such level as to be able to meet the desired pressure demands of the coolant circuit. An advantage is that the fluid pump can be controlled in to be in an active state to supply coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank when there is a desire to increase the pressure level in the coolant circuit. Hence, the fluid pump can move the necessary volume of coolant, as well as pressurize the coolant, from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank to increase the pressure level in the coolant circuit. Also, and according to an example embodiment, the control unit may be connected to the valve, the control circuitry being configured to control the valve to assume the second state when the pressure level is below the predetermined pressure threshold level. Thus, also controlling the valve to be arranged in a closed position will advantageously assist in increasing the pressure level.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an example embodiment, the control circuitry may be further configured to control the valve to assume the first state when the pressure level is above the predetermined pressure threshold level. Hereby, the pressure level in the coolant circuit can be reduced when the pressure level is too high. Preferably, the fluid pump is here arranged in an inactive state, thereby not supplying coolant to the first coolant tank.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an example embodiment, the control unit may be further connected to the first and second coolant tanks, wherein the control circuitry is configured to receive a signal indicative of a coolant level present in the first coolant tank, receive a signal indicative of a coolant level present in the second coolant tank, determine a difference between the coolant level in the first coolant tank and the coolant level in the second coolant tank; compare the difference with a predetermined difference threshold limit; and control the fluid pump to supply a flow of coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank when the difference exceeds the predetermined difference threshold limit. An advantage is that the pressure levels in the first and second coolant tanks can be arranged at substantially equal pressure levels. Also, and according to an example embodiment, the control unit may be connected to the valve, the control circuitry being configured to control the valve to assume the second state when the difference exceeds the predetermined difference threshold limit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an example embodiment, the control circuitry may be configured to receive a signal indicative of coolant filling of the second coolant tank at the filling portion, and control the fluid pump to supply a flow of coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank. Thus, when filling the second coolant tank, the pump can instantly deliver coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to an example embodiment, the coolant system may further comprise a deaeration conduit connected to the first coolant tank, the deaeration conduit being connectable to the coolant circuit for deaeration of the coolant circuit to the first coolant tank. According to an example embodiment, the coolant system may further comprise a pressure relief conduit arranged in fluid communication between the first coolant tank and the second coolant tank via a pressure relief device connected to the first coolant tank. Preferably, and according to an example embodiment, the pressure relief device may be a pressure relief valve. Hereby, when the pressure level in the first coolant tank exceeds a predetermined threshold limit, the pressure can be relieved in an automatic manner through the deaeration conduit. A further advantage is that the coolant is prevented from boiling.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an example embodiment, the coolant system may further comprise an electronically controlled valve arranged in the pressure relief conduit, the electronically controlled valve being connected to, and controlled by, the control unit. An advantage is that the valve can be controlled in an open position during filling, from the second coolant tank, of the first coolant tank, whereby air is allowed to return to the second coolant tank. The first coolant tank can hereby be filled-up more rapidly.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an example embodiment, the pressure relief device may be arranged on a vertically upper position of the first coolant tank, the pressure relief device is configured to relief the pressure in the first coolant tank when the pressure exceeds a predetermined tank pressure limit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a second aspect, there is provided a vehicle comprising an electric traction motor and an electric source configured to supply electric power to the electric traction motor, the vehicle further comprises a coolant circuit connected to the electric source, and a coolant system according to any one of the embodiments described above in relation to the first aspect, wherein the coolant system is connected to the coolant circuit.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Effects and features of the second aspect are largely analogous to those described above in relation to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a third aspect, there is provided a method of controlling a coolant system of a vehicle, the coolant system being connected to a coolant circuit for an electric source arranged to supply electric power to an electric traction motor of the vehicle, wherein the coolant system comprises a first coolant tank configured to contain a coolant fluid, a second coolant tank comprising a filling portion for admitting coolant fluid into the second coolant tank, a first coolant feeding conduit arranged in fluid communication between the first coolant tank and the second coolant tank, and a fluid pump arranged in the first coolant feeding conduit for controllable supply of coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank, wherein the method comprises determining a pressure level in the coolant circuit, comparing the pressure level with a predetermined pressure threshold level; and controlling the fluid pump to supply a flow of coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank when the pressure level is below the predetermined pressure threshold level.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Effects and features of the third aspect are largely analogous to those described above in relation to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a fourth aspect, there is provided a computer readable medium carrying a computer program comprising program code means for performing the steps of the third aspect when the program means is run on a computer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a fifth aspect, there is provided a computer program comprising program code means for performing the steps of the third aspect when the program is run on a computer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Effects and features of the fourth and fifth aspects are largely analogous to those described above in relation to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further features of, and advantages will become apparent when studying the appended claims and the following description.

The invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided for thoroughness and completeness. Like reference character refer to like elements throughout the description.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is depicted a vehicle <b>200</b> in the form of a truck. The vehicle comprises a traction motor (not shown) for propelling the wheels of the vehicle. The traction motor is in the example embodiment an electric machine arranged to receive electric power from an electric source (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>), such as a battery and/or a fuel cell system. As will be described below, the electric source is connected to a coolant system for supply of coolant to the electric source. The vehicle <b>200</b> also comprises a control unit <b>114</b> for controlling various operations, such as operation of the coolant system, as will also be described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In order to describe the coolant system in further detail, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which is a schematic illustration of the coolant system <b>100</b> according to an example embodiment. As can be seen, the coolant system <b>100</b> comprises a first coolant tank <b>1</b> and a second coolant tank <b>9</b>. The first coolant tank <b>1</b> comprises a first level sensor <b>15</b> arranged to detect a level of coolant present in the first coolant tank <b>1</b>, and the second coolant tank <b>9</b> comprises a second level sensor <b>17</b> arranged to detect a level of coolant present in the second coolant tank <b>9</b>. The first <b>1</b> and second <b>9</b> coolant tanks are separated from each other and hence arranged at a predetermined, non-zero distance from each other. The first <b>1</b> and second <b>9</b> coolant tanks are thus arranged to contain a coolant in the form of a coolant fluid. The first <b>1</b> and second <b>9</b> coolant tanks are fluidly connected to each other by means of a first coolant feeding conduit <b>11</b>, in which coolant is allowed to flow from the second coolant tank <b>9</b> to the first coolant tank <b>1</b>. Preferably, the first coolant tank <b>1</b> is arranged on the vehicle <b>200</b> at an elevated position in relation to the second coolant tank <b>9</b>, and the coolant system <b>100</b> comprises a fluid pump <b>10</b> in the first coolant feeding conduit <b>11</b> and arranged to pressurize the coolant from the second coolant tank <b>9</b> and supply the pressurized coolant to the first coolant tank <b>1</b>. Coolant fluid from an external coolant fluid supply source is thus received at a filling portion <b>16</b> of the second coolant tank <b>9</b>. The filling portion <b>16</b> hereby serves as an interface to a user filling coolant into the second coolant tank <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the coolant system <b>100</b> comprises a coolant supply conduit <b>5</b> connected to the first coolant tank <b>1</b>. The coolant supply conduit <b>5</b> is in turn connected to a coolant circuit <b>30</b>, thereby providing a fluid connection between the first coolant tank <b>1</b> and the coolant circuit <b>30</b>. The coolant circuit <b>30</b> is fluidly connected to the above described electric source <b>2</b>, in the following referred to as a fuel cell, providing coolant into the fuel cell <b>2</b> as well as receiving coolant expelled from the fuel cell <b>2</b>. According to the example embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the coolant circuit <b>30</b> comprises a heat exchanger <b>3</b>, an additional fluid pump <b>6</b>, a pressure sensor <b>8</b>, and a flow control valve <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the coolant circuit <b>30</b> is in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> example connected to the first coolant tank <b>1</b> by means of two deaeration conduits <b>4</b>. One of the deaeration conduits is connected to the flow control valve <b>7</b> and the other deaeration conduit is directly connected to the coolant circuit. The deaeration conduits <b>4</b> allows for supply of coolant from the coolant circuit <b>30</b> to the first coolant tank <b>1</b>, which can advantageously control the temperature and/or pressure level of the fuel cell at desired levels. The system may comprise further deaeration conduits than what is depicted in the figures. For example, a deaeration conduit may be connected between the first coolant tank <b>1</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The coolant system <b>200</b> further comprises a control unit <b>21</b>. As exemplified, the control unit <b>21</b> is connected to the first level sensor <b>15</b> of the first coolant tank <b>1</b>, the second level sensor <b>17</b> of the second coolant tank <b>9</b>, the fluid pump <b>10</b>, the additional pump <b>6</b>, the pressure sensor <b>8</b>, and the flow control valve <b>7</b>. The control unit <b>21</b> comprises control circuitry arranged to either receives signals from the various devices and to control operation thereof. In particular, the control circuitry is configured to control operation of the fluid pump <b>10</b>, the additional pump <b>6</b> and the flow control valve <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In particular, and according to an example embodiment, the control circuitry receives a signal from the pressure sensor <b>8</b> during operation of the vehicle <b>200</b>. The signal is indicative of the pressure level in the coolant circuit <b>30</b>. When the pressure level in the coolant circuit <b>30</b> is below a predetermined pressure threshold level, i.e. there is a desire to increase the pressure level in the coolant circuit <b>30</b>, the control circuit controls the fluid pump <b>10</b> to start pressurize and supply coolant from the second coolant tank <b>9</b> to the first coolant tank <b>1</b>. Hereby, the first coolant tank <b>1</b> is able to supply pressurized coolant into the coolant circuit <b>30</b> via the coolant supply conduit <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, the control unit may determine if the coolant level in the first coolant tank is sufficient to meet the pressure demands from the coolant circuit, or sufficient to fulfill the coolant demands. If the coolant level is too low, i.e. not able to meet the coolant demands, the control unit can control the fluid pump <b>10</b> to supply coolant from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank. The control unit may also monitor if there is a leakage in the system, and control the fluid pump to supply additional flow of coolant fluid from the second coolant tank to the first coolant tank if a leakage is detected.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, the control unit may also control the fluid pump to operate such that it is not running dry or if there is a need to top-up the system with coolant.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to another operating scenario, the control circuitry is also configured to receive a signal from the first level sensor <b>15</b> and a signal from the second level sensor <b>17</b>.
