Airbags have various forms, for example, so-called driver airbags that deploy from near the center of the steering wheel to protect the driver, curtain airbags that deploy downward inside the window to protect the occupants in the event of a lateral impact, rollover, or overturning accident, and side airbags that are deployed to the side of the occupant (the side of the seat) to protect the occupant in the event of a lateral impact of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A driver airbag device stowed in a steering wheel must securely restrain the occupant by promptly deploying the airbag, and in that respect, it is important that the deployment shape and deployment posture of the airbag are stable. Regarding a driver airbag device, the rim of the steering wheel functions as a reaction force surface when the airbag is deployed, and this contributes to the stabilization of the deployment shape and the deployment posture of the airbag.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Incidentally, in addition to the general circular shape, steering wheel shapes such as an irregular shape such as an airplane control stick, in which the upper side (twelve o'clock side) and the lower side (6 o'clock side) of the circular shape are missing, are known. For example, in an irregular steering wheel in which the upper side (twelve o'clock side) is missing when compared to a general steering wheel having a circular rim, there is no reaction force received from the rim in the upper part of the airbag facing the head of the occupant. Therefore, when the head of the occupant advances into the expanded airbag, the airbag may be pushed down or greatly deformed, and the restraint performance may be impaired.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Focusing on the lower part of the steering wheel, a situation where the airbag deployed from near the center of the steering wheel quickly expands toward the driver's abdomen (downward) and the driver colliding with the steering wheel must be avoided. In addition, in the case of an irregular steering wheel in which the lower side (6 o'clock side) of the rim is missing when compared to a general steering wheel having a circular rim, the lower region of the airbag must be quickly expanded to restrain near the abdomen of the occupant.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In light of the circumstances described above, an object of the present invention is to provide an airbag device that stabilizes the deployment posture of an airbag and contributes to improvement of occupant restraint performance even in a so-called irregular steering wheel.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the object described above, the present invention is an airbag device mounted on a steering wheel of a vehicle having a rim having a shape in which the distance from the center of rotation to the upper edge part is shorter than the distance to the left and right edge parts, provided with a gas generating device that generates an expansion gas and an airbag that expands and deploys toward the occupant side due to the expansion gas. Furthermore, at the stage before the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag, the thickness (width) D<b>1</b> of the upper end part of the airbag in the direction parallel to the rotation axis of the steering wheel when the airbag is viewed from the side is configured to be larger than the thickness (width) D<b>2</b> of the lower end part.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Note that &#x201c;a rim with a shape in which the distance from the center of rotation to the left and right edges is shorter than the distance to the upper edge&#x201d; means that with respect to a normally used circular (annular) rim, a rim where the part corresponding to 12 o'clock when a surface parallel to the rim is viewed as a clock face is missing, extends horizontally, or is formed in a concave shape. Further, the &#x201c;lower region&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper region&#x201d; of the airbag can be defined as, for example, below the lower end of the rim of the steering wheel and above the upper end of the steering wheel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention having the configuration described above, the thickness of the airbag in the front-to-back direction is larger in the upper region than in the lower region before the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag, and as such, when the head of the occupant advances into the upper part of the expanded airbag, the front side of the upper region of the airbag goes over the upper end part of the rim of the steering wheel and comes into contact with interior parts such as the instrument panel, where the interior parts function as the reaction surface for the airbag. As a result, the deployment posture of the airbag is stabilized, and the head of the occupant can be appropriately restrained.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the present invention, a space is preferably formed between the upper region of the airbag and the interior parts of the vehicle located in front of the steering wheel in the stage before the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag. After the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag, the airbag has at least a part of the upper region of the airbag advanced to the front of the vehicle from the rim and comes into contact with the interior parts.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The &#x201c;stage before the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag&#x201d; means the initial state of the airbag being deployed. &#x201c;Interior parts located in front of the steering wheel&#x201d; means the entirety of interior parts in front of the driver seat under the front windshield. &#x201c;Space is formed&#x201d; means a state in which they are not in contact with each other. &#x201c;After the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag&#x201d; means after a situation such as a frontal collision of the vehicle occurs and the occupant advances into the airbag, that is, the collision energy of the occupant begins to become absorbed by the airbag. In addition, &#x201c;at least a part of the upper region of the airbag advances to the front of the vehicle from the rim&#x201d; means that the upper part of the airbag moves forward over the steering wheel rim and forward (to the interior parts side) due to an impact where the occupant collides with the airbag.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As the present invention is configured such that a space is formed between the upper region of the airbag and the interior parts at the stage of initial deployment, and that the upper region of the airbag contacts the interior parts after the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag, the interior parts can be used as a reaction force surface while minimizing the increase in capacity of the airbag.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">If the airbag is configured to include a protruding portion that protrudes forward, the front surface of the airbag can be brought into contact with interior parts such as the instrument panel from the initial stage of deployment, but in this case, as the capacity of the airbag increases, the capacity of the gas generating device must also be increased accordingly. However, since the space for accommodating the airbag device inside the steering wheel is small and limited, the size (capacity) of the airbag and inflator is preferably as compact as possible.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With the present invention, the thicknesses D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> of the upper end part and lower end part of the airbag are measured from the surface of the rim of the steering wheel, which can be specified as the thickness of the upper end part (highest part) and the thickness of the lower end part (lowest part) of the airbag in the direction parallel to the rotation axis of the steering wheel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Under the condition that the occupant is an AM50 equivalent as specified in the collision safety performance evaluation standard based on FMVSS208 (US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard) and collides with a full [width] rigid barrier with or without wearing a standard seatbelt, the timing at which the upper region of the airbag comes into contact with the interior parts can be configured to be 50 ms to 90 ms after the collision of the vehicle with the full [width] rigid barrier and preferably is configured to be 60 ms to 80 ms after the collision.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The timing can be set under the condition that collision with the full [width] rigid barrier occurs at a speed of 25 mph where the occupant is not wearing a seat belt.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By setting the timing at which the upper region of the airbag comes into contact with the interior parts located in front of the steering wheel as described above, the reaction force from the interior parts can be received at the optimum timing, and the occupants are appropriately protected.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ratio D<b>1</b>:D<b>2</b> of the thickness D<b>1</b> of the upper end part and the thickness D<b>2</b> of the lower end part of the airbag can be in the range of 1.1:1 to 2.3:1. If the ratio deviates from such a range, unfavorable outcomes may occur. In other words, if the thickness D<b>1</b> of the upper end part of the airbag is larger than the above range with respect to the thickness D<b>2</b> of the lower end part, there is a fear of the capacity of the airbag becoming large or the protection of the body portion of the occupant becoming insufficient. On the other hand, if the thickness D<b>1</b> of the upper end part of the airbag is smaller than the above range with respect to the thickness D<b>2</b> of the lower end part, sufficient reaction force cannot be obtained even if the front side of the upper region of the airbag comes into contact with the interior parts, making maintaining restraining performance of the occupant difficult.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the thickness of the intermediate portion between the upper end part and the lower end part of the airbag is set to DO in the stage before the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag, the intermediate portion can be configured so that D<b>1</b>&#x3e;D<b>0</b>&#x3e;D<b>2</b>. By setting up in this manner, the deployed shape of the airbag becomes relatively smooth, enabling suppressing an increase in the capacity of the airbag.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The thickness DO of the intermediate portion can be formed so as to be gradually changed so as to continuously decrease from the upper end part to the lower end part.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Viewing the expanded and deployed airbag from the side, the intermediate portion of the portion below the center of rotation of the steering wheel can have a recessed part that makes the airbag partially thinner in the vehicle front-to-back direction than the surrounding portions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the expanded and deployed airbag, the length H<b>2</b> of the portion lower than the center of rotation of the steering wheel can be configured to be longer than the length H<b>1</b> of the portion above the center of rotation of the steering wheel. Here, the lengths H<b>2</b> and H<b>1</b> can be defined as the lengths in the direction extending parallel to the surface of the rim, orthogonal to the rotation axis of the steering wheel when the deployed airbag is viewed from the side.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As described above, by lengthening the lower portion of the deployed airbag, it is possible to reliably protect the area around the abdomen of the occupant and avoid an unfavorable situation such as the area around the abdomen colliding with the steering wheel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The airbag may have a structure including a rear panel facing the occupant, a front panel opposite the rear panel, and side panels connecting the rear panel and the front panel. Such a panel configuration enables easy adjustment of the thickness of the deployed airbag in the front-to-back direction. Here, a vent hole can be formed in the side panel. If a vent hole is formed on the front panel, the vent hole may be blocked by coming into contact with an interior part such as the instrument panel.

Steering wheels to which the present invention is applicable is not limited to the above-mentioned three patterns, and the present invention can be applied to various types of steering wheels having a shape where sufficient reaction force can not be obtained near twelve o'clock on the rim when the airbag is deployed.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the airbag device according to the present invention includes a gas generating device <b>14</b> that generates an expansion gas and an airbag <b>16</b> that expands and deploys toward the occupant (driver) D side due to the expansion gas. Furthermore, in the stage before the occupant D comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag <b>16</b>, a space G is formed between the upper region <b>16</b>U of the airbag <b>16</b> and the instrument panel <b>18</b> of the vehicle located in front of the steering wheel <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the thickness D<b>2</b> of the lower region <b>16</b>L of the airbag <b>16</b> is configured to be smaller than the thickness D<b>1</b> of the upper region <b>16</b>U at a stage before the occupant D comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag <b>16</b>. The thicknesses D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> are measured from the surface <b>12</b><i>x </i>of the rim of the steering wheel <b>12</b>, which can be specified as the thickness of the upper end part (highest part) <b>1000</b> and the thickness of the lower end part (lowest part) <b>100</b> L of the airbag <b>16</b> in the direction parallel to the rotation axis of the steering wheel <b>12</b>. Here, the upper end part <b>1000</b> and the lower end part <b>100</b>L of the airbag <b>16</b> can be the farthest points above and below the rotation axis in the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the steering wheel <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The ratio of the thicknesses D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> is preferably in the range of 1.1:1 to 2.3:1.

The difference D<b>3</b> between the thicknesses D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> can be set to about 50 mm. Furthermore, the thickness DO at the position corresponding to the rotation axis of the steering control system <b>2</b> is preferably set to a value such that a relationship of D<b>1</b>&#x3e;D<b>0</b>&#x3e;D<b>2</b> is established.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present Embodiment, the thicknesses D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> of the airbag <b>16</b> are set as described above, but when the thickness D<b>1</b> of the upper region <b>16</b>U is larger than the above range with respect to the lower region <b>16</b>L, there is a risk that the capacity of the airbag <b>16</b> will become large or that the protection of the body portion of the occupant D will be insufficient. On the other hand, if the thickness D<b>1</b> of the upper region <b>16</b>U of the airbag <b>16</b> is smaller than the above range with respect to the lower region <b>16</b>L, there is a possibility that a sufficient reaction force cannot be obtained even if the front side of the upper region <b>16</b>U comes into contact with the instrument panel <b>18</b>.

By lengthening the lower portion L<b>2</b> of the deployed airbag <b>16</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the area in the vicinity of the abdomen of the occupant D is reliably protected, and an unfavorable situation such as the area in the vicinity of the abdomen colliding with the steering wheel <b>12</b> can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, after the occupant D comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag <b>16</b>, at least a part of the upper region <b>16</b>U of the airbag <b>16</b> advances to the front of the vehicle from the steering wheel <b>12</b>, coming into contact with the instrument panel <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, under the conditions that the occupant D is AM50 equivalent as specified in the collision safety performance evaluation standard based on FMVSS208 (US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard) and collides with a full [width] rigid barrier with or without wearing a seatbelt, the timing at which the upper region <b>16</b>U of the airbag <b>16</b> comes into contact with the instrument panel <b>18</b> is configured to be 50 ms to 90 ms after the collision of the vehicle with the barrier. More preferably, this contact is 60 ms to 80 ms after the collision. Here, the timing as described above can also be set under the condition that the occupant D collides with the full [width] rigid barrier at a speed of 25 mph without wearing a seat belt.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">By setting the timing at which the upper region <b>16</b>U of the airbag <b>16</b> comes into contact with the instrument panel <b>18</b> located in front of the steering wheel <b>12</b> as described above, the airbag <b>16</b> can receive a reaction force from the instrument panel <b>18</b> at optimal timing, enabling appropriate protection of the occupant D.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the present invention having the above configuration, the thickness of the airbag <b>16</b> in the front-to-back direction is larger in the upper region <b>16</b>U than in the lower region <b>16</b>L before the occupant comes into contact with the expanded and deployed airbag <b>16</b>, and as such, when the head of the occupant D advances into the upper part of the expanded airbag <b>16</b>, the front side of the upper region <b>16</b>U of the airbag <b>16</b> goes over the upper end part of the rim of the steering wheel <b>12</b> and comes into contact with the instrument panel <b>18</b>, where the instrument panel <b>18</b> functions as the reaction surface of the airbag (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As a result, the deployment posture of the airbag <b>16</b> is stabilized, and the head of the occupant D can be appropriately restrained.
