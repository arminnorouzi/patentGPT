Since silver exhibits high conductivity and oxidation resistance, it is widely used as a conductive material for wiring, electrodes, and the like. In order to achieve microfabrication of wiring and electrodes, silver fine particles used in a paste agent for forming wiring and electrodes are required to have an appropriately small particle diameter, and particularly to have a uniform particle diameter. Further, production of silver fine particles is required to have high productivity from the viewpoint of economy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a method of producing silver fine particles for a paste agent for wiring and electrode formation, a wet reduction method of reducing silver ions by a chemical method (a liquid phase reduction method) is mainly used. As a method of producing silver fine particles by this wet reduction method, Patent Literature 1 discloses a method of producing silver fine particles by reducing a raw material solution containing a silver compound with a reducing agent, while a cationic surfactant is added to the reaction solution. However, when the wet reduction method is performed in a batch system as in Patent Literature 1, it is difficult to obtain uniform silver fine particles because the reaction field is non-uniform due to the temperature gradient and the concentration gradient in the batch system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to solve this problem, Patent Literatures 2 and 3 discloses a method of producing silver fine particles by the wet reduction method using a continuous reactor, comprising flowing a fluid containing a silver compound into one of the two flow paths and a fluid containing a reducing agent into the other, bringing the two fluids into contact with each other at the merging portion of the two flow paths, and mixing the two fluids to precipitate silver fine particles. By merging the two flow paths, the mixing of the two fluids is completed in a short time, and the reaction proceeds in a uniform state in the system, so that silver fine particles having a uniform shape and properties are produced. Further, unlike the batch type system using a conventional reaction vessel, silver fine particles can be continuously produced, which is advantageous from the viewpoint of productivity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, electroless plating technology is widely used. Silver mirror reaction is classified into a reduced non-catalytic type of the electroless plating technology, in which a silver salt solution and a reducing agent are mixed to form silver plating on the surface of the object to be plated. However, it is known that the reduction reaction in the silver mirror reaction proceeds not only on the surface of the object to be plated, but also on the wall surface of the plating bath vessel in the plating bath.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, also in the methods of producing silver fine particles of Patent Literatures 2 and 3, the reduction reaction proceeds not only in the reaction system, but also on the inner walls of the merging portion and the flow path of the downstream thereof, and silver also adheres to the surface of the inner walls of the merging portion and the flow path of the downstream thereof to form a silver mirror. When a silver mirror is formed on the inner wall of the merging portion and the flow path, there is a problem as follows. Since the silver compound is continuously introduced into the merging portion and the flow path, the amount of the adhered silver increases with lapse of time, and finally the adhered silver blocks the merging portion and the flow path. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly clean or replace the merging portion and the flow path, so that productivity of equipment is lowered.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve this problem, known is a method of using ammoniacal silver nitrate of an ammine complex obtained by adding ammonia to silver nitrate as a raw material solution. However, due to use of ammoniacal silver nitrate, ammonia odor is terrible and the working environment is very poor. Further, ammoniacal silver nitrate has a problem of generating explosive fulminating silver when it is left in contact with a reducing substance such as an alcohol. Thus, use of a large amount of ammonia should be avoided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Literature 4 describes a method of producing silver fine particles in the presence of sodium citrate. Citric acid may be a protective agent for silver. But, since the coordinating power of citric acid to a silver ion is weaker than that of ammonia, citric acid cannot sufficiently prevent the adhesion of silver in the continuous wet reduction method.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Literatures 5 and 6 describe a method of producing silver fine particles by a wet reduction method using a continuous forced thin film reactor which mixes reaction fluids in a thin film fluid formed between at least two processing surfaces being capable of approaching to and separating from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other. In this method, self-discharging property of the forced thin film reactor can prevent blockage of the flow path by the product, and uniform fine particles can be efficiently produced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the case of silver fine particles, even if a forced thin film reactor is used, some silver inevitably precipitates on the inner wall surface of the merging portion and the flow path, so that the shape and surface material of the processing surfaces which constitute a reaction space change. As the shape and surface material the processing surfaces change, the shape and properties of the silver fine particles produced on the processing surfaces also change. Accordingly, in the case of continuously producing silver fine particles for mass-production of uniform silver fine particles, even if a forced thin film reactor is used, adhesion of silver onto the processing surfaces proceeds with lapse of time from the start of production, resulting in a problem that the shape and properties of the produced silver fine particles change. In particular, when a concentration of silver in the fluid containing a silver compound increases in order to pursue mass productivity, precipitation is more likely to occur, and the problem becomes even more serious.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">Patent Literature 1: JP S61-243105</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">Patent Literature 2: JP 2005-048236</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0013">Patent Literature 3: JP 2010-070793</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0014">Patent Literature 4: JP 2006-045655</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0015">Patent Literature 5: WO 2009/008390</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0016">Patent Literature 6: WO 2012/165000</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0017">Patent Literature 7: JP 2019-108610</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0018">Patent Literature 8: JP 2011-021252</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0019">As described above, when silver fine particles are produced by a continuous wet reduction method using a continuous reactor such as a forced thin film reactor, silver inevitably precipitates on the inner wall surface of the merging portion and the flow path by the conventional production method. As a result, as the environment of the merging portion and the flow path changes with lapse of time, the shape and properties of the produced silver fine particles change unexpectedly. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to control the shape and properties of the silver fine particles in order to ensure the uniformity with respect to the elapsed time of the continuous processing, and there was a problem in quality control.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0020">Therefore, the problem to be solved by the present invention is to solve these conventional problems, and to provide a method of producing silver fine particles in a wet reduction method using a continuous reactor with sufficient continuous productivity and quality uniformity, without problems of deterioration of working environment and generation of explosive fulminating silver due to the use of a large amount of ammonia.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to the Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0021">As a result of diligent research, the present inventors have surprisingly found that in the production method of silver fine particles which continuously precipitates silver fine particles by a redox reaction by mixing a plurality of fluids flowing from separate flow paths, silver fine particles can be continuously, stably and uniformly produced by adding an amino acid to at least one of the plurality of fluids, while the adhesion of silver on the inner walls of the merging portion and the flow path of the downstream thereof is suppressed. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0022">An amino acid used in the present invention has two types of functional groups, an amino group and a carboxyl group, which can coordinate to a silver ion within the molecule. Amino acids are available in a powder form which is highly safe and easy to handle, so that they can be effectively used as a substitute for ammonia.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">Patent Literature 7 discloses a method of producing silver fine particles for a conductive paste, which uses a neutral or basic amino acid having 5 or more carbon atoms. However, the production method is characterized in that a conductive film having a low volume resistivity can be formed by remaining the amino acid within the formed silver fine particles and sintering the silver fine particles at a relatively low temperature. The amino acid is not used as a complexing agent for a silver ion, but as an impurity remaining in silver fine particles. Further, in the examples, a silver ammine complex prepared from silver nitrate and aqueous ammonia is used as a raw material, and ammonia is used as a complexing agent for a silver ion. Therefore, the method still has the problems of ammonia odor and explosive fulminating silver as in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">Patent Literature 8 discloses a method of precipitating silver fine particles in an aqueous solution containing an amino acid and an aliphatic hydroxy acid metal salt. The method is characterized in that silver fine particles having a unique structure such as an X-letter shape or a flower-shape is produced, and therefor an amino acid is used to produce nuclei consisting of silver particles and the amino acid for forming one component (aggregate) having the specific shape. Further, in the examples, an aqueous reducing agent solution is added dropwise to and mixed with an aqueous mixed silver compound solution without stirring, and the mixture is stirred at a low speed even after the addition is completed. Therefore, the method of producing silver fine particles of Patent Literature 8 cannot be applied to a continuous wet reduction method in which a silver compound and a reducing agent are continuously and quantitatively mixed and reacted in a short time.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">As described above, in Patent Literatures 7 and 8, amino acids are used in the production of silver fine particles. However, by the techniques of these Patent Literatures, silver fine particles cannot be produced in a wet reduction method using a continuous reactor with sufficient continuous productivity and quality uniformity, or without problems of deterioration of working environment and generation of explosive fulminating silver due to the use of a large amount of ammonia. Under such circumstances, the present invention solves the problem to be solved by the present invention, and provides a method of producing silver fine particles in a wet reduction method using a continuous reactor with sufficient continuous productivity and quality uniformity, without problems of deterioration of working environment and generation of explosive fulminating silver due to the use of a large amount of ammonia.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">The present invention is as follows.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">1.

More specifically, it may be a forced thin film reactor, wherein the reactor has the first processing surface and the second processing surface being capable of approaching to and separating from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other; at least two types of fluids to be processed are introduced between the at least two processing surfaces, and a separation force acting in the direction of separating the first processing surface and the second processing surface is generated by the pressure applied between the first processing surface and the second processing surface; a minute interval is maintained between the first processing surface and the second processing surface by the pressure balance with the pressure in the direction of bringing the processing surfaces closer to each other; a thin film fluid is formed by passing the at least two types of fluids to be processed between the first processing surface and the second processing surface kept at the minute interval; and the fluids to be processed are contacted and mixed with each other in the thin film fluid. Among them, a preferable forced thin film reactor used in the present invention has a mechanism for promoting mixing by relatively moving the processing surfaces while maintaining a constant interval at the mixing portion of the fluids to be processed. Specifically, for example, the forced thin film type fluid processing apparatus shown in JP 2010-189661 is preferably used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">&#x3c;Silver Compound&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">The silver compound used in the present invention includes, for example, monovalent, divalent or trivalent silver compounds which can be dissolved in a solvent used in a fluid containing the silver compound, preferably monovalent silver compound. Specific examples of the silver compounds include silver nitrate, silver fluoride, silver sulfate, silver phosphate and the like, and more preferably silver nitrate. A concentration of silver ions in the fluid containing the silver compound is preferably, for example, 0.1% by mass or more in order to increase productivity. Further, it is preferably, for example, 5% by mass or less, because it becomes difficult to suppress formation of a silver mirror when a concentration of silver ions is too high. A concentration of silver ions is more preferably 0.5% by mass or more and 4.5% by mass or less, further preferably 1% by mass or more and 4% by mass or less, and even more preferably 1.5% by mass or more and 3% by mass or less.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">&#x3c;Reducing Agent&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">As the reducing agent used in the present invention, any reducing agent may be used, as long as it can reduce silver ions contained in the silver compound and precipitate silver fine particles. Preferred reducing agents include, for example, ascorbic acid, ferrous sulfate, sulfite, alkanolamine, formic acid, hydroquinone, glucose, formalin, sodium borohydride, hydrazine, a hydrazine compound (hydrazine sulfate, hydrazine chloride, etc.) and the like. Among these agents, for example, hydrazine, hydrazine compounds and the like are more preferable.

In the redox reaction, electrons are transferred between the compounds, and a silver ion receives one electron and is reduced to silver. A number of electrons transferred from one molecule differs for each of the above reducing agents. For example, hydrazine provides 4 electrons in the reduction reaction. Therefore, when hydrazine which transfers 4 electrons is a reducing agent, 1 equivalent or more with respect to a silver ion means 0.25 mol or more of hydrazine with respect to 1 mol of a silver ion.

A concentration of the reducing agent in the fluid containing the reducing agent is preferably, for example, 1% by mass or more in order to increase productivity. Further, a concentration is preferably, for example, 50% by mass or less, because silver fine particles become non-uniform when a concentration of the reducing agent is too high.

Therefore, a mixture of various types of complexes is formed, in which an amino group, a carboxyl group, or the like is coordinated to a silver ion. The amino acid stabilizes a silver ion by forming a mixture of silver ions and various types of complexes, and decrease the reduction rate immediately after mixing silver ions and the reducing agent, and thereby the formation of a silver mirror on the inner walls of the merging portion and the flow path of the continuous reactor is suppressed, and the adhesion of silver on the inner walls of the merging portion and the flow path is suppressed.

Specific &#x3b1;-amino acids include, for example, glycine, arginine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamine, aspartic acid, alanine, proline, cysteine, lysine, threonine, asparagine, serine, methionine, tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan, citrulline, ornithine and the like. More preferable &#x3b1;-amino acids are glycine, arginine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid and the like.
