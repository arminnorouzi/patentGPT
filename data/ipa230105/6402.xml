Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is directed to an adapter system that facilitates convenient access to one or more adapters. The adapter system includes an elongated wire that generally features a plurality of adapters mounted/secured with respect thereto. The wire defines an attachment mechanism at a first end thereof, the attachment mechanism allowing the wire to be movably secured with respect to a cable. In use, the disclosed adapter system permits a user to readily access and individually utilize each of the adapters mounted/secured with respect to the wire on an as-needed basis.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is well known, day-to-day use of the myriad electronics that support personal and professional activities require access to and use of a wide range of adapters. For example, communications with and between electronics, such as desk top computers, laptop computers, tablet computers and smart phones, require different adapters that depend on the device(s) at the other end of the desired communication. In a particular use case, delivery of a presentation to a third party/group/audience often requires communication from a presenter's computer (laptop/tablet/smart phone) to an accessory monitor or projection screen and the appropriate adapter must be available to facilitate such communication or the presentation will not be possible.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has become commonplace for individuals to accumulate a collection of adapters for inter-electronic communications required in their personal and professional lives. Various approaches have been taken to storing and transporting these adapters, e.g., storage and transport by way of bags, cases and the like. There have also been efforts to provide devices/assemblies to facilitate storage and transport of adapters, e.g., cable tie systems (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,186,451 to Benoit), cord organizing systems (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,469,854 to Richardson), DIY systems (see, e.g., &#x201c;DIY Cord Organizers That Will Keep Your Wires Untangled Forever; https://www.onecrazyhouse.com/diy-cor-organizers/), and adapter keychains (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,784,338 and 10,041,565 to Parrett et al.; Digitalinx Secure Adapter Ring available from Liberty AV Solutions).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, systems have been disclosed that relate to cable winding/unwinding mechanisms (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,521,227 to Kim, U.S. Pat. No. 7,183,743 to Geiger, CN 206388984U to Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., and CN 209150369U to Dongguan Xinganhui Electronic Technology).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite efforts to date, a need remains for improved systems for storing, securing and providing ready access to adapter(s) for use in electronic communications on an as-needed basis. These and other needs are met by the disclosed systems and methods.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides advantageous systems for providing access to one or more adapters. The disclosed systems include an elongated wire that supports adapter(s) along the extent thereof. The wire is movably mounted with respect to a cable, e.g., an HDMI cable, a DisplayPort cable or another cable currently known or unknown, according to one of the following structural arrangements:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">The wire forms a loop around the cable and a coupler is applied to an overlapping region of the wire, e.g., in the field, to securely fix the loop in place relative to the cable. A coupler/stop is optionally mounted with respect to the cable to limit travel of the loop/wire relative to the cable.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">A ring that defines a tab extension with aperture is movably mounted with respect to the cable, and the wire forms a loop through the aperture in the tab extension. A coupler is applied to an overlapping region of the wire, e.g., in the field, to fix the loop in place relative to the tab extension/ring. A coupler/stop is optionally mounted with respect to the cable to limit travel of the loop/wire relative to the cable.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">A ring that defines a tab extension and the wire are joined relative to each other to define a subassembly. The ring is movably mounted with respect to the cable with the wire extending therefrom. A coupler/stop is optionally mounted with respect to the cable to limit travel of the loop/wire relative to the cable.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">The adapter(s) are mounted/secured with respect to the wire/cable and may include indicia (e.g., color indicia) that facilitate identification of the adapter type. The adapter(s) may be movably mounted with respect to the wire/cable, and relative movement may be bounded by stops/couplers positioned at either end thereof. At the free end of the wire/cable, a pull-tab may be provided to facilitate interaction with the wire/cable and the associated adapters.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">The present disclosure further provides an advantageous coupler/stop that accommodates cables of differing diameters by providing mating portions that receive/accommodate inserts of differing sizes, thereby permitting utilization with a range of cable diameters using the same mating portions. A cable wire gauge tool may be provided with the noted coupler/stop and inserts to facilitate selection of appropriate inserts for a particular cable gauge application.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">Additional features, functions and benefits of the disclosed systems will be apparent from the detailed description which follows, particularly when read in conjunction with the appended figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0014">To assist those of skill in the art in making and using the systems disclosed herein, reference is made to the accompanying figures, wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary system for providing access to a plurality of adapters according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of an alternative exemplary system for providing access to a plurality of adapters according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts component parts of a coupler/stop in a disassembled state according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts a coupler/stop in an assembled state and mounted with respect to a cable according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> depicts component parts of a coupler/stop and cable gauges according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a further alternative exemplary system for providing access to a plurality of adapters according to the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of an additional alternative exemplary system for providing access to a plurality of adapters according to the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0022">The present disclosure is directed to an adapter system that facilitates convenient access to one or more, e.g., a plurality of, adapters. The adapter system includes an elongated wire that generally features a plurality of adapters mounted/secured with respect thereto. The wire defines an attachment mechanism at a first end thereof, the attachment mechanism allowing the wire to be movably secured with respect to a cable. In use, the disclosed adapter system permits a user to readily access and individually utilize each of the adapters mounted/secured with respect to the wire on an as-needed basis. Moreover, the disclosed adapter system functions to securely mount the adapter(s), thereby safeguarding against potential loss, disappearance or misappropriation of the adapter(s).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary adapter delivery system <b>10</b> is schematically depicted. System <b>10</b> includes an elongated cable <b>12</b> that includes a connector <b>14</b>, e.g., an HDMI connector, at one end thereof. An optional coupler/stop <b>15</b> is mounted with respect to cable <b>12</b> in spaced relation relative to connector <b>14</b>. System <b>10</b> further includes a rope or wire <b>20</b> that is movably mounted with respect to cable <b>12</b> by loop <b>22</b> formed at one end of wire <b>20</b>. Of note, loop <b>22</b> is formed by encircling cable <b>12</b> with wire <b>20</b> and securing a coupler <b>16</b> to an overlapping region of wire <b>20</b>. Coupler <b>16</b> may be advantageously fixed relative to wire <b>20</b> in the field, i.e., by a user of the disclosed system.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">A plurality of adapters <b>26</b> are advantageously mounted/secured with respect to wire <b>20</b> at spaced intervals along the wire. Individual adapter(s) may be detachably mounted/secured with respect to wire <b>20</b>. In exemplary implementations of system <b>10</b>, adapters <b>26</b> may be movably mounted/secured with respect to wire <b>20</b>, i.e., each adapter may be free to travel along wire <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">Although system <b>10</b> includes three (3) adapters <b>26</b>, the present disclosure is not limited by or to the depicted embodiment. Thus, system <b>10</b> may be implemented with as few as one (1) adapter and by more than three (3) adapters. Indeed, system <b>10</b> is generally implemented with a number and variety of adapters as may be desired by users in typical and/or specialized use cases.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">Various securement mechanisms may be employed to mount/secure adapter(s) <b>26</b> relative to wire <b>20</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, adapters <b>26</b> may be mounted/secured relative to wire <b>20</b> by eyelets <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>c </i>that extend from the adapters <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>, respectively, and are joined to wire <b>20</b>. Of note, eyelets <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>c </i>permit rotational freedom of movement for the adapters <b>26</b> relative to wire <b>20</b>, thereby facilitating positioning of the adapter <b>26</b> relative to an electronic device(s) (not pictured) for insertion therein. In instances where the eyelets <b>25</b> permit longitudinal travel of adapters <b>26</b> relative to wire <b>20</b>, further flexibility in positioning of adapters <b>26</b> relative to electronic devices is facilitated. The flexibility of wire <b>20</b>&#x2014;which is typically fabricated from steel and is between <b>24</b> and <b>14</b> gauge&#x2014;further facilitates positioning of the individual adapters <b>26</b> for insertion in electronic devices. The eyelets <b>25</b> may also permit travel of adapters <b>26</b> along wire <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">Eyelet <b>25</b> may be fabricated as part of an outer body of adapter <b>26</b>, e.g., as part of the molding process, or may be retrofitted to an existing adapter <b>26</b>, e.g., by way of an adhesive, sonic welding, mechanical clamping or the like. Eyelet <b>25</b> may allow passage of wire <b>20</b> through an opening defined thereby, or may be fixedly mounted relative to wire <b>20</b> in various ways, e.g., by way of crimping, adhesive or the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, coupler/stop <b>16</b> limits the travel of adapters <b>26</b> along wire <b>20</b> in the direction of cable <b>12</b> in implementations where eyelets <b>25</b> are not fixedly mounted/secured relative to wire <b>20</b>, but instead allow travel of adapters <b>26</b> along wire <b>20</b>. At the other free end of wire <b>20</b>, a pull-tab <b>30</b> is mounted/secured with respect to wire <b>20</b> by a second coupler/stop <b>32</b>. Pull tab <b>30</b> facilitates easy location of and interaction with system <b>10</b>. In the exemplary implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, pull tab <b>30</b> includes a rivet/opening <b>38</b> that is dimensioned to allow passage of wire <b>20</b>. Pull tab <b>30</b> is secured with respect to wire <b>20</b> by the doubling back of wire <b>20</b> after passage through rivet/opening <b>38</b> and securement of the doubled back portion of wire <b>20</b> with an original extent of wire <b>20</b>, e.g., by way of second coupler/stop <b>32</b>. Coupler/stop <b>32</b> advantageously functions as a stop for travel of adapters <b>26</b> along wire <b>20</b> (away from cable <b>12</b>) when the eyelets <b>25</b> permit adapter <b>26</b> travel along wire <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">Adapters <b>26</b> may take various forms. For example, adapters may include a combination selected from the group consisting of DVI-D to HDMI adapter(s), Micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter(s), Mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter(s), Mini-DisplayPort to HDMI adapter(s), DisplayPort to HDMI adapter(s), VGA to HDMI adapter(s), MHL to HDMI adapter(s), and/or USB to HDMI adapter(s). The present disclosure is not limited by or to the foregoing exemplary adapters, but may be effectively and advantageously employed with alternative and/or additional adapters, including adapters yet-to-be-developed and/or yet-to-be-commercialized.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">Adapters <b>26</b> may advantageously include an indicia <b>27</b> that designates the type of adapter. Thus, for example, indicia <b>27</b> may take the form of a color band positioned on a portion of the adapter <b>26</b>, although alternative forms of indicia may be employed. In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, system <b>10</b> includes adapter <b>26</b><i>a </i>with indicia <b>27</b><i>a </i>(e.g., red band), adapter <b>26</b><i>b </i>with indicia <b>27</b><i>b </i>(e.g., green band), and adapter <b>26</b><i>c </i>with indicia <b>27</b><i>c </i>(e.g., yellow band). The correlation of color coding relative to adapter type may be provided by a key, or may become widely known in the industry, e.g., through industry practice, thereby allowing a user to easily identify the adapter needed for a particular device/application.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">Of note, system <b>10</b> advantageously permits travel/translation of loop <b>22</b> of wire <b>20</b> along cable <b>12</b>, as depicted by the two-headed arrow above cable <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The extent of travel/translation is limited by connector <b>14</b> and typically by coupler/stop <b>15</b>. Relative motion of wire <b>20</b> relative to cable <b>12</b> enhances the ability of users to position an adapter <b>26</b> for insertion relative to an electronic device (not pictured) using the disclosed system. In addition, the flexibility afforded users by allowing loop <b>22</b> to be formed in the field allows the portion of the system associated with wire <b>20</b> to be movably secured relative to a cable <b>12</b> selected by the user based on site-specific considerations, e.g., the accessibility and expected functionality of cable <b>12</b> as compared to other cable(s) that may be available at the site.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an alternative system <b>50</b> for providing access to adapters <b>66</b> is depicted according to the present disclosure. System <b>50</b> includes an elongated cable <b>52</b> that includes a connector <b>54</b>, e.g., an HDMI connector, at one end thereof. System <b>50</b> further includes a rope or wire <b>60</b> that is movably mounted with respect to cable <b>52</b> by loop <b>62</b> formed at one end of wire <b>60</b>. Of note, loop <b>62</b> is formed by encircling cable <b>52</b> with wire <b>60</b> and securing a coupler <b>56</b> to an overlapping region of wire <b>60</b>.
