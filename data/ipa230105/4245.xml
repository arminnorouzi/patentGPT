An electroluminescent display device has a wide viewing angle as compared with a liquid crystal display device because it is self-luminous, thin, light weight, and low in power consumption because a backlight unit is not necessary. In addition, an electroluminescent display device is driven by low voltages of direct current (DC) and has a fast response time. An electroluminescent display device is also resistant to external impacts and may be used in a wide range of temperatures because its components are solids. An electroluminescent display device may also be manufactured at low cost.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electroluminescent display device has been applied to various devices. Especially, the electroluminescent display device has been widely applied to portable devices such as smartphones, multimedia devices or table PCs.
