More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a non-caloric sweetener and methods for synthesizing the non-caloric sweetener.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Steviol glycosides are natural products isolated from <i>Stevia rebaudiana </i>leaves. Steviol glycosides are widely used as high intensity, low-calorie sweeteners and are significantly sweeter than sucrose. As natural sweeteners, different steviol glucosides have different degrees of sweetness and after-taste. The sweetness of steviol glycosides is significantly higher than that of sucrose. For example, stevioside is 100-150 times sweeter than sucrose with bitter after-taste. Rebaudioside C is between 40-60 times sweeter than sucrose. Dulcoside A is about 30 times sweeter than sucrose.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Naturally occurring steviol glycosides share the same basic steviol structure, but differ in the content of carbohydrate residues (e.g., glucose, rhamnose and xylose residues) at the C13 and C19 positions. Steviol glycosides with known structures include, steviol, stevioside, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F and dulcoside A (see e.g., Table 1). Other steviol glycosides are rebaudioside M, rebaudioside N and rebaudioside O.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

0.3% of the total weight of the steviol glycosides in the leaves, respectively, while the other steviol glycosides are present in much lower amounts. Extracts from the <i>Stevia rebaudiana </i>plant are commercially available, which typically contain stevioside and rebaudioside A as primary compounds. The other steviol glycosides typically are present in the stevia extract as minor components. For example, the amount of rebaudioside A in commercial preparations can vary from about 20% to more than 90% of the total steviol glycoside content, while the amount of rebaudioside B can be about 1-2%, the amount of rebaudioside C can be about 7-15%, and the amount of rebaudioside D can be about 2% of the total steviol glycosides.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">The majority of steviol glycosides are formed by several glycosylation reactions of steviol, which are typically catalyzed by the UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) using uridine 5&#x2032;-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) as a donor of the sugar moiety. UGTs in plants make up a very diverse group of enzymes that transfer a glucose residue from UDP-glucose to steviol. For example, glycosylation of the C-3&#x2032; of the C-13-O-glucose of stevioside yields rebaudioside A; and glycosylation of the C-2&#x2032; of the 19-O-glucose of the stevioside yields rebaudioside E. Further glycosylation of rebaudioside A (at C-2&#x2032;-19-O-glucose) or rebaudioside E (at C-3&#x2032;-13-O-glucose) produces rebaudioside D.

Although artificial sweeteners are available, many artificial sweeteners such as dulcin, sodium cyclamate and saccharin have been banned or restricted by some countries due to concerns over their safety. Therefore, non-caloric sweeteners of natural origin are becoming increasingly popular. One of the main obstacles for the widespread use of stevia sweeteners are their undesirable taste attributes. Accordingly, there exists a need to develop alternative sweeteners and methods for their production to provide the best combination of sweetness potency and flavor profile.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">The present disclosure relates generally to natural sweeteners.

It should be understood, however, that the description of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the disclosure to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0076">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar to or equivalent to those described herein may be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred materials and methods are described below.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0077">The term &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to describe the relationship between nucleotide bases that are capable to hybridizing to one another. For example, with respect to DNA, adenosine is complementary to thymine and cytosine is complementary to guanine. Accordingly, the subject technology also includes isolated nucleic acid fragments that are complementary to the complete sequences as reported in the accompanying Sequence Listing as well as those substantially similar nucleic acid sequences.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0078">The terms &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; and &#x201c;nucleotide&#x201d; are used according to their respective ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally-occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified or degenerate variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0079">The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and when used in the context of an isolated nucleic acid or an isolated polypeptide, is used without limitation to refer to a nucleic acid or polypeptide that, by the hand of man, exists apart from its native environment and is therefore not a product of nature. An isolated nucleic acid or polypeptide can exist in a purified form or can exist in a non-native environment such as, for example, in a transgenic host cell.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0080">The terms &#x201c;incubating&#x201d; and &#x201c;incubation&#x201d; as used herein refers to a process of mixing two or more chemical or biological entities (such as a chemical compound and an enzyme) and allowing them to interact under conditions favorable for producing a steviol glycoside composition.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0081">The term &#x201c;degenerate variant&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid sequence having a residue sequence that differs from a reference nucleic acid sequence by one or more degenerate codon substitutions. Degenerate codon substitutions can be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed base and/or deoxyinosine residues. A nucleic acid sequence and all of its degenerate variants will express the same amino acid or polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0082">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; and &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; are used according to their respective ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art; the three terms are sometimes used interchangeably, and are used without limitation to refer to a polymer of amino acids, or amino acid analogs, regardless of its size or function. Although &#x201c;protein&#x201d; is often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides, and &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; is often used in reference to small polypeptides, usage of these terms in the art overlaps and varies. The term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; as used herein refers to peptides, polypeptides, and proteins, unless otherwise noted. The terms &#x201c;protein,&#x201d; &#x201c;polypeptide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein when referring to a polynucleotide product. Thus, exemplary polypeptides include polynucleotide products, naturally occurring proteins, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments and other equivalents, variants, and analogs of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0083">The terms &#x201c;polypeptide fragment&#x201d; and &#x201c;fragment,&#x201d; when used in reference to a reference polypeptide, are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings to a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to a polypeptide in which amino acid residues are deleted as compared to the reference polypeptide itself, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is usually identical to the corresponding positions in the reference polypeptide. Such deletions can occur at the amino-terminus or carboxy-terminus of the reference polypeptide, or alternatively both.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0084">The term &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; of a polypeptide or protein refers to a peptide fragment that is a portion of the full length polypeptide or protein, and has substantially the same biological activity, or carries out substantially the same function as the full length polypeptide or protein (e.g., carrying out the same enzymatic reaction).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0085">The terms &#x201c;variant polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;modified amino acid sequence&#x201d; or &#x201c;modified polypeptide,&#x201d; which are used interchangeably, refer to an amino acid sequence that is different from the reference polypeptide by one or more amino acids, e.g., by one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or additions. In an aspect, a variant is a &#x201c;functional variant&#x201d; which retains some or all of the ability of the reference polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0086">The term &#x201c;functional variant&#x201d; further includes conservatively substituted variants. The term &#x201c;conservatively substituted variant&#x201d; refers to a peptide having an amino acid sequence that differs from a reference peptide by one or more conservative amino acid substitutions, and maintains some or all of the activity of the reference peptide. A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is a substitution of an amino acid residue with a functionally similar residue. Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of one non-polar (hydrophobic) residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another; the substitution of one charged or polar (hydrophilic) residue for another such as between arginine and lysine, between glutamine and asparagine, between threonine and serine; the substitution of one basic residue such as lysine or arginine for another; or the substitution of one acidic residue, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid for another, or the substitution of one aromatic residue, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan for another. Such substitutions are expected to have little or no effect on the apparent molecular weight or isoelectric point of the protein or polypeptide. The phrase &#x201c;conservatively substituted variant&#x201d; also includes peptides wherein a residue is replaced with a chemically-derivatized residue, provided that the resulting peptide maintains some or all of the activity of the reference peptide as described herein.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0087">The term &#x201c;variant,&#x201d; in connection with the polypeptides of the subject technology, further includes a functionally active polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 75%, at least 76%, at least 77%, at least 78%, at least 79%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, and even 100% identical to the amino acid sequence of a reference polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0088">The term &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; in all its grammatical forms and spelling variations refers to the relationship between polynucleotides or polypeptides that possess a &#x201c;common evolutionary origin,&#x201d; including polynucleotides or polypeptides from superfamilies and homologous polynucleotides or proteins from different species (Reeck et al., Cell 50:667, 1987). Such polynucleotides or polypeptides have sequence homology, as reflected by their sequence similarity, whether in terms of percent identity or the presence of specific amino acids or motifs at conserved positions. For example, two homologous polypeptides can have amino acid sequences that are at least 75%, at least 76%, at least 77%, at least 78%, at least 79%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, and even 100% identical.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0089">&#x201c;Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity&#x201d; with respect to the variant polypeptide sequences of the subject technology refers to the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues of a reference polypeptide after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0090">Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For example, the % amino acid sequence identity may be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2. The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including, for example, unmask yes, strand=all, expected occurrences 10, minimum low complexity length=15/5, multi-pass e-value=0.01, constant for multi-pass=25, dropoff for final gapped alignment=25 and scoring matrix=BLOSUM62. In situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: 100 times the fraction X/Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0091">In this sense, techniques for determining amino acid sequence &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; are well known in the art. In general, &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; refers to the exact amino acid to amino acid comparison of two or more polypeptides at the appropriate place, where amino acids are identical or possess similar chemical and/or physical properties such as charge or hydrophobicity. A so-termed &#x201c;percent similarity&#x201d; may then be determined between the compared polypeptide sequences. Techniques for determining nucleic acid and amino acid sequence identity also are well known in the art and include determining the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA for that gene (usually via a cDNA intermediate) and determining the amino acid sequence encoded therein, and comparing this to a second amino acid sequence. In general, &#x201c;identity&#x201d; refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences, respectively. Two or more polynucleotide sequences can be compared by determining their &#x201c;percent identity&#x201d;, as can two or more amino acid sequences. The programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.), for example, the GAP program, are capable of calculating both the identity between two polynucleotides and the identity and similarity between two polypeptide sequences, respectively. Other programs for calculating identity or similarity between sequences are known by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0092">An amino acid position &#x201c;corresponding to&#x201d; a reference position refers to a position that aligns with a reference sequence, as identified by aligning the amino acid sequences. Such alignments can be done by hand or by using well-known sequence alignment programs such as ClustalW2, Blast 2, etc.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0093">Unless specified otherwise, the percent identity of two polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences refers to the percentage of identical amino acid residues or nucleotides across the entire length of the shorter of the two sequences.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0094">&#x201c;Coding sequence&#x201d; is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to a DNA sequence that encodes for a specific amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0095">&#x201c;Suitable regulatory sequences&#x201d; is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5&#x2032; non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3&#x2032; non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences may include promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0096">&#x201c;Promoter&#x201d; is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to a DNA sequence capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coding sequence is located 3&#x2032; to a promoter sequence. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic DNA segments. It is understood by those skilled in the art that different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental conditions. Promoters, which cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times, are commonly referred to as &#x201c;constitutive promoters.&#x201d; It is further recognized that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences have not been completely defined, DNA fragments of different lengths may have identical promoter activity.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0097">The term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; refers to the association of nucleic acid sequences on a single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one is affected by the other. For example, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting the expression of that coding sequence (i.e., that the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter). Coding sequences can be operably linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0098">The term &#x201c;expression&#x201d; as used herein, is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from the nucleic acid fragment of the subject technology. &#x201c;Over-expression&#x201d; refers to the production of a gene product in transgenic or recombinant organisms that exceeds levels of production in normal or non-transformed organisms.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0099">&#x201c;Transformation&#x201d; is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to the transfer of a polynucleotide into a target cell. The transferred polynucleotide can be incorporated into the genome or chromosomal DNA of a target cell, resulting in genetically stable inheritance, or it can replicate independent of the host chromosomal. Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as &#x201c;transgenic&#x201d; or &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; or &#x201c;transformed&#x201d; organisms.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0100">The terms &#x201c;transformed,&#x201d; &#x201c;transgenic,&#x201d; and &#x201c;recombinant,&#x201d; when used herein in connection with host cells, are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to a cell of a host organism, such as a plant or microbial cell, into which a heterologous nucleic acid molecule has been introduced. The nucleic acid molecule can be stably integrated into the genome of the host cell, or the nucleic acid molecule can be present as an extrachromosomal molecule. Such an extrachromosomal molecule can be auto-replicating. Transformed cells, tissues, or subjects are understood to encompass not only the end product of a transformation process, but also transgenic progeny thereof.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0101">The terms &#x201c;recombinant,&#x201d; &#x201c;heterologous,&#x201d; and &#x201c;exogenous,&#x201d; when used herein in connection with polynucleotides, are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to a polynucleotide (e.g., a DNA sequence or a gene) that originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus, a heterologous gene in a host cell includes a gene that is endogenous to the particular host cell but has been modified through, for example, the use of site-directed mutagenesis or other recombinant techniques. The terms also include non-naturally occurring multiple copies of a naturally occurring DNA sequence. Thus, the terms refer to a DNA segment that is foreign or heterologous to the cell, or homologous to the cell but in a position or form within the host cell in which the element is not ordinarily found.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0102">Similarly, the terms &#x201c;recombinant,&#x201d; &#x201c;heterologous,&#x201d; and &#x201c;exogenous,&#x201d; when used herein in connection with a polypeptide or amino acid sequence, means a polypeptide or amino acid sequence that originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus, recombinant DNA segments can be expressed in a host cell to produce a recombinant polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0103">The terms &#x201c;plasmid,&#x201d; &#x201c;vector,&#x201d; and &#x201c;cassette&#x201d; are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to an extra chromosomal element often carrying genes which are not part of the central metabolism of the cell, and usually in the form of circular double-stranded DNA molecules. Such elements may be autonomously replicating sequences, genome integrating sequences, phage or nucleotide sequences, linear or circular, of a single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA, derived from any source, in which a number of nucleotide sequences have been joined or recombined into a unique construction which is capable of introducing a promoter fragment and DNA sequence for a selected gene product along with appropriate 3&#x2032; untranslated sequence into a cell. &#x201c;Transformation cassette&#x201d; refers to a specific vector containing a foreign gene and having elements in addition to the foreign gene that facilitate transformation of a particular host cell. &#x201c;Expression cassette&#x201d; refers to a specific vector containing a foreign gene and having elements in addition to the foreign gene that allow for enhanced expression of that gene in a foreign host.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0104">Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used herein are well known in the art and are described, for example, by Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.

Sucrose synthase catalyzes the chemical reaction between NDP-glucose and D-fructose to produce NDP and sucrose. Sucrose synthase is a glycosyltransferase. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NDP-glucose:D-fructose 2-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP glucose-fructose glucosyltransferase, sucrose synthetase, sucrose-UDP glucosyltransferase, sucrose-uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase, and uridine diphosphoglucose-fructose glucosyltransferase. Addition of the sucrose synthase to the reaction mixture that includes a uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase creates a &#x201c;UGT-SUS coupling system&#x201d;.

there are four &#x3b2;-D-glucosyl units in its structure connected to the aglycone steviol. A close comparison of the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR values of Reb V with Reb G suggested the presence of a steviol aglycone moiety with a 3-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucobiosyl unit at C-13 in the form of ether linkage and another &#x3b2;-D-glucosyl unit at C-19 position in the form of an ester linkage, leaving the assignment of the fourth &#x3b2;-D-glucosyl moiety (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). The downfield shift for both the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts at 2-position of sugar I of the &#x3b2;-D-glucosyl moiety supported the presence of &#x3b2;-D-glucosyl unit at this position. The structure was further supported by the key TOCSY and HMBC correlations as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. Based on the results of NMR and mass spectral data as well as hydrolysis studies, the structure of Reb V produced by the enzymatic conversion of Reb G was deduced as 13-[(3-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid-(2-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl) ester.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0249">Acid hydrolysis of Reb V. To a solution of Reb V (5 mg) in MeOH (10 ml) was added 3 ml of 5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and the mixture was refluxed for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was then neutralized with saturated sodium carbonate and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (2&#xd7;25 ml) to give an aqueous fraction containing sugars and an EtOAc fraction containing the aglycone part. The aqueous phase was concentrated and compared with standard sugars using the TLC systems EtOAc/n-butanol/water (2:7:1) and CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>/MeOH/water (10:6:1); the sugars were identified as D-glucose.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0250">Enzymatic hydrolysis of Reb V. Reb V (1 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5 and crude pectinase from <i>Aspergillus niger </i>(50 uL, Sigma-Aldrich, P2736) was added. The mixture was stirred at 50&#xb0; C. for 96 hr. The product precipitated out during the reaction from the hydrolysis of 1 was identified as steviol by comparison of its co-TLC with standard compound and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectral data. A compound named Reb V was confirmed as 13-[(3-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid-(2-O-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl) ester on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR as well as high resolution mass spectral data and hydrolysis studies.</p><heading id="h-0036" level="1">Example 22</heading><p id="p-0264" num="0251">In this Example, the structure of Reb W was analyzed by NMR.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0252">The material used for the characterization of Reb W was produced by using enzymatic conversion of Reb V and purified by HPLC. HRMS data were generated with a LTQ Orbitrap Discovery HRMS instrument, with its resolution set to 30 k. Scanned data from n/z 150 to 1500 in positive ion electrospray mode. The needle voltage was set to 4 kV; the other source conditions were sheath gas=25, aux gas=0, sweep gas=5 (all gas flows in arbitrary units), capillary voltage=30V, capillary temperature=300 C, and tube lens voltage=75. Sample was diluted with 2:2:1 acetonitrile:methanol:water (same as infusion eluent) and injected 50 microliters. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker Avance DRX 500 MHz or Varian INOVA 600 MHz instruments using standard pulse sequences. The 1D (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C) and 2D (TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC) NMR spectra were performed in C<sub>5</sub>D<sub>5</sub>N.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0253">The molecular formula of Reb W has been deduced as C<sub>50</sub>H<sub>80</sub>O<sub>28 </sub>on the basis of its positive high resolution (HR) mass spectrum which showed adduct ions corresponding to [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> at m/z 1151.4708; this composition was supported by the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectral data. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectral data of Reb W showed the presence of two methyl singlets at &#x3b4; 0.92 and 1.39, two olefinic protons as singlets at &#x3b4; 5.10 and 5.73 of an exocyclic double bond, nine sp3 methylene and two sp3 methine protons between S 0.72-2.72, characteristic for the ent-kaurane diterpenoids isolated earlier from the genus <i>Stevia</i>. The basic skeleton of ent-kaurane diterpenoids was supported by the TOCSY studies which showed key correlations: H-1/H-2; H-2/H-3; H-5/H-6; H-6/H-7; H-9/H-11; H-11/H-12. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of Reb W also showed the presence of five anomeric protons resonating at &#x3b4; 5.10, 5.34, 5.41, 5.81, and 6.14; suggesting five sugar units in its structure. Acid hydrolysis of Reb W with 5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>afforded D-glucose which was identified by direct comparison with authentic sample by TLC. Enzymatic hydrolysis of Reb W furnished an aglycone which was identified as steviol by comparison of <sup>1</sup>H NMR and co-TLC with standard compound. The large coupling constants observed for the five anomeric protons of the glucose moieties at &#x3b4; 5.10 (d, J=7.4 Hz), 5.34 (d, J=7.9 Hz), 5.41 (d, J=7.9 Hz), 5.89 (d, J=7.9 Hz), and 6.14 (d, J=7.9 Hz), suggested their &#x3b2;-orientation as reported for steviol glycosides [1-5, 9-13]. The <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR values for Reb W were assigned on the basis of TOCSY, HMQC and HMBC data and are given in Table 4.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004"
