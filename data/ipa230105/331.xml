The endoscope system <b>100</b> may further include a monitor <b>30</b>, an endoscope hanger <b>40</b>, and a tray <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The endoscope <b>1</b> is a video scope which includes an image sensor. Although the endoscope <b>1</b> is not particularly limited, the endoscope <b>1</b> is, for example, a flexible endoscope used for examination and treatment of a nose, ears and throat. In addition, the endoscope <b>1</b> may be a rigid endoscope. The endoscope <b>1</b> may be an endoscope used for examination and treatment of other organs, for example, a respiratory system such as bronchi or may be an endoscope used for examination and treatment of a digestive system. Alternatively, the endoscope <b>1</b> may be an endoscope used for laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, the endoscope <b>1</b> is not limited to the medical endoscope and may be an industrial endoscope.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the endoscope <b>1</b> includes a grip part <b>11</b> which an operator grips, an operation part <b>12</b> which the operator operates, and an insertion part <b>13</b> which is inserted into a test object. It is to be noted that the endoscope <b>1</b> is the so-called wireless endoscope and wirelessly transmits, to the video processor <b>20</b>, a signal obtained by imaging the test object with the insertion part <b>13</b> inserted into a body cavity of the test object (hereinafter, referred to as an endoscopic image). Therefore, the endoscope <b>1</b> does not have any universal cord which extends from the operation part <b>12</b> and is connected to peripherals such as the video processor <b>20</b>. However, the endoscope <b>1</b> is not limited to the wireless endoscope and may be a wired endoscope which includes a universal cord.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The video processor <b>20</b> is a video processor which processes the endoscopic image obtained by the endoscope <b>1</b>. The video processor <b>20</b> converts, for example, the signal from the endoscope <b>1</b> to a video signal and outputs the video signal to the monitor <b>30</b>. Thus, on the basis of the video signal from the video processor <b>20</b>, the monitor <b>30</b> displays a live image.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although the monitor <b>30</b> is, for example, a liquid crystal display, the monitor <b>30</b> may be other display device such as an organic EL display. The endoscope hanger <b>40</b> is a tool which hangs and retains the endoscope <b>1</b>, and at least one part thereof is configured by a conductive member <b>41</b>. The tray <b>50</b> is a metallic tray on which the endoscope <b>1</b> is placed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an internal configuration of the endoscope. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of an eddy current sensor. Hereinafter, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, a configuration of the endoscope <b>1</b> will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the endoscope <b>1</b> includes a light source part <b>2</b>, an imaging part <b>3</b>, a wireless communication part <b>4</b>, a control part <b>5</b>, a sensor part <b>6</b>, and a battery <b>7</b> which supplies electric power to each of the parts.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The light source part <b>2</b> includes a built-in light source which emits illumination light. Although the built-in light source is not particularly limited, the built-in light source is, for example, a white LED which emits white light for normal observation. In addition, the light source part <b>2</b> may include a semiconductor light source which emits special light used for special light observation such as narrow band imaging (NBI) (registered trademark) observation and auto-fluorescence imaging (AFI) (registered trademark) observation. The endoscope <b>1</b> may appropriately make switching between the normal observation with the white light and the NBI observation by controlling the light source part <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The imaging part <b>3</b> includes an image sensor which detects light from a test object <b>102</b> which is irradiated with the illumination light. The image sensor is, for example, a charge coupled device (CCD) image sensor, a complementary MOS (CMOS) image sensor, or the like. The imaging part <b>3</b> generates an endoscopic image transmitted to the video processor <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The wireless communication part <b>4</b> transmits and receives signals to and from the video processor <b>20</b>. Specifically, the wireless communication part <b>4</b> transmits, for example, the endoscopic image generated by the imaging part <b>3</b> to the video processor <b>20</b>. It is to be noted that a communication method between the wireless communication part <b>4</b> and the video processor <b>20</b> is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The control part <b>5</b> controls operation of each of the light source part <b>2</b>, the imaging part <b>3</b>, and the wireless communication part <b>4</b>. In addition, on the basis of a detection result by the sensor part <b>6</b>, the control part <b>5</b> switches an operation mode of the endoscope <b>1</b>. Specifically, on the basis of a detection result of the conductive member <b>101</b> by at least one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>included in the sensor part <b>6</b>, the control part <b>5</b> makes switching between a normal operation mode and an energy-saving operation mode. Thus, the endoscope <b>1</b> enables inhibiting useless power consumption in the endoscope <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is to be noted that it is only required for the energy-saving operation mode to be an operation mode of which power consumption is lower than that of the normal operation mode. The control part <b>5</b> may dim the illumination light emitted from the light source part <b>2</b> in, for example, the energy-saving operation mode so as to be dimmer than the illumination light emitted therefrom in the normal operation mode and may stop emitting of the illumination light from the light source part <b>2</b>. Thus, electric power consumed by the light source part <b>2</b> can be inhibited. In addition, the control part <b>5</b> may transfer the endoscopic image obtained by the imaging part <b>3</b> from the endoscope <b>1</b> to the video processor <b>20</b> in, for example, the energy-saving operation mode at an image transfer rate lower than an image transfer rate in the normal operation mode and may stop transferring of the endoscopic image. Thus, electric power consumed by the wireless communication part <b>4</b> can be inhibited. In addition, even in the case where the transferring of the endoscopic image is stopped, only minimum operation in which wireless connection between the endoscope <b>1</b> and the video processor <b>20</b> is maintained, for example, only minimum communication may be performed. In other words, while a state in which the endoscope <b>1</b> and the video processor <b>20</b> recognize each other as a counterpart of the wireless connection is maintained, the endoscope <b>1</b> and the video processor <b>20</b> operate so as to save power as much as possible. Thus, since while electric power consumed by the endoscope <b>1</b> is inhibited, it is not needed to perform pairing again for reconnection upon resuming image transfer, time required for the pairing can be saved and overhead of communication can be avoided, thereby allowing the image transfer to be early resumed. In addition, the control part <b>5</b> may dim the illumination light or stop emitting of the illumination light and may reduce the image transfer rate in, for example, the energy-saving operation mode. As described above, it is desirable that in the energy-saving operation mode, by adjusting operation of at least one of the light source part <b>2</b> and the wireless communication part <b>4</b>, in each of which an amount of the power consumption is comparatively large, the amount of the power consumption is inhibited.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a case where the image transfer rate is adjusted, in the energy-saving operation mode, the control part <b>5</b> may decimate a part of pixels of the endoscopic image obtained by the imaging part <b>3</b> and may thereafter transfer the endoscopic image from the endoscope <b>1</b> to the video processor <b>20</b>. Thus, the image transfer rate may be adjusted while a frame rate is maintained. Alternatively, in the energy-saving operation mode, the control part <b>5</b> may control the imaging part <b>3</b> so as to image the test object at a frame rate lower than a frame rate in the normal operation mode. Thus, electric power consumed by the imaging part <b>3</b> in addition to the electric power consumed by the wireless communication part <b>4</b> may be inhibited. Furthermore, in the energy-saving operation mode, the control part <b>5</b> may control the imaging part <b>3</b> so as to image the test object at the frame rate lower than the frame rate in the normal operation mode and may decimate the part of pixels of the endoscopic image obtained by the imaging part <b>3</b> and may then transfer the endoscopic image from the endoscope <b>1</b> to the video processor <b>20</b>. It is to be noted that the control part <b>5</b> may adjust imaging operation by the imaging part <b>3</b> so as not to be in conjunction with adjustment of the image transfer rate and for example, in the energy-saving operation mode, may stop imaging by the imaging part <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sensor part <b>6</b> includes one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a</i>, any of which detects the conductive member and a posture sensor <b>6</b><i>b</i>. In each of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a</i>, an eddy current sensor <b>8</b> which detects eddy induced currents generated in the conductive member <b>101</b> is included (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In each of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a</i>, other sensor which can detect the conductive member <b>101</b> may be included and for example, a capacitance type proximity sensor or the like may be included. The posture sensor <b>6</b><i>b </i>is a sensor which detects a posture of the endoscope <b>1</b> and includes, for example, a gyroscope sensor, acceleration sensor, and the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the eddy current sensor <b>8</b> includes a sensor coil <b>9</b> and a sensor circuit <b>10</b>. The sensor coil <b>9</b> generates an alternating current magnetic flux by a high frequency current supplied from the sensor circuit <b>10</b>. The sensor circuit <b>10</b> detects a current flowing in the sensor coil <b>9</b> and generates an output signal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The eddy current sensor <b>8</b> is a sensor which detects change in impedance of the sensor coil <b>9</b> by eddy currents generated in the conductive member <b>101</b>. In the eddy current sensor <b>8</b>, when the sensor coil <b>9</b> and the conductive member <b>101</b> come close to each other, a number of cross fluxes penetrating the sensor coil <b>9</b> changes by the eddy currents induced by the conductive member <b>101</b>. Therefore, by detecting the change in the impedance of the sensor coil <b>9</b>, which is caused by the change in the number of cross fluxes, presence of the conductive member <b>101</b> can be detected.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the endoscope <b>1</b> configured as described above, any of the proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member <b>41</b> of the endoscope hanger <b>40</b> and the metallic tray <b>50</b>, whereby the operation mode of the endoscope <b>1</b> is switched from the normal operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode. Thus, at timing at which the endoscope <b>1</b> is obviously not in use such as in a case where the endoscope <b>1</b> is hung on the endoscope hanger <b>40</b> and in a case the endoscope <b>1</b> is placed on the tray <b>50</b>, electric power supply can be controlled. Therefore, while necessary electric power is surely supplied, useless power consumption can be surely inhibited. In particular, since in the endoscope <b>1</b>, by detecting the conductive member, the operation mode can be switched, it is only required for each of a holding tool such as the endoscope hanger and a receiving tool such as the tray, which are used in combination with the endoscope <b>1</b>, to include a metallic member or the like, and the existing tools can be used as they are.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, in the endoscope <b>1</b>, each of the proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>includes the eddy current sensor. Because the eddy currents are not induced by a member other than the conductive member, unlike capacitance type proximity sensors or the like, by using the eddy current sensor, a detection target can be limited to the conductive member. Therefore, the endoscope <b>1</b> can inhibit a situation in which a member, not intended, is erroneously detected and the operation mode is thereby switched.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Hereinbefore, the exampled in which in the energy-saving operation mode, the operation of each of the light source part <b>2</b>, the imaging part <b>3</b>, and the wireless communication part <b>4</b> is adjusted is described, and in a case where the operation of the wireless communication part <b>4</b> among these is stopped, it is often the case that it takes a long time for return, as compared with a case where the operation of each of the light source part <b>2</b> and the imaging part <b>3</b> is stopped, and due to this, responsiveness is easily sacrificed. One factor of this is that when the wireless connection between the endoscope <b>1</b> and the video processor <b>20</b> is once disconnected, before data transfer therebetween is started, additional work for establishing the wireless connection again is required.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Therefore, as to a specific operation mode after switching from the normal operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode, in consideration of balance between inhibition of the power consumption and the responsiveness of the endoscope <b>1</b>, an operator may select an operation mode from among previously provided operation modes, and on the basis of a remaining amount of the battery <b>7</b> or the like, the endoscope <b>1</b> may automatically select an operation mode.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A first example of the specific operation mode is that when the endoscope <b>1</b> is place on the tray <b>50</b> or is hung on the endoscope hanger <b>40</b>, any of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member <b>101</b>, and the operation mode is switched to the energy-saving operation mode, the control part <b>5</b> immediately stops emitting of the illumination light from the light source part <b>2</b> and also stops the imaging operation by the imaging part <b>3</b>. In addition, concurrently therewith, the control part <b>5</b> also disconnects the wireless connection between the wireless communication part <b>4</b> and the video processor <b>20</b>. This operation mode allows the endoscope <b>1</b> to inhibit the power consumption at a maximum.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A second example of the specific operation mode is similar to the first example in that when the operation mode is switched to the energy-saving operation mode, the control part <b>5</b> immediately stops the emitting of the illumination light from the light source part <b>2</b> and also stops the imaging operation by the imaging part <b>3</b>. Thereafter, when any of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member <b>101</b> continuously for a predetermined period of time or more, that is, the energy-saving operation mode is maintained for the predetermined period of time or more, the control part <b>5</b> also disconnects the wireless connection between the wireless communication part <b>4</b> and the video processor <b>20</b>. For example, in a case where the operator has once placed the endoscope <b>1</b> on the tray <b>50</b> but soon resumes using of the endoscope <b>1</b>, since the wireless connection is not disconnected, this operation mode allows the operator to resume using of the endoscope <b>1</b> without inconvenience.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A third example of the specific operation mode is similar to the first example and the second example in that when the operation mode is switched to the energy-saving operation mode, the control part <b>5</b> immediately stops the emitting of the illumination light from the light source part <b>2</b> and also stops the imaging operation by the imaging part <b>3</b>. Thereafter, when the energy-saving operation mode is maintained for a predetermined period of time or more, the control part <b>5</b> reduces a bit rate between the wireless communication part <b>4</b> and the video processor <b>20</b>. Not only in the case where soon after switching to the energy-saving operation mode, using the endoscope <b>1</b> is resumed as in the second example but also in a case where the energy-saving operation mode is maintained for the predetermined period of time or more, this operation mode allows return to setting in normal use only by recovering the bit rate. Therefore, without sacrificing operability of the operator, inhibition in the power consumption can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A fourth example of the specific operation mode is similar to the first to the third example in that when the operation mode is switched to the energy-saving operation mode, the control part <b>5</b> immediately stops the emitting of the illumination light from the light source part <b>2</b> and also stops the imaging operation by the imaging part <b>3</b>. In addition, the fourth example is similar to the third example in that thereafter, when the energy-saving operation mode is maintained for the predetermined period of time or more, the control part <b>5</b> reduces the bit rate between the wireless communication part <b>4</b> and the video processor <b>20</b>. In the present example, when the energy-saving operation mode is maintained further for a second predetermined period of time (&#x3e;the predetermined period of time) exceeding the predetermined period of time or more, the control part <b>5</b> also disconnects the wireless connection between the wireless communication part <b>4</b> and the video processor <b>20</b>. In other words, the control part <b>5</b> inhibits the power consumption in the wireless communication part <b>4</b> via the reduction in the bit rate to the disconnection of the wireless connection in a stepwise manner. This operation mode allows balancing between the operability of the operator and the inhibition in the power consumption at a further high level.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Another operation mode may be an operation mode in which the stopping of the emitting of the illumination light in the first to the fourth example is changed to dimming of the illumination light. In addition, still another operation mode may be an operation mode in which the stopping of the imaging operation in each of the first to the fourth example is changed to a reduction in a frame rate. In addition, yet another operation mode may be an operation mode in which the stopping of the imaging operation in the first to the fourth example is changed to decimating of a part of pixels from the image. In addition, further another operation mode may be any combination of these.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Hereinafter, a desirable aspect of the endoscope <b>1</b> will be described. First, it is desirable that a coil diameter of the sensor coil <b>9</b> is larger than an internal diameter of a forceps port which opens at a leading end of the insertion part <b>13</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b>. In addition, it is further desirable that the coil diameter of the sensor coil <b>9</b> is three times or more as large as the internal diameter of the forceps port. This is because the internal diameter of the forceps port is deemed to substantially define a size of a treatment tool guided to the test object via the forceps port, and this is to avoid switching the operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode by detecting the treatment tool formed of the conductive member. Further details will be as follows.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Because the shorter a distance between the sensor coil <b>9</b> and the conductive member <b>101</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a liftoff L and see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) is, the larger change in impedance is caused in the sensor coil <b>9</b>, in the eddy current sensor <b>8</b>, output in accordance with the liftoff L can be obtained. On the other hand, as described in Journal of Magnetics Society of Japan, pages 569-572, Vol. 20, No. 2, 1996, when the liftoff L is constant, output in accordance with an area ratio between a coil area calculated from the coil diameter of the sensor coil <b>9</b> and an area of a surface facing the sensor coil <b>9</b> of the conductive member <b>101</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a target area) is obtained, and the smaller the target area/coil area is, the smaller also the change in the impedance is. In particular, since in a range in which the liftoff L is small, as compared with the coil diameter, change in inductance (eventually, the change in the impedance) strongly depends on an area of the conductive member <b>101</b>, detection sensitivity of the eddy current sensor <b>8</b> having the sensor coil <b>9</b> of which coil diameter is large is lowered. Therefore, it is difficult to detect a target of which diameter is smaller than the coil diameter, and in general, it is desirable that a diameter of a plane surface of a target is three times or more as large as the coil diameter. This is because when the diameter of the plane surface exceeds three times the coil diameter, the change in the impedance is approximately constant, not depending on the area ratio, and as a result, the detection sensitivity is also approximately constant at a high level.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above-described characteristics regarding the coil diameter which the eddy current sensor <b>8</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b> has are largely different from those of the conventional eddy current sensor. In order to surely detect even a small target by the eddy current sensor, it is desirable that the coil diameter is small, and this agrees with requisition to sensors in general, which are desired to be small-sized and lightweight. In contrast to this, as opposed to the above-mentioned requisition in general, by intendedly designing the coil diameter of the sensor coil <b>9</b> to be large, the eddy current sensor <b>8</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b> limits a detection target. By designing the eddy current sensor <b>8</b> as described above, the endoscope <b>1</b> makes it possible to further ensure a function to surely supply the electric power required when the endoscope is used.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is to be noted that although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an example in which the coil is wound in a rectangle is shown, a shape of the coil is not particularly limited. It is only required for the shape of the coil to generate a magnetic flux, and the coil may be wound in, for example, any annular shape such as a circular shape and an elliptic shape. In addition, in the present description, the coil diameter is a distance from an axis of the coil to the coil, and in a case where the coil has a certain thickness, the coil diameter may be, for example, a distance from the axis of the coil to the center of the thickness of the coil. More specifically, by integrating the distance from the axis of the coil to the coil along the coil and dividing a value obtained by the integration by a length of the coil, the coil diameter may be calculated. It is to be noted that the axis of the coil may be defined by, for example, the center of gravity of a projected image of the coil and a normal vector, the projected image obtained when the coil is projected on a plane surface having the normal vector in a direction orthogonal to the magnetic flux generated in the coil, and in a case where the coil is wound in the circular shape, aggregate of centers of circles is the axis of the coil.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the sensor coil <b>9</b> may be featured by the coil area, instead of the coil diameter, and in such a case, it is desirable that the coil area of the sensor coil <b>9</b> is larger than a sectional area of the forceps port which opens at the leading end of the insertion part <b>13</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b>. It is to be noted that also by designing the sensor coil <b>9</b> as described above, the endoscope <b>1</b> makes it possible to further ensure the function to surely supply the required electric power.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b></figref> are diagrams showing variations of placement of the sensor coil.

Hereinafter, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>9</b></figref>, desirable placement of the sensor coil will be described.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the endoscope <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the sensor coil <b>9</b> is provided in the grip part <b>11</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b>.

In more details, the sensor coil <b>9</b> is wound such that the axis of the sensor coil <b>9</b> faces a direction intersecting a tray bottom surface when the endoscope <b>1</b> is placed on the tray <b>50</b>. In the above-described placement, when the endoscope <b>1</b> is placed on the tray <b>50</b>, switching to the energy-saving operation mode is surely made. Furthermore, since in general, the treatment tool is inserted into the endoscope <b>1</b> from the forceps port provided for the operation part <b>12</b>, the treatment tool does not come close to the sensor coil <b>9</b> and accordingly, erroneously detecting the treatment tool and thereby switching to energy-saving operation mode can also be surely avoided. In addition, although in a case where the endoscope <b>1</b> is an industrial endoscope, it is assumed that a test object itself is a conductive member, by providing the sensor coil <b>9</b> in the grip part <b>11</b>, even if the test object is the conductive member, detecting the test object by the eddy current sensor <b>8</b> and thereby switching to the energy-saving operation mode can be avoided.

Hereinafter, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, placement of a sensor coil which is particularly desirable in a case where a nonmetallic tray is used will be described.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">An endoscope <b>1</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> includes two eddy current sensors. A sensor coil <b>9</b><i>c </i>of one of the eddy current sensors is provided in an inside of a grip part <b>11</b>, that is, a portion which contacts first joints and second joints of fingers when an operator grips the grip part <b>11</b>.

Either of the sensor coils is wound such that an axis of each of the sensor coils faces a direction substantially in parallel with a tray bottom surface when the endoscope <b>1</b><i>c </i>is placed on a nonmetallic tray <b>51</b>. In the above-described placement, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, since metallic pins <b>52</b> which are provided for a tray <b>51</b> to fix the endoscope <b>1</b><i>c </i>in a predetermined position when the endoscope <b>1</b><i>c </i>is placed on the tray <b>51</b> are detected by the eddy current sensors, switching to an energy-saving operation mode is surely made. It is to be noted that the tray having the metallic pins <b>52</b> is not limited to the nonmetallic tray and may be a metallic tray.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It is to be noted that although hereinbefore, the examples in which the sensor coil or sensor coils are fixed inside the endoscope are described, the sensor coil may be provided in such a way as to turn inside the endoscope depending on a posture of the endoscope. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a sensor coil <b>9</b><i>e </i>may be fixed on a bottom surface of a weight <b>60</b>, and the sensor coil <b>9</b><i>e </i>may be configured such that an axis of the sensor coil <b>9</b><i>e </i>invariably faces a gravitational direction by passing a supporting member <b>61</b> fixed on a wall surface <b>62</b> of the endoscope through a through hole provided for the weight <b>60</b>. Thus, in a case where the endoscope is placed on the tray <b>50</b>, facing even any direction, since eddy currents can be surely induced on a bottom surface of the tray, the tray is detected and the operation mode can be thereby switched to the energy-saving operation mode.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The above-described embodiment shows specific examples for facilitating understanding of the present disclosure, and the embodiment of the present disclosure is not limited to these. A variety of modifications and changes to the endoscope and the method for operating the endoscope can be devised without departing from the scope of the description of the claims.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, at least a region of a surface of the endoscope, through which the magnetic flux generated from the sensor coil pass, may be subjected to water repellent finish. Thus, occurrence of a situation in which the eddy current sensor detects human body fluid having high electric conductivity and as a result, during observation of an inside of a body cavity, the operation mode is switched to the energy-saving operation mode can be inhibited.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, in the above-described embodiment, the example in which any of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member and switching to the energy-saving operation mode is thereby made is shown. However, when each of a plurality of proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>included in the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member, the control part <b>5</b> may switch the operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode. By switching the operation mode on condition that the plurality of proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detect the conductive member, probability with which for example, by detecting a conductive member such as a finger ring, which is not intended, switching of the operation mode is made can be substantially reduced.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the above-described embodiment, the example in which any of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member and in which the operation mode is switched to the energy-saving operation mode is shown. However, when any of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member continuously for a predetermined period of time or more, the control part <b>5</b> may switch the operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode. As described above, by providing a certain grace period for switching the operation mode, risk that at timing which is not intended by an operator, switching to the energy-saving operation mode is made can be substantially reduced. It is to be noted that the certain grace period may be applied only in a case where switching from the normal operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode is made, and no grace period may be provided in a case where switching from the energy-saving operation mode to the normal operation mode is made. By using such an unsymmetrical switching criterion, both of inhibiting useless power consumption and surely supplying necessary electric power can be achieved at a high level. It is to be noted that switching from the energy-saving operation mode to the normal operation mode may be made by manual operation of an operator or may be made on the basis of the detection result of the proximity sensors as with the switching from the normal operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode. Specifically, return from the energy-saving operation mode to the normal operation mode may be made by pressing down a specific switch provided for the endoscope, or the return from the energy-saving operation mode to the normal operation mode may be made when a state in which the proximity sensors are detecting the conductive member is changed to a state in which the proximity sensors are not detecting the conductive member.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the above-described embodiment, the example in which any of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member and in which the operation mode is switched to the energy-saving operation mode is shown.

However, on the basis of the detection result of the conductive member by the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the detection result of the posture of the endoscope <b>1</b> by the posture sensor <b>6</b><i>b</i>, the control part <b>5</b> may make switching between the normal operation mode and the energy-saving operation mode. More specifically, for example, in a case where any of the one or more proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>detects the conductive member and the posture sensor <b>6</b><i>b </i>detects a predetermined posture, the control part <b>5</b> may switch the operation mode to the energy-saving operation mode. Since by combining the proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the posture sensor <b>6</b><i>b</i>, probability with which an unused state of the endoscope <b>1</b> is erroneously detected can be decreased, necessary electric power can be further surely supplied. It is to be noted that although herein, as one example of the conductive member, each of the metallic tray, the metallic pins, and the metallic hanger is exemplified, the conductive member is not limited to metal. The conductive member may be, for example, made of carbon, resin with conductive particles added, or the like. Accordingly, instead of the metallic tray, a tray made of carbon or a tray made of Teflon (registered trademark) with conductive particles added may be used, and instead of the metallic pins, pins made of resin with conductive particles added may be provided. In addition, the pins provided for the tray may be pins with surrounding of metallic pins covered with Teflon.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Although the detection result of the conductive member by the proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>is outputted, for example, as a voltage value from the proximity sensors <b>6</b><i>a </i>to the control part <b>5</b>, the voltage value (a threshold voltage) that the control part <b>5</b> should determine that the conductive member is detected may be adjusted by an operator in consideration of a previously assumed liftoff, a target area, and the like. In addition, the conductive member may be detected by using threshold voltages which are different from each other between when the endoscope is hung on the endoscope hanger <b>40</b> and when the endoscope is placed on the tray <b>50</b>, and in this case, the control part <b>5</b> may determine a threshold voltage which should be used on the basis of the detection result of the posture sensor <b>6</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, although in the above-described embodiment, the example in which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, both of the two eddy current sensors are provided for the purpose of detecting the pins <b>52</b> is shown, the plurality of proximity sensors provided for the endoscope may be provided for the purpose of detecting different targets.
