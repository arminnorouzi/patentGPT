As media exposure becomes increasingly fragmented across devices, platforms, and services, audience measurement entities (AME) are working to utilize a wider variety of data sources in television (TV) audience measurement. While statistical panels remain the gold standard, other datasets can provide additional information to supplement or expand measurement. For example, large census or census-like sources, such as set top box and smart TV data, can help stabilize estimates and mitigate sampling error. However, these data sources are of varying levels of quality, and each may have unique challenges based on the techniques through which they collect audience measurement data, such as tuning data, demographic data, etc. To use different data sources appropriately, it is helpful to have a high-quality truth source against which to validate the data sources. Further, if it is possible for data from the same device to appear in multiple sources, deduplication may be needed to avoid double counting of an audience member in the final audience measurement or ratings data.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;media,&#x201d; &#x201c;media content,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;media presentation&#x201d; include any type of content and/or advertisement delivered via any type of distribution medium. Thus, media includes television programming or advertisements, radio programming or advertisements, movies, web sites, streaming media, etc.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Descriptors &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; &#x201c;third,&#x201d; etc., are used herein when identifying multiple elements or components which may be referred to separately. Unless otherwise specified or understood based on their context of use, such descriptors are not intended to impute any meaning of priority or ordering in time but merely as labels for referring to multiple elements or components separately for ease of understanding the disclosed examples. In some examples, the descriptor &#x201c;first&#x201d; may be used to refer to an element in the detailed description, while the same element may be referred to in a claim with a different descriptor such as &#x201c;second&#x201d; or &#x201c;third.&#x201d; In such instances, it should be understood that such descriptors are used merely for ease of referencing multiple elements or components.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture disclosed herein monitor media presentations at media devices. Such media devices may include, for example, Internet-enabled televisions, personal computers, Internet-enabled mobile handsets (e.g., a smartphone), video game consoles (e.g., Xbox&#xae;, PlayStation&#xae;), tablet computers (e.g., an iPad&#xae;), digital media players (e.g., a Roku&#xae; media player, a Slingbox&#xae;, etc.), etc. In some examples, media monitoring information is aggregated to determine ownership and/or usage statistics of media devices, relative rankings of usage and/or ownership of media devices, types of uses of media devices (e.g., whether a device is used for browsing the Internet, streaming media from the Internet, etc.), and/or other types of media device information. In examples disclosed herein, monitoring information includes, but is not limited to, media identifying information (e.g., media-identifying metadata, codes, signatures, watermarks, and/or other information that may be used to identify presented media), application usage information (e.g., an identifier of an application, a time and/or duration of use of the application, a rating of the application, etc.), and/or user-identifying information (e.g., demographic information, a user identifier, a panelist identifier, a username, etc.).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As used herein a &#x201c;media device&#x201d; is a device that retrieves media from a media provider for presentation. In some examples, media devices are capable of directly presenting media (e.g., via a display) while, in other examples, media devices present the media on separate media presentation equipment (e.g., speakers, a display, etc.). Thus, as used herein &#x201c;media devices&#x201d; may or may not be able to present media without assistance from a second device. Media devices include consumer electronics. For example, media devices include Internet-enabled mobile handsets (e.g., a smartphone, an iPod&#xae;, etc.), video game consoles (e.g., Xbox&#xae;, PlayStation 3, etc.), tablet computers (e.g., an iPad&#xae;, a Motorola&#x2122; Xoom&#x2122;, etc.), digital media players (e.g., a Roku&#xae; media player, a Slingbox&#xae;, a Tivo&#xae;, etc.), smart televisions, personal computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, servers, etc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Monitoring companies (e.g., AMEs) desire knowledge on how users interact with media devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, smart televisions, etc. In particular, media monitoring companies want to monitor media presentations made at the media devices to, among other things, monitor exposure to advertisements, determine advertisement effectiveness, determine user behavior, identify purchasing behavior associated with various demographics, etc.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To enable data quality assessments, methodology research and development, validation, and deduplication, a process to identify the same devices appearing in multiple data sources, referred to herein as common devices or devices in common, is useful. By matching devices in common, different audience measurement data sources can be compared side-by-side to understand the differences in the data gathered and/or produced by the different audience measurement data sources. For example, if a panelist's TV set is the same as a TV set associated with audience measurement data from a satellite provider, the tuning data coming from both sources can be assessed to quantify data gaps or other quality concerns. Example common device identification techniques disclosed herein use TV tuning behavior and other characteristics to identify common devices in disparate data sources and to deduplicate the data gathered or derived from a common device. The deduplication results in more accurate audience measurement data.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Disclosed example common device identification techniques match media devices or media presentation devices across data sources based on behavioral similarity. For example, using tuning data, disclosed examples can determine whether the same device is present in multiple data sources. This enables data quality assessments as well as deduplication across data sources, both of which enable the appropriate integration of multiple datasets into audience measurement. Furthermore, if high-quality panel data is available, disclosed example device matching techniques can play a role in vetting data partners, provide foundational validation datasets for methodology development, and facilitate integrating multiple datasets into audience measurement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Disclosed example common device identification techniques match media devices that are present in multiple data sources by assessing similarity in tuning behavior on those devices. In some disclosed examples, for all possible pairwise device comparisons across data sources, the common device identification techniques compute several metrics, which are combined into an overall score. If the score passes or satisfies a particular threshold, then the devices are classified as a match. Additional restrictions on matches, such as requiring devices to come from the same geographical area, can also be included to use additional matching criteria and also to decrease the number of comparisons for scalability. Disclosed example techniques enable comparisons of large numbers of devices. For example, 50,000 media devices may be represented in panelist audience measurement data and 2,000,000 media devices may be represented in census audience measurement data, resulting in 10<sup>11 </sup>(i.e., 100,000,000,000) possible pairwise comparisons. Panelists are users registered on panels maintained by a ratings entity (e.g., an AME) that owns and/or operates the ratings entity subsystem. Panelist audience measurement data includes data gathered and/or derived from these users. A census includes collection of information across large or broad segments of the population. Census audience measurement data includes data gathered and/or derived from a broader segment of the population at large (rather than just registered panelists). As noted above, census-like sources include set top boxes and smart TVs. As used herein, &#x201c;census&#x201d; and &#x201c;census data&#x201d; includes a portion of a population but not necessarily every member of a population.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As disclosed herein, example metrics that can be used for common device identification capture different aspects of tuning behavior including the media (e.g., content, advertisement, etc.) tuned, time of tuning events, and sequence of tuning events. Example metrics disclosed herein can be used to determine if there is a sufficient, desired, and/or threshold degree of similarity between what media two devices associated with two different audience measurement datasets were presenting (e.g., based on one or more thresholds), when the two devices were presenting media, the order in which events (e.g., tuning events) occurred, etc., for the two devices to be identified as the same device (e.g., a common device) appearing in multiple data sources. However, because the data quality can differ across data sources, the metrics can allow for some degree of difference, which may also vary depending on the data source. For example, some data sources may be more prone to missing information and/or containing errors associated with capturing the exact timing of tuning events. For this reason, the disclosed example deduplication and common device identification techniques are flexible such that the metrics and respective thresholds for matching device activity can be adjusted based on known information and/or limitations of the datasets being compared.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unlike prior techniques for identifying common devices among multiple datasets, disclosed example techniques do not detect matches by relying on device identification information such as, for example, device model and/or serial numbers. Rather, disclosed example deduplication and common device identification techniques compare tuning behavior across the datasets, for example, media presentation information (e.g., channel/station identifiers, program identifiers, etc.), timing and sequencing of tuning events, duration of tuning events, etc., to identify common devices across the datasets. Furthermore, disclosed example deduplication and common device identification techniques are nuanced as these techniques include metrics that assess different aspects of tuning behavior, which can be optimized based on known qualities of the data sources under evaluation, thereby allowing the disclosed examples to be applied to a wide variety of use cases.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Turning to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example environment <b>100</b> in which there are multiple data measurement sources including an audience measurement entities (AME) meter <b>102</b> and an automatic content recognition (ACR) meter <b>104</b>. In this example, the AME meter <b>102</b> measures panelist audience measurement data, which includes data indicative of the media presented by the media devices (e.g., televisions) at panelists sites. In this example, the ACR meter <b>104</b> measures census data, which includes data reported by software clients executed by the media devices (e.g., smart TVs). Though two example data sources, the AME meter <b>102</b> and the ACR meter <b>104</b>, are shown in the example environment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in other examples, other numbers of data sources may be included. The AME meter <b>102</b> gathers data from one or more first devices <b>108</b>. The ACR meter <b>104</b> gathers data from one or more second devices <b>110</b>. In some examples, the first devices <b>108</b> and the second devices <b>110</b> are the same. In some examples, the first devices <b>108</b> and the second devices <b>110</b> partially overlap. In some examples, the first devices <b>108</b> and the second devices <b>110</b> are disparate. The examples disclosed herein facilitate the identification of common devices between the first devices <b>108</b> and the second devices <b>110</b> that are represented in both panelist audience measurement data and census audience measurement data reported by media devices. The example disclosed herein facilitate deduplication of data related to common devices to enhance the accuracy of audience measurement data.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example common device identification system <b>200</b> implemented in accordance with teachings of this disclosure. The common device identification system <b>200</b> of the illustrated example includes an example panelist data retriever <b>205</b>, an example census data retriever <b>210</b>, an example comparison controller <b>215</b>, an example station duration metric calculator <b>220</b>, an example time match metric calculator <b>225</b>, an example station path metric calculator <b>230</b>, an example time distance metric calculator <b>233</b>, an example comparison scorer <b>235</b> and an example common device selector <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, the panelist data retriever <b>205</b> retrieves, via one or more networks, panelist audience measurement data reported by AME meter <b>102</b>. In some examples, the census data retriever <b>210</b> retrieves, via one or more networks, census audience measurement data reported by ACR meter <b>104</b> (e.g., smart TVs and/or other media devices). In some examples, the panel data retriever <b>205</b> and the census data retriever <b>210</b> are combined. In other examples, there are additional data retrievers such as, for example, if there are additional meters and/or other data sources in the environment <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some examples, the comparison controller <b>215</b> identifies homes that include multiple data sources including, for example two meters. For example, the comparison controller <b>215</b> determines AME panel households that include ACR meters such as an ACR meter included in a smart TV. The comparison controller <b>215</b> is to identify a first device in a first data source and a second device in a second data source as a possible common device. For example, the comparison controller <b>215</b> can compare tuning data collected from the two data sources to match devices with similar tuning data. In some examples, the comparison controller <b>215</b> can examine minute-level and sub-minute level tuning. In some examples other time periods may be used. In some examples, the comparison controller <b>215</b> can pinpoint data quality concerns such as, for example, missing and/or miscredited tuning data.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, the comparison controller <b>125</b> is to apply a restriction to first data from the first data source and second data from the second data source before the comparison controller is to identify the first device and the second device as the possible common device.

Accounting for the number of stations tuned in the denominator ensures that devices tuning to a small number of stations do not carry disproportionately high weight in the calculation. The station duration metric calculator <b>220</b> sets the normalized distance score as the station duration metric. The factor N<sup>0.75 </sup>is a normalization factor and, in some examples, the value 0.75 is configurable. In the illustrated example, a lower station duration metric indicates a closer match.

The time match metric calculator <b>225</b> compares data related to a pair of media devices (e.g., one media device represented in the panelist audience measurement data with another media device represented in the census audience measurement data). The time match metric measures whether the two media devices being compared presented the same media at the same times. The time match metric is based on first time data and second time data. The first time data is associated with a first set of times of day that the first device tuned to a set of stations. The second time data is associated with a second set of times of day that the second device tuned to the set of stations. In some examples, the first set of times of day overlap with the second set of times of day. In some example, the set of stations related to the data compared by the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> is the same as the set of stations related to the data compared by the station duration metric calculator. In some example, the set of stations related to the data compared by the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> and the set of stations related to the data compared by the station duration metric calculator at least partially overlap. In some example, the set of stations related to the data compared by the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> is wholly disparate from the set of stations related to the data compared by the station duration metric calculator.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0029">In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> divides the first set of times of day and the second set of times of day into time slots. For example, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> divides the comparison duration (e.g., one week for the first pass, six weeks for the second pass, etc.) into time slots. In some examples, the time slots are an hour in duration. In some examples, the time slots are in half-hour increments. Other examples may use other durations for the time slots and/or a combination of different durations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0030">The time match metric calculator <b>225</b> identifies a dominant station tuned to by the different devices for respective time slots. In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> identifies the dominant station tuned to by each of the devices for each of the time slots. For example, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> may determine the dominant station based on a duration of tuning to the station, the station tuned to for the most amount of aggregate time in a time slot, and/or the station tuned to for the longest contiguous time duration. In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> identifies from the respective panelist versus census audience measurement data for each device being compares, the dominant station tuned by each device during each time slot. For example, with two slots, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> identifies a first dominant station tuned to by the first device in a first time slot of the time slots, identifies a second dominant station tuned to by the second device in the first time slot, identifies a third dominant station tuned to by the first device in a second time slot of the time slots, and identifies a fourth dominant station tuned to by the second device in the second time slot. In some examples, the first and second device may be the same device. In such an example, and with two time slots, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> identifies a first dominant station tuned to by the device in a first time slot of the time slots based on a first data source (e.g., the panelist data), identifies a second dominant station tuned to by the device in the first time slot based on a second data source (e.g., the census data), identifies a third dominant station tuned to by the device in a second time slot of the time slots based on the first data source, and identifies a fourth dominant station tuned to by the device in the second time slot based on the second data source.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0031">In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> compares the dominant stations in respective time slots. In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> compares the dominant stations in each time slot. For example, with the example of two time slots, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> performs a first comparison of the first dominant station and the second dominant station of the first time slot, and performs a second comparison of the third dominant station and the fourth dominant station.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0032">In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> calculates a penalty based on the comparison of dominant stations in a time slot. In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> sets a penalty at a first value when at least one of: (1) data for the respective time slot is missing from at least one of the first device or the second device, or (2) at least one of the first device or the second device is powered off for the respective time slot. The time match metric calculator <b>225</b> sets a penalty at a second value when the first device and the second device are tuned to different stations during a respective time slot. In some examples, the second value is greater than the first value. Thus, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> determines different penalties to assign to a time slot based on the power status and/or tuning status of the device. Thus, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> determines different penalties to assign to a time slot based on whether the dominant stations between two devices (or data sources) match, one device is powered off, one device is tuning and lacks a dominant station, both devices are powered off, etc. For example, if the stations tuned by the pair of devices match during a time slot, no penalty is assigned (e.g., penalty=0). If both devices are off, a penalty value (e.g., 0.5) is assigned. If there is a mismatch, a penalty value is assigned, which can be dependent on the type of mismatch. In some examples, the penalty values are between 0 and 1. In some examples, penalty factors are alternatively or additionally based on the data sources being compared. For example, some data sources have excess tuning compared to other data sources. In such examples, a different penalty may be applied to mismatches with comparisons using those data sources.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0033">In the illustrated example, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> sums the penalty values for respective time slots over the given comparison duration, and divides by the number of timeslots to determine the time match metric for that pair of devices. In some examples, the time match metric calculator <b>225</b> sums the penalty values for all time slots over the given comparison duration. The time match metric calculator <b>225</b> determines a difference score based on the sum of the penalties. The term &#x201c;difference&#x201d; score is to signify a level of difference between the two devices, i.e., how different the devices are. The time match metric calculator <b>225</b> sets the difference score as the time match metric. In the illustrated example, a lower time match metric indicates a closer match. That is, the lower the time match metric, the more likely the two devices are a common device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0034">In some examples, a third calculator such as, for example, the station path metric calculator <b>230</b> calculates an example station path metric. The station path metric calculator <b>230</b> determines the station path metric to compare a pair of media devices (e.g., one media device represented in a first data source such as, for example, the panelist audience measurement data with another media device represented in a second data source such as, for example, the census audience measurement data). The station path metric measures whether the two media devices being compared presented the same sequence of media. Thus, in some examples, the station path metric is based on a first sequence of stations tuned to by the first device and a second sequence of stations tuned to by the second device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0035">In the illustrated example, the station path metric calculator <b>230</b> computes an edit distance between the sequence of stations tuned by the first device and the sequence of stations tuned by the second device over a comparison duration (e.g., one week for the first pass, six weeks for the second pass). The edit distance counts the number of changes that would be needed for the sequence tuned by the first device to match the sequence tuned by the second device.

In the illustrated example, a lower station path metric indicates a closer match. That is, the lower the station path metric, the more likely the two devices are a common device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0037">In some examples, a fourth calculator such as, for example, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> calculates an example time distance metric. The time distance metric measures or quantifies how similar the start and/or end times of tuning sessions or tuning activities are between two devices. The times discussed with respect to the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> could be either the start times or the end times of the tuning sessions or, in some examples. Could be both start times and end times that are then combined. The time distance metric measures whether the two media devices being compared presented media at the same times. Thus, in some examples, the time distance metric is based on tuning or time events of the first device and the second device.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0038">In the illustrated example, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> identifies a first set of time events for the first device and creates a first list of the time events. The first list of the time events may be, for example, unix timestamps, which are integer numbers of seconds from some reference point. For example, a first list may include [10, 15, 20]. In this example, the first device had a first time event 10 seconds after the reference point. The first time event could be powering on the first device, tuning to a channel, or other change in operation of the first device. The first device, in this example, has a second time event at fifteen seconds past the reference point and a third time event at twenty seconds past the reference point. The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> identifies a second set of time events for the second device and creates a second list of the time events. The second list of the time events also may be, for example, unix timestamps. For example, a second list may include [10, 12, 16, 19, 20].</p><p id="p-0048" num="0039">The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the length of each list of time events. In some examples, the two lists of time events are not same length. In such examples, the shorter list may be known as the short list, and the longer list may be known as the long list. Thus, in the example above, the lists could be identified as short=[10, 15, 20] and long=[10, 12, 16, 19, 20]. In some examples, the lengths of the two lists are the same. The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the absolute distance between each event in each of the two lists. For example, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> may use an array to determine the absolute time distance between the events:</p><p id="p-0049" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>16</entry><entry>19</entry><entry>20</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>6</entry><entry>9</entry><entry>10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>15</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>8</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>Thus, in this example, the first device had a time event at 10 seconds, and the second device had a time event at 10 seconds. Therefore, the distance between the two time events is 0. The first device had a second event at 15 seconds. The second device has a second event at 12 seconds. Therefore, the distance between the two time events is 3. The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> also determines the distance between different ones of the time events. For example, the distance between the first time event of the first device (at 10 seconds) and the third time event of the second device (at 16 seconds) is 6. The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the distances between all of the time events between the two devices.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0040">The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines a minima distance list, which is a list of scores or distances that represent how close the events in the list are. When there is one list shorter than the other, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the minimum distance for each item in the short list (i.e., each row in the array). This is the minimum distance for an event in the short list to one of the events in the long list. In the example above, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the minima distance as short_list_minima=[0 1 0]. In the example in which the lists are of the same length, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the minimum distance from one of the lists to the other.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0041">In the example above, there is a short list and a long list. Thus, there are additional items in the long list that did not match to an item in the short list when the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determined the minima distance. For example, the second time event of the second device at 12 seconds and the fourth time event of the second device at 19 seconds did not match to an event of the first device when determining the minima distance. In this scenario, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> adds a penalty value. In some examples, the penalty value is the greatest distance possible between two timestamps in the time period. For example, in a seven-day time period, the penalty may be 604,800 (7 days=7 days*24 hours*60 minutes*60 seconds). In some examples, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> calculates:</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>all_penalties=short_list_minima+[penalty]*(len(long)&#x2212;len(short))=[0,1,0, penalty, penalty]&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation (6):<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0053" num="0000">where len represents the name of the length function in Python, which is the number of elements in the list. In the example above, the number of elements in the short list is three, and the number of elements in the long list is five.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0042">The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> computes a final time distance score as the root mean square of these values.

In the illustrated example, a lower time distance metric indicates a closer match. That is, the lower the time distance path metric, the more likely the two devices are a common device.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0043">In some examples, the comparison scorer <b>235</b> determines a final comparison or joint score based on the station duration metric, the time match metric, the station path metric, and the time distance metric. In some examples, the comparison scorer <b>235</b> standardizes the station duration metric, the time match metric, the station path metric, and/or the time distance metric. For example, the comparison scorer <b>235</b> computes the z-score of the station duration metric, the z-score of the time match metric, the z-score of the station path metric, the z-score of the time distance metric. In the illustrated example, the comparison scorer <b>235</b> determines the joint score based on a combination (e.g., a sum) of the z-score of the station duration metric, the z-score of the time match metric, the z-score of the station path metric, and the z-score of the time distance metric.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0044">The common device selector <b>240</b> uses the resulting joint scores to select pairs of devices that are candidate common devices during the first iteration pass, or are identified common devices during the second iteration pass. In some examples, the common device selector determines that the first device and the second device are a common device when the joint score satisfies a threshold. In some examples, the threshold is satisfied when four times the standard deviation of the joint score is less than the mean joint score. In some examples, the common device selector <b>240</b> determines that two devices are a common device, when the joint score satisfies the threshold for the first iteration pass and again for the second iteration pass.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0045">In some examples, the common device selector <b>240</b> outputs final selections of the common devices that are represented in both sources of data.

The station path metric C is used to identify if two devices are common devices as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example procedure or program <b>700</b> to be performed by the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> to determine an example time distance metric. The time distance metric is used to compare how similar the start and/or end times of tuning sessions or tuning activities are between two devices. The time distance metric measures whether the two devices being compared had tuning events at the same times or how closely in time.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0081">In the illustrated example program <b>700</b>, time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> accesses tuning time data for a first device (block <b>702</b>). The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> accesses tuning time data for a second device (block <b>704</b>). The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> identifies time events from the first device based on the tuning time data of the first device and creates a first list of time events (block <b>706</b>). The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> identifies time events from the second device based on the tuning time data of the second device and creates a second list of time events (block <b>708</b>). The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the absolute distance between each time event for each device (block <b>710</b>). For example, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> creates an array using the first list and the second list. The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> fills in the array by calculating the distance between a time event of the first device and a time event of the second device.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0082">The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines if the first list is shorter than the second list or if the second list is shorter than the first list (block <b>712</b>). If the first and second lists are the same length (block <b>712</b>: NO), the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the minima distance (block <b>714</b>). The minima distance is a list of the respective minimum distance from each event on one list to an event on the other list. If the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines that one of the first list or the second list is shorter than the other (block <b>712</b>: YES), the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the minima distance for the short list (Block <b>716</b>). That is, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines a list of the minimum distance from each event in the short list to an event in the long list.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0083">Because the long list has more event than the short list, there will be events in the long list that are not matched to the events in the short list when the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> determines the minima distance for the short list. The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> calculates a penalty for each event in the long list that is unmatched to an event in the short list (block <b>718</b>). In other words, events in the long list that are too far in distance from events in the short list are assigned a penalty. The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> computes a time distance score (block <b>720</b>). The time distance score is based on the minima distance and any penalties. For example, the time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> may compute the time distance score using Equation (6).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0084">The time distance metric calculator <b>233</b> sets the distance as the time distance metric D for the pair of devices being compared (block <b>722</b>). The time distance metric D is used to identify if two devices are common devices as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example procedure or program <b>800</b> to be performed by the comparison scorer <b>235</b> and the common device selector <b>240</b>. In the example program <b>800</b>, the comparison scorer <b>235</b> accesses the metrics (block <b>802</b>). For example, the comparison scorer <b>235</b> access the station duration metric A, the time match metric B, the station path metric C, and the time distance metric D. The comparison scorer <b>235</b> computes the z-scores of the station duration metric A, the time match metric B, the station path metric C, and the time distance metric D for each pair of media devices being compared (block <b>804</b>). The comparison scorer <b>235</b> combines (e.g., sums) the z-scores for each pair of media devices into a joint score (block <b>806</b>). The comparison scorer <b>235</b> computes the z-scores of the joint scores to determine a final comparison score for each pair of media devices being compared (block <b>808</b>).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0086">The common device selector <b>240</b> determines if the resulting comparison score satisfies a threshold (block <b>810</b>). For example, the common device selector <b>240</b> determines if four times the standard deviation of the comparison score is less than the mean comparison score. If the common device selector <b>240</b> determines that the comparison score does not satisfy the threshold (block <b>810</b>: NO), the common device selector <b>240</b> determines, selectors or identifies the devices as different (block <b>812</b>). That is, the common device selector <b>240</b> identifies the devices as not common devices when the comparison score does not satisfy a threshold.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0087">If the common device selector <b>240</b> determines that the comparison score does satisfy the threshold (block <b>810</b>: YES), the common device selector <b>240</b> selects the devices as candidate common devices (block <b>814</b>). The common device selector <b>240</b> then determines if the candidate common devices have matched for an aggregate time period (block <b>816</b>). That is, the common device selector <b>240</b> determines if a comparison score for the devices has satisfied a threshold for an aggregate of multiple time periods. In other words, the example program <b>800</b> is performed using metrics for a first time period, and the example program <b>800</b> is performed using metrics for a second time period. The two time periods could be, for example, one week for a first pass (e.g., the first time period) and six weeks for a second pass (e.g., the second time period). The second time period of, in this example, six weeks, could be an aggregate of analysis and scorings for each week in the six weeks. Testing or determining the matching of two devices with scores aggregated over time periods enhances confidence that the two devices are common devices.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0088">If the common device selector <b>240</b> determines that the candidate common devices have not matched for two time periods (block <b>816</b>: NO), the common device selector <b>240</b> identifies the devices as different (block <b>812</b>). In other words, if the common device selector <b>240</b> determines that the comparison score for two devices satisfies a threshold for one time period but does not satisfy the threshold for another time period, the common device selector <b>240</b> identifies the two devices as not common or different devices.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0089">If the common device selector <b>240</b> determines that the candidate common devices have matches for two time periods (block <b>816</b>: YES), the common device selector <b>240</b> determines, selects, or identifies the candidate common devices as common devices (block <b>818</b>).
