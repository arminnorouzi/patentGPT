The normal charging mode means that the adapter outputs small current value (usually less than 2.5 A) or uses small power (usually less than 15 W) to charge the battery in the charging device. In normal charging mode, it usually takes several hours to fully charge a large capacity battery (such as a 3000 MAH battery). Fast charging mode means that the adapter can output large current (usually greater than 2.5 A, such as 4.5 A, 5 A or higher) or a high power (usually greater than or equal to 15 W) to charge the battery in the charging device. Compared with the normal charging mode, the charging speed of the adapter in the fast charging mode is faster, and the charging time required to fully fill the battery with the same capacity can be significantly shortened.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a circuit structure block diagram of a power supply circuit <b>1</b> in an embodiment of the present disclosure.
