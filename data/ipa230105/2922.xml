According to certain embodiments, the gold and/or silver can be recovered selectively, such that gold and/or silver is at least partially separated from non-silver and/or non-gold material within the scrap. According to certain embodiments, gold and/or silver may be recovered from scrap material using mixtures of acids. In some embodiments, the mixture comprises nitric acid and at least one supplemental acid. For example, in some embodiments, mixtures comprising sulfuric acid and nitric acid may be used to recover gold and/or silver. In certain embodiments, mixtures comprising phosphoric acid and nitric acid may be used to recover gold and/or silver. In some embodiments, the amount of nitric acid within the mixture may be relatively small compared to the amount of sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid within the mixture. According to some embodiments, highly concentrated acids may be used in the recovery process (e.g., such that the leaching solution contains a relatively small amount of water). In some embodiments, the recovery of gold and/or silver using the acid mixtures described herein can be enhanced by transporting an electric current between an electrode and the gold and/or silver of the scrap material. Certain embodiments relate to the use of acid mixtures to recover silver from particular types of scrap materials. For example, some embodiments relate to the use of acid mixtures to recover silver from scrap material comprising silver metal and cadmium oxide and/or scrap material comprising silver metal and tungsten metal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Certain of the processes involve the separation and/or recovery of gold and/or silver in their metallic form(s) from any type of gold and/or silver containing scrap items (e.g., plated and/or filled scrap items). According to certain embodiments, gold and/or silver can be selectively recovered from the surface of base metals and base metal alloys. The gold and/or silver within the scrap material can be in any suitable form. For example, in some embodiments, the gold and/or silver may be in the form of a plating or filling (e.g., which are collectively referred to as a &#x201c;coating&#x201d; everywhere below). Examples of such scrap items from which gold and/or silver may be recovered include, but are not limited to, gold and/or silver filled jewelry, gold and/or silver plated wires, silver/cadmium oxide filled copper, and gold plated electronic components (e.g., CPUs). The invention is not limited to the recovery of gold and/or silver from the surface of scrap materials, and in some embodiments, gold and/or silver can be also recovered from scrap items containing gold and/or silver metal within the bulk of the article (e.g., at a depth of at least 5% of the maximum cross-sectional diameter of the article). Recovery of gold and/or silver from the bulk can be achieved, for example, by exposing the scrap to the action of the leaching solutions after the scrap items have been reduced to powder. Non-limiting examples of such scrap materials include silver-tungsten pellets and ground electronic chips.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, silver may be recovered from silver-containing scrap items that are substantially free of gold (e.g., including gold in an amount of less than 2 wt %). In certain embodiments, gold may be recovered from gold-containing scrap items that are substantially free of silver (e.g., including silver in an amount of less than 2 wt %). According to some embodiments, gold and silver may be recovered from scrap items that contain both gold and silver.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from a scrap material by exposing the scrap material comprising the gold and/or silver (and, in some embodiments, at least one base metal) to a mixture comprising acids. For example, in some embodiments, the scrap material is exposed to a mixture comprising nitric acid and at least one supplemental acid. In some such embodiments, the amount of nitric acid within the mixture is less than or equal to about 10 wt %, less than or equal to about 9 wt %, less than or equal to about 8 wt %, less than or equal to about 7 wt %, less than or equal to about 6 wt %, less than or equal to about 5 wt %, less than or equal to about 4 wt %, less than or equal to about 3 wt %, less than or equal to about 2 wt %, less than or equal to about 1 wt %, or less. In some embodiments, the amount of nitric acid within the mixture is as little as about 4 wt %, as little as about 3 wt %, at little as about 2 wt %, as little as about 1 wt %, as little as about 0.5 wt %, as little as about 0.1 wt %, or less. In some embodiments, the amount of nitric acid within the mixture is as little as about 0.07 wt %, as little as about 0.05 wt %, at little as about 0.02 wt %, as little as about 0.01 wt %, or less.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A variety of acids can be used as the supplemental acid. In some embodiments, the supplemental acid(s) is capable of forming an insoluble salt with gold and/or silver within the mixture. For example, in some embodiments, phosphoric acid and/or sulfuric acid can be used in combination with the nitric acid.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to certain embodiments, the supplemental acid comprises a sulfonic acid. For example, the leaching solution may comprise, according to certain embodiments, a solution (e.g., an aqueous solution) of nitric acid and a sulfonic acid. In some such embodiments, the leaching solution may also comprise an additional supplemental acid, such as sulfuric acid and/or phosphoric acid. Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the presence of the sulfonic acid can provide high solubility of dissolved metals (e.g., dissolved noble metal(s)) in the leaching solution, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In certain embodiments, the leaching solution comprises at least one sulfonic acid represented by:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RS(&#x2550;O)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;OH,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0033" num="0000">wherein R is an alkyl group containing 1-12 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group containing 1-12 carbon atoms, a hydroxyalkyl group containing 1-12 carbon atoms, or an aryl group containing 6-12 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the leaching solution comprises an alkanesulfonic acid comprising an alkyl group containing 1-5 carbon atoms. Combinations of these may also be used.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">According to certain embodiments, the supplemental acid of the leaching solution comprises an alkane sulfonic acid. Examples of suitable alkane sulfonic acids that can be used include, but are not limited to, ethanesulfonic acid, propanesulfonic acid, isopropanesulfonic acid, butanesulfonic acid, isobutanesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and combinations of two or more of these. In some embodiments, alkane sulfonic acid can be part of an aqueous solution used as the leaching solution. The leaching solution can contain, according to certain embodiments, the alkane sulfonic acid and nitric acid. In some embodiments, the leaching solution can contain an alkane sulfonic acid, nitric acid, and at least one additional supplemental acid (e.g., sulfuric acid and/or phosphoric acid).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">In some embodiments, the supplemental acid of the leaching solution comprises methanesulfonic acid. Methanesulfonic acid is a strong organic acid that is generally substantially completely non-oxidizing at high concentrations, and that generally forms highly soluble salts with many metals. Methanesulfonic acid generally has a high dissociation constant, and is therefore a good electrolyte. Methanesulfonic acid also has substantially no odor, and it is sometimes described as being a &#x201c;green acid&#x201d; because of its ecological advantages (e.g., readily biodegradable, virtually VOC free, having low TOC, making hardly any contribution to COD, being free of nitrogen, phosphorus and halogens, etc.).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">According to certain embodiments, the leaching solution comprises persulfuric acid. The persulfuric acid may be present in place of or in addition to a sulfonic acid in the leaching solution (including any of the sulfonic acids mentioned elsewhere herein, and mixtures of these).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">In some embodiments, the leaching solution comprises a peroxymonosulfate ion (SO<sub>5</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) and/or a peroxydisulfate ion (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>). The peroxymonosulfate ions and/or peroxydisulfate ions may be present in place of or in addition to a sulfonic acid in the leaching solution (including any of the sulfonic acids mentioned elsewhere herein, and mixtures of these).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">According to certain embodiments, the leaching solution comprises sulfamate ions. The sulfamate ions can originate from a number of sources. In some embodiments, at least a portion (e.g., at least about 1 wt %, at least about 5 wt %, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 25 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 75 wt %, at least about 90 wt %, at least about 95 wt %, at least about 99 wt %, or all) of the sulfamate ions originate from sulfamic acid and/or a sulfamate salt. In certain embodiments, at least a portion (e.g., at least about 1 wt %, at least about 5 wt %, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 25 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 75 wt %, at least about 90 wt %, at least about 95 wt %, at least about 99 wt %, or all) of the sulfamate ions originate from sulfamic acid. In certain embodiments, at least a portion (e.g., at least about 1 wt %, at least about 5 wt %, at least about 10 wt %, at least about 25 wt %, at least about 50 wt %, at least about 75 wt %, at least about 90 wt %, at least about 95 At %, at least about 99 wt %, or all) of the sulfamate ions originate from a sulfamate salt. The sulfamate salt may include, for example, sulfamate ions ionically bonded to one or more metal ions. The sulfamate salt may include, for example, ammonium sulfamate, sodium sulfamate, potassium sulfamate, calcium sulfamate, and/or combinations of two or more of these.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">In certain embodiments, the total amount of sulfamate ions in the leaching solution is less than or equal to about 10 wt %, less than or equal to about 9 wt %, less than or equal to about 8 wt %, less than or equal to about 7 wt %, less than or equal to about 6 wt %, less than or equal to about 5 wt %, less than or equal to about 4 wt %, less than or equal to about 3 wt %, or less than or equal to about 2 wt % (and/or, in some embodiments, at least about 0.001 wt %, at least about 0.01 wt %, at least about 0.1 wt %, at least about 1 wt %, or at least about 2 wt %).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">According to certain embodiments, the leaching solution comprises ammonium. In certain embodiments, the total amount of ammonium in the leaching solution is less than or equal to about 5 wt %, less than or equal to about 4.5 wt %, less than or equal to about 4 wt %, less than or equal to about 3.5 wt %, less than or equal to about 3 wt %, less than or equal to about 2.5 wt %, or less than or equal to about 2 wt % (and/or, in some embodiments, at least about 0.001 wt %, at least about 0.01 wt %, at least about 0.1 wt %, at least about 1 wt %, or at least about 2 wt %).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">According to certain embodiments, the leaching solution comprises acetic acid.

In some embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from a scrap material by exposing the scrap material comprising the gold and/or silver (and, in some embodiments, at least one base metal) to a mixture comprising phosphoric acid and nitric acid. In certain embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from a scrap material by exposing the scrap material comprising the gold and/or silver (and, in some embodiments, at least one base metal) to a mixture comprising phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">In some embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from a material containing gold and/or silver by exposing the material comprising the gold and/or silver (and, in some embodiments, at least one base metal) to a mixture comprising a sulfonic acid and nitric acid. In certain embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from a material containing gold and/or silver by exposing the material comprising the gold and/or silver (and, in some embodiments, at least one base metal) to a mixture comprising phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid. In certain embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from a material containing gold and/or silver by exposing the material comprising the gold and/or silver (and, in some embodiments, at least one base metal) to a mixture comprising sulfuric acid, a sulfonic acid (e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid such as methane sulfonic acid), and nitric acid. In certain embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from a material containing gold and/or silver by exposing the material comprising the gold and/or silver (and, in some embodiments, at least one base metal) to a mixture comprising phosphoric acid, a sulfonic acid (e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid such as methane sulfonic acid), and nitric acid.

In certain embodiments in which electric current is transported between the electrode and the gold and/or silver, the scrap items can be used as an anode in an electrolytic cell.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">In some embodiments, gold and/or silver can be recovered from scrap material containing gold and/or silver and at least one base metal. In some such embodiments, the gold and/or silver can be recovered (e.g., via dissolution of the gold and/or silver) without substantially dissolving the base metal(s) of the scrap material. Base metals are generally non-precious metals (e.g., metals that are not gold, silver, platinum, or palladium). Examples of base metals include, but are not limited to, iron, nickel, lead, zinc, copper, manganese, tin, antimony, and/or aluminum, as well as alloys comprising same, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the base metals include copper, iron, nickel, lead, and/or zinc, alloys comprising same, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">Certain of the methods described herein can be applied for the recovery of precious metals from types of scrap that are generally difficult to process such as, for example, scrap in which impure gold and/or silver (e.g., alloys of gold and/or silver metals with the base metals) are applied as a coating (e.g., plating, filling) over a substrate, made of base metals/base metals alloys. According to certain embodiments, the gold and/or silver can be dissolved and the base metals of the coating can be removed, whereby the coating will be removed from the substrate, but it will not lead to any essential dissolution of the base metals of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">In some embodiments, the weight ratio of the supplemental acid within the acid mixture to the nitric acid within the mixture is relatively high. For example, in some embodiments, the ratio of the weight of the at least one supplemental acid in the mixture to the weight of the nitric acid in the mixture is at least about 3:1, at least about 4:1, at least about 5:1, at least about 6:1, at least about 7:1, at least about 8:1, at least about 9:1, at least about 10:1, at least about 11:1, at least about 12:1, at least about 13:1, at least about 14:1, at least about 15:1, or at least about 17:1 (and/or, in certain embodiments, up to about 20:1, up to about 50:1, up to about 100:1, or more). When more than one supplemental acid is present, the ratio of the weight of the at least one supplemental acid to the weight of the nitric acid is calculated by adding the weights of all supplemental acids within the mixture together, and comparing this number to the weight of the nitric acid within the mixture. In some embodiments, the ratio of the combined weights of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid in the mixture to the weight of the nitric acid in the mixture is at least about 3:1, at least about 4:1, at least about 5:1, at least about 6:1, at least about 7:1, at least about 8:1, at least about 9:1, at least about 10:1, at least about 11:1, at least about 12:1, at least about 13:1, at least about 14:1, at least about 15:1, or at least about 17:1 (and/or, in certain embodiments, up to about 20:1, up to about 50:1, up to about 100:1, or more).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">In certain embodiments, the weight ratio of sulfuric acid to nitric acid in the mixture used to recover the gold and/or silver is relatively high. Such relatively high weight ratios can be employed, in certain embodiments, when electrical current is transported between the scrap material and another electrode within the system, which can result in the electrolytic removal of gold and/or silver from the scrap material. In some such embodiments, the weight ratio of sulfuric acid to nitric acid within the mixture is at least about 12:1, at least about 13:1, at least about 14:1, at least about 15:1, or at least about 17:1 (and/or, in certain embodiments, up to about 20:1, up to about 50:1, up to about 100:1, or more). For example, in one set of embodiments, the leaching solution includes 90 wt % or more of concentrated sulfuric acid (e.g., at least 95 wt % sulfuric acid, such as 95-98 wt % sulfuric acid, the balance of which may be, for example, water) and 10 wt % or less of concentrated nitric acid (e.g., at least 68 wt % nitric acid, such as 68-70 wt % nitric acid, the balance of which may be, for example, water).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">In certain embodiments, the weight ratio of phosphoric acid to nitric acid in the mixture is relatively high. Such relatively high weight ratios can be employed, for example, when electrical current is transported between the scrap material and another electrode within the system, which can result in the electrolytic removal of gold and/or silver from the scrap material. For example, in some embodiments, the weight ratio of phosphoric acid to nitric acid within the mixture is at least about 11:1, at least about 12:1, at least about 13:1, at least about 14:1, at least about 15:1, or at least about 17:1 (and/or, in certain embodiments, up to about 20:1, up to about 50:1, up to about 100:1, or more). In one set of embodiments, the leaching solution includes 90 wt % or more of concentrated phosphoric acid (e.g., 85 wt % phosphoric acid or stronger, the balance of which may be, for example, water) and 10 wt % or less of concentrated nitric acid (e.g., at least 68 wt % nitric acid, such as 68-70 wt % nitric acid, the balance of which may be, for example, water).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the use of nitric acid in amounts greater than those described above can, in certain cases, lead to the formation of NO<sub>x </sub>compounds in the bath, especially when, for example, the scrap material is being used as part of an electrolytic cell during removal of gold and/or silver. In addition, it is believed that the use of nitric acid in amounts greater than those described above can, in certain cases, cause overheating of the solution and/or rapid dissolution of base metals of the substrate, which one may desire to avoid.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">In certain embodiments, an oxidant can be used (in place of, or in addition to, the nitric acid) to recover gold and/or silver from the scrap material. For example, some embodiments comprise exposing the scrap material to a fluid comprising an oxidant having the ability to dissolve gold and/or silver. In some such embodiments, the amount of the oxidant within the fluid is less than or equal to about 10 wt %, less than or equal to about 9 wt %, less than or equal to about 8 wt %, less than or equal to about 7 wt %, less than or equal to about 6 wt %, or less than or equal to about 5 wt % (and/or, in some embodiments, as little as 4 wt %, as little as 3 wt %, at little as 2 wt %, as little as 1 wt %, or less). A variety of such oxidants may be used. In some embodiments, an oxidant with the ability to dissolve gold and/or silver is selected for use. In some embodiments, the oxidant can be in the form of a soluble salt. In certain embodiments, the soluble salt comprises an oxide of manganese, nickel, lead, and/or chromium. One non-limiting example of an oxidant that may be used is manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>). In some embodiments, the mixture comprises the oxidant (e.g., MnO<sub>2</sub>) and at least one supplemental acid (e.g., phosphoric acid and/or sulfuric acid). For example, in some embodiments, mixtures comprising an oxidant (e.g., MnO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfuric acid and/or phosphoric acid may be used to recover gold and/or silver. Any of the supplemental acids described elsewhere herein can, according to certain embodiments, be used in combination with the oxidant. In some embodiments, the oxidant is capable of producing oxygen by reacting with the supplemental acid (e.g., phosphoric acid and/or sulfuric acid). For example, when manganese oxide and sulfuric acid are used, manganese oxide can react with sulfuric acid to produce manganese sulfate (MnSO<sub>4</sub>), oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>), and water.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">The mixtures described herein that are used to recover gold and/or silver (which can include for example one or more acids and/or one or more oxidants, as described above) are also sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;leaching solutions.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">In some embodiments, the amount of water contained in the leaching solution is relatively low.

For example, in some embodiments, a scrap material containing a silver and cadmium oxide coating over a copper base material can be exposed to the acid mixture. In some such embodiments, cadmium and silver are dissolved in the leaching solution while the copper base material is not substantially dissolved. As another example, in some karat gold filled items, 40% of Au is alloyed with 60% of base metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Fe, etc.) and applied over Cu&#x2014;Zn substrate. In certain embodiments, exposing these articles to certain of the acid mixtures described herein results in the dissolution of the gold and base metals in the coating, but does not result in the dissolution of the Cu&#x2014;Zn substrate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">According to certain embodiments in which the scrap material is used as part of an electrolytic cell, the use of the above mentioned proportions of the concentrated acids has led to the unexpected discovery that the gold and/or silver as well as the base metals of the coating (e.g., base metals of the karat gold filling, cadmium of the silver-cadmium oxide coating, etc.) are dissolved in the leaching solution, but as soon as the dissolution of the coating is finished, the base metal substrate does not substantially dissolve in the solution, and the electric current in the cell drops down to substantially zero. In some such embodiments, the precious metals can be dissolved in the leaching solution and subsequently recovered, while the base metal substrate is not substantially damaged by the process (and can therefore be recovered separately).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">The gold and/or silver that are recovered can be at least partially separated from the scrap material, for example, in metallic form. In some embodiments, the gold and/or silver that is recovered from the process is recovered in high purity (e.g., having a purity of at least about 90 wt %, at least about 95 wt %, at least about 99 wt %, or at least about 99.9 wt %, relative to non-gold and non-silver metals).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">According to certain embodiments, gold metal (e.g., high purity gold metal) can be recovered from the leaching solution, in which gold, optionally silver, and optionally some amount of base metal(s) have been dissolved. In some embodiments, separation of gold from the rest of metal(s) occurs by diluting the leaching solution (containing concentrated acids) with water. In some embodiments, gold can be recovered from a gold-containing solution by combining water and the gold-containing solution to form a mixture, such that solid gold is precipitated within the mixture. For example, in some embodiments, when the solution is mixed with the excess amount of water, silver and/or base metal(s) remain dissolved, while gold is precipitated (e.g., in the form of pure or substantially pure metal powder). According to some embodiments, the gold may be separated from the dilute leaching solution and from the rest of metals, for example, via filtration. In some embodiments in which gold removal is performed by passing electrical current through the scrap material, gold can be at least partially precipitated on a cathode through which the current is transported.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">In certain embodiments in which silver is present (either in combination with gold or on its own), the silver may be recovered, for example, by any of a number of methods, including, but not limited to, addition of chloride ions, addition of a reducing agent, addition of a base, electrowinning, or cementation. In certain embodiments, silver may be recovered via the cementation of silver with copper. In some embodiments, dissolved silver may be precipitated (e.g., as elemental silver and/or as a solid silver salt). In some such embodiments, the precipitated silver may be at least partially separated from the leaching solution and/or other metals. For example, the precipitated silver may be filtered from the leaching solution and/or from other metals. In certain embodiments, a formate salt (e.g. sodium formate), can be used as reducing agent. In some embodiments, a base (e.g. sodium hydroxide) can be added to the solution. Addition of the base can cause formation of a silver-containing solid (e.g., in the form of silver oxide). In some embodiments, the silver-containing solid (e.g., silver oxide), can be recovered and the silver within the silver-containing solid can be at least partially extracted (e.g., via smelting). In some embodiments in which silver is at least partially dissolved from scrap material using electrical current, silver can be recovered on a cathode through which the electric current is transported.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">In some embodiments, silver can be precipitated by adding chloride ions (e.g., by adding hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride, or any other suitable source of chloride ions). In some such embodiments, the silver can be precipitated as silver chloride. In some such embodiments, the solid silver chloride can be at least partially separated from other dissolved metals that do not form a solid compound with chloride ions (e.g. cadmium). According to certain embodiments, silver chloride can be further transformed to silver metal using any of a variety of methods (e.g., by addition of hydroxide and/or glucose or by interaction with sodium borohydride).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">Silver may also be selectively precipitated as silver metal using other methods. For example, in some embodiments, silver metal can be precipitated by adding sodium formate at increased pH (e.g., a pH of between about 1.5 and about 4), which can produce high purity silver. In some embodiments, silver metal can be precipitated by adding a reducing agent. For example, reducing agents such as hydrazine, hydroquinone, and/or ascorbic acid, can be added to the solution of dissolved silver.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">It is noted that, in many conventional operations, the dilution of the concentrated acids with water is a very dangerous process, in which NO<sub>x </sub>compounds and/or large amounts of hot corrosive acid vapor are generated. It has been discovered that the dilution of acids in accordance with certain embodiments described herein can be accomplished safely without generation of dangerous vapors and gases, when the loaded leaching solution is slowly added to the excess amount of deionized (DI) water. In some embodiments, the weight proportion of water to concentrated acid solution can be 3:1 or higher (and, in some embodiments, may be from 3:1 to below 5:1). In certain embodiments, the weight proportion of water to concentrated acid solution can be 5:1 or higher (and, in some embodiments, may be from 5:1 to below 10:1). In certain embodiments, the weight proportion of water to concentrated acid solution can be 10:1 or higher. According to certain embodiments, the concentrated acid solution is rapidly stirred in the excess volume of water as it is added. As a result of this operation, gold can be precipitated in the form of a substantially pure metal powder and can be recovered from the solution, for example, using any type of solid-liquid separation technique. Subsequently, scrap copper can be added to the leaching solution, and silver can be recovered by galvanic displacement (cementation).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">Certain of the methods described herein may be used to recover silver from scrap material comprising silver and cadmium oxide. For example, in some embodiments, silver is recovered by exposing a scrap material comprising silver and cadmium oxide to a mixture comprising sulfuric acid and nitric acid, or to a mixture comprising phosphoric acid and nitric acid, such that the silver is dissolved by the mixture. In some embodiments, the scrap material from which the silver is recovered comprises silver and cadmium oxide (e.g., a Ag&#x2014;CdO alloy) coated or otherwise positioned over a copper base material. Such materials are often used, for example, in relay contacts, switches, profiles, contact tips, and the like. In some embodiments, the silver-cadmium oxide material is dissolved in the leaching solution, the silver is separately recovered, and the copper base is not substantially corroded by the leaching solution. In such a way, the silver-cadmium oxide on copper base material, which generally cannot be easily recycled by conventional methods such as smelting (e.g., due to the dangers caused by melting of cadmium), can be recycled relatively easily.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">In some embodiments, silver can be recovered from scrap material containing silver and tungsten. For example, in some embodiments, silver is recovered by exposing a scrap material comprising the silver and tungsten to a mixture comprising sulfuric acid and nitric acid, or to a mixture comprising phosphoric acid and nitric acid, such that the silver is dissolved by the mixture. In the past, the recovery of silver from scrap containing silver and tungsten has generally not been commercially feasible using conventional methods such as smelting because of very high melting temperature of tungsten. In addition, the use of conventional leaching solutions for dissolving silver (such as, for example, solutions containing 50 wt % or 50 vol % nitric acid) may lead to the oxidation of tungsten and the formation of tungsten oxide. In addition, in such methods large amounts of nitric acid is consumed for the oxidation of tungsten, and silver is generally not dissolved entirely. Surprisingly, the leaching solution formulated according to certain of the embodiments described herein does not lead to the oxidation of tungsten. In addition, in some embodiments, silver is selectively dissolved and recovered from the solution, leaving behind the tungsten residue.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">Certain embodiments relate to inventive systems and apparatus used to recover gold and/or silver from scrap material.

The electrically conductive lead can be inserted into the rotatable container and positioned such that the electrically conductive lead remains in contact with the scrap material (and, in some such cases, the gold and/or silver within the scrap material) when the container is rotated. During operation, the scrap can be placed in the rotatable container (e.g., a cylindrical container such as a barrel), and the electrically conductive lead(s) (which may be made, for example, of titanium, any other corrosion resistant conductive material, or any other material) can be inserted such that they make contact with the rotatable container and/or the scrap material within the rotatable container. In some embodiments, the conductive leads may be positioned such that they continuously remain in electrical contact with the scrap items (which may move because of the rotation of the rotatable container), so that substantially all the scrap items remain in the electrical contact with the electrically conductive leads. The leads can be connected to the positive pole of a direct current source, and in such a way the scrap items serve as an electrode (e.g., an anode). A non-limiting example of a system in which such arrangements are used is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">In certain embodiments in which an electrical current is used to at least partially remove the gold and/or silver, the other electrode (e.g., the cathode) can be made of any corrosion resistant conductive material, such as e.g. stainless steel, and can be placed inside of the leaching reactor (e.g., close to the rotatable container). The scrap material can be placed in the rotatable container. The rotatable container can then be closed and immersed into the leaching solution inside the leaching reactor. In some embodiments, as soon as the electric current drops to substantially zero, the leaching solution can be pumped out of the reactor, and, in some such embodiments, rinse water can be pumped into the reactor. The rotatable container can be rotated with or without electrical current being applied, so that the scrap items can be rinsed from the residues of the leaching solution. In some embodiments, the rinse water can then be transported out of the reactor. At this point the cover of the leaching reactor can be lifted and the treated scrap material can be removed. Advantageously, human contact with the concentrated acids can be avoided, according to certain embodiments, making the leaching process safe to use.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">An exemplary process for the recovery of silver from silver-containing scrap material is now described. The exemplary process comprises three main parts: leaching, dilution, and cementation. During the leaching stage, the scrap items are treated with the leaching solution, so that the silver containing surfaces are in the direct contact with the solution, and in such manner, silver metal can be selectively dissolved in the leaching solution and separated from the remaining scrap items, which are made of base metals. Examples of the materials which have been already successfully treated according to this process, include silver plated copper wires (e.g., up to 5 wt % of silver, with the balance copper), silver filled copper-zinc perforated tapes (e.g., up to 25 wt % of silver, with the balance being copper-zinc alloy), silver-cadmium oxide filled copper plates (e.g., up to 90 wt % silver, up to 25% cadmium oxide filling on pure copper plates), silver and tungsten containing pellets (40-45 wt % of silver, with the balance being tungsten and some base metals). In the last case the pellets were reduced to powder before being exposed to the action of the leaching solution.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">According to certain embodiments, the relative amounts of silver and leaching solution can be up to 60 g of silver per 1 liter of solution, for example, when the solution is at about 55&#xb0; C. According to some embodiments, if larger amounts of silver are dissolved, the white precipitate of silver sulfate can appear. To dissolve the precipitate, more leaching solution can be added, heated and stirred. In some embodiments, the temperature of the solution is from about 55&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C.

The addition of supplemental sulfuric acid can be used to replenish the acid which has been consumed by the formation of silver salt. Thus, in some such embodiments, as the dissolved silver precipitates, new portions of the undissolved metal in the scrap can be dissolved as sulfuric acid is added. In some such embodiments, the leaching process can be performed over much longer continuous periods of time than would be possible were additional supplemental acid not added to the leaching solution In some embodiments, the solid silver salt (e.g., silver sulfate) can be separated from the leaching solution, for example, via filtration. In some embodiments in which silver sulfate is formed (e.g., when sulfuric acid is used as a supplemental acid), the silver sulfate can be reacted to form silver oxide. The formation of silver oxide from silver sulfate can be achieved, for example, by adding a base (e.g. sodium hydroxide) to the silver sulfate-containing liquid. In some embodiments, the silver oxide can be transformed to silver metal. The formation of silver metal from silver oxide can be achieved, for example, via smelting.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">In some embodiments, the formation of a silver-containing solid (e.g., silver precipitate such as silver sulfate) in the leaching solution can be beneficial in separating the silver from other metals. For example, in some embodiments, a coating on the scrap material can contain a base metal (e.g., in addition to silver). In some such embodiments, the base metal in the coating can be soluble in the leaching solution and the silver may be at least partially insoluble in the leaching solution (and, thus, form a precipitate in the leaching solution). In some such embodiments, the base metal (e.g., cadmium) may remain dissolved in the leaching solution while the silver precipitates. In some such embodiments, the silver-containing precipitate may be at least partially separated from the base metal (e.g., cadmium), for example, via filtration or any other suitable solid liquid separation process. In some such embodiments, the silver can be recovered in substantially pure form.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">In some embodiments (e.g., in certain embodiments in which electrical current is transported through the scrap material during the removal of silver), silver salt (e.g., silver sulfate) may be initially included in the leaching solution (e.g., in an amount up to the saturation limit of the silver salt). In some embodiments, the voltage that is applied across the scrap material and a second electrode is kept relatively low, such as at or lower than about 5V, at or lower than about 2V. In some such embodiments, silver will be deposited on the second electrode (which can be the cathode of the electrochemical cell). In some such embodiments, the silver dissolved from the scrap material replenishes the silver deposited on the second electrode. In some embodiments, at the end of the stripping process, some amount of silver remains dissolved in the leaching solution. In some embodiments, silver which has been deplated during the process can be recovered from the second electrode.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">In certain embodiments (including certain embodiments in which relatively large amounts of gold are dissolved), a gold precipitate (e.g., a dark-brown gold precipitate) can appear in the leaching solution. In some embodiments, the precipitate can be accumulated and separated from the leaching solution using filtration or any other suitable liquid-solid separation technique. According to certain embodiments, if no other metals are dissolved in the leaching solution along with gold, the stripping process can be operated over a relatively long continuous period. In some such cases, replenishing the leaching solution is not needed unless some of the original leaching solution escapes from the leaching solution container. In some embodiments in which other metals (e.g., base metals and/or silver) are dissolved together with gold in the leaching solution, the dilution of the leaching solution and separation of solid gold can be performed before the concentration of the other metal dissolved in the leaching solution (e.g., the base metal and/or silver) exceeds its saturation level within the leaching solution. In some such embodiments, mixing of solid gold with an insoluble salt of a non-gold metal can be avoided, which can enhance the degree to which the gold is purified.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">In some embodiments, re-circulation of the solution speeds up the process.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the leaching solution is prepared by mixing the components in separate leaching solution preparation container <b>401</b>, in which the solution is heated up to temperature. The scrap is positioned within a rotating drum, which is inserted into a leaching tank <b>402</b>. The cover of the leaching tank is closed and the leaching solution is pumped from tank <b>401</b> into the tank <b>402</b>. According to certain embodiments, the barrel can then be rotated and the leaching process can start.

Although in some such embodiments some dissolution of copper occurs because of the presence of the nitric acid, it has been established experimentally that the consumption of copper is usually about &#x2153; of the weight of the recovered silver. The cementation is generally complete when the concentration of silver in the solution drops to substantially zero (which can be determined, for example, using a chloride ion test).

If the material contains a Ag&#x2014;CdO coating, which was relatively thick in the treated samples, it may be advantageous to increase the reaction speed by using anodic stripping. The scrap material can be used as an anode, and stainless steel rods (or other conductive materials) can be used as a cathode. The electrodes can be connected to a power supply, and an electric current can be applied. The current will drop to at or near zero when the dissolution of the coating is over. It is favorable, in some cases, to use moderate amperage to avoid overheating of the solution, which may lead to the formation of NO<sub>x </sub>compounds. The set-up configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> can be all used in this process. In such cases, the rack, the container/reactor, and/or the rotatable container can be connected to the power supply and used as an anode.

Stainless steel bars (or other conductive materials) can be used as a cathode. Electrical current can be applied across the anode and the cathode to aid in the dissolution of the gold and silver. Generally, the electrical current drops to at or near zero once the process of dissolving the silver and gold is complete. Gold, silver, and minor amounts of base metals can be dissolved in the solution. The moment when the solution can be considered saturated can be determined by measuring the conductivity and/or the specific gravity of the solution. The saturation can also be detected by observing the removal of gold and silver from the stripped scrap material.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0114">The leaching solution used in the silver process described above is also capable of oxidizing and dissolving gold. In cases in which gold is dissolved, the speed with which the process is performed can be increased if electrical force (anodic stripping) is used. Thus, the strong acid liquids described elsewhere herein can be used to dissolve silver, gold, and/or combinations of silver and gold from scrap materials.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0115">Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, dissolution of the gold and silver may take place as follows.

Both sides of the tape were analyzed with a SPECTROSCOUT XRF (x-ray fluorescence) Analyzer (AMETEK). The silver-plated side of the tape was found to be covered by almost pure silver, having the following composition:</p><p id="p-0144" num="0123">Ag=99.5&#xb1;0.5 wt %,</p><p id="p-0145" num="0124">Zn=0.41&#xb1;0.05 wt %,</p><p id="p-0146" num="0125">Cu=0.043&#xb1;0.032 wt %.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0000">The non-plated side was identified as a copper-zinc alloy with the following composition:</p><p id="p-0148" num="0126">Cu=62.2&#xb1;0.4 wt %,</p><p id="p-0149" num="0127">Zn=37.8&#xb1;0.4 wt %.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0000">A plate having a length of 5 inches was cut off. One side of it (2.2 inches long) was immersed into a leaching solution. The leaching solution was composed of 85 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (certified 95.0 to 98.0 wt %, by Fisher Sci.) and 15 ml of concentrated nitric acid (certified 68.0 to 70.0 wt %, by Fisher Sci.). Considering the highest possible concentration of the concentrated nitric acid (70.0 wt %) and its density (1.41 g/mL), as well as the highest concentration of sulfuric acid (98.0 wt %) and its density (1.84 g/mL), the concentration of pure nitric acid in this solution was equal to 8.34 wt %, the concentration of pure sulfuric acid was 86.33 wt %, and the concentration of water was 5.34 wt %.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0128">The solution was heated to 60&#xb0; C. and stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The silver plated sample was left in the stripping solution for 20 minutes, and the color of the sample on the treated part changed to yellow, which was the color of the non-plated, copper-zinc alloy side of the tape. The stripping solution did not change in color, but became a little bit more opaque. There was no blue color, which would signal dissolution of copper in the leaching solution (which would be undesirable). The experiment was continued for an additional 5 minutes, and the sample was removed from the solution. The sample was then immersed in deionized (DI) water, rinsed, and dried.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0129">The stripped side was analyzed by XRF and showed the following percentage of metals:</p><p id="p-0153" num="0130">Cu=61.6&#xb1;0.3 wt %,</p><p id="p-0154" num="0131">Zn=38.3&#xb1;0.3 wt %.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0132">Silver was not detected. There were no visual signs of corrosion of copper-zinc alloy. A volume of DI water that was 10 times larger than the leaching solution was prepared in a beaker and stirred by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm. The leaching solution containing the dissolved silver was carefully added to the DI water in small portions, and the resulting solution was vigorously stirred after addition of each small portion. No formation of brown NO<sub>x </sub>was observed. As soon as the dilution was over, urea was added to the diluted solution until the fizzing was no longer observed. Scrap copper metal was immersed into the solution, and cementation of silver started substantially immediately. After two hours, a chloride ion test showed only light opacity, meaning that almost all silver ions were displaced from the solution. The solution was left overnight so that the cementation process could be completed. Subsequently, powdered silver metal was filtered out of the solution, dried, mixed with borax, and melted into a nugget in an ashing furnace AFI (Vecstar) at 1050&#xb0; C. The weight of the nugget was 1.283 g. For comparison, a plate of the same length as the length of the stripped sample was cut from the original sample material and weighed (having a weight of 4.801 g). Assuming the sample had the same density of plating, the weight fraction of the recovered silver would be 26.7 wt %, which represents a very heavy plating. Subsequently, the stripped part of the plate was cut off and completely dissolved in 50 vol % nitric acid solution in order to detect any unstripped silver values; the resulting solution was analyzed by ICP-OES (SPECTRO ARCOS EOP, AMETEK) (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). The amount of silver measured in the solution was 0.748 mg, which represents only 0.06 wt % of the recovered silver nugget's weight, meaning that substantially all of the silver was deplated and recovered in the process.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0133">To calculate the silver content in this type of material, another sample weighing 2.382 g was prepared and completely dissolved in the leaching solution, containing 50% by volume of concentrated nitric acid and 50% DI water. The sample of the solution was analyzed by ICP and resulted in 0.594 g of dissolved silver in 41 ml of the solution, or in 24.94 wt % of silver content in the sample, which is close to the stripped value of 26.7%. This demonstrated that the amount of silver stripped from the sample using the method described in this example corresponds to substantially the entire amount of silver in the original sample.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0134">For comparison, the experiment was repeated with the same sample size of the same material; the only difference was that the leaching solution was composed of 225 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and 75 ml of concentrated nitric acid. Considering the highest possible concentration of the concentrated nitric acid (70.0 wt %) and its density (1.42 g/mL), as well as the highest concentration of sulfuric acid (98.0 wt %) and its density (1.84 g/mL), the concentration of the pure nitric solution in this solution was equal to 14.24 wt %, the concentration of pure sulfuric acid was equal to 78.06 wt %, and the concentration of water was 7.70 wt %.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0135">As soon as the sample was immersed in the leaching solution, a large amount of brown NO<sub>x </sub>was generated, and the color of the solution changed to blue, which is a characteristic of the formation of copper ions. This demonstrated that elevated concentrations of nitric acid in the leaching solution leads to extensive dissolution of the base metal substrate, an undesirable outcome for the selective recovery of precious metals.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0159" num="0136">This example demonstrates the removal of gold from gold filled wire.

A stainless steel electrode weighing 196.4 g with dimensions of 26.2&#xd7;3.1&#xd7;0.3 cm was connected to the negative pole and served as a cathode. Both electrodes were installed vertically in a beaker and clipped with plastic clippers to the walls. A 1.5-cm stirring bar was rotated in the center of the beaker at 200 rpm. The beaker contained leaching solution composed of 95 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid. Considering the highest possible concentration of the concentrated nitric acid (70.0 wt %) and its density (1.41 g/mL), as well as the highest concentration of sulfuric acid (98.0 wt %) and its density (1.84 g/mL), the leaching solution contained:</p><p id="p-0171" num="0147">sulfuric acid&#x2014;94.2 wt %,</p><p id="p-0172" num="0148">nitric acid&#x2014;2.71 wt %,</p><p id="p-0173" num="0149">and water&#x2014;3.09 wt %.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0150">During the first leach, the gold filled wires were not immersed into the solution completely, as the part of the wire which was attached to an alligator clip, was above the surface of the solution. When one side of the sample was deplated, the wire was turned and attached by the treated side, and the non-treated side was immersed in the solution. The initial electrical current parameters for the first sample were 1.2 A and 5.8V in a constant voltage mode. During the experiment the current was decreasing, and the solution gradually turned yellow. At the end of the stripping process the current dropped down to 0.01 A. and the experiment was stopped. The total process took 4.2 minutes. The sample was removed from the solution, washed with DI water, dried, and its surface was analysed by XRF in order to detect unstripped precious metals, if present.

Subsequently, the stripping solution was mixed with an amount of DI water that was 10 times larger than the leaching solution; the leaching solution was added to water by small portions and vigorous stirring. Black powder particles appeared in the diluted solution. Initially very fine, the particles agglomerated and became larger with time. The solution decanted fast and it was filtered using vacuum filtration unit and cellulose filter paper with the pore size of less than 0.45 micrometers.

Both the cathode and the anode were connected to the corresponding pole of direct current regulated power supply (BK Precision 1621A). Leaching solutions were prepared, which were composed of 75 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and volumes of nitric acid that varied from 0.1 ml in the first experiment to 20 ml in the last experiment (See Table 1 below). The leaching solution was poured in a 200 ml beaker and stirred by a magnetic stirrer. The solution was heated to 60&#xb0; C. and this temperature was kept constant during the experiments.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0168">At the beginning of each experiment a maximum current (0.09 A) was established in constant voltage mode, and both the starting current and the starting voltage (2.9V) had the same values for all experiments. Each time the deplating process was stopped as soon as the current dropped to 0.01 A. The remaining piece of the sample was then removed from the solution, washed with DI water, dried, and weighed. The sample's surface was analyzed by XRF. At the lowest concentration of nitric acid (0.07 wt %), all the silver was removed from the sample when the current dropped down to 0.01 A. The same complete removal of silver was achieved in all of the following experiments. The time required for the current to drop to zero was monitored. The surface of the deplated items was analyzed by XRF and was shown to be a copper-zinc alloy:</p><p id="p-0194" num="0169">Cu=64.9&#xb1;0.4 wt %,</p><p id="p-0195" num="0170">Zn=35.1&#xb1;0.4 wt %.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0171">At a concentration of nitric acid equal to 10.87 wt %, intense evolution of colorless fumes started, and the intensity of the fumes increased at 11.88%. At 10.87 wt % of nitric acid, the experiment started at 2.9V and 0.09 A, as in all the previous cases, but instead of dropping down, the current increased up to 0.22 A during the first minute, and started to drop down only afterwards. The processing time increased compared to the cases when the concentration of the nitric acid was lower. At 11.88 wt % the phenomenon of current increase repeated; it increased up to 0.22 A during the first 1.15 min of treatment, and subsequently decreased. The deplating process took 7.23 min, which is 3.5-4.5 times longer than the process took at lower concentrations of nitric acid. High currents and long processing times mean the sudden increase of the consumption of energy, which resulted in the increase of the temperature of the solution up to 90&#xb0; C., which provoked even higher evolution of fumes. The results of these experiments are presented in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup

experiments in which leaching solutions having varying concentrations of nitric acid were used to remove gold from gold-plated copper wire. A piece of a gold plated copper wire was cut into the sections of approximately similar length and weight, and the pieces were analyzed by XRF before and after each deplating process. An example of the XRF analysis of the wire before deplating is presented below:</p><p id="p-0199" num="0173">Au=38.2&#xb1;0.7 wt %,</p><p id="p-0200" num="0174">Ni=36.5&#xb1;0.4 wt %,</p><p id="p-0201" num="0175">Cu=24.9&#xb1;0.3 wt %,</p><p id="p-0202" num="0176">Fe=0.21&#xb1;0.10%.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0177">The experiment was repeated as described in Example 3. In the first experiment, all gold was removed from the wire, confirmed by XRF analysis. As the nitric acid concentration in the leaching solution was increased, all the gold was always removed from the treated samples, but the percentage weight loss of the samples continuously increased. At a nitric acid concentration of 10.87 wt %, intense generation of colorless fumes was observed, which made experiments using such high levels of nitric acid difficult to perform. Increasing the concentration of nitric acid up to 11.88 wt % lead to almost triple the percentage weight loss, compared to the percentage weight loss of the first sample. Additionally, the acid fumes became very heavy, the time of treatment almost doubled; accordingly, further increase of nitric acid concentration were stopped. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 2.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup

Example 4 was prepared and weighed (0.6274 g). 60 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was heated to 60&#xb0; C. and a measured quantity of manganese dioxide (0.427 g) was added to it by stirring. The solution was stirred for 20 minutes, then removed from heat and left overnight. No gas evolution was detected. The next day, the solution had dark rose color and some unreacted/undissolved black powder on the bottom. The solution was used in an electrolytic process, in which the gold plated wire served as an anode and a piece of stainless steel served as a cathode (the same as in the Example 4). When the power supply was turned on, a current of 0.12 A and a voltage of 3.2V was applied to the electrode in constant voltage mode. The current started to diminish, and when it reached 0.04 A, the voltage was increased to 12.3 A, to increase the current and deplate the material faster. Soon afterwards, the current dropped down to 0.01 A. The total processing time was 5.07 minutes. During the electrolytic process, intensive evolution of gas was observed, which was much more intensive than the evolution of gas typical for the deplating procedures in the mixtures of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the oxygen, liberated in the reaction of MnO<sub>2 </sub>with the hot concentrated sulfuric acid, is responsible for dissolution of gold.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2MnO<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&#x2192;2MnSO<sub>4</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0207" num="0179">The deplated wire was removed from the solution, rinsed, dried, weighed (0.6198 g) and analyzed by XRF.

The pellets had different silver/tungsten weight proportions, which also varied between the surface and the center of the pellets, but in general, the pellets contained about 50 wt % of silver metal and 50 wt % of tungsten-containing material (tungsten metal or tungsten carbide). The concentration of silver on the surface of the pellets was generally higher or equal to 50 wt %, but in the center of the pallets, the concentration of silver was as low as 5-8 wt %, the rest being tungsten. If the tested pellets are brought in contact with the leaching solution without preliminary size reduction, the silver containing in the center of the pellets will be inaccessible for the leaching solution and hence, will be lost. To avoid this situation, the sample of the silver-tungsten containing material was shredded into particles with sizes less than 2 mm.

The initial weight of the jewelry was 4.7 kg.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0226">An electrolytic cell was built, including a rotating barrel, which was immersed in a plastic tank containing the leaching solution during operation. Three stainless steel plates, each having dimensions 26.2 cm&#xd7;3.1 cm&#xd7;0.5 cm were attached to the inner wall of the tank using plastic clips and connected together using electrical wires. These plates were connected to the negative pole of a direct current power supply (BK Precision 1621A) and served as a cathode. The rotating barrel (Model 66) was manufactured by Sterling Systems. It includes a 6&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2033; barrel, made of polypropylene, with square holes of 0.093&#x2033; in the walls of the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0227">The barrel was attached to a stand, which was installed in a tank containing the chemical solution, and turned by the action of 57 rpm-110V AC motor. Copper contacts were inserted into the center of the barrel from its sides so that, during rotation of the barrel, each item placed in the barrel remained in electrical contact either with a contact or with another item, which was in electrical contact with the lead. The leads were attached to copper bars at both sides of the barrel, which were connected to the positive pole of the power supply.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0228">The barrel with the stand was attached to a chain hoist, so that the barrel could be lifted over the leaching tank and in such a way, removed from the leaching solution. The leaching tank was custom made of grey PVC, and had the inner dimensions H&#xd7;L&#xd7;W=12&#x2033;&#xd7;14&#x2033;&#xd7;11&#x2033;. The total amount of scrap items was divided into 8 parts, each weighing between 400 g and 800 g. The leaching solution was prepared in the leaching tank, and contained 93.31 wt % sulfuric acid, 2.69 wt % nitric acid, 0.94 wt % sulfamic acid, and 3.06 wt % water.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0229">The first part of the karat gold filled scrap was loaded into the rotating barrel, the opening of the barrel was closed, and the barrel was immersed into the leaching solution. The electrodes were connected to the power supply, the motor was turned on, and the barrel was rotated. The electric parameters were kept in constant voltage mode. The current and the voltage differed between batches, generally remaining in the range of 20-28 V and 12-19 A. During the processing of each batch, the electric current diminished, and dropped down to 0.01 A-0.03 A. At this moment, the rotating barrel was disconnected from the power supply, the rotation was stopped, the barrel was lifted out of the solution and left in this position for some time so that the residual leaching solution could drop into the leaching tank. Subsequently, the lifted barrel was pulled to the side so that it was hanging over a containment box, and the barrel was placed in it. The loading window of the barrel was opened, and the stripped scrap items were removed from the barrel and rinsed with DI water. The DI water was kept, as it contained some gold and dissolved silver. All the batches were treated with the same stripping solution. The leaching experiments were carried out on randomly selected dates during a 3-week period. No acid replenishment was performed during the testing. The leaching solution changed from light yellow in color after the first three batches, and the intensity of the color did not change during the rest of the experiments. Some black precipitate accumulated on the cathodes and on the bottom of the leaching tank. At the end of the process, the leaching solution was added by portions using the corrosion resistant chemical pump into a 5-times larger volume of DI water, which was stirred with an overhead mixer using an extended stirring rod. The black powder decanted quickly and was transformed into large black flakes with time. To recover the gold and the silver mixed together, the gold powder was not filtered right away, but left in the solution. Scrap copper pieces were added and left in the solution overnight. The chloride ion test, made on the solution sample, did not show any substantial opaqueness, meaning that substantially all silver precipitated in the form of silver metal. The pieces of copper were removed from the solution and rinsed in an ultrasonic bath. The rinse water was filtered in order to collect the powder. The mixed gold and silver powder was decanted and filtered out of the solution. A randomly taken sample of the powder was analyzed by XRF providing with the following elemental composition:</p><p id="p-0265" num="0230">Au=60.9&#xb1;0.5,</p><p id="p-0266" num="0231">Ag=38.0&#xb1;0.5,</p><p id="p-0267" num="0232">Cu=0.77&#xb1;0.06,</p><p id="p-0268" num="0233">Pb=0.23&#xb1;0.12.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0234">The powder was distributed between four fused silica crucibles, mixed with some borax, and melted in a furnace at 1150&#xb0; C. Nuggets of gold-silver alloy were recovered, and had a total weight of 210.91 g. As the silver and gold powder were not perfectly blended to provide a uniform mixture, the nuggets had different proportions of gold and silver.
