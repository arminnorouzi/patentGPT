Mammalian milk contains at least 130 of these complex oligosaccharides (Urashima et al, Milk Oligosaccharides, Nova Biomedical Books, N.Y., 2011, ISBN: 978-1-61122-831-1).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Previously, the only source of HMOs had been mammalian milk which contains mostly water, together with 55-70 g/I lactose, 24-59 g/I lipids, ca. 13 g/I proteins, 5-15 g/I HMOs and ca. 1.5 g/I minerals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, several processes for synthesizing HMOs have been developed in recent years due to their roles in numerous human biological processes. In this regard, processes have been developed for producing HMOs by microbial fermentations, enzymatic processes, chemical syntheses, or combinations of these technologies. For example, by chemical processes, Galp&#x3b2;1-4GlcNAcp&#x3b2;1-3Galp&#x3b2;1-4GIc or lacto-N-neotetraose (&#x201c;LNnT&#x201d;) can be made as described in WO 2011/100980 and WO 2013/044928; Galp&#x3b2;1-3GlcNAcp&#x3b2;1-3Galp&#x3b2;1-4lc or lacto-N-tetraose (&#x201c;LNT&#x201d;) can be synthesized as described in WO 2012/155916 and WO 2013/044928; 6&#x2032;-O-sialyllactose (&#x201c;6&#x201d;-SL) can be synthesized as described in WO 2011/100979; a mixture of LNT and LNnT can be made as described in WO 2013/091660; 2&#x2032;-O-fucosyllactose (&#x201c;2&#x2032;-FL&#x201d;) can be made as described in WO 2010/115934 and WO 2010/115935; 3-fucosyllactose (&#x201c;3-FL&#x201d;) can be made as described in</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2013/139344; and 6&#x2032;-SL can be made as described in WO 2010/100979. As examples of biotechnological processes, WO 01/04341 and WO 2007/101862 describe how to make core human milk oligosaccharides optionally substituted by fucose or sialic acid, including LNnT, 6&#x2032;-SL and 3&#x2032;-O-sialyllactose (&#x201c;3&#x2032;-SL&#x201d;) using genetically modified E. co/i; and WO 2015/032412 describes making 2&#x2032;-FL and difucosyllactose or Fuc(a1-2)Gal(&#x3b2;1-4)[Fuc(&#x3b1;1-3)]Glc (&#x201c;DFL&#x201d;) using genetically modified <i>E. coli</i>. As an example of enzymatic processes, sialylated oligosaccharides can be made as described in EP-A-577580.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Efforts have also been made to develop processes for synthesizing enzymatically mixtures of HMO oligosaccharides, without having to synthesize all of the component oligosaccharides of the mixture as described in WO 2012/156897 and WO 2012/156898. Such processes have provided reaction mixtures containing a plurality of different oligosaccharides.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Evidence is accumulating that the resident community of microbes, called the microbiota, in the human digestive tract plays a major role in health and disease. When the composition of the intestinal microbiota is thrown off balance, the human host can suffer consequences. Recent research has implicated intestinal microbiota imbalances in individual disorders as diverse as cancer, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, asthma, and possibly even autism. Individual non-digestible fibres, including HMOs, are believed to beneficially modulate the microbiota, and they are of increasing interest for treating one or more of such disorders. However, many digestible fibres non-specifically modulate the microbiota while others are not able to provide sufficiently broad, but specific, modulation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there has been a need to specifically modulate the microbiota, so as to address individual disorders in different ways and also to address simultaneously multiple disorders. In particular, there has been a need for a composition that can be used for, inter a/ia, treating and/or preventing bacterial and viral infections, particularly in the intestinal and respiratory tracts, improving cognitive function and/or increasing the efficacy of anticancer agents against tumors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first aspect of this invention relates to a synthetic mixture of HMOs consisting essentially of LNnT, LNT, 2&#x2032;-FL, 3&#x2032;-SL, 6&#x2032;-SL and either DFL or 3-FL, preferably DFL. This mixture can optionally include lactose. The mixture of HMOs preferably consists essentially of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">i. about 55 wt % to about 75 wt % of 2&#x2032;-FL, more preferably about 60 wt % to about 70 Wt % of 2&#x2032;-FL;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">ii. about 2 wt % to about 10 wt % of LNnT, more preferably about 3 wt % to about 7 wt % of LNnT;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">iii. about 10 wt % to about 20 wt % of LNT, more preferably about 12 wt % to about 18 wt % of LNT;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">iv. about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % of DFL or 3-FL, more preferably about 1 wt % to about 10 wt %, even more preferably about 2 wt % to about 10 wt % of DFL or 3-FL such as e.g. about 2 wt % to about 8 wt %;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0014">v. about 1 wt % to about 10 wt % of 3&#x2032;-SL, more preferably about 2 wt % to about 8 wt % of 3&#x2032;-SL; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0015">vi. about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % of 6&#x2032;-SL, preferably about 5 wt % to about 15 wt % of 6&#x2032;-SL, more preferably about 7 wt % to about 13 wt % of 6&#x2032;-SL.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0016">A second aspect of the invention relates to a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition comprising a synthetic mixture of HMOs according to the first aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0017">A third aspect of this invention relates to a synthetic mixture of HMOs or a composition comprising a synthetic mixture of HMOs for use in: i) preventing and/or treating viral and/or bacterial infections in a non-infant human; ii) specifically modulating the indigenous microbiota of a non-infant human; and/or iii) improving the cognitive function of a non-infant human. The synthetic mixture of HMOs consists essentially of LNnT, LNT, 2&#x2032;-FL, 3&#x2032;-SL, 6&#x2032;-SL, either DFL or 3-FL, preferably DFL, and optionally lactose, as described above. The synthetic HMO mixture or the nutritional or pharmaceutical composition comprising it contains a plurality of different HMOs with novel combinations of properties and biological activities. The composition is especially useful against viral and bacterial, intestinal infections through specific modulation of the intestinal microbiota by an increase in Bifidobacterium, modulation of intestinal binding of viruses and pathogenic bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells, and improvement of intestinal barrier function. The composition is also especially useful against viral and bacterial, respiratory tract infections by inhibiting pathogen binding to human epithelial cells.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">A fourth aspect of this invention relates to a method of modulating the indigenous microbiota of a non-infant human to increase the abundance of Bifidobacterium in order to increase the efficacy of anticancer agents against tumors in a non-infant human patient. The method involves administering to the non-infant human a synthetic mixture of HMOs according to the first aspect of this invention or a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition according to the second aspect of this invention, as described above. Bifidobacterium can act as an immune booster, hence the increase in its abundance can strengthen a cancer patient's response to an anticancer agent. This property makes the mixture suitable as an aid in cancer therapy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">A fifth aspect of this invention relates to a method of modulating the indigenous intestinal microbiota of a non-infant human to increase Bifidobacterium and/or Bamesiella abundance and also to reduce the abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus. The method involves administering to the non-infant human a synthetic mixture of HMOs according to the first aspect of this invention or a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition according to the second aspect of this invention, as described above. The increased <i>Bifidobacterium </i>and/or <i>Bamesiella </i>abundance and reduced abundance of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus </i>render the non-infant human's intestinal milieu less prone to inflammation and provide improved intestinal barrier function. These effects can prevent and/or treat conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and other conditions associated with inflammation and impaired gut barrier function.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">A sixth aspect of this invention relates to a method of modulating the indigenous microbiota of a non-infant human to increase Bifidobacterium abundance and to at least maintain the abundance of Faecalibacterium. The method involves administering to the non-infant human a synthetic mixture of HMOs according to the first aspect of this invention or a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition according to the second aspect of this invention, as described above. Increasing the Bifidobacterium abundance and at least maintaining the abundance of Faecalibacterium render the non-infant human's intestinal milieu less prone to inflammation and provide improved intestinal barrier function. Preferably the abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus is reduced. These effects can prevent and/or treat conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and other conditions associated with inflammation and impaired gut barrier function.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">In both the fifth and sixth aspects of the invention, the abundance of Proteobacteria is also preferably reduced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0022">A seventh aspect of this invention relates to a method of preventing or treating viral and/or bacterial infections in a non-infant human, especially intestinal infections and infections of the respiratory tract. The method comprises administering, to the non-infant human, a synthetic mixture of HMOs according to the first aspect of this invention or a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition according to the second aspect of this invention, as described above.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0023">An eighth aspect of this invention relates to a method of improving the cognitive function of a non-infant human. The method comprises administering, to the non-infant human, a synthetic mixture of HMOs according to the first aspect of this invention or a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition according to the second aspect of this invention, as described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0024">In accordance with this invention, the following terms preferably have the following meanings:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">&#x201c;Non-infant human&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-infant&#x201d; preferably means a human of 3 years of age and older.

Accordingly, oral administration is a form of enteral administration.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">&#x201c;Cognitive function&#x201d; refers to cerebral activities that lead to knowledge, including all means and mechanisms of acquiring information. Cognitive functions encompass reasoning, memory , attention, and language and lead directly to the attainment of information and, thus, knowledge.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">In accordance with this invention, it has been surprisingly discovered that a synthetic</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">HMO mixture consisting essentially of LNnT, LNT, 2&#x2032;-FL, 3&#x2032;-SL, 6&#x2032;-SL and either DFL or 3-FL, preferably DFL, and optionally lactose, can provide an anti-infective composition for preventing or treating, bacterial or viral infections through specific modulation of the intestinal microbiota, binding of viruses, reduction in pathogenic translocation and improvement of intestinal barrier function in a non-infant human. Further, the HMO mixture of this invention acts as a decoy receptor and binds to rotaviruses to prevent the rotaviruses from adhering to human intestinal cells. These properties, coupled with an improvement in intestinal barrier function, make the HMO mixture suitable for preventing and treating intestinal infections.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">It has also been found that the HMO mixture of this invention can increase the brain ganglioside and glycoprotein sialic acid concentrations, and enhance hippocampal long term potentiation through the vagus nerve, leading to increased synaptogenesis and neurodevelopment in a non-infant human. This makes the HMO mixture suitable for administration to non-infant humans to improve their cognitive function.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">The HMO mixture of this invention can also:</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">i) increase the indigenous intestinal abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0040">ii) increase the intestinal abundance of <i>Bamesiella </i>and/or at least maintain the intestinal abundance of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0041">iii) reduce the intestinal abundance of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus </i>and/or Proteobacteria</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">in non-infant humans.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043">These effects can render an intestinal milieu less prone to inflammation. Coupled with an improvement in intestinal barrier function, these effects of the HMO mixture can prevent and/or treat conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and other conditions associated with inflammation and impaired barrier function. Surprisingly, the increase of bifidobacteria in the gut, induced by the HMO mixture of this invention, increases the efficacy of anticancer agents against tumors. The bifidobacteria act as immune helpers, strengthening a cancer patient's response to an anticancer agent. This property makes the HMO mixture suitable as an aid in cancer therapy.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044">Preferably the HMO mixture of this invention contains: i) about 55 wt % to about 75 wt % of 2&#x2032;-FL, more preferably about 60 wt % to about 70 wt %; ii) about 2 wt % to about 10 wt % of LNnT, more preferably about 3 wt % to about 7 wt %; iii) about 10 wt % to about 20 wt of LNT, more preferably about 12 wt % to about 18 wt %; iv) about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % of DFL or 3-FL, preferably about 1 wt % to about 10 wt %, even more preferably about 2 wt % to about 10 wt %; v) about 1 wt % to about 10 wt % of 3&#x2032;-SL, more preferably about 2 wt % to about 8 wt %; and vi) about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % of 6&#x2032;-SL, preferably about 5 wt % to about 15 wt %, more preferably about 7 wt % to about 13 wt %. The HMO mixture of this invention can also contain lactose, but it is not considered an active ingredient of the mixture.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">The synthetic HMO mixture can be administered to a non-infant human in any suitable form such as a nutritional or pharmaceutical composition, for example, a unit dosage form (for example, a tablet, a capsule, a sachet of powder, etc.).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046">The nutritional or pharmaceutical composition consists of the synthetic mixture of HMOs consisting essentially of LNnT, LNT, 2&#x2032;-FL, 3&#x2032;-SL, 6&#x2032;-SL, either DFL or 3-FL, and optionally lactose, and suitable excipients. The nutritional or pharmaceutical composition does not contain any other HMOs than those mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0047">In one embodiment, the HMO mixture of this invention can be in the form of a nutritional composition. For example, the nutritional composition can be a food composition, a rehydration solution, or a dietary maintenance or supplement for elderly individuals or immunocompromised individuals. The nutritional composition can contain sources of protein, lipids and/or digestible carbohydrates and can be in powdered or liquid forms. The composition can be designed to be the sole source of nutrition or a nutritional supplement.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">Suitable protein sources include milk proteins, soy protein, rice protein, pea protein and oat protein, or mixtures thereof. Milk proteins can be in the form of milk protein concentrates, milk protein isolates, whey protein or casein, or mixtures of both. The protein can be whole protein or hydrolysed protein, either partially hydrolysed or extensively hydrolysed. Hydrolysed protein offers the advantage of easier digestion which can be important for non-infants with inflamed GI tracts. The protein can also be provided in the form of free amino acids. The protein can comprise about 5% to about 30% of the energy of the nutritional composition, normally about 10% to 20%.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0049">The protein source can be a source of glutamine, threonine, cysteine, serine, proline, or a combination of these amino acids. The glutamine source can be a glutamine dipeptide and/or a glutamine enriched protein. Glutamine can be included due to the use of glutamine by enterocytes as an energy source. Threonine, serine and proline are important amino acids for the production of mucin. Mucin coats the GI tract and can improve mucosal healing. Cysteine is a major precursor of glutathione, which is key for the antioxidant defences of the body.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050">Suitable digestible carbohydrates include maltodextrin, hydrolysed or modified starch or corn starch, glucose polymers, corn syrup, corn syrup solids, high fructose corn syrup, rice-derived carbohydrates, pea-derived carbohydrates, potato-derived carbohydrates, tapioca, sucrose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, honey, sugar alcohols (e.g., maltitol, erythritol, sorbitol), or mixtures thereof. Preferably the composition is free from added lactose. Generally digestible carbohydrates provide about 35% to about 55% of the energy of the nutritional composition. A particularly suitable digestible carbohydrate is a low dextrose equivalent (DE) maltodextrin.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0051">Suitable lipids include medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and long chain triglycerides (LCT). Preferably the lipid is a mixture of MCTs and LCTs. For example, MCTs can comprise about 30% to about 70% by weight of the lipids, more specifically about about 50% to about 60% by weight. MCTs offer the advantage of easier digestion which can be important for non-infants with inflamed GI tracts. Generally, the lipids provide about 35% to about 50% of the energy of the nutritional composition. The lipids can contain essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids). Preferably these polyunsaturated fatty acids provide less than about 30% of total energy of the lipid source. Decreasing the levels of these polyunsaturated fatty acids is believed to decrease sensitivity to peroxidation; which can be beneficial for non-infants having inflammatory conditions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0052">Suitable sources of long chain triglycerides are rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, palm oil, soy oil, milk fat, corn oil, high oleic oils, and soy lecithin. Fractionated coconut oils are a suitable source of medium chain triglycerides. The lipid profile of the nutritional composition is preferably designed to have a polyunsaturated fatty acid omega-6 (n-6) to omega-3 (n-3) ratio of about 4:1 to about 10:1. For example, the n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio can be about 6:1 to about 9:1.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0053">The nutritional composition may also include vitamins and minerals. If the nutritional composition is intended to be a sole source of nutrition, it preferably includes a complete vitamin and mineral profile. Examples of vitamins include vitamins A, B-complex (such as B1, B2, B6 and B12), C, D, E and K, niacin and acid vitamins such as pantothenic acid, folic acid and biotin. Examples of minerals include calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, iodine, copper, phosphorus, manganese, potassium, chromium, molybdenum, selenium, nickel, tin, silicon, vanadium and boron.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0054">The nutritional composition can also include a carotenoid such as lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene. The total amount of carotenoid included can vary from about 0.001 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml. Lutein can be included in an amount of from about 0.001 pg/ml to about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml, preferably from about 0.044 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of lutein. Lycopene can be included in an amount from about 0.001 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 10 &#x3bc;g/ml, preferably about 0.0185 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of lycopene. Beta-carotene can comprise from about 0.001 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 10 mg/ml, for example about 0.034 &#x3bc;g/ml to about 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of beta-carotene.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0055">The nutritional composition preferably also contains reduced concentrations of sodium; for example, from about 300 mg/I to about 400 mg/I. The remaining electrolytes can be present in concentrations set to meet needs without providing an undue renal solute burden on kidney function. For example, potassium is preferably present in a range of about 1180 to about 1300 mg/I; and chloride is preferably present in a range of about 680 to about 800 mg/I.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0056">The nutritional composition can also contain various other conventional ingredients such as preservatives, emulsifying agents, thickening agents, buffers, fibres and prebiotics (e.g. fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides), probiotics (e.g. <i>B. animalis </i>subsp. lactis BB-12, <i>B. lactis </i>HNO19, <i>B. lactis </i>Bi07, <i>B. infantis </i>ATCC 15697, <i>L. rhamnosus </i>GG, <i>L. rhamnosus </i>HNOOI, <i>L. acidophilus </i>LA-5, <i>L. acidophilus </i>NCFM, L. fermentum CECT5716, <i>B. longum </i>BB536, <i>B. longum </i>AH1205, <i>B. longum </i>AH1206, <i>B. breve </i>M-16V, <i>L. reuteri </i>ATCC 55730, L. reuteri ATCC PTA-6485, L. reuteri DSM 17938), antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compounds including tocopherols, caroteinoids, ascorbate/vitamin C, ascorbyl palmitate, polyphenols, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase (melon), other bioactive factors (e.g. growth hormones, cytokines, TFG-&#x3b2;), colorants, flavours, and stabilisers, lubricants, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0057">The nutritional composition can be formulated as a soluble powder, a liquid concentrate, or a ready-to-use formulation. The composition can be fed to a human in need via a nasogastric tube or orally. Various flavours, fibres and other additives can also be present.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0058">The nutritional compositions can be prepared by any commonly used manufacturing techniques for preparing nutritional compositions in solid or liquid form. For example, the composition can be prepared by combining various feed solutions. A protein-in-fat feed solution can be prepared by heating and mixing the lipid source and then adding an emulsifier (e.g. lecithin), fat soluble vitamins, and at least a portion of the protein source while heating and stirring. A carbohydrate feed solution is then prepared by adding minerals, trace and ultra trace minerals, thickening or suspending agents to water while heating and stirring. The resulting solution is held for 10 minutes with continued heat and agitation before adding carbohydrates (e.g. the HMOs and digestible carbohydrate sources). The resulting feed solutions are then blended together while heating and agitating and the pH adjusted to 6.6-7.0, after which the composition is subjected to high-temperature short-time processing during which the composition is heat treated, emulsified and homogenized, and then allowed to cool. Water soluble vitamins and ascorbic acid are added, the pH is adjusted to the desired range if necessary, flavours are added, and water is added to achieve the desired total solid level.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">For a liquid product, the resulting solution can then be aseptically packed to form an aseptically packaged nutritional composition. In this form, the nutritional composition can be in ready-to-feed or concentrated liquid form. Alternatively, the composition can be spray-dried and processed and packaged as a reconstitutable powder.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0060">When the nutritional product is a ready-to-feed nutritional liquid, it may be preferred that the total concentration of HMOs in the liquid, by weight of the liquid, is from about 0.0001% to about 2.0%, including from about 0.001% to about 1.5%, including from about 0.01% to about 1.0%. When the nutritional product is a concentrated nutritional liquid, it may be preferred that the total concentration of HMOs in the liquid, by weight of the liquid, is from about 0.0002% to about 4.0%, including from about 0.002% to about 3.0%, including from about 0.02% to about 2.0%.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0061">In other embodiment, the HMO mixture of this invention can be comprised in a pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g. phosphate buffered saline solution, mixtures of ethanol in water, water and emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, as well as various wetting agents or excipients. The pharmaceutical composition can also contain other materials that do not produce an adverse, allergic or otherwise unwanted reaction when administered to non-infants. The carriers and other materials can include solvents, dispersants, coatings, absorption promoting agents, controlled release agents, and one or more inert excipients, such as starches, polyols, granulating agents, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents. If desired, tablet dosages of the anti-infective compositions can be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0062">The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered orally, e.g. as a tablet, capsule, or pellet containing a predetermined amount, or as a powder or granules containing a predetermined concentration or a gel, paste, solution, suspension, emulsion, syrup, bolus, electuary, or slurry, in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, containing a predetermined concentration. Orally administered compositions can include binders, lubricants, inert diluents, flavouring agents, and humectants. Orally administered compositions such as tablets can optionally be coated and can be formulated so as to provide sustained, delayed or controlled release of the mixture therein. The pharmaceutical compositions can also be administered by rectal suppository, aerosol tube, naso-gastric tube or direct infusion into the GI tract or stomach.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0063">The pharmaceutical compositions can also include therapeutic agents such as antiviral agents, antibiotics, probiotics, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory agents. The proper dosage of these compositions for a non-infant human can be determined in a conventional manner, based upon factors such immune status, body weight and age. In some cases, the dosage will be at a concentration similar to that found for the HMOs in human breast milk. The required amount would generally be in the range from about 200 mg to about 20 g per day, in certain embodiments from about 300 mg to about 15 g per day, from about 400 mg to about 10 g per day, in certain embodiments from about 500 mg to about 10 g per day, in certain embodiments from about 1 g to about 10 g per day. Appropriate dose regimes can be determined by conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0064">Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be used for treatment of a concerned disease in combination with other medicaments prescribed for said disease, e.g. in combination with an anti-diabetes medicine or antibiotic therapy. Yet in other embodiment, the composition comprising the HMO mixture of this invention is a unit dosage form. The unit dosage form can contain an acceptable carrier, e.g. phosphate buffered saline solution, mixtures of ethanol in water, water and emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, as well as various wetting agents or excipients. The unit dosage form can also contain other materials that do not produce an adverse, allergic or otherwise unwanted reaction when administered to a patient. The carriers and other materials can include solvents, dispersants, coatings, absorption promoting agents, controlled release agents, and one or more inert excipients, such as starches, polyols, granulating agents, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents. If desired, tablet dosages of the composition can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0065">A unit dosage form of this invention can be administered orally, e.g. as a tablet, capsule, or pellet containing a predetermined amount of the mixture, or as a powder or granules containing a predetermined concentration of the mixture or a gel, paste, solution, suspension, emulsion, syrup, bolus, electuary, or slurry, in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid, containing a predetermined concentration of the mixture. An orally administered composition can include one or more binders, lubricants, inert diluents, flavouring agents, and humectants.
