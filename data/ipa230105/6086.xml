A dopant for a film of tin oxide or the like is not particularly limited as long as the dopant is one or more selected from the group consisting of In, Si, Ge, Ti, Cu, Sb, Nb, Ta, W, Mo, F, Cl, and the like. It is preferable that the p-electrode <b>2</b> preferably includes a tin oxide film doped with one or more elements selected from the group consisting of In, Si, Ge, Ti, Cu, Sb, Nb, Ta, W, Mo, F, Cl, and the like.

Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described more specifically based on Examples, but the present disclosure is not limited to the following Examples.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0085">ITO (In:Sn=90:10, film thickness 20 nm) and ATO (Sn Sb=98:2, film thickness: 150 &#x3bc;m) are deposited on an upper surface of a glass substrate on a side in contact with glass as a p-electrode on a back surface side. A Cu<sub>2</sub>O light-absorbing layer is formed on a transparent p-electrode by heating at 500&#xb0; C. by a sputtering method in an oxygen and argon gas atmosphere. Thereafter, by an ALD method, 10 nm of Ga<sub>1.20</sub>Al<sub>0.80</sub>O<sub>3.4 </sub>having no composition inclination is deposited as a first n-type layer, and 10 nm of Zn<sub>0.80</sub>Sn<sub>0.20</sub>O<sub>1.20 </sub>having no composition inclination as a first n-type layer and an AZO transparent conductive film as the n-electrode are deposited on the deposited surface side. A solar cell is obtained by forming an MgF<sub>2 </sub>film as an antireflection film. The obtained solar cell is evaluated for a short circuit current (Jsc), an open circuit voltage (Voc), a fill factor (FF), conversion efficiency, and transmittance. An oxygen composition ratio of the n-type layer is obtained from a type and a composition ratio of metal of a metal oxide.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The transmittance of the solar cell is evaluated. The transparency of the solar cell is an average transmittance when a wavelength of 700-1200 nm is measured with a spectrophotometer.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Examples 2 to 38 and Comparative Examples</heading><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Tables related to examples are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Conditions of n-type layers of Examples and Comparative Examples are shown in the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The same procedures as in Example 1 were carried out except for the conditions of the n-type layers. When two-layer or three layer of the n-type layer is formed in Examples, a thickness of each n-type layer is 6 nm. In example 32, a composition of Ti is changed inclinedly so that Ti is large on the p-type light-absorbing layer side and small on the n-electrode side. In example 33, a composition of Al is changed inclinedly so that Al is large on the p-type light-absorbing layer side and small on the n-electrode side. In example 34, a composition of Hf is changed inclinedly so that Hf is large on the p-type light-absorbing layer side and small on the n-electrode side. In examples 35-38, the n-type layer is formed to include a plurality of the n-type region shown in table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> so that the n-type layer is single layer, the target ratio is inclinedly changed as shown in the table, and there is no interface in the n-type layer.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The amount of light is adjusted to 1 sun by using a solar simulator simulating a light source of AM 1.5G and using a reference Si cell under a light source. A temperature in a measurement chamber is 25&#xb0; C. under an atmospheric pressure. A voltage is swept, and a current density (current divided by a cell area) is measured. When a horizontal axis represents the voltage and a vertical axis represents the current density, a point intersecting the horizontal axis represents an open circuit voltage Voc, and a point intersecting the vertical axis represents a short circuit current density Jsc. When the voltage and the current density are multiplied on a measurement curve and maximum points are Vmpp and Jmpp (maximum power point), respectively, FF=(Vmpp*Jmpp)/(Voc*Jsc), and a conversion efficiency Eff. is obtained by Eff.=Voc*Jsc*FF.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the short circuit current (Jsc), the open circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), the conversion efficiency, and the light transmittance of Examples and Comparative Examples are collectively illustrated.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The transmittance is evaluated as A when the transmittance of light in a wavelength band of 700 nm or more and 1200 nm or less is 75% or more, is evaluated as B when the transmittance of light in a wavelength band of 700 nm or more and 1200 nm or less is 70% or more and less than 75%, and is evaluated as C when the transmittance of light in a wavelength band of 700 nm or more and 1200 nm or less is less than 70%.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Jsc is evaluated as A when the conversion efficiency is 1.02 times or more the conversion efficiency of Comparative Example 1, is evaluated as B when the conversion efficiency is 0.95 times or more and less than 1.02 times Jsc of Comparative Example 1, and is evaluated as C when the conversion efficiency is less than 0.95 times Jsc of Comparative Example 1.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Voc is evaluated as A when Voc is 1.30 times or more the conversion efficiency of Comparative Example 1, is evaluated as B when Voc is 1.00 times or more and less than 1.30 times Voc of Comparative Example 1, and is evaluated as C when Voc is less than 1.00 times Voc of Comparative Example 1.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">FF is evaluated as A when FF is 1.01 times or more the conversion efficiency of Comparative Example 1, is evaluated as B when FF is 0.70 times or more and less than 1.01 times FF of Comparative Example 1, and is evaluated as C when FF is less than 0.7 times FF of Comparative Example 1.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The conversion efficiency is evaluated as A when the conversion efficiency is 1.3 times or more the conversion efficiency of Comparative Example 1, is evaluated as B when the conversion efficiency is 1.01 times or more and less than 1.3 times the conversion efficiency of Comparative Example 1, and is evaluated as C when the conversion efficiency is less than 1.01 times the conversion efficiency of Comparative Example 1.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As can be seen from the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the short-circuit current density Jsc tends to increase when Ti and Sn is a lot or when it is multi-layered. It is considered that the amount of light absorbed inside Cu<sub>2</sub>O is increased because the refractive index distribution from Cu<sub>2</sub>O to the n-electrode is improve because the refractive index of TiO<sub>2 </sub>SnO<sub>2 </sub>is larger than that of Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In Comparative Examples 2 to 4, it is considered that the short-circuit current density was increased as a result of the increase in the refractive index by introducing In and Zn. The increasing is confirmed in the result of suppressing recombination at the interface by multi-layering. Furthermore, it can be also confirmed that the recombination of electron inside the n-type layer is suppressed by forming the composition change inside the n-type layer. The effect of multi-layering also appears in the fill factor, and it can be seen that the effect is increased as the number of layers is increased. The open circuit voltage tends to increase when the amount of Hf and Zr in the first n-type layer (first region) is large, and lowering the difference in conduction band position between Cu<sub>2</sub>O and the first n-type layer (first region) may contribute. However, if Hf and Zr are too much, the conduction band position becomes too high than the conduction band position of Cu<sub>2</sub>O, which may result in a decrease in conversion efficiency. In a multi-junction solar cell using the solar cell of the example as a top cell and using a solar cell having Si as a light-absorbing layer as a bottom cell, the multi-junction solar cell having an excellent conversion efficiency can be obtained because of the high transparency and conversion efficiency of the top cell.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the specification, some elements are represented only by chemical symbols for elements.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
