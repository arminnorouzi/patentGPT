Further, the space for soldering can be ensured with ingenuity of the three-dimensional shape specific to the MID, which can improve workability and achieve downsizing.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A connector, for example, may be provided for such connection, which is effective in a case in which there is no space for arrangement, and can also be applied as a space for arranging the connector.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, a design in which the above-described dimension in the radial direction is reduced to increase easiness when inserting the endoscope can be obtained. A space for the light guide or the illumination optical system from the light source device provided in parallel is ensured, and a space for the treatment instrument insertion channel <b>26</b> is ensured, so that a light source which is bright and illuminates an appropriate range can be obtained. This contributes to obtaining a high-performance, sophisticated endoscope that is adaptable to complicated treatment. In other words, it is characterized by providing a space for electric connection by providing a recessed portion or a dent portion that is not influenced by the size of the opening of the cavity portion.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above, according to the electronic module <b>50</b> of the present embodiment, the entire circumference of the cavity portion <b>55</b> in the MID frame part <b>51</b> is covered by the four wall surfaces, for example. This is because the image pickup device and the chip components typically occupy a rectangular range on the mounting surface. In a case of filling the inside of the cavity portion <b>55</b> with sealing resin for stabilizing these components, the resin will not be flown to the outside.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Note that there may be three wall surfaces if the bottom surface is triangular, and some of sides of the walls of the cavity portion as in the present embodiment may be eliminated if sealing is performed taking a countermeasure against overflow of sealing resin. In addition, by forming a gradient for at least one surface among the above-described four wall surfaces such that the opening of the cavity portion is widened (in the present embodiment, the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>have gradients), the opening is widened, molding of the MID frame part <b>51</b>, generation of the wiring pattern, and mounting of the electronic components are facilitated, and improvement in reliability can also be expected. In a case of providing the electronic module of the present embodiment at the distal end portion of the endoscope, the wall surfaces are formed to have gradients with respect to the direction in which the insertion section of the endoscope is inserted.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The gradients of the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>are set to be larger in inclination angle than the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>c </i>and <b>51</b><i>d. </i>The gradients of the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>are gradients for facilitating the shape of a mounting tool or laser processing which will be described later and facilitating pouring of resin, and are assumed to be more than or equal to approximately 5&#xb0;, which is inclined more than a draft of the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>c </i>and <b>51</b><i>d </i>in typical injection molding of less than or equal to 3&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Large inclination angles of the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>facilitate laser processing or resin filling. However, the electronic module will be increased in size as a whole. Thus, by providing a gradient for only a wall surface in a necessary direction, the influence can be reduced. In a case in which the mounting surface or the light receiving surface of the image pickup device is rectangular, for example, the influence of optical vignetting is reduced, and size increase of the electronic module can be minimized by performing mounting with the longitudinal direction of the device light receiving surface or the mounting surface conformed to a wall surface having a larger inclination angle.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">By inclining some wall surfaces among the plurality of wall surfaces constituting the cavity portion, it can be designed such that stress produced when sealing resin contracts/shrinks depending on the temperature escapes to the opening section. In the present embodiment, the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>are provided with a stress distribution function achieved by the inclination. In this manner, an electronic module having excellent processability and reliability can be obtained by virtue of the gradients provided for the wall surfaces <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Herein, a method of mounting each component on the electronic module with the cavity portion through use of the MID in the present embodiment is explained, but solder paste first needs to be applied to correct positions for soldering mounted components.

A soldering portion for the cable and electrodes of the electronic module <b>150</b> will be explained in a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Cable wiring can be performed without interfering with the layout of the above-mentioned pulling mechanism. In this manner, by providing a downsized electronic module which is a feature of the present invention, a side-viewing endoscope can be downsized. Further, reliable treatment instrument control and image pickup device control enables a highly reliable, easy-to-use endoscope product to be provided.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">&#x3c;Third Embodiment&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, the third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> show the third embodiment of the present invention. Using these drawings, a wiring pattern is also illustrated herein in an easy-to-understand manner so as to also explain the first embodiment and the second embodiment described above together. In other words, portions not depicted in the drawings according to the first embodiment and the second embodiment described above shall be equivalent to content which will be explained herein.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the third embodiment includes an incorporating part <b>256</b> for facilitating incorporation of an electronic module <b>250</b> into a distal end portion of an endoscope or the like.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The incorporating part <b>256</b> includes a recessed portion so as to enable positioning through use of a screw, for example. The incorporating part <b>256</b> is provided at a portion molded in an extended part provided in a direction identical to a gradient of a cavity portion in the electronic module <b>250</b>, and conforms to the direction in which the endoscope is inserted, for example, thereby reducing a radial dimension which is an obstacle at the time of insertion.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Since the incorporating part <b>256</b> can be handled in a manner not to touch a metal wiring pattern in an incorporating operation to produce a defect such as a crack, a design is obtained in which handling when a product is manufactured or when the module is inspected is improved.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a side cross-sectional view of the electronic module according to the present third embodiment, and the relationship between the gradients of the cavity portion of a frame member (MID) and electronic components is also provided making effective use of the mounting surface in a direction in which the gradients are present similarly to the first and second embodiments.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">An image pickup module <b>261</b> which is a stacked lens or the like having a height with respect to the mounting surface is sealed by filling the cavity with sealing resin according to necessity. This enables manufacturing which is also preferable in terms of improvement of reliability in which management is performed such that when filling the cavity with resin, an occurrence of air bubbles, for example, can be prevented by flowing resin along the gradient part, overflowing or spillover is prevented, and the amount of sealing resin that fills the periphery of the image pickup module <b>261</b> becomes substantially uniform.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The present embodiment can also have a watertight structure by means of resin, a material of an optical system, or ingenuity of design. The electronic module can be developed to various applications because of downsizing.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The direction of the extended part extended in the direction in which the walls having gradients are arrayed is also a direction in which the runner explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> extends. Further, the extended part presents a shape extended in the insertion direction when incorporating the electronic module (image pickup unit) into the distal end portion of the endoscope or the like, and contributes to downsizing for entering a narrow place. In other words, by providing the incorporating part, a design is obtained in which the length in the direction perpendicular to the insertion direction will not be long.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">At the time of injection molding, resin is injected in the direction of the runner. It is generally known that a coefficient of linear expansion in a flow direction of resin containing a filler is small with respect to a right angle direction. The walls of the cavity are at right angles to the flow direction, that is, the bottom surface of the cavity in which the electronic components are mounted is parallel to the flow direction of resin. Thus, the coefficient of linear expansion is small, and is advantageous in terms of reliability.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In a case of mounting the electronic components on a relatively central area in the cavity, and filling the cavity with resin, and assuming a case in which a temperature property causes contraction/shrinkage of resin, the respective opposite wall surfaces of the cavity may have symmetric shapes centering around the mounting area for the electronic components such as sensors in the cavity portion of a three-dimensional substrate. It can therefore be expected that a balance between forces to be exerted by the contraction/shrinkage on the wall surfaces and the electronic components is adjusted to reduce unbalanced stress on the electronic components.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">When such an extended part is present, a wiring pattern from the cavity portion to the cable (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) along the wall surfaces having gradients is elongated to degrade the quality of signals. Thus, a through hole <b>252</b> is provided such that wirings on the rear side of the mounting surface for the image pickup device, for example, can be routed by a short distance. A pattern <b>253</b> to the soldering portion can be produced with a short wiring using the through hole <b>252</b>, and a scan range with laser light continuously radiated along the pattern is simplified. Such ingenuity facilitates manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In other words, a pattern including a through hole that extends from the front surface to the rear surface of the three-dimensional substrate is provided in a region other than the cavity portion of the three-dimensional substrate, and intended for connecting terminals of a sensor mounting area and external terminals through a surface of the above-described opening section is formed. The through hole saves the effort of wiring step production to facilitate manufacturing, and shortens wirings themselves to reduce an influence caused by noise or the like entering the signal line when the module is inspected or actually used. Some of the wirings are less likely to run into each other at the portion where the through hole is formed, resulting in favorable handling and contributing to improved productivity.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, it is also understood that a frame member includes a flat bottom section, and the electronic module <b>250</b> has a structure to be easily laid on a working table or the like when the electronic module <b>250</b> is handled with the extended part gripped.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As is also clear from the perspective view of a rear surface of the electronic module according to the present third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the third embodiment enables how the wiring pattern <b>253</b>, explanation of which is omitted in the first and second embodiments, is routed from the cavity portion to be checked.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> also illustrates in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> how wirings extending upward from the mounting surface along the gradient part continue to soldering lands <b>254</b>. It is assumed that the first and second embodiments have similar wirings.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In particular, it is assumed that the cable in the second embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) is soldered to the cable connection electrodes (soldering lands) <b>254</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Soldering lands in the first embodiment should be provided at a portion of a surface substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the module following the wirings toward the electronic circuit with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Inspection electrodes <b>255</b> are provided on the bottom surface of the module equivalent to the rear surface of the mounting surface such that the module can be placed on an inspection table or the like to verify functions and performance of the image pickup device and the like. This enables an inspection including an image pickup signal to be performed without shielding or the like of an image of a target caused to enter the image pickup device or the like during the inspection.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In other words, the pattern extended to the rear side of the image pickup device in a viewing field direction for signals of the image pickup device and the like is electrically connected to inspection terminals provided on a parallel flat surface on the rear side of the above-described sensor mounting area, thereby making it less likely to be influenced by an inspection jig, a circuit, wirings, and the like in an inspection step, and enabling a check pin and the like to be applied reliably.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, an endoscope system to which the electronic modules of the first to third embodiments are applied will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, an endoscope system <b>9</b> includes the endoscope <b>2</b>, a processor <b>5</b>A, a light source device <b>5</b>B, and a monitor <b>5</b>C. The endoscope <b>2</b> inserts the insertion section <b>3</b> into a body cavity of a subject to pick up an image of the inside of the body of the subject, and outputs an image pickup signal. In other words, the endoscope <b>2</b> includes any of the electronic modules (image pickup units) <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>250</b> at a distal end portion of the insertion section <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The operation section <b>4</b> provided with various buttons for operating the endoscope <b>2</b> is disposed on a proximal end side of the insertion section <b>3</b> of the endoscope <b>2</b>. The operation section <b>4</b> includes a treatment instrument insertion port <b>4</b>A of a channel through which a treatment instrument such as a biological forceps, an electric cautery, and an inspection probe is to be inserted into the body cavity of the subject. A channel opening section is provided at the distal end.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The insertion section <b>3</b> is composed of a distal end portion <b>3</b>A at which the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> is disposed, a bendable bending portion <b>3</b>B provided in a manner coupled to the proximal end side of the distal end portion <b>3</b>A, and a flexible tube portion <b>3</b>C provided in a manner coupled to the proximal end side of the bending portion <b>3</b>B. The bending portion <b>3</b>B is bent by an operation of the operation section <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A signal cable <b>75</b> connected to the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> at the distal end portion <b>3</b>A is inserted through a universal cord <b>4</b>B disposed on the proximal end portion side of the operation section <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The universal cord <b>4</b>B is connected to the processor <b>5</b>A and the light source device <b>5</b>B via connectors <b>4</b>C. The processor <b>5</b>A controls the endoscope system <b>9</b> as a whole, and performs signal processing on an image pickup signal outputted from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> to output an image signal. The monitor <b>5</b>C displays the image signal outputted from the processor <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The light source device <b>5</b>B includes a white LED, for example. White light emitted from the light source device <b>5</b>B is guided to an illumination optical system (not shown) of the distal end portion <b>3</b>A via a light guide (not shown) inserted through the universal cord <b>4</b>B to illuminate the subject.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Since the endoscope <b>2</b> includes the downsized image pickup apparatus <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, or <b>250</b> at the distal end portion of the insertion section, the endoscope <b>2</b> can be reduced in diameter. As described above, by configuring the endoscope such that the image pickup unit (electronic module) and the channel are arranged at the distal end portion so as to be perpendicular to the direction in which the endoscope is inserted, the image pickup unit is less likely to receive stress caused by a member taken in/out of the channel part, and the three-dimensional wiring board including the cavity portion in which the bottom surface of the image pickup unit and the plurality of walls are formed, and the plurality of electronic components mounted on electrodes provided at the bottom surface, and the like are safely protected. Since a wall corresponding to the direction in which the above-described plurality of electronic components are arrayed among the plurality of walls of the above-described cavity portion is inclined with respect to the bottom surface of the cavity portion, and is in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction in which the adjacent channel is arrayed, the distal end of the endoscope can be narrowed to facilitate insertion.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, and various changes, modifications, and the like can be made within a range not changing the gist of the present invention. For example, application of replacing the portion explained as the endoscope with another camera such as a consumer camera, an industrial camera, an on-vehicle camera, or a surveillance camera can be performed. In other words, by exploiting the characteristics of downsizing of the present invention, a space including a cable wiring that controls the image pickup unit and receives a signal from the image pickup unit can be saved in a direction perpendicular to a direction in which the wirings are pulled out. Thus, even in a case of a system or a layout in which a control circuit that controls an image pickup unit arranged in a narrow space is arranged away from the image pickup unit, a sophisticated image pickup apparatus can be incorporated. Consequently, since many image pickup units are mounted on an automobile for which there is a need to pick up images of various places without blind spots outside or inside the vehicle, downsizing including even wirings as in the present invention is important, and facilitates design at the time of incorporation. The present invention can also be applied to a portable terminal required to be downsized and reduced in weight for portability, a network terminal such as an AI speaker required to be placed at a small spot, IoT consumer electronics, and a watching camera that watches everyday life of a target to assure the security of the target. Further, the image pickup unit is easily incorporated into a movable body, such as a robot (including a vacuum cleaner and the like) or a drone, in which downsizing, weight reduction, and further, the center of gravity of the apparatus, and balance are also important since a moving function is important.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The electronic module and the three-dimensional wiring board including the cavity portion for the image pickup unit in the above description are not necessarily limited to those produced by the MID technology through injection molding, but may be produced by processing with a 3D printer or cutting machining, for example. The material is not limited to resin, but ceramic or glass epoxy may be used.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
