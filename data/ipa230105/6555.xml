level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">In a conventional Fixed Frequency PWM controller (Digital Controller, PID based voltage mode with Vin Feedforward), Vtarget is the regulator's target output voltage, adjusted for the feedback ratio of the voltage sensor. Verror is the error voltage, such as the difference between the feedback voltage and target voltage. A feed forward module provides feedforward computation of the nominal duty cycle ratio DO, based on measured, estimated, or fixed Vin.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A respective pulse width modulator (PWM) converts a received control signal and produces a pulse width modulation signal. This results in a PWM signal at a fixed frequency of FO, with variable duty cycle D responsive to the error voltage. The feedback loop thus tries to reduce the error voltage, such that the output voltage matches Vtarget, adjusted for the ratio of the voltage sensor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Implementation of clean energy (or green technology) is very important to reduce our impact as humans on the environment. In general, clean energy includes any evolving methods and materials to reduce an overall toxicity on the environment from energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This disclosure includes the observation that raw energy, such as received from green energy sources or non-green energy sources, typically needs to be converted into an appropriate form (such as desired AC voltage, DC voltage, etc.) before it can be used to power end devices such as servers, computers, mobile communication devices, wireless base stations, etc. In certain instances, energy is stored in a respective one or more battery resource. Regardless of whether energy is received from green energy sources or non-green energy sources, it is desirable to make most efficient use of raw energy (such as storage and subsequent distribution) provided by such systems to reduce our impact on the environment. This disclosure contributes to reducing our carbon footprint and better use of energy via more efficient energy conversion.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">First Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments herein include novel ways of improving generation of a respective output voltage via a power converter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, embodiments herein include an apparatus such as a power supply. The power supply includes components such as one or more power supply phases and a power supply controller. During operation, the power supply controller produces an output voltage via supply of current from one or more power supply phases of the power supply to power a load. In furtherance of producing the output voltage, the power supply controller generates a current control signal based on an error voltage signal indicating a difference between an output voltage and a reference setpoint voltage, such that under closed loop conditions, the control loop derives the current control signal that modulates the pulse width modulation signal of the power supply phases, causing the total phase currents supplied to the load to match the load current and drive the error voltage to effectively small value such that the output voltage matches the setpoint voltage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, in further example embodiments, the power supply controller generates a switching period adjustment signal and a current adjustment signal based on an error voltage signal indicating a difference between an output voltage and a reference setpoint voltage. Under dynamic load conditions and changing output current, the switching period and current control signal are adjusted such that the error voltage under dynamic load is minimized, and the output voltage dynamic regulation is improved. The power supply controller then generates (such as via modulating or other suitable function) the pulse width modulation signal of the at least one power supply phases based on the switching period adjustment signal and the current adjustment signal. This effectively changes the pulse width On-time, Off-time, duty cycle, switching period, switching frequency and phase current of the power supply phase, which the controller applies in order to control the output voltage and phase currents of the regulator.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, in one embodiment, in order to close the loop and provide regulation, the current control signal is generated (or derived) so that it drives the error voltage to effectively 0, making the output voltage match the setpoint voltage. The current adjustment signal as discussed herein provides adjustments during transient events to maintain the magnitude of the output voltage at a desired setpoint voltage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with further example embodiments, the power supply controller produces a first phase current control signal based on the current control signal and a number of power supply phases in the power supply; the power supply controller derives a first pulse width setting from the first phase current control signal and then modulates (generates) a first pulse width modulation signal controlling the first power supply phase based on the first pulse width setting.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with further example embodiments, the power supply controller controls operation of multiple phases of the power supply such as a first power supply phase and a second power supply phase. For example, the power supply controller produces a first phase current control signal based on the current control signal and a number of power supply phases in the power supply. The power supply controller produces a first error current signal based on a difference between the first phase current control signal and a first current monitoring signal indicative of first output current supplied by the first power supply phase to the load. Additionally, the power supply controller derives a first pulse width setting from the first error current signal. The power supply controller then generates (such as modulates) a first pulse width modulation signal of the first power supply phase based on the first pulse width setting.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The power supply controller produces a second phase current control signal based on the current control signal and the number of power supply phases in the power supply. The power supply controller produces a second error current signal based on a difference between the second phase current control signal and a second current consumption signal indicative of second output current supplied by the second power supply phase. Additionally, the power supply controller derives a second pulse width setting from the second error current signal. The power supply controller then generates a second pulse width modulation signal of the second power supply phase based on the second pulse width setting.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, embodiments herein include controlling multiple power supply phases to produce a respective output voltage to power a load.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet further example embodiments, the power supply controller: i) produces an error current signal (Ierror) based on a difference between the current control signal and a current consumption signal indicative of output current supplied by the first power supply phase and a second power supply phase to power a load, (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and corresponding description below with respect to summer <b>461</b> producing the error current signal <b>489</b>) and ii) derives a pulse width setting from the error current signal and apply the pulse width setting to the pulse width modulation signal. In further example embodiments, the power supply controller: i) produces a nominal pulse width ON-time signal; ii) derives a pulse width ON-time adjustment signal from the error current signal; and iii) applies the pulse width ON-time adjustment signal to the nominal pulse width ON-time signal to control a pulse width of the pulse width modulation signal.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the current control signal generated by the power supply controller indicates a total target output current to be supplied by a combination of the first power supply phase and the second power supply phase to the load.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In still further example embodiments, the power supply controller: i) produces a nominal switching period; and ii) applies the switching period adjustment signal to the nominal switching period to control a switching period and frequency of the pulse width modulation signal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further embodiments herein include, via the power supply controller, generating the switching period adjustment signal and the current adjustment signal based on a magnitude, slope, or a combination of magnitude and slop of the error voltage.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In still further example embodiments, the power supply controller is configured to operate in a non-linear variable frequency control mode of generating the pulse width modulation signal based on the error voltage. In one embodiment, the power supply controller operates in the non-linear control mode in response to a transient output current consumption condition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As previously discussed, the power supply can be configured to include multiple power supply phases, each of which supply output current to the load. For example, in one embodiment, the power supply includes a second power supply phase controlled by the controller. The second power supply phase supplies corresponding second output current to the load. Thus, the first power supply phase supplies first output current to the load; the second power supply phase supplies second output current to the load.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with further embodiments, the power supply further includes a current monitor. Based on a magnitude of the first output current and a magnitude of the second output current, the current monitor (and controller) balances the first output current and the second output current via adjustment of a switching frequency of operating the first power supply phase the second power supply phase. For example, in response to detecting an imbalance in a magnitude of the first output current and the second output current, the current monitor changes a switching frequency of operating one or more of the first power supply phase and the second power supply phase. The change in switching frequency results in a change in the magnitudes of the output current from each power supply phase.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In further example embodiments, the power supply controller derives a pulse width ON-time adjustment signal from the current control signal; the power supply controller then varies the pulse width modulation signal based on the switching period adjustment signal and the pulse width ON-time adjustment signal.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Still further embodiments herein include, via the power supply controller, generating the current adjustment signal and the switching period adjustment signal (to be non-zero values) in response to detection of a transient current supplied by the output voltage to a dynamic load.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the power supply controller generates the current adjustment signal (such as current boost adjustment signal) and the switching period adjustment signal in response to the error voltage being greater than a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Note further that the power supply controller can be configured to include any number of control functions. For example, in one embodiment, the power supply controller includes a first PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller function operative to convert the error voltage into the switching period adjustment signal; the power supply controller includes a second PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller function operative to convert the error voltage into the current adjustment signal.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, in one embodiment, the power supply controller implements a first controller function that produces the switching period adjustment signal from the error voltage; the power supply controller implements a second controller function operative to produce the current adjustment signal from the error voltage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In further example embodiments, the power supply controller includes a summer function that produces an error current signal based on a difference between the current control signal and a current consumption signal. In one embodiment, the current consumption signal represents an amount of output current supplied by the first power supply phase to power a load. A third controller function of the power supply controller converts the error current signal into a pulse width ON-time adjustment signal. A pulse width modulation generator of the power supply controller produces the pulse width modulation signal based on the switching period adjustment signal and the pulse width ON-time adjustment signal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Second Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further embodiments herein include a power supply controller such as a current mode controller. During operation including conversion of an input voltage to an output voltage, the current mode controller produces an output voltage by supplying phase current from one or more power supply phases of a power supply to power a load. The current mode controller produces an error current signal (Ierror) based on a difference between a magnitude of output current (Ifeedback) supplied from the one or more power supply phase to a load and a phase current setpoint (Ictl). Based on a magnitude of the error current signal, the current mode controller controls a pulse width setting of a pulse width modulation signal controlling the power supply phase. In one embodiment, the current mode controller varies a leading edge and a falling edge of a pulse width ON-time of the pulse width modulation signal over each of multiple control cycles depending on variations in the magnitude of the pulse width setting.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further embodiments herein include, via the current mode controller, producing an error voltage signal based on a difference between a magnitude of output voltage supplied from a power supply phase to a load and a voltage setpoint; and deriving, from an error voltage, the phase current setpoint in which to control the output current supplied by the power supply phase to the load. Additionally, the current mode controller varies a switching frequency of the pulse width modulation signal based on a magnitude of the error voltage, the error voltage representing a difference between a magnitude of the output voltage and a voltage setpoint of producing the output voltage.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In further example embodiments, the current mode controller: determines the magnitude of the output current over time from an emulated current signal representing the output current supplied from the power supply phase to the load; determines a magnitude of the output voltage based on a voltage feedback signal representative of the output voltage applied to the load; emulates the phase current over time based on a current feedback signal representative of the phase current supplied by the power supply phase and a state of the pulse width modulation signal controlling switching of the power supply phase; and determines the magnitude of the output current from a respective power supply phase based on the emulated phase current.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the current mode controller receives a current measurement signal approximating a magnitude of the output current supplied by the power supply phase to the load and derives the emulated current signal from the current measurement signal.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In still further example embodiments, for a first control cycle of the multiple control cycles: generates a first ramp signal; derives a pulse width signal from the pulse width setting, the pulse width signal representing an amount of time in which to activate high side switch circuitry in the power supply phase to convert an input voltage into the output voltage; and controls timing of the leading edge of the pulse width modulation control signal based on a magnitude of the pulse width signal with respect to the first ramp signal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, for the first control cycle, the current mode controller generates a second ramp signal with respect to the leading edge; and controls timing of the trailing edge of the pulse width modulation control signal based on the magnitude of the pulse width setting with respect to the second ramp signal. In such an embodiment, the magnitude of the pulse width signal at the leading edge of the first control cycle is different than the magnitude of the pulse width signal at the trailing edge of the first control cycle.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In yet further example embodiments, a timing of the leading edge of the pulse width modulation signal in a first control cycle of multiple control cycles depends on a magnitude of the pulse width setting; and a timing of the trailing edge of the pulse width modulation signal in the first control cycle of the multiple control cycles depends on the magnitude of the pulse width setting.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In further example embodiments, a magnitude of the pulse width setting at the leading edge of the pulse width modulation signal for a first control cycle is a first pulse width value; the magnitude of the pulse width setting at the trailing edge of the pulse width modulation signal for the first control cycle is a second pulse width value, the second pulse width value different than the first pulse width value.
