The communication devices include but are not limited to: Wi-Fi routers and other wireless access point (AP) devices, wireless stations (STA), user terminals, user nodes, mobile terminals or tablet computers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an application scenario of the embodiments of the disclosure, before transmitting data frames, a data frame originator and a data frame recipient can negotiate a BA feedback mechanism. After continuously receiving a certain number of data frames, the data fame receiving end feeds back BA, and when no more continuous data frames are sent, the BA mechanism can be disenabled.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A single transmission link BA feedback mechanism as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Step a, BA feedback mechanism establishment. Before transmitting the data frames, the data frame originator and the data frame recipient can negotiate the BA mechanism. The data frame originator sends a BA feedback establishment request, ADDBA request, and the data frame recipient sends a BA feedback establishment response, ADDBA response.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Step b, data frame transmission and feedback.

After continuous transmission of the data frames is completed, the data frame originator sends a BA feedback disenabled request, DELBA request, to disenable the BA feedback.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The BA feedback disenabled process is applicable to single transmission link, and can be used to disenable the BA feedback for one transmission link, but cannot disenable the BA feedback for multiple transmission links. The transmission links that are not disenabled remain active, which is not conducive to saving power.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">If BA feedback disenabled is initiated under each transmission link, the power consumption is greater than that of BA feedback disenabled process for one transmission link.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If BA feedback disenabled frames for multiple transmission links are initiated under one transmission link, considering that Wi-Fi uses the contention-based access mechanism and there may be hidden nodes, the transmission of multiple disenable frames may lead to a high probability of communication collision, which may cause retransmission, and thus is not conducive to saving power and reduces spectrum utilization.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this example embodiment provides a method for controlling BA feedback, which can be applied to a first communication device in wireless communication. The method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>101</b>, for a plurality of transmission links that transmit continuous data frames, a block acknowledgement feedback control identifier is sent, in which the block acknowledgement feedback control identifier is configured to indicate an enabled or disenabled state of BA feedback of each transmission link.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Wireless communication may be Wi-Fi communication of IEEE802.11be standard. The first wireless communication device may be an originator for continuous data frame in the Wi-Fi communication technology, and the second wireless communication device may be a recipient for the continuous data frame in the Wi-Fi communication technology. The first communication device may communicate with the second communication device over multiple transmission links.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The continuous data frames may include multiple data frames transmitted over multiple transmission links. Each transmission link of the multiple transmission links occupies one transmission frequency band, and the multiple transmission links occupy multiple transmission frequency bands. The transmission frequency band may be any of multiple Wi-Fi working frequency bands, such as 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz, and 6-7 GHz. The bandwidths occupied by multiple transmission links in the same frequency band may be the same or different. For example, the bandwidths occupied by the multiple transmission links may be one or more of 20 MHz, 40 MHz, and 80 MHz. The frequency ranges of the bandwidths occupied by respective transmission frequency bands may belong to the same Wi-Fi working frequency band, or may belong to different Wi-Fi working frequency bands.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first communication device may send the BA feedback control identifier by carrying the BA feedback control identifier in a management frame, or may send the BA feedback control identifier by sending an instruction. Here, the BA feedback control identifier may be configured to indicate an enabled or disenabled state of BA feedbacks of the transmission links after transmission of the data frames.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a control identifier can be set in the BA feedback control identifier for each transmission link, and each control identifier corresponds to one transmission link. Here, the transmission link may be any of multiple transmission links for continuous data frames. Link <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> represents the control identifier for one transmission link, which is configured to indicate an enabled or disenabled state of BA feedback of the transmission link.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The control identifiers for respective transmission links shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be arranged according to frequency bands of the respective transmission links. For example, Link <b>1</b> to Link n may be arranged according to the frequency bands for the corresponding transmission links from high to low, or may be arranged according to the frequency bands for the corresponding transmission links from low to high.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The control identifier for each transmission link in the BA feedback control identifier may occupy one subfield in the BA feedback control identifier, and each subfield may occupy 1 bit, in which &#x201c;1&#x201d; or &#x201c;0&#x201d; are used to indicate an enabled or disenabled state of the BA feedback for the transmission link. For example, &#x201c;1&#x201d; may be used to indicate that the BA feedback for the transmission link is enabled, and &#x201c;0&#x201d; may be used to indicate that the BA feedback for the transmission link is disenabled. Alternatively, &#x201c;0&#x201d; may be used to indicate that the BA feedback for the transmission link is enabled, and &#x201c;1&#x201d; may be used to indicate that the BA feedback for the transmission link is disenabled.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After receiving the message frames, the second communication device may determine the an enabled or disenabled state of each transmission link indicated by the first communication device according to the control identifier. The BA feedback is disenabled for the transmission link that is indicated to be disenabled, and the BA feedback is enabled for the transmission link that is indicated to be enabled.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">After completing transmission of the continuous data frames, the first communication device may determine the reception of the data frame over each transmission link according to the BA feedback by the second communication device. The first communication device may send the BA feedback control identifier after receiving the BA. For the transmission link that completes data frame transmission and does not require retransmission, the first communication device may disenable the BA feedback for the transmission link, that is, set the control identifier for the transmission link to disenabled. For the transmission link that completes the data frame transmission but needs to retransmit the data frames, the first communication device may maintain the BA feedback for the transmission link, that is, set the control identifier for the transmission link to enable. The first communication device may also send the message frame after retransmission of all the transmission links is completed, and set the BA feedbacks for the transmission links for transmitting the data frames to disenabled.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this way, on one hand, with the BA feedback control identifier, the BA feedback for each transmission link is controlled to enabled or disenabled, and the BA feedback of multiple transmission links whose data transmission is completed can be disenabled, to disenable the active states of the multiple transmission links, thereby reducing the power consumption of the communication device. On the other hand, the enabled or disenabled state of BA feedbacks for multiple transmission links is realized through one BA feedback control identifier, which reduces the communication conflict problem caused by sending a BA feedback disenabled frame separately for each transmission link, and reduces retransmission of the BA feedback disenabled frame, thereby reducing power consumption caused by retransmission.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the BA feedback control identifier further includes:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">first identification information configured to indicate a data frame sequence number of the continuous data frames.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first communication device may transmit multiple sequences of continuous data frames, and after completing the transmission of one sequence of continuous data frames, the first communication device may control the BA feedbacks for the transmission links of the sequence of continuous data frames.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first communication device may set the first identification information in the BA feedback control identifier to instruct the second communication device to enable or disenable the transmission links of the confirmed continuous data frames.
