A jig may be inserted within the sock to hold the sock cuff in place during the sublimation printing process. But as recognized by the inventors hereof, the very sharp angles and/or right angles of conventional jigs that are used for holding a sock's cuff in place will snag and grab the insides of the sock pulling threads out of place when the conventional jig is removed from the sock. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> that shows a jig <b>1001</b> having sharp angled shoulder portions or transitions <b>1005</b> between the jig's upper portion <b>1009</b> and lower portion <b>1013</b>. The sharp angles may cause the jig <b>1001</b> to snag, grab the inside of a sock, and pull threads out of place when the jig <b>1001</b> is being slidably removed from the sock. By comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of a jig <b>900</b> including rounded shoulder portions or transitions <b>904</b> between the jig's upper portion <b>908</b> and lower portion <b>912</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a generally S-shaped curve is defined along each side of the jig <b>900</b> between the jig's upper portion <b>908</b> rounded shoulder portion or transition <b>904</b>, and lower portion <b>912</b>. Changing the sharp angled portion <b>1005</b> of the conventional jig <b>1001</b> to generally rounded gradual transitions <b>904</b> allows the jig <b>900</b> to be slidably removed from a sock seamlessly without the jig <b>900</b> snagging the sock, e.g., after the jig <b>900</b> has been used to maintain the sock in a generally flat shape during production (e.g., during sublimation printing, etc.), etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the inventor(s) hereof have also recognized that conventional jigs tend to be very thick (e.g., thicknesses of 2 millimeters or more, etc.), which thickness results in a harsh or thick white seam (or a non-white seam in the case of a non-white sock). The seam corresponds with the location along which the sublimated ink did not transfer and is visible along the side of the sublimation printed sock. The seam is defined by the absence of sublimated ink along the side of the sock. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> that shows an example sock <b>1217</b> that was sublimation printed while a conventional 2 millimeter thick jig was within the sock. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the sublimation printed sock <b>1217</b> includes a visible harsh or thick seam <b>1221</b> defined by the absence of sublimated ink along a side of the sock <b>1217</b>. By comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an example sock <b>1116</b> that was sublimation printed while a 0.4 millimeter thick jig was within the sock <b>1116</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the sublimation printed sock <b>1116</b> does not include a visible seam <b>1120</b> defined by the absence of sublimated ink along a side of the sock <b>1116</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">After recognizing the above drawbacks associated with conventional jigs, the inventor(s) hereof developed and/or disclose herein exemplary embodiments of jigs or insert cards (broadly, inserts) for use when sublimation printing on socks, production ready sublimation printable socks with preinstalled jigs therein, and related systems and methods.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As disclosed herein, exemplary embodiments include a jig or insert card (broadly, an insert) configured (e.g., sized, shaped, etc.) to hold a sock cuff (broadly, an upper portion of a sock) in place during a sublimation printing process. The jig is also configured (e.g., sized, shaped with rounded shoulder portions or transitions, etc.) to allow the jig to be slidably removed from within the sock seamlessly without snagging or grabbing the insides of the sock and pulling threads out of place.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In exemplary embodiments, the jig is configured to have a relatively small thickness (e.g., a thickness less than 2 millimeters, a thickness of 0.4 millimeters, etc.) such that there will be substantially no visible seam where the sublimated ink did not transfer along the side of the sublimation printed sock. For example, an exemplary embodiment of a jig may have a thickness of about 0.4 millimeter, which allows the sublimated ink to substantially entirely cover the seam/edge between the top and bottom sides of a sock, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In exemplary embodiments, the jig is configured for use as a disposable single-use jig. The disposable single-use jig may be made of chipboard or other sufficiently inexpensive and/or biodegradable material(s) to thereby be disposable, etc. As recognized by the inventor(s) hereof, using a jig for only a single sublimation printing process advantageously avoids the problem associated with reusing a jig for multiple sublimation printing processes. With a reusable jig, some ink may transfer to the jig during a first sublimation printing process of a first sock. If the same jig is then reused, the transferred ink on the reused jig may then subsequently transfer to the inside of another (e.g., second, third, etc.) sock during a subsequent (e.g., second, third, etc.) sublimation printing process.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In exemplary embodiments, the jig is configured to be preinstalled within a sock such that the sock with the preinstalled jig therein is production ready for sublimation printing. In exemplary embodiments, the jig is configured to allow the sock with the preinstalled jig therein to be flat, e.g., packed and shipped in a flat stackable configuration in a container, box, large envelope, etc. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> showing socks <b>316</b>, <b>416</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>616</b>, <b>716</b> with preinstalled jigs <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b> therein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In exemplary embodiments, a length of the jig is greater than an overall length of the sock (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, etc.) such that an upper portion of the jig protrudes outwardly beyond the opening at the top of the sock to thereby provide an exposed upper portion (e.g., pull tab, etc.) of the jig to facilitate grasping and/or slidably pulling the jig from within the sock.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates socks including jigs (broadly, inserts) therein, which jigs are configured (e.g., shaped with rounded shoulder portions or transitions, etc.) to allow the jigs to be slidably removed from the socks seamlessly without the jigs snagging the socks after sublimating printing on the socks according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref> illustrate the jigs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with exemplary dimensions in centimeters for purpose of illustration only.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary jig <b>300</b> installed within a toddler ankle sock <b>316</b>.

If, for some reason, the imprecision provided by &#x201c;about&#x201d; is not otherwise understood in the art with this ordinary meaning, then &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein indicates at least variations that may arise from ordinary methods of measuring or using such parameters. For example, the terms &#x201c;generally&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; may be used herein to mean within manufacturing tolerances.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;inner,&#x201d; &#x201c;outer,&#x201d; &#x201c;beneath&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the example term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.
