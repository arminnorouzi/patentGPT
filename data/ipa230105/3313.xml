In comparison to other techniques fluidics offers an efficient means of distributing power to activate elements remote from the power source as the pressure/fluid flow may be used directly to generate pressure and/or motion without requiring an additional transducer, e.g. a motor to convert electric power to mechanical power. Accordingly, fluidics may allow either air and/or liquid based fluidic devices to be provided which are suitable for applications in these consumer and non-consumer products that are compatible with the dimensions, design, and performance required whilst also operating multiple actuators of one or more types and allowing multiple motors (pumps) to be employed within a small region. Further, fluidic actuators may be flexed and/or distorted during operation as well as operating after having been flexed and/or distorted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Today fluidic developments are primarily within the realm of micro-fluidics for self-powered biological and/or chemical testing applications where dimensions are measured in micrometers (microinches) or pump based hydraulic (fluidic) systems for plumbing, refrigeration, heating, hydroculture, vehicle suspensions, etc. where dimensions are measured in centimeters (inches). Such pump based systems exploit pumps such as rotary vane pumps, diaphragm pumps, gear pumps etc. which are bulky, low efficiency, and high power requiring connection to the electrical power grid (mains electricity) or other power sources such as lead acid batteries or petrol/diesel/gas engines. The absence of high efficiency, compact fluidic pumps has until recently blocked the consideration of using hydraulic devices within portable and/or alkaline battery powered consumer and non-consumer products. Further, most prior art pumps do not support the operation modes required for such devices, such as, for example, low frequency, variable duration, and pulsed for those providing primary pumps for dimensional adjustments or for example, high frequency operation for those providing secondary pumps for vibration and other types of motion/excitation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast, electromagnetic pumps offer a low power, compact, linear fluidic pump solution as evident from those developed by the inventor and described within WO/2014/047717 entitled &#x201c;Methods and Devices for Fluidic Driven Adult Devices&#x201d; and WO/2014/047718 entitled &#x201c;Fluidic Methods and Devices.&#x201d; Such electromagnetic pumps can achieve sufficient efficiency to enable their deployment within portable battery powered consumer and non-consumer products employing fluidics such as those, for example, described by the inventor within the preceding publications and WO/2015/135,070 entitled &#x201c;Methods and Devices to Hydraulic Consumer Devices.&#x201d; The entire contents of WO/2014/047,717; WO/2914/047,718; and WO/2015/135,070 being incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the higher the functionality and programmability desired for the consumer and/or non-consumer product then the more complex the overall fluidic system in terms of the number of actuators, valves, switches etc. within the fluidic system coupled to the one or more fluidic pumps. It would therefore be beneficial to be provide fluidic valves and switches to support configurability, programmability, and operation of these portable battery-operated consumer and non-consumer devices. Accordingly, such fluidic valves and switches should offer high efficiency, have a small footprint, be low complexity for high reliability and ease of manufacture, and low cost.</p><p id="p-0009"

If the piston <b>380</b> is formed from a magnetic material, then when the piston is driven to the first valve stop element <b>315</b> to block fluid flow between the first port <b>300</b>C and second port <b>300</b>D the piston <b>380</b> is retained in position when the coil(s) are not energised by the first magnetic washer <b>340</b>.

Accordingly, power consumption is minimised as the magnetic washers retain the piston in position until their retentive magnetic force is overcome by the magnetic force on the piston <b>380</b> generated by the first and/or second coils <b>360</b> and <b>370</b> respectively.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0104">The first and second coils <b>360</b> and <b>370</b> respectively are energised such that the coils as depicted end to end have their outer faces having the same pole (e.g. north or south) and hence their inner faces the same opposite poles (e.g. south or north). The magnet is axially magnetized, i.e. north at one end and south at the other. Within embodiments of the invention the first and second coils <b>360</b> and <b>370</b> respectively can be energized at the same time, e.g. they are wired in series or parallel and excited by the same electrical source or controlled separately with precise phase or lag timed with respect to each other and the time required for magnet piston to go from one end to the other.

However, with too small a magnetic force applied to the magnetic piston then the magnet may fail to reach the end against the fluid pressure and similarly not latch and therefore the switch or valve again fails. Accordingly, within embodiments of the invention sufficient magnetic force is applied to the magnet with a first electrical pulse applied to the coils to ensure that it reaches from one end to the other but once the piston has arrived at the other end a second short electrical pulse is applied to ensure that the piston is latched and stable at the far end.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0106">As evident in first and second images <b>300</b>A and <b>300</b>B respectively each of the first valve stop element <b>315</b> and the second valve stop element <b>335</b> project through the respective one of the first magnetic washer <b>340</b> and second magnetic washer <b>350</b>.

The magnetic retention of the magnetic piston <b>380</b> to either the first magnetic washer <b>340</b> or second magnetic washer <b>350</b> is determined by the magnetic strength of the piston <b>380</b>, the magnetic strength of either the first magnetic washer <b>340</b> or second magnetic washer <b>350</b>, and either the respective first distance l<sub>1 </sub>or second distance l<sub>2</sub>. The larger the distance between end of the valve stop element which abuts the end face of the piston <b>380</b> and the magnetic washer then the lower the magnetic retention force and the lower the reverse magnetic force required to move the piston in the reverse direction. The lower the reverse magnetic force the lower the electrical power consumption required to reverse the FVSE from closed for that pair of openings to open.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0107">The magnetic retentive force required for maintaining the piston in the position to close the fluidic connection between the openings at an end of a FVSE is dependent upon the fluidic pressure at that point in the fluidic system. Within many fluidic systems such as where the FVSE couples fluid from a reservoir under pressure with pressure flow generated by an ELPUMP to an actuator on one side and from the actuator to a reservoir at lower pressure from which the ELPUMP draws. Accordingly, the fluid pressure on one side of the FVSE is different to that of the FVSE on the other side. If electrical power consumption of the device of which the fluidic system comprising the FVSE(s) is not limited such as a device pulling power from an electrical supply such as 120V, 240V mains electricity, then minimizing the electrical consumption of the FVSE may not be of concern. However, in portable device applications reducing power consumption is important for increasing the duration that the device can be used particularly where there are multiple FVSEs and they are required to open/close/modulate at increasing rates according to the operating mode of the device.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0108">Accordingly, FVSEs according to embodiments of the invention allow for the respective distances l<sub>1 </sub>and l<sub>2 </sub>to be established differently on each side in dependence upon the pressure that the piston within the FSVE must hold off when closed. Additionally, the pressure being held off can be adjusted within a predetermined range established in dependence upon the magnetic strength of the piston and magnetic washer by changing the distance between the end of the gate valve element and the magnetic washer. Accordingly, with a FVSAM employing FVSEs then all FVSEs can be adjusted simultaneously by replacing the sheet of gate valve elements with a different sheet providing a different distance. Optionally, rather than each sheet of gate valve elements providing a common distance for each FVSE the sheet may be formed with different distances for each FVSE assembled to it.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0109">Referring to second image <b>400</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> then the elements of a single FVSE <b>450</b> such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with FVSE <b>220</b>A, <b>220</b>B and <b>2200</b>C are depicted in an exploded perspective view together with the first sheet <b>310</b> of stop valve elements and second sheet <b>330</b> of stop valve elements which provide the appropriate standoff distances for the piston <b>380</b> at either end of the FVSE <b>450</b> for all three FVSEs <b>450</b> with the FVSAM <b>120</b> depicted in third image <b>100</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

In contrast, a gate valve has been depicted as comprising an outer portion against the external surface of the magnetic washer and an inner portion comprising a central element that forms the pair of openings in conjunction with the piston sleeve within which the piston moves. However, it would be evident that a hybrid valve design may exploit a design similar to a block valve in that there is an outer ring and a central divider but the central divider projects further through the magnetic washer into the bore of the FVSE than the outer ring and abuts the piston end either solely or initially before the piston abuts both the outer ring and central divider.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0167">Within the embodiments of the invention described above in respect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>19</b>B</figref> the standoff has been primarily described as being different on one side of an FVSE and/or FVSAM to the other, e.g. the magnetic force required for holding a FVSE closed against a fluid source at zero pounds per square inch (0 psi) PSI source) is less than that required for a fluid source at, say, seven pounds per square inch (7 psi) and accordingly the separation between the magnetic piston and the magnetic washer can be larger for a FVSE operating on the 0 psi source than for one operating on the 7 psi source. Accordingly, the smaller the standoff distance from the magnet face to the inside face of the magnetic washer the larger the latching force and the more energy it takes to move the magnetic piston away from its latched position (all other aspects such a pressure difference etc. being equal).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0168">Alternatively, the distances between the magnet face of the piston and the inner face of the magnetic washer may be the same but the dimensions of the magnetic washer may be adjusted to adjust the latching force for the same strength magnetic material. Alternatively, the magnetic material may be different at each end of the FVSE.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0169">For example, rather than a 0.030&#x2033; (0.762 mm) thickness washer being employed on both ends of the FVSE a reduction in latching force can be achieved by reducing the magnetic washer thickness to 0.010&#x2033; (0.254 mm) or below.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0170">Alternatively, the smaller the internal diameter of the magnetic washer the stronger the latching force although as this diameter reduces. However, as the internal diameter of the magnetic washer is reduced to less than that of the magnetic element of the piston then the smaller the openings to provide the inlet and outlet ports of the FVSE are as typically the outer diameter of the piston defines the inner diameter of piston sleeve. Similarly, as the inner diameter of the magnetic washer is increased beyond that of the magnetic element forming the piston then the latching force reduces. However, whilst increasing/decreasing the inner diameter of the magnetic washer adjusts the latching force it also adjusts the electrical drive efficiency of the electromagnetic coils in the same direction and hence whilst a reduction in latching force can be achieved then a corresponding reduction in the electrical efficiency of the FVSE in switching between states is observed.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0171">Accordingly, a configuration with high latching force can be employed at either end of the FVSE and if required the latching force reduced by making the magnet relatively weak, either by selecting a different magnetic material for example or employing less magnetic material within a cast, molded, or stamped magnetic washer employing magnetic material within a body of one or more other materials. For example, using neodymium magnets may be formed at N26, N27, or N28 for reduced magnetic strength.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0172">Within the embodiments of the invention described in respect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>19</b>B</figref> magnetic washers are only employed at the ends of the piston sleeve and hence ends of the FVSE.

This switching cycle can accordingly achieve pulsed fluid actuations in the range of 30 Hz or higher. It would be evident that whilst there is not a significant fluid flow at these higher switching speeds the FVSE switching creates pressure and flow pulses at the control frequency and this pulsed pressure/flow can be employed to impart vibration to another portion of the fluidic system to which the FVSE is coupled such that the pressure/flow pulses act as a stimulation or vibration source for massagers, vibrators, etc.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0174">Within the embodiments of the invention described in respect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>19</b>B</figref> FVSEs have been described as comprising an outer shell.
