Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various embodiments are described herein as applied to a fin field effect transistor (FinFET). Embodiments may be applied to other transistor technologies, including NanosheetFET (NSFET, including gate all around field effect transistors (GAAFETs), nanowire FETs, nanosheet FETs, and the like), or the like.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In various embodiments, a dielectric material may be used to separate metal gates of adjacent transistors. The dielectric material may be formed by patterning an opening in a dummy gate stack or a metal gate stack and filling the dielectric material in the opening. In various embodiments, an upper portion of the opening may be widened, thereby improving a gap fill window of the dielectric material. For example, a small critical dimension may result in voids in the dielectric material, and these voids may be subsequently filled with undesirable materials (e.g., a metal gate material in cut dummy gate processes). By widening a gap fill window for the dielectric material, these voids can be reduced or eliminated. Further a lower portion of the opening may not be widened, and an effective gate width of the adjacent gate stacks may be maintained. In some embodiments, widening the upper portion of the opening may be achieved one or more cycles of treatment and etching processes. Accordingly, an atomic layer etch (ALE) type process may be achieved to control effective gate width and enlarge the dielectric material gap fill window. Manufacturing defects can be reduced, and device performance can be improved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates examples of a device <b>10</b> and device <b>20</b>, respectively, in a three-dimensional view, in accordance with some embodiments.

As will be described in subsequent figures, the fin <b>52</b>B may be optionally removed and replaced with a dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the fins <b>52</b>A may be formed in the substrate <b>50</b> by etching trenches in the substrate <b>50</b>. The etching may be any acceptable etch process, such as a reactive ion etch (RIE), neutral beam etch (NBE), the like, or a combination thereof. The etch may be anisotropic.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fins may be patterned by any suitable method. For example, the fins may be patterned using one or more photolithography processes, including double-patterning or multi-patterning processes. Generally, double-patterning or multi-patterning processes combine photolithography and self-aligned processes, allowing patterns to be created that have, for example, pitches smaller than what is otherwise obtainable using a single, direct photolithography process. For example, in one embodiment, a sacrificial layer is formed over a substrate and patterned using a photolithography process. Spacers are formed alongside the patterned sacrificial layer using a self-aligned process. The sacrificial layer is then removed, and the remaining spacers may then be used to pattern the fins. In some embodiments, the mask (or other layer) may remain on the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an insulation material <b>54</b> is formed over the substrate <b>50</b> and between neighboring fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B. The insulation material <b>54</b> may be an oxide, such as silicon oxide, a nitride, the like, or a combination thereof, and may be formed by a high density plasma chemical vapor deposition (HDP-CVD), a flowable CVD (FCVD) (e.g., a CVD-based material deposition in a remote plasma system and post curing to make it convert to another material, such as an oxide), the like, or a combination thereof. Other insulation materials formed by any acceptable process may be used. In the illustrated embodiment, the insulation material <b>54</b> is silicon oxide formed by a FCVD process. An anneal process may be performed once the insulation material is formed. In an embodiment, the insulation material <b>54</b> is formed such that excess insulation material <b>54</b> covers the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B. Although the insulation material <b>54</b> is illustrated as a single layer, some embodiments may utilize multiple layers. For example, in some embodiments a conformal liner (not shown) may first be formed along a surface of the substrate <b>50</b> and the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B. Thereafter, a fill material, such as those discussed above may be formed over the liner.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">After deposition, a removal process is applied to the insulation material <b>54</b> to remove excess insulation material <b>54</b> over the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B. In some embodiments, a planarization process such as a chemical mechanical polish (CMP), an etch-back process, combinations thereof, or the like may be utilized. The planarization process exposes the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B such that top surfaces of the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B and the insulation material <b>54</b> are level after the planarization process is complete. In embodiments in which mask <b>53</b> remains on the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B, the planarization process may expose the mask <b>53</b> or remove the mask <b>53</b> such that top surfaces of the mask or the fins <b>52</b>A/<b>52</b>B, respectively, and the insulation material <b>54</b> are level after the planarization process is complete.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at least a portion of the fin <b>52</b>B is removed using an acceptable etching process, for example. Thus, an opening <b>55</b> is formed in the isolation material <b>54</b> between the fins <b>52</b>A. In subsequent processes, a dummy channel region may be formed in the opening <b>55</b>. The fin <b>52</b>B may be completely removed or a portion of the fin <b>52</b>B may remain under the opening <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; is formed in the opening <b>55</b>. The dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may comprise one or more layers of a silicon-based material (e.g., SiN, SiON, SiOCN, SiC, SiOC, SiO<sub>2</sub>, or the like), a metal-based material (e.g., a metal oxide, metal nitride, or the like such as TaN, TaO, HfO, or the like), and/or the like. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; as being a single material, the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may comprise multiple layers of materials, which may be stacked vertically and/or horizontally. For example, in some embodiments, a first layer of the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may line sidewalls and a lateral surface of a second layer of the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032;. As a further example, a third layer of the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may be disposed on top of the second layer of the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032;. In some embodiments, a width W of the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may be in the range of about 5 &#x212b; to about 500 &#x212b;.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may be formed using one or more deposition processes, such as CVD, plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD), plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD), ALD, PVD, or the like. In embodiments where the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; comprises a multilayer structure, forming the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may also include one or more etch back and/or planarization steps before additional material layer(s) of the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; are deposited. Further, the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; may be deposited to initially cover the insulation material <b>54</b>, and a planarization, etch back, or the like process may be used to remove excess portions of the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; and expose the insulation material <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the insulation material <b>54</b> is recessed to form Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) regions <b>56</b>. The insulation material <b>54</b> is recessed such that upper portions of fins <b>52</b>A and the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; protrude from between neighboring STI regions <b>56</b>. Further, the top surfaces of the STI regions <b>56</b> may have a flat surface as illustrated, a convex surface, a concave surface (such as dishing), or a combination thereof. The top surfaces of the STI regions <b>56</b> may be formed flat, convex, and/or concave by an appropriate etch. The STI regions <b>56</b> may be recessed using an acceptable etching process, such as one that is selective to the material of the insulation material <b>54</b> (e.g., etches the material of the insulation material <b>54</b> at a faster rate than the material of the fins <b>52</b>). For example, an oxide removal using, for example, dilute hydrofluoric (dHF) acid may be used. Recessing the insulation material <b>54</b> may use a process that is selectively etches the insulation material <b>54</b> compared to the dummy fin <b>52</b>&#x2032; (if present).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The process described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> through <b>7</b></figref> is just one example of how the fins <b>52</b>A may be formed. In some embodiments, the fins may be formed by an epitaxial growth process. For example, a dielectric layer can be formed over a top surface of the substrate <b>50</b>, and trenches can be etched through the dielectric layer to expose the underlying substrate <b>50</b>. Homoepitaxial structures can be epitaxially grown in the trenches, and the dielectric layer can be recessed such that the homoepitaxial structures protrude from the dielectric layer to form fins. Additionally, in some embodiments, heteroepitaxial structures can be used for the fins <b>52</b>A. For example, the fins <b>52</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> can be recessed, and a material different from the fins <b>52</b>A may be epitaxially grown over the recessed fins <b>52</b>A. In such embodiments, the fins <b>52</b>A comprise the recessed material as well as the epitaxially grown material disposed over the recessed material. In an even further embodiment, a dielectric layer can be formed over a top surface of the substrate <b>50</b>, and trenches can be etched through the dielectric layer. Heteroepitaxial structures can then be epitaxially grown in the trenches using a material different from the substrate <b>50</b>, and the dielectric layer can be recessed such that the heteroepitaxial structures protrude from the dielectric layer to form the fins <b>52</b>A. In some embodiments where homoepitaxial or heteroepitaxial structures are epitaxially grown, the epitaxially grown materials may be in situ doped during growth, which may obviate prior and subsequent implantations although in situ and implantation doping may be used together.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Still further, it may be advantageous to epitaxially grow a material in region <b>50</b>N (e.g., an NMOS region) different from the material in region <b>50</b>P (e.g., a PMOS region). In various embodiments, upper portions of the fins <b>52</b>A may be formed from silicon-germanium (Si<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>1-x</sub>, where x can be in the range of 0 to 1), silicon carbide, pure or substantially pure germanium, a III-V compound semiconductor, a II-VI compound semiconductor, or the like. For example, the available materials for forming III-V compound semiconductor include, but are not limited to, indium arsenide, aluminum arsenide, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium nitride, indium gallium arsenide, indium aluminum arsenide, gallium antimonide, aluminum antimonide, aluminum phosphide, gallium phosphide, and the like.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, appropriate wells (not shown) may be formed in the fins <b>52</b>A and/or the substrate <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, a P well may be formed in the region <b>50</b>N, and an N well may be formed in the region <b>50</b>P. In some embodiments, a P well or an N well are formed in both the region <b>50</b>N and the region <b>50</b>P.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiments with different well types, the different implant steps for the region <b>50</b>N and the region <b>50</b>P may be achieved using a photoresist or other masks (not shown). For example, a photoresist may be formed over the fins <b>52</b>A and the STI regions <b>56</b> in the region <b>50</b>N. The photoresist is patterned to expose the region <b>50</b>P of the substrate <b>50</b>, such as a PMOS region. The photoresist can be formed by using a spin-on technique and can be patterned using acceptable photolithography techniques. Once the photoresist is patterned, an n-type impurity implant is performed in the region <b>50</b>P, and the photoresist may act as a mask to substantially prevent n-type impurities from being implanted into the region <b>50</b>N, such as an NMOS region. The n-type impurities may be phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or the like implanted in the region to a concentration of equal to or less than 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, such as between about 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>and about 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. After the implant, the photoresist is removed, such as by an acceptable ashing process.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Following the implanting of the region <b>50</b>P, a photoresist is formed over the fins <b>52</b>A and the STI regions <b>56</b> in the region <b>50</b>P. The photoresist is patterned to expose the region <b>50</b>N of the substrate <b>50</b>, such as the NMOS region. The photoresist can be formed by using a spin-on technique and can be patterned using acceptable photolithography techniques. Once the photoresist is patterned, a p-type impurity implant may be performed in the region <b>50</b>N, and the photoresist may act as a mask to substantially prevent p-type impurities from being implanted into the region <b>50</b>P, such as the PMOS region. The p-type impurities may be boron, boron fluoride, indium, or the like implanted in the region to a concentration of equal to or less than 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, such as between about 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>and about 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. After the implant, the photoresist may be removed, such as by an acceptable ashing process.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the implants of the region <b>50</b>N and the region <b>50</b>P, an anneal may be performed to repair implant damage and to activate the p-type and/or n-type impurities that were implanted.
