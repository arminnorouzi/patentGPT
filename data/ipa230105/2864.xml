Magnesium in solid solution is effective in strengthening aluminum alloys, and magnesium-containing aluminum alloys are relatively inert because magnesium oxide that forms at the surface creates a barrier to corrosion. For example, 5xxx series aluminum alloys are generally considered relatively inert to seawater corrosion and thus are particularly useful in marine construction or offshore applications. 7xxx series aluminum alloys also demonstrate good corrosion resistance in most environments. Nonetheless, 5xxx series aluminum alloys containing relatively high content of magnesium (e.g., 3 wt. % or greater) as an alloying element, as well as 7xxx series aluminum alloys containing low or no copper and 7xxx series aluminum alloys or containing relatively high combined content of zinc, magnesium, and copper (e.g., 6 wt. % or greater), can experience stress corrosion cracking over time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Stress corrosion cracking usually occurs at the grain boundaries where stress corrosion cracks may make a trans granular path, especially at the later stages when the failure is more mechanical than corrosive. The start of the cracks requires an indentation in the metal, such as a deep pit or an etched grain boundary. The growth of the cracks generally starts slow, but then transforms and becomes rapid. Roughly, about 70% to about 90% of the time to failure is for nucleation of the crack. Cracks can also be triggered when vacancies or dislocations pile up.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Tension (i.e., stress) is often a prerequisite for stress corrosion, and in bent samples, the cracking almost always starts in the tension side. The corrosion rate is generally proportional to the load, such that the higher the load the shorter the life. In wrought products, the direction of the load in relation to the grain orientation is important. A load, applied in the short transverse direction, can be less than one-fifth of that for the long transverse or longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The denuded zones near the grain boundary and sub boundaries can play an important role in crack generation. Crack initiation may be tied to the denuded zone around the grain boundary, which may remain super saturated the longest with the greatest electronegativity with respect to the matrix balance. The precipitates at the edge of the grain may advance the crack (like postage stamp perforations), but the electronegativity in the denuded region may be responsible for the crack initiation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Stress corrosion susceptibility may be related to oxide film ductility and crack growth rate. This stress corrosion susceptibility can be a result of the crack growth passivation rate: if the crack grows faster than passivation occurs, failure ensues. Corrosion without stress tends to accelerate the eventual stress corrosion crack rate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Structure can also be an important influence on stress corrosion cracking. Fine grain size decreases susceptibility, but a large number of sub-boundaries may produce a much larger improvement in resistance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Stress corrosion cracking of aluminum alloys containing magnesium can involve a condition where magnesium-containing precipitates at the edge of a recrystallized grain in conditions where increased temperature and/or time promotes the nucleation and growth of certain magnesium-containing precipitates, such as the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase particles for a 5xxx aluminum alloy or the MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase particles for a 7xxx aluminum alloy, at the recrystallized grain boundary to form a semi-continuous string, similar to a string of pearls. The relative electronegativity of the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase or the MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase with respect to the surrounding material in the grain creates a corrosion event near the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase or the MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase particles. Eventually, the corrosion cells, coupled with the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase or the MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase, forms weak areas in the microstructure that crack or tear, similar to how perforations formed between postage stamps can be used to guide their separation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Depending on the precipitates out of the matrix, the precipitate particles may or may not be continuous, or may be separated or scattered. However, the crack may nonetheless propagate and compromise the integrity and eventually cause the failure of the alloy structure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term embodiment and like terms are intended to refer broadly to all of the subject matter of this disclosure and the claims below. Statements containing these terms should be understood not to limit the subject matter described herein or to limit the meaning or scope of the claims below. Embodiments of the present disclosure covered herein are defined by the claims below, not this summary. This summary is a high-level overview of various aspects of the disclosure and introduces some of the concepts that are further described in the Detailed Description section below. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter. The subject matter should be understood by reference to appropriate portions of the entire specification of this disclosure, any or all drawings and each claim.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Described herein are stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy products. The aluminum alloy products described herein advantageously exhibit good resistance to corrosion through the inclusion of calcium, strontium, and/or silver in the alloy, which allows the aluminum alloy products to resist crack formation and growth and fracture while under stress in corrosive environments. Stress corrosion cracking resistance and classification of metals, such as aluminum alloys, can be determined according to various standard test methods, such as ASTM G139-05(2015), Standard Test Method for Determining Stress-Corrosion Cracking Resistance of Heat-Treatable Aluminum Alloy Products Using Breaking Load Method, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, Pa., 2015, or ASTM G64-99(2013), Standard Classification of Resistance to Stress-Corrosion Cracking of Heat-Treatable Aluminum Alloys, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, Pa., 2013, ASTM G47-98(2019), Standard Test Method for Determining Susceptibility to Stress-Corrosion Cracking of 2XXX and 7XXX Aluminum Alloy Products, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, Pa., 2019, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, the inclusion of calcium, strontium, and/or silver in the alloy provides a level of corrosion resistance to magnesium containing aluminum alloys beyond that achievable by the inclusion of other alloying elements in the aluminum alloy. An example stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product comprises a plurality of alloying elements, including: 3 wt. % to 10 wt. % magnesium or 6 wt. % to 15 wt. % zinc, magnesium, and copper combined, and 0.001 wt. % to 0.1 wt. % calcium; and aluminum. In some embodiments, the stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product further comprises 0.001 wt. % to 0.1 wt. % strontium. In some embodiments, the stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product further comprises 0.001 wt. % to 0.1 wt. % silver. In embodiments, aluminum constitutes a remainder of the stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product (i.e., a remainder of the alloy beyond the alloying elements and any unavoidable impurities). The aluminum alloy may be in any suitable temper, such as an H temper or a T temper, which may be dependent upon the particular aluminum alloy used. Example aluminum alloys include 5xxx series aluminum alloys and 7xxx series aluminum alloys. Optionally, the plurality of alloying elements does not include zinc; that is, in some cases, the alloy does not contain zinc or only contains zinc in trace amounts or as unavoidable impurities. Optionally, the plurality of alloying elements further comprises zinc, such as in an amount of from 0.1 wt. % to 15 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy products described herein can be prepared and processed according to any suitable methods. In embodiments, a stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product is prepared by casting an aluminum alloy comprising aluminum, 3 wt. % to 10 wt. % magnesium or 6 wt. % to 15 wt. % zinc, magnesium, and copper combined, and 0.001 wt. % to 0.01 wt. % calcium. Optionally, the cast aluminum product is subjected to one or more hot rolling processes and/or one or more cold rolling processes. Other example processes may include, but are not limited to, homogenization processes, heat treatment processes, aging processes, or the like.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In embodiments, magnesium containing aluminum alloys may contain magnesium-containing precipitates, which may correspond to intermetallic particles. Example magnesium-containing precipitates include, Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase particles and MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase particles. The presence of the different magnesium-containing precipitates may depend upon the particular alloy and processing conditions. Magnesium-containing precipitates may, in some cases, serve as corrosion initiation sites and allow for corrosion to propagate and for stress corrosion cracking to be problematic. By including calcium in the aluminum alloys, the presence or concentrations of magnesium-containing precipitates may be limited or reduced and/or the corrosion potential of the magnesium-containing precipitates may be reduced. In some embodiments, a stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product comprises less than 0.05 wt. % of magnesium-containing precipitates, such as Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase particles or MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase particles. In some cases, magnesium-containing precipitates may also comprise Zn.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As noted above, the presence of magnesium-containing precipitates may be dictated by the specific composition of an aluminum alloy as well as the processing conditions by which the aluminum alloy is made. In some embodiments, magnesium-containing precipitates in a stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product may be formed through exposure to a temperature of from 50&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. Optionally, the magnesium-containing precipitates are formed during aging of an aluminum alloy product.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By including calcium, strontium, and/or silver in the alloy, calcium, strontium, and/or silver may be present in magnesium-containing precipitates and/or may modify the composition of the magnesium-containing precipitates as compared to alloys where calcium, strontium, and/or silver may only be present in trace amounts. Inclusion of calcium, strontium, and/or silver in a magnesium-containing precipitate may lower the corrosion potential of the magnesium-containing precipitate as compared to magnesium-containing precipitates that do not include calcium, strontium, and/or silver. Optionally, a presence of the calcium, strontium, and/or silver in the aluminum alloy product reduces an amount of the magnesium-containing precipitates in the stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product as referenced to a comparable aluminum alloy product comprising 3 wt. % to 10 wt. % magnesium or 6 wt. % to 15 wt. % zinc, magnesium, and copper combined, and less than 0.001 wt. % calcium, strontium, and/or silver and subjected to identical processing conditions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">When calcium, strontium, and/or silver are present in an aluminum alloy, precipitates containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver may develop at grain boundaries. Optionally, a stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy product may comprise one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver at grain boundaries of the aluminum alloy product. In some cases, the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver may be produced by exposure to an elevated temperature of from 50&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. and/or by aging. Optionally, the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises calcium metal, strontium metal, and/or silver metal. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises calcium and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises strontium and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises silver and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises calcium and aluminum. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises strontium and aluminum. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises silver and aluminum. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises calcium, aluminum, and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises strontium, aluminum, and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises calcium, strontium, aluminum, and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises calcium, silver, aluminum, and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises strontium, silver, aluminum, and magnesium. Optionally, one phase of the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver comprises calcium, strontium, silver, aluminum, and magnesium. In some cases, the one or more phases containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver may at least partially surround magnesium-containing precipitates located at the grain boundaries, which may optionally limit or reduce the corrosion potential of the magnesium-containing precipitates.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, methods of making stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloy products are described. An example method of this aspect comprises providing an aluminum alloy in a molten state as a molten aluminum alloy, such as an aluminum alloy that comprises aluminum, 3 wt. % to 10 wt. % magnesium or 6 wt. % to 15 wt. % zinc, magnesium, and copper combined, and 0.001 wt. % to 0.1 wt. % calcium; and casting the molten aluminum alloy to form an aluminum alloy product. Other processing techniques may also be employed in the methods of this aspect. For example, methods of this aspect may optionally comprise one or more of homogenizing the aluminum alloy product to form a homogenized aluminum alloy product; aging the aluminum alloy product; cold rolling the aluminum alloy product; hot rolling the aluminum alloy product; subjecting the aluminum alloy product to an elevated temperature; or subjecting the aluminum alloy product to a corrosive environment. Advantageously, the stress corrosion cracking-resistant aluminum alloys described herein may be useful in marine environments or other high corrosion or corrosion susceptible environments.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Advantageously a presence of calcium, strontium, and/or silver in the aluminum alloy product may increase an amount of time needed to induce stress corrosion cracks in the aluminum alloy product as referenced to a comparable aluminum alloy product comprising 3 wt. % to 10 wt. % magnesium or 6 wt. % to 15 wt. % zinc, magnesium, and copper combined, and less than 0.001 wt. % calcium, strontium, and/or silver.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description of non-limiting examples.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The specification makes reference to the following appended figures, in which use of like reference numerals in different figures is intended to illustrate like or analogous components.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> schematically illustrates the formation of magnesium-containing precipitates at grain boundaries.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> schematically illustrates corrosion occurring near magnesium-containing precipitates particles at grain boundaries.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides an overview of an exemplary method of making an aluminum alloy product.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Described herein are aluminum alloy products and systems and methods of making and using aluminum alloy products.

Magnesium in solid solution is effective in strengthening the aluminum alloys, and the alloys are also relatively inert because magnesium oxide that forms at the surface creates a barrier to corrosion. However, aluminum alloys having a magnesium, such as a relatively high content magnesium in the case of certain 5xxx aluminum alloys or a relatively high combined content of zinc, magnesium, and copper in the case of certain 7xxx aluminum alloys, may, nonetheless, experience stress corrosion cracking.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Stress corrosion cracking of aluminum alloys containing magnesium involves a condition where magnesium-containing particles precipitate at the edge of a recrystallized grain at increased temperature and/or over time, which promotes the nucleation and growth of Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase particles or MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase particles at the recrystallized grain boundary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> schematically illustrates a grain structure of a magnesium-containing aluminum alloy and shows the presence of the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase particles 105 at the grain boundaries 110. The relative electronegativity of the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase with respect to the surrounding material in the grain may generate a corrosion event near the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase particles. Eventually, the corrosion cells, coupled with the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase, may form weak areas 115 in the microstructure, as schematically illustrated in the grain structure depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, which may crack or tear under stress. Similar corrosion behavior may be observed in aluminum alloys with discontinuous precipitation of MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase along grain boundaries. Although Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>and MgZn<sub>2 </sub>are described as exemplary magnesium-containing precipitates or magnesium-containing intermetallic compounds that may form particles at the grain boundaries, other magnesium-containing phases or compounds, such as Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>3 </sub>or others, may also be formed at the grain boundaries of the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloy and/or may make the alloy susceptible to stress corrosion cracking.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the case of 5xxx aluminum alloys, precipitation of magnesium at grain boundaries, such as formation of Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase particles at grain boundaries, may be more prominent when the magnesium content is 3 wt. % or higher, and the Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase may optionally form a semi-continuous string of particles along some grain boundaries. However, depending on the processing and/or operating conditions, magnesium precipitation, such as Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>beta phase formation, may also occur when the magnesium content is below 3 wt. %. Depending on the magnesium content, the magnesium-containing precipitates may or may not be continuous, or may be separated or scattered. However, cracks may nonetheless propagate and compromise strength, and may eventually cause failure of the alloy product.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the case of 7xxx aluminum alloys, precipitation of magnesium at grain boundaries, such as formation of MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase particles at grain boundaries, may be more prominent when a combined content of magnesium zinc, magnesium, and copper is 6 wt. % or higher, and the MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase may optionally form a semi-continuous string of particles along some grain boundaries. However, depending on the processing and/or operating conditions, magnesium precipitation, such as MgZn<sub>2 </sub>eta phase formation, may also occur when the combined content of zinc, magnesium, and copper is below 6 wt. %. Depending on the magnesium content, the magnesium-containing precipitates may or may not be continuous, or may be separated or scattered. However, cracks may nonetheless propagate and compromise strength, and may eventually cause failure of the alloy product.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Increased or elevated temperatures may lead to the growth of the magnesium-containing precipitates, such as temperatures from 50&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the elevated temperature that may lead to the growth of the magnesium-containing precipitates, such as Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>or MgZn<sub>2 </sub>may not be very high, and may be below 200&#xb0; C., such as below 150&#xb0; C., below 100&#xb0; C., below 50&#xb0; C., or even lower. Therefore, heat treatment, if performed for magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloys, may be limited or require close control so as to limit the formation of the magnesium-containing precipitates. However, increases in temperature may not be avoided and/or may occur during subsequent handling of products made of various magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloys, such as during welding, paint baking, etc. Therefore, the magnesium-containing precipitates may inevitably form and create preferential corrosion sites which may eventually lead to stress corrosion cracking.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">To suppress stress corrosion cracking, calcium, strontium and/or silver may be added to magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloys to reduce corrosion that may otherwise occur at the grain boundaries due to the presence of the magnesium-containing precipitates when no calcium, strontium, and/or silver are added. By adding calcium, strontium, and/or silver, the growth of the magnesium-containing precipitates may be altered. Without intending to be bound to any particular theory, the inventors believe that, given a relatively low solubility in aluminum, calcium or strontium, or optionally silver, may precipitate, along with magnesium, at the grain boundaries when the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloy is subjected to an elevated temperature. The magnesium precipitate, the calcium precipitate, the strontium precipitate, and/or the silver precipitate may form one or more intermetallic compounds that may or may not include aluminum. The formation of intermetallic compounds containing magnesium, calcium, strontium, and/or silver may reduce the amount of magnesium that may otherwise form magnesium-containing precipitates, such as Mg<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>8 </sub>and/or MgZn<sub>2</sub>. The overall reduction in the magnesium-containing precipitates may lead to reduced corrosion at the grain boundaries, thereby suppressing or reducing the stress corrosion cracking phenomenon, such as when compared to magnesium-containing aluminum alloys that lack or only contain trace amounts of calcium, strontium, and/or silver. A trace amount of each of calcium, strontium, and/or silver may refer to an amount of each of calcium, strontium, and/or silver that may be less than 0.001 wt. %. Alternatively, the precipitates or particles containing calcium, strontium, and/or silver may coat and/or be positioned adjacent to the magnesium-containing precipitates that may be formed at the grain boundaries, thereby limiting the corrosion reaction between the magnesium-containing precipitates and the surrounding grains. The ductility of the oxide film at the crack tip may also be modified constructively by adding calcium and/or strontium. Additionally, calcium and/or strontium can vary or positively form a very stable pacifying layer in the region of the crack tip, reducing the overall growth rate of an initiated crack in a denuded region of the grain. Further, the calcium, strontium, and/or silver remaining in the grains may alter the electronegativity of the grains themselves and/or a relative electronegativity of the grains as compared to the magnesium-containing precipitates, and thus limit the corrosion that may occur where the magnesium-containing precipitates may be present.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Depending on the application, the amount of calcium that may be added to the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloy may range from 0.001% to 0.1% by weight.

Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a schematic illustration of a direct chill casting process, the aluminum alloys described herein can also be cast using a continuous casting process. A continuous casting system can include a pair of moving opposed casting surfaces (e.g., moving opposed belts, rolls, or blocks), a casting cavity between the pair of moving opposed casting surfaces, and a molten metal injector. The molten metal injector can have an end opening from which molten metal can exit the molten metal injector and be injected into the casting cavity.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The molten aluminum alloy <b>206</b> may include molten aluminum, magnesium, and calcium and optionally strontium or silver.

As discussed above, heat treatment for conventional magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloys may be avoided or may require close control, if performed, so as to limit the formation of the magnesium-containing precipitates, which eventually may lead to stress corrosion cracking. Accordingly, conventional magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloys are typically work hardened and are in an H condition or temper. In contrast, when calcium is added to the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloy as disclosed herein, the alloy may be significantly less susceptible to stress corrosion cracking as discussed above. Accordingly, the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloy including calcium as an alloying element may be work hardened and/or heat treated. The resultant alloy may be in an H temper or T temper, as appropriate. Suitable H tempers may include H1X, H2X, H3X, H4X, or the like, such as H111, H112, H115, H116, H12, H14, H16, H18, H19, H24, H26, H28, H32, H321, H323, H34, H343, H36, H38, etc. Suitable T tempers may include T1, T2, T3, T351, T352, T3510, T3511, T36, T361, T4, T42, T451, T4510, T4511, T5, T6, T62, T651, T6510, T6511, T7, T72, T73, T7351, T8, T81, T851, T8510, T8511, T9, T10, etc. Exemplary processing steps may include homogenization, hot rolling, cold rolling, annealing, solution heat treatment, pre-aging, or the like.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Some exemplary processing steps are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

For example, the product <b>207</b> can be heated to about 465&#xb0; C. for about 3.5 hours and then heated to about 480&#xb0; C. for about 6 hours.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Following the homogenization step, at step <b>215</b>, the homogenized aluminum alloy product <b>211</b> is subjected to one or more rolling passes to form a rolled aluminum alloy product <b>212</b>, which may correspond to an aluminum alloy article, such as an aluminum alloy plate, an aluminum alloy shate, or an aluminum alloy sheet that is coiled after rolling.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the case where a hot rolling step is performed, prior to hot rolling, the homogenized product <b>211</b> can be allowed to cool to a temperature such as between 300&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C. For example, the homogenized product <b>211</b> can be allowed to cool to a temperature of between 325&#xb0; C. to 425&#xb0; C. or from 350&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the cast product can be a continuously cast product that can be allowed to cool to a temperature between 300&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C. The product can then be hot rolled at a suitable temperature, such as between 300&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C., to form a hot rolled intermediate product such as a hot rolled plate, a hot rolled shate or a hot rolled sheet having a gauge between 3 mm and 200 mm (e.g., 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, 55 mm, 60 mm, 65 mm, 70 mm, 75 mm, 80 mm, 85 mm, 90 mm, 95 mm, 100 mm, 110 mm, 120 mm, 130 mm, 140 mm, 150 mm, 160 mm, 170 mm, 180 mm, 190 mm, 200 mm, or anywhere in between). During hot rolling, temperatures and other operating parameters can be controlled so that the temperature of the hot rolled intermediate product upon exit from the hot rolling mill is no more than 470&#xb0; C., no more than 450&#xb0; C., no more than 440&#xb0; C., or no more than 430&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The hot rolled product can then be cold rolled into a cold rolled product having a gauge between about 0.5 to 10 mm, e.g., between about 0.7 to 6.5 mm. Optionally, the cold rolled sheet can have a gauge of 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, 3.5 mm, 4.0 mm, 4.5 mm, 5.0 mm, 5.5 mm, 6.0 mm, 6.5 mm, 7.0 mm, 7.5 mm, 8.0 mm, 8.5 mm, 9.0 mm, 9.5 mm, or 10.0 mm. The cold rolling can be performed to result in a final gauge thickness that represents a gauge reduction of up to 85% (e.g., up to 10%, up to 20%, up to 30%, up to 40%, up to 50%, up to 60%, up to 70%, up to 80%, or up to 85% reduction) as compared to the hot rolled product. In some embodiments, an interannealing step can be performed during the cold rolling step. The interannealing step can be performed at a temperature of from about 300&#xb0; C. to about 450&#xb0; C. (e.g., about 310&#xb0; C., about 320&#xb0; C., about 330&#xb0; C., about 340&#xb0; C., about 350&#xb0; C., about 360&#xb0; C., about 370&#xb0; C., about 380&#xb0; C., about 390&#xb0; C., about 400&#xb0; C., about 410&#xb0; C., about 420&#xb0; C., about 430&#xb0; C., about 440&#xb0; C., or about 450&#xb0; C.). In some cases, the interannealing step comprises multiple processes. In some non-limiting examples, the interannealing step includes heating the cold rolled product to a first temperature for a first period of time followed by heating to a second temperature for a second period of time. For example, the cold rolled product can be heated to about 410&#xb0; C. for about 1 hour and then heated to about 330&#xb0; C. for about 2 hours.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, a rolled product can undergo a solution heat treatment step. The solution heat treatment step can be any treatment for the sheet which results in solutionizing of the soluble particles. Because the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloy with added calcium may be less susceptible to stress corrosion cracking, the solution heat treatment may be omitted. In the case where a solution heat treatment is performed, the rolled product can be heated to a peak metal temperature (PMT) of up to 590&#xb0; C. (e.g., from 400&#xb0; C. to 590&#xb0; C.) and soaked for a period of time at the temperature. For example, the rolled product can be soaked at 480&#xb0; C. for a soak time of up to 30 minutes (e.g., 0 seconds, 60 seconds, 75 seconds, 90 seconds, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, or 30 minutes). After heating and soaking, the product can be rapidly cooled at rates greater than 200&#xb0; C./s to a temperature between 500 and 200&#xb0; C. In one example, the product is subjected to a quench rate of above 200&#xb0; C./second at temperatures between 450&#xb0; C. and 200&#xb0; C. Optionally, the cooling rates can be faster in other cases.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After quenching, the heat treated product can optionally undergo a pre-aging treatment by reheating the product before coiling. The pre-aging treatment can be performed at a temperature of from about 70&#xb0; C. to about 125&#xb0; C. for a period of time of up to 6 hours. For example, the pre-aging treatment can be performed at a temperature of about 70&#xb0; C., about 75&#xb0; C., about 80&#xb0; C., about 85&#xb0; C., about 90&#xb0; C., about 95&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C., about 105&#xb0; C., about 110&#xb0; C., about 115&#xb0; C., about 120&#xb0; C., or about 125&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the pre-aging treatment can be performed for about 30 minutes, about 1 hour, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, or about 6 hours. The pre-aging treatment can be carried out by passing the plate, shate, or sheet through a heating device, such as a device that emits radiant heat, convective heat, induction heat, infrared heat, or the like.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The cast products described herein can be used to make products in the form of plates or other suitable products. For example, plates including the products as described herein can be prepared by processing an ingot in a homogenization step or casting a product in a continuous caster followed by a hot rolling step. In the hot rolling step, the cast product can be hot rolled to a 200 mm thick gauge or less (e.g., from about 10 mm to about 200 mm). For example, the cast product can be hot rolled to a plate having a final gauge thickness of about 10 mm to about 175 mm, about 15 mm to about 150 mm, about 20 mm to about 125 mm, about 25 mm to about 100 mm, about 30 mm to about 75 mm, or about 35 mm to about 50 mm.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As discussed above, the added calcium may alter or limit the formation of magnesium-containing precipitates at the grain boundaries when the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloy may be subjected to an elevated temperature. Accordingly, in addition to the heat treatment discussed above, the magnesium-strengthened aluminum alloys described herein may be further subjected to an elevated temperature, such as during welding, paint baking, etc., without increasing the risk of or susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking. Depending on the process, the elevated temperature may range from 50&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C.
