Some peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules, also referred to as lipopeptides, have been shown as potential candidates for use in a clinical procedure that allows tissue-specific cells to repair and regenerate the ECM whilst preventing the formation of scar tissue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">PAs are synthetic materials used for their ability to self-assemble in aqueous media at physiological pH into highly ordered nanostructures. Some of these nanostructures have been shown to have unique effects on cell viability and/or protein expression. For instance, 016-KTTKS lipopeptides, used under the trade name of Matrixyl, have been shown to stimulate collagen production in vitro in corneal and skin fibroblasts (Jones et al., 2013).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention aims to provide alternative and/or improved PAs with a variety of potential applications, for example in corneal tissue regeneration after injury, in vitro tissue biofabrication, or in skin care.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is based on the inventors' surprising finding that a C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide has a number of unexpected uses and advantages.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide has been previously considered bio-inert and has been used as a non-bioactive diluent molecule to assist with cell attachment by co-assembling lipopeptides with bioactive moieties (such as cell adhesion moieties for example RGD or RGDS).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a diluent, the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide is able to vary the density of the bioactive moieties within the supramolecular structure formed by assembled lipopeptides. The functional amino acid sequence of the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide was initially rationally designed as a non-bioactive diluent molecule able to optimise the distance between other neighbouring lipopeptide molecules (Castelletto et al., 2013). It was shown that by using the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide, the distance between neighbouring lipopeptides with cell adhesion moieties such as RGD or RGDS could be altered which allowed improved cell attachment to the cell adhesion moieties. A lipopeptide mixture comprising the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide was subsequently used in a RGDS:ETTES coating for 2D human corneal stromal fibroblast (hCSF) attachment and growth. The coating has been described to function not only as a support for hCSF adhesion but also as an effector in tuning the cell phenotype and preventing cell death in serum-free conditions. Specifically, results have indicated that the RGDS:ETTES coating not only increased hCSF adhesion and proliferation, but also enhanced the molecular and morphological phenotypes characteristic of hCSFs grown in serum-free conditions for long periods in culture. In this type of coating the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide was used only a diluent molecule, but was not shown to have any bioactive function.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Surprisingly, the present inventors have found that culturing cells in the presence of the 016-ETTES lipopeptide increases the amount of extracellular matrix such as collagen produced by the cells. This beneficial effect was observed by the inventors in cells such as stromal cells (for example corneal stromal cells), adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs), and myoblasts. Without wishing to be bound to a specific hypothesis, the inventors believe that the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptides are able to increase extracellular matrix (for example collagen) production by providing a nucleation point for extracellular collagen fibrilization and/or by acting as a ligand to a cell receptor (for example interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 receptor (IMPG1)). Additionally, the inventors have also found that culturing of cells in the presence of the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptide may inhibit cell migration.

The method may comprise the step of contacting the cell with lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As mentioned elsewhere in the present specification, the inventors have found that culturing of cells in the presence of lipopeptides substantially consisting of ETTES lipopeptides may inhibit cell migration. The inventors believe that there may be a direct relationship between increasing collagen production and decreasing cell migration. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the method for increasing collagen production may also be a method for inhibiting cell migration of a cell, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one example, the cell may be a cultured cell. This example gives rise to a further aspect of the invention, which relates to a method for increasing collagen, the method comprising the step of culturing the cell in the presence of an aqueous medium comprising suspended therein lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;collagen&#x201d; refers to the main protein of connective tissue that has a high tensile strength, and is found in most multicellular organisms. Collagen is a major fibrous protein, and it is also the nonfibrillar protein in basement membranes. It contains an abundance of glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine. In the context of the present disclosure, collagen includes any one or more types of collagen, whether native nor not, for example atelocollagen, insoluble collagen, collagen fibres, soluble collagen, and acid-soluble collagen. There are currently at least 28 types of collagen identified which are all encompassed herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Collagen may be for example fibrillar or non-fibrillar. Fibrillar collagen may be, for example, type I, II, III, V, Xl. Non-fibrillar collagen may be, for example, fibril associated collagen with interrupted triple helices (type IX, XII, XIV, XIX, XXI), short chain collagen (type VIII, X), basement membrane collagen (Type IV), multiplexin (XV, XVIII), membrane associated collagen with interrupted triple helices (type XIII, XVII), and collagen type VI and type VII. In one example, the collagen may be type I collagen or type III collagen.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It will be appreciated that the type of cells contacted with lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides, may influence the type of collagen produced. Examples of suitable cells are discussed elsewhere in the present specification. In one example, the cell may be in vivo or ex vivo. An ex vivo cell may be a cultured cell.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term &#x201c;increasing collagen production&#x201d; as used herein refers to an increase in the amount of collagen biosynthesised and/or secreted by cells. The increase may be by an amount of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100%, or more as compared to a suitable control. For example, it may mean an increase by at least 110%, at least 120%, at least 130%, at least 140%, at least 150%, at least 160%, at least 170%, at least 180%, at least 190%, at least 200%, or more as compared to a suitable control.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example, the collagen production may be increased by about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 100%, about 110%, about 120%, about 130%, about 140%, about 150%, about 160%, about 170%, about 180%, about 190%, or about 200%, as compared to a suitable control.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A suitable control may be, for example, a reference value based on the amount of collagen produced by cells not contacted with lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The term &#x201c;inhibiting cell migration&#x201d; as used herein refers to a partial or complete reduction of the cell's movement from a starting position to a new position. The inhibited cell movement may be spontaneous migration and/or directional migration towards specific chemo-attractants.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one example, cell migration may be inhibited if cell movement is reduced by least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or more, as compared to a suitable control. A suitable control may be, for example, a reference value based on the migration distance of a cell not contacted with lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides. Methods of determining cell migration will be well known to those skilled in the art. Merely by way of example, cell migration may be determined by a cell migration assay as explained in the Examples section of the present specification.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The term &#x201c;contacting&#x201d; as used herein refers to bringing the cell into proximity with the lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptides. Methods of contacting a cell will be known to those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that methods of contacting may depend upon whether the cell is in vivo or ex vivo (such as a cultured cell).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the context of an ex vivo cell, such as a cultured cell, &#x201c;contacting&#x201d; may mean providing the lipopeptides to a culture vessel (such as a tube, a flask, a dish or a plate comprising a plurality of wells, or the like) in which the cell is cultured. Providing the lipopeptides to the culture vessel in which the cell is cultured may also be referred to as &#x201c;culturing a cell in the presence of lipopeptides&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the context of an in vivo cell, contacting may mean providing the lipopeptides to a subject. The subject may be provided the lipopeptides for therapeutic or non-therapeutic reasons. Examples of therapeutic and non-therapeutic uses of the lipopeptides substantially consisting of C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES lipopeptides are discussed elsewhere in the present specification.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The term &#x201c;culturing&#x201d; as used herein refers to keeping cells in an artificial (e.g. in vitro or ex vivo) environment. Thus, &#x201c;a cultured cell&#x201d; is a cell that is kept in an artificial (e.g. in vitro or ex vivo) environment. Cells may be kept in an artificial environment without substantially increasing the cell number. Alternatively, cells may be kept in an artificial environment under conditions favouring proliferation, differentiation, and/or continued viability of the cells. Cells may be cultured for the purpose of cell bioprocessing. The term &#x201c;cell bioprocessing&#x201d; as used herein refers to producing a molecule of biological origin. The molecule of biological origin may be, for example, collagen. Accordingly, the method of increasing collagen production in a cell, may also be referred to as a method of bioprocessing a cell to produce collagen.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the context of the present specification the cell can be an individual cell or a population of cells, or a tissue, organ (for example skin) or organ system.

The aqueous medium may be cell culture medium, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or other saline solutions, or water. However, it will be appreciated that the term &#x201c;aqueous medium&#x201d; does not imply that water should always be the major constituent of the medium. The aqueous medium may be serum free.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The terms &#x201c;cell culture medium&#x201d; and &#x201c;culture medium&#x201d; (plural &#x201c;media&#x201d; in each case) refer to a nutritive solution for cultivating live cells and may be used interchangeably. The cell culture medium may be a complete formulation, i.e., a cell culture medium that requires no supplementation to culture cells, or may be an incomplete formulation, i.e., a cell culture medium that requires supplementation or may be a medium that may supplement an incomplete formulation or in the case of a complete formulation, may improve culture or culture results.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Various cell culture media will be known to those skilled in the art, who will also appreciate that the type of cells to be cultured may dictate the type of culture medium to be used.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Merely by way of example and not limitation, the culture medium may be selected from the group consisting of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), Ham's F-12 (F-12), Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), Basal Medium Eagle (BME), RPMI-1640, Ham's F-10, &#x3b1;Minimal Essential Medium (&#x3b1;MEM), Glasgow's Minimal Essential Medium (G-MEM), and Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium(IMDM), or any combination thereof.

For example, about 150 &#x3bc;M, about 200 &#x3bc;M, about 250 &#x3bc;M, about 300 &#x3bc;M, about 350 &#x3bc;M, about 400 &#x3bc;M, about 450 &#x3bc;M, about 500 &#x3bc;M, about 550 &#x3bc;M, about 600 &#x3bc;M, about 650 &#x3bc;M, about 700 &#x3bc;M, about 750 &#x3bc;M, about 800 &#x3bc;M, about 850 &#x3bc;M, about 900 &#x3bc;M, about 950 &#x3bc;M, about 1000 &#x3bc;M or more.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, the cell may be cultured in the presence of the ETTES lipopeptides, wherein the ETTES lipopeptides are at a concentration from about 0.1 &#x3bc;M to about 1000 &#x3bc;M, from about 0.5 &#x3bc;M to about 750 &#x3bc;M, or from about 1 &#x3bc;M to about 500 &#x3bc;M. For example, the cell may be cultured in the presence of the lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides are at a concentration from about 0.1 &#x3bc;M to about 10 &#x3bc;M or from about 0.5 &#x3bc;M to about 5 &#x3bc;M.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Methods of determining a suitable concentration will be known to those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that the mentioned concentrations of lipopeptides may be applicable in the context of the pharmaceutical composition described herein. In other words, the pharmaceutical composition described herein, may comprise lipopeptides substantially consisting of ETTES lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides are at these concentrations.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The term &#x201c;suspended&#x201d; as used herein means that the lipopeptides are fully or partially submerged in the aqueous medium. The submerged lipopeptides may be assembled into supramolecular structures, non-assembled lipopeptide molecules, or partially assembled lipopeptide molecules.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an example where the lipopeptides are in the form of supramolecular structures, the supramolecular structures may have been assembled in any suitable aqueous medium, for example water, or cell culture medium. The supramolecular structure may have any suitable topology. The type of medium in which the supramolecular structure has been assembled may influence the topology of the supramolecular structure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, when the supramolecular structure is assembled in a solvent having an ionic strength that is greater than the ionic strength of distilled water (such as cell culture medium), the supramolecular structure may have a globular topology resulting from aggregated structures. Herein such a supramolecular structure is referred to as a &#x201c;fibrillar supramolecular structure&#x201d;, &#x201c;globular supramolecular structure&#x201d; or &#x201c;aggregated supramolecular structure&#x201d;. Such a fibrillar supramolecular structure is topologically distinct from lipopeptide structures defined in the art which are assembled in water, and form fibrillar nanotapes having a width from about 5 to about 50 nm, rather than globules. The inventors believe that this new structure is formed as a result of the ionic strength of the solvent in which the lipopeptides self-assemble. The inventors hypothesise that the increased ionic strength of the solvent (compared to water) generates electrostatic attraction between the lipopeptides which changes how the lipopeptides assemble. These findings give rise to further aspects of the invention, which provide a fibrillar supramolecular structure, as well as a method of producing the fibrillar supramolecular structure. These aspects are described elsewhere in the present specification.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">By contrast, when the supramolecular structure is assembled in distilled water, the supramolecular structure does not have a globular topology. Such a supramolecular structure may have a fibre-like or fibrillar nanotape topology as known in the art. The present inventors have surprisingly found that in the context of ETTES lipopeptides, such a fibre-like supramolecular structure is particularly useful in the context of increasing collagen production in a cell, such a myoblast cell, for example a mouse myoblast cell. On other hand, a fibrillar supramolecular structure may be particularly useful in the context of increasing collagen production in a cell such as a stromal cell, a stromal progenitor cell and an adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell. The stromal cell may be for example a corneal stromal cell or a fibroblast, for example human corneal stromal cell or a fibroblast. By &#x201c;non-assembled lipopeptide molecules&#x201d; it is meant that substantially all of the lipopeptides are in the aqueous medium as individual molecules. By &#x201c;partially assembled lipopeptides&#x201d; it is meant that some of the lipopeptides have assembled into supramolecular structures whereas others are in the aqueous medium as individual molecules. When the lipopeptides are in the aqueous medium as individual molecules, some or all of the molecules may be dissolved in the aqueous medium.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Lipopeptides</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The term &#x201c;lipopeptide&#x201d; as used herein refers to an amphiphilic molecule comprising or consisting of a lipid portion and an amino acid portion. The terms &#x201c;lipopeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;amphiphilic molecule&#x201d;, &#x201c;peptide amphiphile&#x201d; and &#x201c;PA&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The amphiphilic properties enable a plurality of lipopeptides to self-assemble into the supramolecular structure. Lipopeptides are well known and their self-assembly properties are well characterised in the art (see for example Cui H. et al., <i>Biopolymers, </i>2010; 94(1): 1-18). Appropriate lipopeptides may therefore easily be identified by a person of skill in the art e.g. by testing their propensity to self-assemble under certain conditions and form supramolecular structures. Lipopeptide self-assembly and corresponding c.a.c. can be evaluated by the Thioflavin (ThT) and pyrene (Pyr) fluorescence spectroscopy methods. Fluorescence spectra are recorded with a Fluorescence Spectrometer. For the ThT assay, the spectra are typically recorded from 460 to 600 nm using an excitation wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>ex</sub>=440 nm and the lipopeptide dissolved in a 4-5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>% (w/v) ThT solution. For the Pyr assay, the spectra are typically recorded from 360 to 550 nm using an excitation wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>ex</sub>=339 nm. Pyr assays are performed using a 1-1.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>% (w/v) Pyr solution as a diluent. The Florescence intensity is plotted against a log of the lipopeptide concentration. The inflection point for the data denotes a change of environment for the ThT/Pyr molecule and is used to identify the c.a.c.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A lipopeptide nanostructure can be evaluated by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) using a field-emission cryo-electron microscope (e.g. JEOL JEM-3200FSC), AFM, or small-angle X-ray scattering. For cryo-TEM, vitrified specimens are prepared onto holey carbon copper grids with 3.5 &#x3bc;m hole size. A lipopeptide solution is applied to the grid and then vitrified in a 1/1 mixture of liquid ethane and propane at &#x2212;180&#xb0; C. The cryo-electron microscope is operated at &#x2212;187&#xb0; C. during the imaging. Lipopeptide solutions are heated from &#x2212;187&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. at &#x2dc;10-5 Pa, before being imaged at &#x2212;187&#xb0; C. The heating process from &#x2212;187 to &#x2212;60&#xb0; C., equivalent to a freeze drying process in the microscope, allows for the sublimation of the ice from the sample and removes the vitrified water. Images are taken using bright-field mode and zero-loss energy filtering (omega type) with a slit width 20 eV. Micrographs are recorded using a CCD camera (e.g. Gatan Ultrascan 4000).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The amino acid portion of the lipopeptide may be a natural or synthetic amino acid sequence. A natural amino acid sequence is one that exists in nature and encodes a protein or a fragment thereof. The natural amino acid sequence may encode a human, animal, plant, fungal, Protista, Archaea, and/or bacterial protein or fragment thereof. The fragment may comprise, for example, from about 3 to about 40 amino acids, such as from about 3 to about 20, or from about 3 to about 10 amino acids. The synthetic amino acid may be, for example, a variant of the natural amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the context of the present disclosure, an ETTES lipopeptide is a lipopeptide in which the amino acid portion comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence ETTES or a fragment or variant thereof. The term &#x201c;ETTES lipopeptide&#x201d; therefore encompasses all lipopeptides that comprise the ETTES amino acid sequence, as well as those with ETTES fragment sequences or ETTES variant sequences. For the avoidance of doubt, ETTES lipopeptides therefore do not necessarily have the fully ETTES amino acid sequence, but may comprise a fragment of the ETTES sequence, or a variant sequence instead. All such lipopeptides are encompassed by the term &#x201c;ETTES lipopeptide&#x201d; as used herein.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Without wishing to be bound by hypothesis, the inventors believe that the effect of the ETTES lipopeptide on collagen production and/or cell migration may be, at least partially, due to the negative charge of the ETTES amino acid sequence. Thus, in one example, the ETTES fragment or variant may have a negative charge. In one example, the ETTES fragment or variant may have substantially the same negative charge as the ETTES amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">An ETTES fragment is a peptide that is shorter than the corresponding ETTES amino acid sequence. An ETTES fragment may share 100% identity with the portion of the ETTES amino acid sequence that it corresponds to. The fragment may be at least 3 amino acid residues in length. For example, the fragment may be 3 or 4 amino acid residues in length. For example, the fragment may have a sequence selected from the group consisting of ETT, TTE, TES, ETTE and TTES. Suitably, the fragment may have the sequence ETTE. As mentioned in the Examples section, the inventors have shown that peptides comprising fragments of ETTES amino acid sequences may also increase collagen production while increasing, maintaining, or reducing cell proliferation, depending on cell type and formulation method. Suitably, when the amino acid portion comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence ETTE, the lipid portion may be C16. Such a lipopeptide may be referred to as a C<sub>16</sub>-ETTE lipopeptide.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein, the term &#x201c;variant&#x201d; refers to an amino acid sequence in which one or more amino acids have been replaced by different amino acids as compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence. Accordingly, an ETTES variant refers to an amino acid sequence in which one or more amino acids have been replaced by different amino acids as compared to the ETTES amino acid sequence. For example, the variant may be selected from the group consisting of ETETS, TTEES, SEETT, SETET, TESTE, or any one of the aforementioned variants wherein any one or more glutamate (E) residues is substituted with an aspartic acid (D) residue.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is well understood in the art that some amino acids may be changed to others with broadly similar properties without changing the nature of the activity of the peptide (conservative substitutions). Generally, the substitutions which are likely to produce the greatest changes in a peptide's properties are those in which (a) a hydrophilic residue (e.g., Ser or Thr) is substituted for, or by, a hydrophobic residue (e.g. Leu, lie, Phe or Val); (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for, or by, any other residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain (e.g., Arg, His or Lys) is substituted for, or by, an electronegative residue (e.g., Glu or Asp) or (d) a residue having a bulky side chain (e.g., Phe or Trp) is substituted for, or by, one having a smaller side chain (e.g., Ala, Ser) or no side chain (e.g., Gly).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one example, the amino acid portion does not comprise a cell adhesion moiety, meaning that the amino acid portion will not comprise an extracellular matrix protein motif, or a fragment or variant thereof, that is involved in cell adhesion.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the context of the present disclosure, the fragment or variant may substantially retain the biological function of the corresponding sequence.

Indeed, the fragment or variant may have a higher biological function than the corresponding ETTES sequence. The fragment or variant may have 110%, 120%, 130%, 140%, 150%, 160%, 170%, 180%, 190%, 200%, or more, of the biological function of the corresponding ETTES sequence. The biological function may be, for example, the ability to increase collagen production in a cell and/or inhibit cell migration. Methods of determining whether a fragment or variant has the ability to increase collagen production in a cell and/or inhibit cell migration will be known to those skilled in the art.

Such a clinical improvement may be demonstrated by an improvement of the pathology and/or symptoms associated with the diseases. Symptoms associated with a collagen deficiency disease may include fatigue, muscle weakness, body aches, joint pain, and/or a skin rash. Symptoms associated with cancer may include, for example, fever, fatigue, weight loss. In the context of cancer, clinical improvement of the pathology may be demonstrated by one or more of the following: reduced biomarker levels in the subject, increased time to regrowth of cancer upon stopping of treatment, lack of regrowth of cancer upon stopping treatment, decreased tumour invasiveness, reduction or complete elimination of metastasis, increased cancer cell differentiation, or increased survival rate.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; encompasses not only the therapeutic use of lipopeptides in a subject with the symptoms of a collagen deficiency disease, but also the use of lipopeptides in the treatment of a subject who does not exhibit the symptoms of the disease. Such uses may be of particular relevance to an asymptomatic subject, for example, known to carry a mutation which increases the subject's likelihood of developing a collagen deficiency disease.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">As used herein, the term &#x201c;wound&#x201d; refers to damage or loss to any one or combination of skin layers caused by cuts, incisions (including surgical incisions), abrasions, microbial infections, diseases or disorders, necrotic lesions, lacerations, fractures, contusions, burns and amputations. Non-limiting examples of wounds can include bed sores, thin dermis, bullous skin disease, and other cutaneous pathologies, such as subcutaneous exposed wounds that extend below the skin into the subcutaneous tissue. In some instances, a subcutaneous exposed wound may not affect underlying bones or organs.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The phrase &#x201c;enhancing wound healing&#x201d; as used herein refers to improving the natural cellular processes of tissue repair such that healing is faster, and/or the resulting healed area has less scaring, and/or the wounded area possesses tissue strength that is closer to that of uninjured tissue, and/or the wounded tissue attains some degree of functional recovery.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The term &#x201c;providing&#x201d; as used herein encompasses any techniques by which the subject receives a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the lipopeptides. Exemplary routes of administration are discussed elsewhere in the present specification. It will be appreciated that preferred routes of administration will depend on the diseases, or type and/or location of wound.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an amount of the pharmaceutical composition, that when provided to the subject, it is sufficient to increase the amount of collagen in a subject and thereby treat a collagen deficiency disease, enhance wound healing in a subject, and/or inhibit cell migration.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">It will be appreciated that the therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on various factors, such as the subject's body weight, sex, diet and route by which the lipopeptides are administered.

Alternatively, the subject may be asymptomatic but at risk of developing such symptoms. In one example, the subject may be an individual diagnosed with a collagen deficiency disease, for example collagen vascular disease, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, or temporal arteritis. Alternatively, the individual may have a wound. An individual who may benefit from inhibited cell migration may be diagnosed with cancer.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">As mentioned above, the present invention provides use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides. The use may be therapeutic (as described hereinabove) or non-therapeutic (for example cosmetic).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;cosmetic&#x201d; refers to interventions performed with the intention of addressing (e.g. improving, preventing or regulating) a non-pathological condition in a subject, such as the signs of aging on the subject's skin. Accordingly, cosmetic treatments may be used to restore or improve the appearance of a subject. The subject's appearance may be restored or improved for example by reducing or preventing skin wrinkles, reducing or preventing skin hyperpigmentation and/or increasing skin elasticity or preventing loss of skin elasticity. It will be appreciated that these effects may be achieved by increasing the amount of collagen production by the subject's cells. Thus, in the context of cosmetic uses, the subject may be any individual wishing to restore or improve their appearance.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">It will be appreciated that non-therapeutic uses are not limited to cosmetic uses. Other uses of the lipopeptides substantially consisting of ETTES lipopeptides, or compositions comprising lipopeptides substantially consisting of ETTES lipopeptides are also contemplated herein. Merely by way of example, lipopeptides substantially consisting of ETTES lipopeptides or compositions comprising such lipopeptides may be used in an in vitro method for producing tissue. Such a method may be particularly useful in the context of producing meat or other nutritional products. In one example, the in vitro produced tissue is non-human. It will be appreciated that the usefulness of the ETTES lipopeptides or compositions comprising such lipopeptides as described herein, in producing tissue may be due to the ability of the lipopeptides to increase collagen production. Such an increase in collagen production may therefore enhance tissue (for example meat) production as compared to methods that don't employ such lipopeptides. Suitably, the ETTES lipopeptides or compositions comprising such lipopeptides as described, may be used in a method for producing tissue in vitro (such as meat), wherein the method comprises increasing collagen production in a cell by culturing the cell with lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides. The ETTES lipopeptides or compositions comprising such lipopeptides as described herein may be used in other settings, where an increase in collagen production is desired.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">&#x201c;A Supramolecular Structure&#x201d;</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The term &#x201c;supramolecular structure&#x201d; are used herein refers to an aggregate comprising lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The aggregated lipopeptides may form a plurality of fused fibrils.

The structure may be made up of uniformly and/or non-uniformly shaped fibrils. Within the structure, the fibrils may be of substantially the same size or of different size.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">A plurality of fibrils present in the structure are fused together. For example, at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more fibrils may be fused together to form the supramolecular structure.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The fibrillar supramolecular structure may form dense globular deposits.

It will be appreciated that density can be determined using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) or AFM, by analysing the total area occupied by structures formed in different conditions. Details of other appropriate methods are also well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In one example, the fibrillar supramolecular structures generated herein using solvents with high ionic strength may have a density of fibrils that is at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50% higher than the density of fibrils in a supramolecular structure generated using the same lipopeptides with water. For example, the fibrillar supramolecular structures generated herein may have a density of fibrils that is at least 40% higher than the density of fibrils in a supramolecular structure generated using the same lipopeptides with water.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">As will be appreciated by a person of skill in the art, in the context of this specification, when a comparison is made to a supramolecular structure generated using water as the solvent, the water that is meant is distilled water.

Examples of a suitable aqueous medium are provided elsewhere in the present specification. Merely by way of example, the aqueous medium may be cell culture medium or water. The cell culture medium may be serum free. It will be appreciated that when the aqueous medium is water, the fibrillar supramolecular structure would have been assembled in a solvent having a high ionic strength and subsequently transferred to the water. If on the other hand, the aqueous medium is, for example, cell culture medium, the supramolecular structure may have been assembled in the cell culture medium it is provided in.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In a further aspect, provided herein is a surface, wherein immobilised in or on the surface are lipopeptides, wherein the lipopeptides substantially consist of ETTES lipopeptides.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The term &#x201c;surface&#x201d; as used herein refers to an area on which cells may be cultured.

By way of example, a surface may be coated by drop-spotting on the surface and homogenously distributing a solution comprising the lipopeptides (such as ETTES lipopeptides), followed by drying the surface to form a thin film of self-assembled fibrillar supramolecular structure. In an example, the fibrillar supramolecular structure may be immobilised on a 2D surface, such as a cover slip, or a surface of a culture vessel such as a tube, a flask, a dish or a plate comprising a plurality of wells.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">The fibrillar supramolecular structure may be immobilised in the surface for cell culture.

Significance between groups was established for p&#x3c;0.05, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Results</heading><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Firstly, the topography of the C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES PA was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to analyse the organisation of the self-assembled nanostructures, and compare its structure when self-assembled in either water or a cationic medium (SFM). The results showed that C<sub>16</sub>-ETTES self-assembled in medium presented a distinct structure to that observed in water, with much bigger and less defined nanotape networks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). These results confirmed the presence of supramolecular self-assembled structures in medium with a gross difference in structure when compared to water (which in turn indicate a different biological activity and/or function).</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">The effect of the PA on cell proliferation, migration, and collagen production was also evaluated. Firstly, the impact of the different PA formulations was tested on hCSF cultures over the course of 7 days. PA molecules solubilised in a cationic solvent (serum-free medium, or SFM) or water, and then added to fresh SFM at 50 and 500 &#x3bc;M and compared with negative controls (0 &#x3bc;M). Results showed that, up to 500 &#x3bc;M, ETTES solubilised in a cationic solvent did not affect cell proliferation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>) whereas equivalent concentrations of PA initially solubilised in water showed to significantly reduce cell number over time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>). These differences were due to the strong cytotoxicity of ETTES solubilised in water, as evidenced by live/dead cell staining assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>). Specifically, hCSFs cultures with ETTES solubilised in SFM maintained high viability up to 7 days, whereas those treated with PA prepared in water dramatically reduced cell viability (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>). Furthermore, ETTES solubilised in SFM at 500 &#x3bc;M significantly increased collagen production, both in bulk (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>) and per individual cell (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b </i>and <i>c</i></figref>). Finally, the impact of ETTES on the migration of hCSFs was tested using a cell scratch model. At 50 &#x3bc;M, ETTES significantly reduced cell migration compared to control conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>). In addition, collagen production in scratches treated with ETTES was significantly increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>). Moreover, these effects were comparable with those produced by Matrixyl (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Altogether, results demonstrated the correlation between cell motility and collagen production, thus cells that are secreting/depositing collagen appear to decrease their migration rate. This was observed in a similar study growing cells on RGD coatings (Gouveia et al., 2013).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The impact of the different PA formulations was also tested on human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) cultures over the course of 7 days. As in previous assays, PA molecules were solubilised in a cationic solvent (SFM) or water, and then added to fresh SFM at 50 and 500 &#x3bc;M and compared with negative controls (0 &#x3bc;M). Results showed that, up to 500 &#x3bc;M, ETTES solubilised in a cationic solvent affected cell viability and proliferation, whereas ETTES solubilised in water maintained it. Furthermore, ETTES solubilised in water up to 500 &#x3bc;M significantly increased collagen production, both in bulk (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>) and per individual cell (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>). Similar results were obtained when treating C2C12 myoblasts with ETTES, with PA self-assembled in water and diluted in SFM at 25 &#x3bc;M significantly promoting cell proliferation and collagen deposition, whereas, at equivalent concentrations, ETTES initially solubilised in SFM was toxic to cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">Furthermore, the results presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> to <b>13</b></figref> confirm that the inventors' findings are not limited to ETTES lipopeptides comprising the full ETTES peptide sequence and a C16 lipid portion. The inventors have also observed an increase in collagen production with C16-ETTES PA variants. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>the inventors have found that, similarly to the C16-ETTES, PAs with C8 and C20 lipopeptide portions similarly result in both bulk and per cell increase of collagen production. Furthermore, assembly of such PAs in water also resulted in reduced cell proliferation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i></figref>. Similar results were noted in the context of the C16-ETTES fragment, C16-ETTE.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">The reader's attention is directed to all papers and documents which are filed concurrently with or previous to this specification in connection with this application and which are open to public inspection with this specification, and the contents of all such papers and documents are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">All of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), and/or all of the steps of any method or process so disclosed, may be combined in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such features and/or steps are mutually exclusive.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Each feature disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), may be replaced by alternative features serving the same, equivalent, or similar purpose, unless expressly stated otherwise.
