In particular the invention relates to a three-dimensional printer for layer-wise manufacture of an object such as a mould. The invention also particularly relates to a method for manufacture of an object such as a hydrogel using a mould such as a wax mould.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Additive manufacturing methods, commonly referred to as three-dimensional printing methods, offer a number of benefits over traditional manufacturing methods. These methods enable the fabrication of complex parts, and/or one-off parts, often at low-cost. They are also commonly used for rapid fabrication of objects for prototyping purposes. However, the suitability and accuracy of objects produced by additive manufacturing is material and method dependent. Generally, methods capable of producing objects with high resolution features are time consuming.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, additive manufacturing methods for creating three dimensional structures from soft materials and/or biocompatible materials such as hydrogels have a number of challenges. Inkjet-type printing is generally not suitable for printing hydrogel parts. Further, inkjet-type printing of high-resolution parts requires a high resolution print head. Print heads with small orifices can be susceptible to blockages and result in increased print time. Other additive manufacturing methods may be limited in the types of structures they are suitable for, may result in cell damage to the hydrogel during manufacture, or are slow and not suitable for mass production. Therefore, there is currently a lack of suitable high-speed mass manufacturing methods for producing three dimensional hydrogel structures with high resolution features.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, existing additive manufacturing methods often result in waste material as a by-product of the manufacturing process, particularly where a support material has been used during the manufacturing process. The amount of waste product can be significant, particularly in mass manufacture situations. Removal of the supports can also be very time consuming and expensive. For cost and sustainability reasons, it is desirable to reduce waste produced by the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of at least preferred embodiments of the present invention to address one or more of the above mentioned disadvantages and/or to at least provide the public with a useful alternative.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this specification where reference has been made to patent specifications, other external documents, or other sources of information, this is generally to provide a context for discussing features of the invention. Unless specifically stated otherwise, reference to such external documents or sources of information is not to be construed as an admission that such documents or such sources of information, in any jurisdiction, are prior art or form part of the common general knowledge in the art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect the invention broadly consists in an apparatus for the manufacture of an object, comprising: a print bed, a stencil, a heater arranged to heat the stencil; and a squeegee. The stencil comprises one or more apertures and is positionable over the print bed. The squeegee is movable to spread a printing material across the stencil and to thereby force printing material through the stencil aperture(s). One or both of the stencil and the print bed is movable to adjust the spacing between the stencil and the print bed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The print bed may be vertically movable to raise and lower the print bed relative to the stencil.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The heater may comprise a radiant heater. For example, in an embodiment, the heater comprises one or more infrared lamps. The lamps may be elongate lamps positioned adjacent sides of the stencil.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The stencil may comprise a frame and a stencil plate that is pre-tensioned by the frame, the stencil aperture(s) being provided in the stencil plate. The frame may comprise first and second end supports attached to the plate, and elongate first and second side members extending between the end supports.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The side members may apply a pre-tension to the stencil plate via the end supports.

One or both of the stencil <b>9</b> and the print bed <b>7</b> is movable to adjust the spacing between the stencil and the print bed, and thereby to enable the printing of successive layers.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the embodiment shown, the heater <b>10</b>, stencil <b>9</b>, and squeegee <b>11</b> form a print assembly <b>3</b> that is supported on a frame <b>5</b> and horizontally movable relative to the frame and print beds <b>7</b>. The print beds <b>7</b> are each supported by a respective print bed adjustment assembly <b>15</b> arranged adjacent the perimeter of a rotatable print table <b>8</b>. The print bed adjustment assemblies <b>15</b> and thereby the print beds <b>7</b> are also laterally movable relative to the frame <b>5</b> and print assembly <b>3</b> by rotating the print table <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The print bed adjustment assemblies <b>15</b> each comprise a housing, for example a cylindrical housing, in which the print beds <b>7</b> can move up and down, and a mechanism for vertically moving the print beds <b>7</b>. The mechanism may comprise a mechanical, electromechanical, or pneumatic arrangement. In the embodiment shown, each print bed <b>7</b> can be moved vertically using a screw mechanism driven by a stepper motor. That is, the print bed <b>7</b> can be raised or lowered relative to the stencil <b>13</b> and relative to the housing. The print beds <b>7</b> are movable up and down in increments, with each increment being equal to the thickness of a print layer.

The print material is deposited via the stencil <b>9</b>, directly onto the top surface of the print surface. The print surface can then be removed along with the object at the end of the fabrication process. The print surface may comprise an embedded magnet or a mechanical fastener, enabling the print surface to be held to the remainder of the print beds <b>7</b>, for example using an electromagnet for the duration of the printing process. At the time of object removal, the electromagnet can be deactivated to release the print surface and the fabricated object from the print bed assembly <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary stencil <b>9</b> for use in the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The stencil <b>9</b> comprises a frame <b>17</b> and a stencil plate <b>19</b> that is pre-tensioned by the frame <b>17</b>.

In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, each frame end support <b>21</b> is a two part member that receives and clamps to a respective end of the stencil plate <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032;. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the stencil plate <b>19</b> may have a row of apertures <b>23</b>&#x2032; at each end of the plate, to facilitate screwing the two parts of each end support <b>21</b> together to clamp to the stencil plate <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>&#x2032;. The apertures <b>23</b>&#x2032; in the plate <b>19</b>&#x2032; receive the screws that engage the two parts of the respective end member <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The frame <b>17</b> further comprises elongate first and second side members <b>25</b> extending between the end supports <b>21</b>. The side members <b>25</b> hold the end supports <b>21</b> spaced apart and apply a pre-tension to the stencil plate <b>19</b> via the end supports <b>21</b>. In the embodiment shown, the side members <b>25</b> comprise threaded rods. Two nuts (not shown) are provided on each rod, with each nut arranged to contact an inner surface of a respective end support <b>21</b>, and thereby to urge the end supports <b>21</b> away from each other. This applies a tensile force to the stencil plate <b>19</b> to pre-tension the plate <b>19</b>. At least one of the nuts on each threaded rod <b>25</b> is adjustable to increase or decrease the force applied to the end supports <b>21</b> and thereby to adjust the pre-tension applied to the stencil plate <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">This pre-tension advantageously minimises deflection of the stencil plate <b>19</b> during printing. Deflection of the plate <b>19</b> is undesirable as it can cause print defects. The pre-tension is preferably selected to prevent deflection of the plate beyond an allowable amount upon a downward force applied by the squeegee, when the stencil <b>9</b> is at an operating temperature.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In alternative embodiments, a biasing member may be provided on each frame side member <b>25</b>, acting between the side member (for example, against a nut provided on the side member), and the end support <b>21</b> to apply the pre-tension force to the stencil plate <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Each stencil frame <b>17</b> further comprises a pair of handles <b>31</b>. In the embodiment shown, each handle <b>31</b> extends from and is integral with the respective end support <b>21</b>. The handles <b>31</b> facilitate lifting and positioning of the stencil <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the embodiment shown, a plurality of stencils <b>9</b> are provided, with each stencil <b>9</b> corresponding to a layer of the object. The stencils are stacked <b>33</b><i>a </i>in reverse build order, with the stencil corresponding to the lowest layer stacked at the top, and the stencil for the top most layer being at the bottom. The print assembly <b>3</b> comprises stencil lifters <b>35</b>. The stencil lifters <b>35</b> comprise electromagnets and are operable to lift a stencil <b>9</b> from a first stack <b>33</b><i>a </i>by activation of the electromagnet to engage the handles <b>31</b>, and to release the used stencil <b>9</b> onto a second stack <b>33</b><i>b </i>by deactivation of the electromagnet. An elevator <b>34</b><i>a </i>feeds the stencils <b>9</b> in the first stack upwards, such that the topmost stencil <b>9</b> is at a height for engagement with the stencil lifters <b>35</b>. Similarly, an elevator <b>34</b><i>b </i>moves the stencils <b>9</b> in the second stack <b>33</b><i>b </i>downwards, as used stencils are collected.

The lift carousel <b>133</b> continues to rotate such that the support arms <b>134</b> rise, are flipped over, then lower again until the process is repeated. With respect to the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the lift carousel <b>133</b> rotates in a clockwise manner indicated by the arrow R.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Once a stencil reaches the top horizontal position, a pneumatic ram <b>141</b> or other linear actuator pushes the stencil <b>109</b> forward, sliding it off the respective pair of support arms <b>134</b>. The stencil <b>109</b> is pushed onto a top conveyor <b>143</b>, which rotates in a manner to convey the stencil away from the carousel <b>133</b>. A plurality of proximity sensors <b>145</b> are arranged to detect when the stencil <b>109</b><i>b </i>reaches a pre-determined &#x2018;lifting&#x2019; position. When the stencil <b>109</b> is in this lifting position, a system controller stops the top conveyor <b>143</b>.

To store a stencil away, the stencil is placed back in the lifting position by the stencil lifters. The proximity sensors <b>145</b> detect that the stencil has been placed on the conveyor, when the stencil <b>109</b> is in this position, the system controller starts the top conveyor <b>143</b> once again. The used stencil is conveyed to a pair of stencil supports <b>147</b> on a second lift from where it is lowered by way of the second lift rotating in a similar manner to the lift carousel <b>133</b>, thereby lowering the stencil towards the base of the lift <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As the stencil <b>109</b><i>a </i>approaches the base of the lift <b>151</b>, it comes into contact and is transferred into contact with a lower carriage <b>157</b> carried on a lower conveyor <b>153</b>.

The lower conveyor <b>153</b> then moves the used stencil <b>109</b><i>a </i>and carriage <b>157</b> towards the base of the lift carousel <b>133</b>. The stencil is moved from the lower carriage <b>157</b> onto a pair of support arms <b>134</b> by the lower conveyor <b>153</b> for the process to repeat.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In the embodiment shown, the top and lower conveyors are shown as being chains, however other forms of conveyors are envisaged. In some embodiments, the stencil loading apparatus <b>130</b> is at least partly enclosed and comprises a heat source to heat the stencil loading apparatus.

Locating notches <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; are cut from the stencil plate <b>19</b> during fabrication of the stencil apertures <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>&#x2032;, thereby ensuring accurate positioning of the notches <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; relative to the apertures <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>&#x2032; in the stencil plate <b>19</b>. The notches <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; have a substantially arcuate shape, for example formed by a semi-circular or semi-elliptical cut-out.

The notches provided on the frame <b>17</b> are generally larger, e.g. with a larger radius, than the notches <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032; on the stencil plate <b>19</b>. This ensures there is clearance of the frame notches around the edge of the stencil plate notches <b>27</b>, <b>27</b>&#x2032;, thereby ensuring the locating protrusions <b>29</b> only contact the notches in the stencil plate.

If the stencil deflects too much, an excessive volume of material may be printed resulting in unwanted &#x2018;bridging&#x2019; of features where two printed features become connected with unwanted material.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">To avoid this unwanted deflection, it is desirable to ensure the pre-tensioning of the stencil plate is sufficient to limit such deflection to within an acceptable range for the print material and the print resolution. The tension in the stencil plate may be tuned, for example using two threaded shafts frame side members <b>24</b>. In the present embodiment, the deflection of the centre stencil under a 200 g (2 N) pin mass was set to 200 microns. However, in other embodiments with alternative print materials, or with different aperture sizes or print layer thicknesses, other deflections may be suitable. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that an allowable deflection can be determined through a simple process of trial and error, checking for print defects for differing tension levels.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Once the squeegee blade <b>37</b> is adjacent to the second end of the stencil, the printing of the layer is complete. While the squeegee is still in contact with a top surface of the stencil plate, the print bed <b>7</b> is lowered, moving it away from the stencil to increase a vertical spacing between the stencil <b>9</b> and the print bed <b>7</b>. The print bed is lowered at least the depth of a print layer, but more preferably is lowered by a distance of two or more times the depth of the print layer.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">After the print bed <b>7</b> has been lowered, the squeegee blade <b>37</b> is lifted out of contact with the stencil. Lowering the print bed <b>7</b> before lifting the stencil enables control over the speed of separation between the stencil and the printed layer, since the stencil will raise slightly after the downward force from the squeegee is released.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">To unlock the stencil <b>9</b> from position on the print table <b>8</b>, the lifters <b>35</b> lift off the stencil with the electromagnets are disabled. The horizontal ram <b>36</b>, engaged with the stencil using an activated electromagnet, pulls the stencil <b>9</b> out of engagement with the notches <b>27</b>. This movement of the stencil is about or slightly more than the depth of the notches, for example about 5 mm. The stencil <b>119</b> is then lifted from the print table using the stencil lifters <b>35</b>. The electromagnets and pneumatic cylinders in the lifters <b>35</b> engage and lift the stencil <b>119</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The printing assembly <b>3</b> is moved transversely back along the frame <b>5</b>, to position the stencil <b>9</b> generally over the second stencil stack <b>33</b><i>b. </i>The pneumatic cylinders in the lifters <b>35</b> lower the heated stencil <b>119</b> onto the second print stack <b>33</b><i>b, </i>and the electromagnets are then disengaged to release the stencil.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Due to surface roughness of the stencil surface, some printing material may remain in contact with the under surface of the stencil plate after printing of a layer. If this excess material is not removed it may reduce the print accuracy of subsequent layers printed using that stencil, particularly for very small objects. Before the stencil is placed in the second print stack <b>33</b><i>b, </i>any residual print material may be cleaned from the stencil, for example by wiping the underside or both the top and bottom surfaces of the stencil <b>9</b> with a roller, wiper and/or an absorbent material such as a tissue.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> show one embodiment of a stencil cleaner apparatus <b>71</b> for cleaning wax and other debris from a used stencil or stencils. The stencil cleaner <b>71</b> comprises two ribbon spools <b>73</b>, each with an associated motor <b>75</b> for selectively driving the spool <b>73</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, ribbon <b>77</b> extends from a first one of the spools <b>73</b>, over a cleaning head <b>79</b>, and to the second spool <b>73</b>. Guide rods <b>81</b> are positioned between the spools <b>73</b> and the cleaning head <b>79</b> to assist with correctly positioning and tensioning the ribbon <b>77</b>. The guide rods <b>81</b> comprise end stops <b>83</b> to prevent lateral movement of the ribbon off the cleaning head <b>79</b>. The first one of the spools <b>73</b> is loaded with a spool of cleaned and dried ribbon <b>77</b>, which is passed over the cleaning head <b>79</b> and to the second one of the spools <b>73</b>. The second spool motor operates to pull the ribbon from the first spool and wind it onto the second spool. While this occurs, the first spool motor is electrically disabled to allow the first spool to rotate freely. The process can be selectively reversed, with the first spool motor operating to pull the ribbon from the second spool and wind it onto the first spool.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The cleaning head <b>79</b> comprises a substantially flat top surface <b>79</b><i>a </i>for contacting the underside of the stencil. The edges <b>79</b><i>b </i>of the cleaning head are preferably curved to enable the ribbon <b>77</b> to smoothly glide over the cleaning head and to minimise wear to the ribbon <b>77</b>. The cleaning head <b>79</b> is mounted on a movable cassette <b>85</b>. The cleaning head <b>79</b> moves up and down on the moveable cassette <b>85</b> such that it can be moved into and out of contact with the underside of a stencil. The cassette <b>85</b> in turn is mounted to move forward and backwards via guide rods <b>87</b>. The cassette <b>85</b> positions the cleaning head, and the ribbon positioned on the cleaning head, underneath a used stencil.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">To clean a stencil, the stencil cleaner apparatus <b>71</b> is positioned under a used stencil by way of the moveable cassette <b>85</b>. The cleaning head <b>79</b>, and thereby the ribbon <b>77</b> extending over the cleaning head <b>79</b>, is moved up into contact with the stencil. The spool <b>73</b> for collecting the used ribbon is turned in a direction to pull clean ribbon from the other spool <b>73</b> and wind it onto the used ribbon spool, while the ribbon is in contact with the stencil, thereby pulling the ribbon over the surface of the stencil. As the ribbon <b>77</b> is pulled over the cleaning head <b>79</b>, the cleaning head is also moved back and forward to wipe the unwanted or excess wax or other debris from the stencil. The ribbon <b>77</b> acts to absorbs the unwanted or excess wax or other debris.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The ribbon <b>77</b> typically comprises a woven textile, for example satin. Preferably the ribbon material is a smooth, low-lint fabric, which is able to absorb unwanted or excess wax or other debris. After the ribbon from the first spool has been used, the spools are replaced. The used ribbon fabric may be disposed of or it may be cleaned, dried, and reused in the process, by being loaded on to another spool. The stencil cleaner apparatus <b>71</b> is preferably arranged adjacent or forms part of the stencil loading apparatus discussed above, and is configured to clean unwanted or excess wax or other debris from the stencils before they are returned to the lift carousel. In the embodiment shown, the stencil cleaner apparatus <b>71</b> is for use with a rotary print table. Each print station of the rotary print table comprises one or more tabs or other features to identify a point on the print table. A switch <b>89</b> is provided on the stencil cleaner apparatus <b>71</b>. This switch <b>89</b> is activated upon contact with one or more tabs or other features on the print station, to detect when the stencil cleaner apparatus <b>71</b> is correctly aligned with the print station and to thereby communicate when the stencil cleaner should be activated.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The above mentioned process as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is then repeated, as indicated by loop <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with a second stencil, then subsequent stencils, building up an object <b>106</b> in a layer wise manner.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">During printing with the second stencil, the second squeegee blade <b>37</b><i>b </i>is used. The second squeegee blade <b>37</b><i>b </i>is positioned and lowered into contact with the stencil adjacent the second end of the stencil plate <b>19</b>, with the trailing surface of the blade <b>37</b><i>b </i>facing and adjacent the respective frame end member <b>21</b><i>b </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). A quantity of printing material is dispensed onto the heated stencil this time between the stencil apertures <b>13</b> and a second one of the end supports <b>21</b>, such that the printing material is adjacent the squeegee blade on the leading side of the blade. The squeegee assembly <b>11</b> and thereby the second blade <b>37</b><i>b </i>is moved horizontally towards the first end of the stencil in the same but opposite manner as described above.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">The apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprises a single print assembly or print station <b>3</b>, and a plurality of print beds <b>7</b> arranged around the periphery of a rotatable print table <b>8</b>. Rather than printing a single object using the method described above, this arrangement enables a plurality of objects to be printed simultaneously. Once a layer has been completed on a first one of the print beds <b>7</b>, the print bed lowered and the stencil lifted, the print table <b>8</b> is rotated to position a second one of the print beds <b>7</b> under the stencil <b>9</b>. An underside of the stencil may be cleaned. The same stencil is then lowered into position on the print table <b>8</b> over the second print bed and the second print bed raised. The process of printing the layer is repeated for multiple print beds <b>7</b> without changing the stencil. Once a given layer has been printed on to each of the print beds, the stencil is changed following the process described above.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The dual squeegee blade arrangement is particularly advantageous in such a system where the same stencil is used multiple times consecutively, as it enables the print material to be wiped in either forward or backward directions, without having to move the squeegee back after printing each layer, hastening printing time. It also allows excess print material wiped from one direction to be wiped back for printing the next layer eliminating the need to clean the excess wax from the top surface after printing in one direction. In contrast, some embodiments may comprise only a single squeegee blade, but these embodiments require the squeegee to be moved back to the starting position. Alternatively, to achieve a similar capability, the apparatus may comprise a single squeegee blade with an adjustable tilt such that the angle of the blade can be changed for each print pass.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">In alternative embodiments, a plurality of print stations may be provided, with each print station having only a single stencil and corresponding to a layer of the object. The print stations are arranged in print order and a given print bed is moved under a first one of the print stations for printing a first layer, then under a second print station for printing a second layer, and continuing to move to subsequent print stations for the printing of subsequent layers. In such an embodiment, the print beds <b>7</b> may be provided on a rotary table such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with the number of print beds being equal to or greater than the number of unique layers in the printed object <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the print beds may be otherwise provided and moved laterally between stations. For example, the print bed may be provided on a belt or as part of a chain-like production line, and moved between stations. For long chain systems, to reduce inertial forces on the print beds and the printed object from intermittently stopping movement of the table or chain when the print beds are moved between stations, the print stations may be configured to travel with the table or chain while printing.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">In alternative embodiments having a plurality of print stations, each print station may comprise a plurality of interchangeable stencils such that each print station prints multiple unique layers of the object. This arrangement still necessitates stencil changes but will reduce the number of changes required by a factor corresponding to the number of print stations.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Optionally the system or apparatus may comprise one or more other stations in addition to the print station <b>3</b>. For example it may comprise secondary material application station, a curing or heating station, a vacuum application station, a station for shaving the top surface of a layer of the object, or an object removal station.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">The above described printing method is envisaged for use to print moulds or supports, in particular wax moulds, for manufacturing an article. In these embodiments, the material for the final article is not applied via the stencils, but is applied to the printed or partly printed mould by a secondary material applicator. The secondary applicator may be configured to apply a powdered solid material such as a metal powder to the printed or partly printed mould, during printing or after the mould is taken off the machine.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a method of manufacturing a hydrogel object <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, the object <b>106</b> produced by the layer-wise manufacturing process described above is a wax mould that is then used for forming the hydrogel object. The second printing material comprises a cellulose solution <b>109</b> to form the hydrogel.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Once the wax mould <b>106</b> has been printed, the mould is submersed in the cellulose solution <b>109</b>, or the mould <b>106</b> is injected <b>108</b> with the liquid <b>109</b>. Prior to the injection of the cellulose solution to the mould or the submersion of the mould, a cylindrical tube <b>47</b> is placed on the print bed <b>7</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, to contain the solution and to support and shape a cylindrical cellulose gel column.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">In the present embodiment, the cylindrical tube <b>47</b> comprises a polycarbonate tube that is sealed to the print bed to prevent the cellulose solution from leaking under the bottom of the tube <b>47</b>. For example, the tube may comprise a thread at one end to enable it to be screwed onto a complementary thread on the print bed <b>7</b>, and a sealing gasket (not shown) was placed around the join between the tube and the platform to create an airtight seal.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">In a next step, <b>110</b>, a cover <b>49</b> is placed over the tube and the cellulose containing object (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). A vacuum is applied to the object via an inlet <b>51</b> in the cover <b>49</b>, to create a negative pressure within the cover, to remove any air bubbles trapped within the mould. The cover is sealed to the tube or to the print bed around the tube.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Once any air has been removed, the object is removed from the print bed and tube. In some embodiments, this removal step may be automated, for example using a robotic arm to remove the polycarbonate tubes and to remove the object from the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">The removed object is then placed in a preheated oven <b>112</b> to gel the cellulose solution, thereby forming a gel. For the exemplary cellulose embodiment, the oven temperature is preferably at least 50&#xb0; C. Gelling time varies depending on the oven temperature and the size of the column.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">In alternative embodiments, rather than a cellulose solution, the second material may comprise any alternative gel-able polymer, for example, agarose, gelatin, hyaluronic acid or collagen.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Once the cellulose is set, the wax mould is removed. To do this, the object is heated to a temperature higher than the melting point of the wax (50&#xb0; C.-70&#xb0; C.), but not high enough to damage or melt the gel structure. This is preferably achieved by submerging the mould in a hot water bath <b>114</b>, for example water having a temperature of around 90&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Due to the immiscible nature of the water and molten wax, the cellulose gel quickly separates from the wax mould as it melts. The molten wax floats on the water bath and can be collected for recycling. This advantageously minimises waste by-products from the manufacturing process, improving sustainability and reducing cost.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">After the majority of the molten wax has been collected, a surfactant such as a soap is added to the water bath to wash the cellulose gel and remove any wax residues left. The hydrogel object is then removed from the bath, and any excess material may be trimmed from the object.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">In alternative embodiments, variations of the above methods may be used to manufacture metal or polymer objects.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In an embodiment for manufacturing a metal component, a mould such as a wax mould is manufactured according to the above methods. Every layer, or periodically every few layers, powdered metal is applied to the partly formed mould, filling the cavities in the mould. Alternatively, the mould may be printed in its entirety before placing powdered metal into the mould cavities. To ensure a tight packing of the mould with the metal powder, a vibration may be applied to the object, for example, via the print bed <b>7</b>. The apparatus may further comprise a tertiary material applicator such as an ink jet type applicator to apply a binder to the powdered metal. The binder is then cured according to the requirements of the binder used, for example using UV light, before printing the next mould layer. Therefore, in this embodiment, a green body for the metal object is formed in tandem with the mould.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">The green body is then sintered to bond the metal particles and form the final object. The sintering may be by any appropriate means, for example utilising a heat exchanger such as a thin wall heat exchanger, or a catalytic converter, and/or the sintering may be carried out in a vacuum or inert gas oven. This sintering will cause the wax mould to melt, leaving the sintered metal component. Alternatively, depending on the properties of the green body, the wax mould may be removed prior to sintering by first placing the green body-wax component in a water bath, as described above.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> to <b>13</b></figref> illustrate the geometry of one example embodiment hydrogel object for chromatography applications that can be manufactured using the above described methods.

Thermal 3D screen printing of 24 parts 50 mm in height and 0.05 mm layer thickness is estimated to take about 2000 minutes (33.3 hours) or about 83 minute (1 hour 23 minutes) for a single part. In contrast, the commercially available Solidscape 3D printer takes between 28-32 hours to print a single part having the same dimensions and requires a further 5-7 days to remove the support material.
