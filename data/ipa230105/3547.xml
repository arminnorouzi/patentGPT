id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system for vehicle navigation may include a processor including a circuitry and a memory. The memory may include instructions that when executed by the circuitry cause the processor to receive navigational information associated with the vehicle including an indicator of a location of the vehicle, and determine target navigational map segments to retrieve from a map database. The map database may include stored navigational map segments each corresponding to a real-world area. The determination of the target navigational map segments may be based on the indicator of vehicle location and on map segment connectivity information associated with the stored navigational map segments. The instructions may also cause the processor to initiate downloading of the target navigational map segments from the map database, and cause the vehicle to navigate along a target trajectory included in one or more of the target navigational map segments downloaded from the map database.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

Autonomous vehicles may need to take into account a variety of factors and make appropriate decisions based on those factors to safely and accurately reach an intended destination. For example, an autonomous vehicle may need to process and interpret visual information (e.g., information captured from a camera) and may also use information obtained from other sources (e.g., from a GPS device, a speed sensor, an accelerometer, a suspension sensor, etc.). At the same time, in order to navigate to a destination, an autonomous vehicle may also need to identify its location within a particular roadway (e.g., a specific lane within a multi-lane road), navigate alongside other vehicles, avoid obstacles and pedestrians, observe traffic signals and signs, and travel from one road to another road at appropriate intersections or interchanges. Harnessing and interpreting vast volumes of information collected by an autonomous vehicle as the vehicle travels to its destination poses a multitude of design challenges. The sheer quantity of data (e.g., captured image data, map data, GPS data, sensor data, etc.) that an autonomous vehicle may need to analyze, access, and/or store poses challenges that can in fact limit or even adversely affect autonomous navigation. Furthermore, if an autonomous vehicle relies on traditional mapping technology to navigate, the sheer volume of data needed to store and update the map poses daunting challenges.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments consistent with the present disclosure provide systems and methods for vehicle navigation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, a system for navigating a vehicle may include at least one processor comprising circuitry and a memory.

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts. While several illustrative embodiments are described herein, modifications, adaptations and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions or modifications may be made to the components illustrated in the drawings, and the illustrative methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, removing, or adding steps to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description is not limited to the disclosed embodiments and examples. Instead, the proper scope is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Autonomous Vehicle Overview</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;autonomous vehicle&#x201d; refers to a vehicle capable of implementing at least one navigational change without driver input. A &#x201c;navigational change&#x201d; refers to a change in one or more of steering, braking, or acceleration of the vehicle. To be autonomous, a vehicle need not be fully automatic (e.g., fully operation without a driver or without driver input). Rather, an autonomous vehicle includes those that can operate under driver control during certain time periods and without driver control during other time periods. Autonomous vehicles may also include vehicles that control only some aspects of vehicle navigation, such as steering (e.g., to maintain a vehicle course between vehicle lane constraints), but may leave other aspects to the driver (e.g., braking). In some cases, autonomous vehicles may handle some or all aspects of braking, speed control, and/or steering of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As human drivers typically rely on visual cues and observations to control a vehicle, transportation infrastructures are built accordingly, with lane markings, traffic signs, and traffic lights are all designed to provide visual information to drivers. In view of these design characteristics of transportation infrastructures, an autonomous vehicle may include a camera and a processing unit that analyzes visual information captured from the environment of the vehicle. The visual information may include, for example, components of the transportation infrastructure (e.g., lane markings, traffic signs, traffic lights, etc.) that are observable by drivers and other obstacles (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians, debris, etc.). Additionally, an autonomous vehicle may also use stored information, such as information that provides a model of the vehicle's environment when navigating. For example, the vehicle may use GPS data, sensor data (e.g., from an accelerometer, a speed sensor, a suspension sensor, etc.), and/or other map data to provide information related to its environment while the vehicle is traveling, and the vehicle (as well as other vehicles) may use the information to localize itself on the model.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments in this disclosure, an autonomous vehicle may use information obtained while navigating (e.g., from a camera, GPS device, an accelerometer, a speed sensor, a suspension sensor, etc.). In other embodiments, an autonomous vehicle may use information obtained from past navigations by the vehicle (or by other vehicles) while navigating. In yet other embodiments, an autonomous vehicle may use a combination of information obtained while navigating and information obtained from past navigations. The following sections provide an overview of a system consistent with the disclosed embodiments, followed by an overview of a forward-facing imaging system and methods consistent with the system. The sections that follow disclose systems and methods for constructing, using, and updating a sparse map for autonomous vehicle navigation.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">System Overview</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram representation of a system <b>100</b> consistent with the exemplary disclosed embodiments.

Image capture device <b>122</b> may include an optical axis. In one instance, the image capture device <b>122</b> may include an Aptina M9V024 WVGA sensor with a global shutter. In other embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may provide a resolution of 1280&#xd7;960 pixels and may include a rolling shutter. Image capture device <b>122</b> may include various optical elements. In some embodiments one or more lenses may be included, for example, to provide a desired focal length and field of view for the image capture device. In some embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may be associated with a 6 mm lens or a 12 mm lens. In some embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to capture images having a desired field-of-view (FOV) <b>202</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. For example, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to have a regular FOV, such as within a range of 40 degrees to 56 degrees, including a 46 degree FOV, 50 degree FOV, 52 degree FOV, or greater. Alternatively, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to have a narrow FOV in the range of 23 to 40 degrees, such as a 28 degree FOV or 36 degree FOV. In addition, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to have a wide FOV in the range of 100 to 180 degrees. In some embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may include a wide angle bumper camera or one with up to a 180 degree FOV.

Such an image capture device may be used in place of a three image capture device configuration. Due to significant lens distortion, the vertical FOV of such an image capture device may be significantly less than 50 degrees in implementations in which the image capture device uses a radially symmetric lens. For example, such a lens may not be radially symmetric which would allow for a vertical FOV greater than 50 degrees with 100 degree horizontal FOV.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The first image capture device <b>122</b> may acquire a plurality of first images relative to a scene associated with the vehicle <b>200</b>.

In one embodiment, a CMOS image sensor may be employed along with a rolling shutter, such that each pixel in a row is read one at a time, and scanning of the rows proceeds on a row-by-row basis until an entire image frame has been captured. In some embodiments, the rows may be captured sequentially from top to bottom relative to the frame.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, one or more of the image capture devices (e.g., image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>) disclosed herein may constitute a high resolution imager and may have a resolution greater than 5 M pixel, 7 M pixel, 10 M pixel, or greater.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The use of a rolling shutter may result in pixels in different rows being exposed and captured at different times, which may cause skew and other image artifacts in the captured image frame. On the other hand, when the image capture device <b>122</b> is configured to operate with a global or synchronous shutter, all of the pixels may be exposed for the same amount of time and during a common exposure period. As a result, the image data in a frame collected from a system employing a global shutter represents a snapshot of the entire FOV (such as FOV <b>202</b>) at a particular time. In contrast, in a rolling shutter application, each row in a frame is exposed and data is capture at different times. Thus, moving objects may appear distorted in an image capture device having a rolling shutter.

The relative positioning of the image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be selected to aid in fusing together the information acquired from the image capture devices. For example, in some embodiments, a FOV (such as FOV <b>204</b>) associated with image capture device <b>124</b> may overlap partially or fully with a FOV (such as FOV <b>202</b>) associated with image capture device <b>122</b> and a FOV (such as FOV <b>206</b>) associated with image capture device <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be located on vehicle <b>200</b> at any suitable relative heights.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the two image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are at different heights. There may also be a lateral displacement difference between image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>, giving additional parallax information for stereo analysis by processing unit <b>110</b>, for example. The difference in the lateral displacement may be denoted by d<sub>x</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref>. In some embodiments, fore or aft displacement (e.g., range displacement) may exist between image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>. For example, image capture device <b>122</b> may be located 0.5 to 2 meters or more behind image capture device <b>124</b> and/or image capture device <b>126</b>. This type of displacement may enable one of the image capture devices to cover potential blind spots of the other image capture device(s).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Image capture devices <b>122</b> may have any suitable resolution capability (e.g., number of pixels associated with the image sensor), and the resolution of the image sensor(s) associated with the image capture device <b>122</b> may be higher, lower, or the same as the resolution of the image sensor(s) associated with image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the image sensor(s) associated with image capture device <b>122</b> and/or image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may have a resolution of 640&#xd7;480, 1024&#xd7;768, 1280&#xd7;960, or any other suitable resolution.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The frame rate (e.g., the rate at which an image capture device acquires a set of pixel data of one image frame before moving on to capture pixel data associated with the next image frame) may be controllable. The frame rate associated with image capture device <b>122</b> may be higher, lower, or the same as the frame rate associated with image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. The frame rate associated with image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may depend on a variety of factors that may affect the timing of the frame rate. For example, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may include a selectable pixel delay period imposed before or after acquisition of image data associated with one or more pixels of an image sensor in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b>. Generally, image data corresponding to each pixel may be acquired according to a clock rate for the device (e.g., one pixel per clock cycle). Additionally, in embodiments including a rolling shutter, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may include a selectable horizontal blanking period imposed before or after acquisition of image data associated with a row of pixels of an image sensor in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b>. Further, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b> may include a selectable vertical blanking period imposed before or after acquisition of image data associated with an image frame of image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">These timing controls may enable synchronization of frame rates associated with image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>, even where the line scan rates of each are different. Additionally, as will be discussed in greater detail below, these selectable timing controls, among other factors (e.g., image sensor resolution, maximum line scan rates, etc.) may enable synchronization of image capture from an area where the FOV of image capture device <b>122</b> overlaps with one or more FOVs of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>, even where the field of view of image capture device <b>122</b> is different from the FOVs of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Frame rate timing in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may depend on the resolution of the associated image sensors. For example, assuming similar line scan rates for both devices, if one device includes an image sensor having a resolution of 640&#xd7;480 and another device includes an image sensor with a resolution of 1280&#xd7;960, then more time will be required to acquire a frame of image data from the sensor having the higher resolution.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Another factor that may affect the timing of image data acquisition in image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> is the maximum line scan rate. For example, acquisition of a row of image data from an image sensor included in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> will require some minimum amount of time. Assuming no pixel delay periods are added, this minimum amount of time for acquisition of a row of image data will be related to the maximum line scan rate for a particular device. Devices that offer higher maximum line scan rates have the potential to provide higher frame rates than devices with lower maximum line scan rates. In some embodiments, one or more of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may have a maximum line scan rate that is higher than a maximum line scan rate associated with image capture device <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the maximum line scan rate of image capture device <b>124</b> and/or <b>126</b> may be 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, or 2 times or more than a maximum line scan rate of image capture device <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In another embodiment, image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may have the same maximum line scan rate, but image capture device <b>122</b> may be operated at a scan rate less than or equal to its maximum scan rate. The system may be configured such that one or more of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> operate at a line scan rate that is equal to the line scan rate of image capture device <b>122</b>. In other instances, the system may be configured such that the line scan rate of image capture device <b>124</b> and/or image capture device <b>126</b> may be 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, or 2 times or more than the line scan rate of image capture device <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be asymmetric. That is, they may include cameras having different fields of view (FOV) and focal lengths. The fields of view of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may include any desired area relative to an environment of vehicle <b>200</b>, for example. In some embodiments, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be configured to acquire image data from an environment in front of vehicle <b>200</b>, behind vehicle <b>200</b>, to the sides of vehicle <b>200</b>, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, the focal length associated with each image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b> may be selectable (e.g., by inclusion of appropriate lenses etc.) such that each device acquires images of objects at a desired distance range relative to vehicle <b>200</b>. For example, in some embodiments image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may acquire images of close-up objects within a few meters from the vehicle. Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may also be configured to acquire images of objects at ranges more distant from the vehicle (e.g., 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, 150 m, or more). Further, the focal lengths of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be selected such that one image capture device (e.g., image capture device <b>122</b>) can acquire images of objects relatively close to the vehicle (e.g., within 10 m or within 20 m) while the other image capture devices (e.g., image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>) can acquire images of more distant objects (e.g., greater than 20 m, 50 m, 100 m, 150 m, etc.) from vehicle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">According to some embodiments, the FOV of one or more image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may have a wide angle. For example, it may be advantageous to have a FOV of 140 degrees, especially for image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> that may be used to capture images of the area in the vicinity of vehicle <b>200</b>. For example, image capture device <b>122</b> may be used to capture images of the area to the right or left of vehicle <b>200</b> and, in such embodiments, it may be desirable for image capture device <b>122</b> to have a wide FOV (e.g., at least 140 degrees).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The field of view associated with each of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may depend on the respective focal lengths. For example, as the focal length increases, the corresponding field of view decreases.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be configured to have any suitable fields of view. In one particular example, image capture device <b>122</b> may have a horizontal FOV of 46 degrees, image capture device <b>124</b> may have a horizontal FOV of 23 degrees, and image capture device <b>126</b> may have a horizontal FOV in between 23 and 46 degrees. In another instance, image capture device <b>122</b> may have a horizontal FOV of 52 degrees, image capture device <b>124</b> may have a horizontal FOV of 26 degrees, and image capture device <b>126</b> may have a horizontal FOV in between 26 and 52 degrees. In some embodiments, a ratio of the FOV of image capture device <b>122</b> to the FOVs of image capture device <b>124</b> and/or image capture device <b>126</b> may vary from 1.5 to 2.0.

For example, system <b>100</b> may analyze image data, position data (e.g., GPS location information), map data, speed data, and/or data from sensors included in vehicle <b>200</b>. System <b>100</b> may collect the data for analysis from, for example, image acquisition unit <b>120</b>, position sensor <b>130</b>, and other sensors.

The multi-camera system may use one or more cameras facing in the forward direction of a vehicle. In other embodiments, the multi-camera system may include one or more cameras facing to the side of a vehicle or to the rear of the vehicle. In one embodiment, for example, system <b>100</b> may use a two-camera imaging system, where a first camera and a second camera (e.g., image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>) may be positioned at the front and/or the sides of a vehicle (e.g., vehicle <b>200</b>). The first camera may have a field of view that is greater than, less than, or partially overlapping with, the field of view of the second camera. In addition, the first camera may be connected to a first image processor to perform monocular image analysis of images provided by the first camera, and the second camera may be connected to a second image processor to perform monocular image analysis of images provided by the second camera. The outputs (e.g., processed information) of the first and second image processors may be combined. In some embodiments, the second image processor may receive images from both the first camera and second camera to perform stereo analysis. In another embodiment, system <b>100</b> may use a three-camera imaging system where each of the cameras has a different field of view. Such a system may, therefore, make decisions based on information derived from objects located at varying distances both forward and to the sides of the vehicle. References to monocular image analysis may refer to instances where image analysis is performed based on images captured from a single point of view (e.g., from a single camera). Stereo image analysis may refer to instances where image analysis is performed based on two or more images captured with one or more variations of an image capture parameter. For example, captured images suitable for performing stereo image analysis may include images captured: from two or more different positions, from different fields of view, using different focal lengths, along with parallax information, etc.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">For example, in one embodiment, system <b>100</b> may implement a three camera configuration using image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>. In such a configuration, image capture device <b>122</b> may provide a narrow field of view (e.g., 34 degrees, or other values selected from a range of about 20 to 45 degrees, etc.), image capture device <b>124</b> may provide a wide field of view (e.g., 150 degrees or other values selected from a range of about 100 to about 180 degrees), and image capture device <b>126</b> may provide an intermediate field of view (e.g., 46 degrees or other values selected from a range of about 35 to about 60 degrees). In some embodiments, image capture device <b>126</b> may act as a main or primary camera. Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be positioned behind rearview mirror <b>310</b> and positioned substantially side-by-side (e.g., 6 cm apart). Further, in some embodiments, as discussed above, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be mounted behind glare shield <b>380</b> that is flush with the windshield of vehicle <b>200</b>. Such shielding may act to minimize the impact of any reflections from inside the car on image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In another embodiment, as discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>, the wide field of view camera (e.g., image capture device <b>124</b> in the above example) may be mounted lower than the narrow and main field of view cameras (e.g., image devices <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> in the above example). This configuration may provide a free line of sight from the wide field of view camera. To reduce reflections, the cameras may be mounted close to the windshield of vehicle <b>200</b>, and may include polarizers on the cameras to damp reflected light.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">A three camera system may provide certain performance characteristics. For example, some embodiments may include an ability to validate the detection of objects by one camera based on detection results from another camera. In the three camera configuration discussed above, processing unit <b>110</b> may include, for example, three processing devices (e.g., three EyeQ series of processor chips, as discussed above), with each processing device dedicated to processing images captured by one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In a three camera system, a first processing device may receive images from both the main camera and the narrow field of view camera, and perform vision processing of the narrow FOV camera to, for example, detect other vehicles, pedestrians, lane marks, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other road objects. Further, the first processing device may calculate a disparity of pixels between the images from the main camera and the narrow camera and create a 3D reconstruction of the environment of vehicle <b>200</b>. The first processing device may then combine the 3D reconstruction with 3D map data or with 3D information calculated based on information from another camera.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The second processing device may receive images from main camera and perform vision processing to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, lane marks, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other road objects. Additionally, the second processing device may calculate a camera displacement and, based on the displacement, calculate a disparity of pixels between successive images and create a 3D reconstruction of the scene (e.g., a structure from motion). The second processing device may send the structure from motion based 3D reconstruction to the first processing device to be combined with the stereo 3D images.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The third processing device may receive images from the wide FOV camera and process the images to detect vehicles, pedestrians, lane marks, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other road objects. The third processing device may further execute additional processing instructions to analyze images to identify objects moving in the image, such as vehicles changing lanes, pedestrians, etc.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments, having streams of image-based information captured and processed independently may provide an opportunity for providing redundancy in the system. Such redundancy may include, for example, using a first image capture device and the images processed from that device to validate and/or supplement information obtained by capturing and processing image information from at least a second image capture device.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may use two image capture devices (e g, image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>) in providing navigation assistance for vehicle <b>200</b> and use a third image capture device (e.g., image capture device <b>126</b>) to provide redundancy and validate the analysis of data received from the other two image capture devices. For example, in such a configuration, image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may provide images for stereo analysis by system <b>100</b> for navigating vehicle <b>200</b>, while image capture device <b>126</b> may provide images for monocular analysis by system <b>100</b> to provide redundancy and validation of information obtained based on images captured from image capture device <b>122</b> and/or image capture device <b>124</b>. That is, image capture device <b>126</b> (and a corresponding processing device) may be considered to provide a redundant sub-system for providing a check on the analysis derived from image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> (e.g., to provide an automatic emergency braking (AEB) system). Furthermore, in some embodiments, redundancy and validation of received data may be supplemented based on information received from one more sensors (e.g., radar, lidar, acoustic sensors, information received from one or more transceivers outside of a vehicle, etc.).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">One of skill in the art will recognize that the above camera configurations, camera placements, number of cameras, camera locations, etc., are examples only.

The predetermined patterns may be designed in such a way to achieve a high rate of &#x201c;false hits&#x201d; and a low rate of &#x201c;misses.&#x201d; For example, processing unit <b>110</b> may use a low threshold of similarity to predetermined patterns for identifying candidate objects as possible vehicles or pedestrians.

Under such a scheme, for example, a decision by processing unit <b>110</b> that the leading vehicle is likely changing lanes based on a particular type of analysis may be assigned a value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; (and &#x201c;0&#x201d; to represent a determination that the leading vehicle is not likely changing lanes).

In performing the steps above, processing unit <b>110</b> may consider information from both the first and second plurality of images, rather than information from one set of images alone. For example, processing unit <b>110</b> may analyze the differences in pixel-level data (or other data subsets from among the two streams of captured images) for a candidate object appearing in both the first and second plurality of images. As another example, processing unit <b>110</b> may estimate a position and/or velocity of a candidate object (e.g., relative to vehicle <b>200</b>) by observing that the object appears in one of the plurality of images but not the other or relative to other differences that may exist relative to objects appearing if the two image streams.

In particular, the sparse map may be for autonomous vehicle navigation along a road segment. For example, the sparse map may provide sufficient information for navigating an autonomous vehicle without storing and/or updating a large quantity of data. As discussed below in further detail, an autonomous vehicle may use the sparse map to navigate one or more roads based on one or more stored trajectories.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Sparse Map for Autonomous Vehicle Navigation</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">In some embodiments, the disclosed systems and methods may generate a sparse map for autonomous vehicle navigation. For example, the sparse map may provide sufficient information for navigation without requiring excessive data storage or data transfer rates. As discussed below in further detail, a vehicle (which may be an autonomous vehicle) may use the sparse map to navigate one or more roads. For example, in some embodiments, the sparse map may include data related to a road and potentially landmarks along the road that may be sufficient for vehicle navigation, but which also exhibit small data footprints. For example, the sparse data maps described in detail below may require significantly less storage space and data transfer bandwidth as compared with digital maps including detailed map information, such as image data collected along a road.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">For example, rather than storing detailed representations of a road segment, the sparse data map may store three-dimensional polynomial representations of preferred vehicle paths along a road. These paths may require very little data storage space. Further, in the described sparse data maps, landmarks may be identified and included in the sparse map road model to aid in navigation. These landmarks may be located at any spacing suitable for enabling vehicle navigation, but in some cases, such landmarks need not be identified and included in the model at high densities and short spacings. Rather, in some cases, navigation may be possible based on landmarks that are spaced apart by at least 50 meters, at least 100 meters, at least 500 meters, at least 1 kilometer, or at least 2 kilometers. As will be discussed in more detail in other sections, the sparse map may be generated based on data collected or measured by vehicles equipped with various sensors and devices, such as image capture devices, Global Positioning System sensors, motion sensors, etc., as the vehicles travel along roadways. In some cases, the sparse map may be generated based on data collected during multiple drives of one or more vehicles along a particular roadway. Generating a sparse map using multiple drives of one or more vehicles may be referred to as &#x201c;crowdsourcing&#x201d; a sparse map.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, an autonomous vehicle system may use a sparse map for navigation. For example, the disclosed systems and methods may distribute a sparse map for generating a road navigation model for an autonomous vehicle and may navigate an autonomous vehicle along a road segment using a sparse map and/or a generated road navigation model. Sparse maps consistent with the present disclosure may include one or more three-dimensional contours that may represent predetermined trajectories that autonomous vehicles may traverse as they move along associated road segments.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Sparse maps consistent with the present disclosure may also include data representing one or more road features. Such road features may include recognized landmarks, road signature profiles, and any other road-related features useful in navigating a vehicle. Sparse maps consistent with the present disclosure may enable autonomous navigation of a vehicle based on relatively small amounts of data included in the sparse map. For example, rather than including detailed representations of a road, such as road edges, road curvature, images associated with road segments, or data detailing other physical features associated with a road segment, the disclosed embodiments of the sparse map may require relatively little storage space (and relatively little bandwidth when portions of the sparse map are transferred to a vehicle) but may still adequately provide for autonomous vehicle navigation. The small data footprint of the disclosed sparse maps, discussed in further detail below, may be achieved in some embodiments by storing representations of road-related elements that require small amounts of data but still enable autonomous navigation.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">For example, rather than storing detailed representations of various aspects of a road, the disclosed sparse maps may store polynomial representations of one or more trajectories that a vehicle may follow along the road. Thus, rather than storing (or having to transfer) details regarding the physical nature of the road to enable navigation along the road, using the disclosed sparse maps, a vehicle may be navigated along a particular road segment without, in some cases, having to interpret physical aspects of the road, but rather, by aligning its path of travel with a trajectory (e.g., a polynomial spline) along the particular road segment. In this way, the vehicle may be navigated based mainly upon the stored trajectory (e.g., a polynomial spline) that may require much less storage space than an approach involving storage of roadway images, road parameters, road layout, etc.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">In addition to the stored polynomial representations of trajectories along a road segment, the disclosed sparse maps may also include small data objects that may represent a road feature. In some embodiments, the small data objects may include digital signatures, which are derived from a digital image (or a digital signal) that was obtained by a sensor (e.g., a camera or other sensor, such as a suspension sensor) onboard a vehicle traveling along the road segment. The digital signature may have a reduced size relative to the signal that was acquired by the sensor. In some embodiments, the digital signature may be created to be compatible with a classifier function that is configured to detect and to identify the road feature from the signal that is acquired by the sensor, for example, during a subsequent drive. In some embodiments, a digital signature may be created such that the digital signature has a footprint that is as small as possible, while retaining the ability to correlate or match the road feature with the stored signature based on an image (or a digital signal generated by a sensor, if the stored signature is not based on an image and/or includes other data) of the road feature that is captured by a camera onboard a vehicle traveling along the same road segment at a subsequent time.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In some embodiments, a size of the data objects may be further associated with a uniqueness of the road feature. For example, for a road feature that is detectable by a camera onboard a vehicle, and where the camera system onboard the vehicle is coupled to a classifier that is capable of distinguishing the image data corresponding to that road feature as being associated with a particular type of road feature, for example, a road sign, and where such a road sign is locally unique in that area (e.g., there is no identical road sign or road sign of the same type nearby), it may be sufficient to store data indicating the type of the road feature and its location.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">As will be discussed in further detail below, road features (e.g., landmarks along a road segment) may be stored as small data objects that may represent a road feature in relatively few bytes, while at the same time providing sufficient information for recognizing and using such a feature for navigation. In one example, a road sign may be identified as a recognized landmark on which navigation of a vehicle may be based. A representation of the road sign may be stored in the sparse map to include, e.g., a few bytes of data indicating a type of landmark (e.g., a stop sign) and a few bytes of data indicating a location of the landmark (e.g., coordinates). Navigating based on such data-light representations of the landmarks (e.g., using representations sufficient for locating, recognizing, and navigating based upon the landmarks) may provide a desired level of navigational functionality associated with sparse maps without significantly increasing the data overhead associated with the sparse maps. This lean representation of landmarks (and other road features) may take advantage of the sensors and processors included onboard such vehicles that are configured to detect, identify, and/or classify certain road features.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">When, for example, a sign or even a particular type of a sign is locally unique (e.g., when there is no other sign or no other sign of the same type) in a given area, the sparse map may use data indicating a type of a landmark (a sign or a specific type of sign), and during navigation (e.g., autonomous navigation) when a camera onboard an autonomous vehicle captures an image of the area including a sign (or of a specific type of sign), the processor may process the image, detect the sign (if indeed present in the image), classify the image as a sign (or as a specific type of sign), and correlate the location of the image with the location of the sign as stored in the sparse map.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Generating a Sparse Map</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">In some embodiments, a sparse map may include at least one line representation of a road surface feature extending along a road segment and a plurality of landmarks associated with the road segment. In certain aspects, the sparse map may be generated via &#x201c;crowdsourcing,&#x201d; for example, through image analysis of a plurality of images acquired as one or more vehicles traverse the road segment.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a sparse map <b>800</b> that one or more vehicles, e.g., vehicle <b>200</b> (which may be an autonomous vehicle), may access for providing autonomous vehicle navigation.

For example, in some embodiments, memory <b>140</b> or <b>150</b> may include hard drives, compact discs, flash memory, magnetic based memory devices, optical based memory devices, etc. In some embodiments, sparse map <b>800</b> may be stored in a database (e.g., map database <b>160</b>) that may be stored in memory <b>140</b> or <b>150</b>, or other types of storage devices.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">In some embodiments, sparse map <b>800</b> may be stored on a storage device or a non-transitory computer-readable medium provided onboard vehicle <b>200</b> (e.g., a storage device included in a navigation system onboard vehicle <b>200</b>). A processor (e.g., processing unit <b>110</b>) provided on vehicle <b>200</b> may access sparse map <b>800</b> stored in the storage device or computer-readable medium provided onboard vehicle <b>200</b> in order to generate navigational instructions for guiding the autonomous vehicle <b>200</b> as the vehicle traverses a road segment.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Sparse map <b>800</b> need not be stored locally with respect to a vehicle, however. In some embodiments, sparse map <b>800</b> may be stored on a storage device or computer-readable medium provided on a remote server that communicates with vehicle <b>200</b> or a device associated with vehicle <b>200</b>. A processor (e.g., processing unit <b>110</b>) provided on vehicle <b>200</b> may receive data included in sparse map <b>800</b> from the remote server and may execute the data for guiding the autonomous driving of vehicle <b>200</b>. In such embodiments, the remote server may store all of sparse map <b>800</b> or only a portion thereof. Accordingly, the storage device or computer-readable medium provided onboard vehicle <b>200</b> and/or onboard one or more additional vehicles may store the remaining portion(s) of sparse map <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Furthermore, in such embodiments, sparse map <b>800</b> may be made accessible to a plurality of vehicles traversing various road segments (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands, or millions of vehicles, etc.). It should be noted also that sparse map <b>800</b> may include multiple sub-maps. For example, in some embodiments, sparse map <b>800</b> may include hundreds, thousands, millions, or more, of sub-maps that may be used in navigating a vehicle. Such sub-maps may be referred to as local maps, and a vehicle traveling along a roadway may access any number of local maps relevant to a location in which the vehicle is traveling. The local map sections of sparse map <b>800</b> may be stored with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) key as an index to the database of sparse map <b>800</b>. Thus, while computation of steering angles for navigating a host vehicle in the present system may be performed without reliance upon a GNSS position of the host vehicle, road features, or landmarks, such GNSS information may be used for retrieval of relevant local maps.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In general, sparse map <b>800</b> may be generated based on data collected from one or more vehicles as they travel along roadways. For example, using sensors aboard the one or more vehicles (e.g., cameras, speedometers, GPS, accelerometers, etc.), the trajectories that the one or more vehicles travel along a roadway may be recorded, and the polynomial representation of a preferred trajectory for vehicles making subsequent trips along the roadway may be determined based on the collected trajectories travelled by the one or more vehicles. Similarly, data collected by the one or more vehicles may aid in identifying potential landmarks along a particular roadway. Data collected from traversing vehicles may also be used to identify road profile information, such as road width profiles, road roughness profiles, traffic line spacing profiles, road conditions, etc. Using the collected information, sparse map <b>800</b> may be generated and distributed (e.g., for local storage or via on-the-fly data transmission) for use in navigating one or more autonomous vehicles. However, in some embodiments, map generation may not end upon initial generation of the map. As will be discussed in greater detail below, sparse map <b>800</b> may be continuously or periodically updated based on data collected from vehicles as those vehicles continue to traverse roadways included in sparse map <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Data recorded in sparse map <b>800</b> may include position information based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data. For example, location information may be included in sparse map <b>800</b> for various map elements, including, for example, landmark locations, road profile locations, etc. Locations for map elements included in sparse map <b>800</b> may be obtained using GPS data collected from vehicles traversing a roadway. For example, a vehicle passing an identified landmark may determine a location of the identified landmark using GPS position information associated with the vehicle and a determination of a location of the identified landmark relative to the vehicle (e.g., based on image analysis of data collected from one or more cameras on board the vehicle). Such location determinations of an identified landmark (or any other feature included in sparse map <b>800</b>) may be repeated as additional vehicles pass the location of the identified landmark. Some or all of the additional location determinations may be used to refine the location information stored in sparse map <b>800</b> relative to the identified landmark. For example, in some embodiments, multiple position measurements relative to a particular feature stored in sparse map <b>800</b> may be averaged together. Any other mathematical operations, however, may also be used to refine a stored location of a map element based on a plurality of determined locations for the map element.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The sparse map of the disclosed embodiments may enable autonomous navigation of a vehicle using relatively small amounts of stored data. In some embodiments, sparse map <b>800</b> may have a data density (e.g., including data representing the target trajectories, landmarks, and any other stored road features) of less than 2 MB per kilometer of roads, less than 1 MB per kilometer of roads, less than 500 kB per kilometer of roads, or less than 100 kB per kilometer of roads. In some embodiments, the data density of sparse map <b>800</b> may be less than 10 kB per kilometer of roads or even less than 2 kB per kilometer of roads (e.g., 1.6 kB per kilometer), or no more than 10 kB per kilometer of roads, or no more than 20 kB per kilometer of roads. In some embodiments, most, if not all, of the roadways of the United States may be navigated autonomously using a sparse map having a total of 4 GB or less of data. These data density values may represent an average over an entire sparse map <b>800</b>, over a local map within sparse map <b>800</b>, and/or over a particular road segment within sparse map <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">As noted, sparse map <b>800</b> may include representations of a plurality of target trajectories <b>810</b> for guiding autonomous driving or navigation along a road segment. Such target trajectories may be stored as three-dimensional splines. The target trajectories stored in sparse map <b>800</b> may be determined based on two or more reconstructed trajectories of prior traversals of vehicles along a particular road segment, for example. A road segment may be associated with a single target trajectory or multiple target trajectories. For example, on a two lane road, a first target trajectory may be stored to represent an intended path of travel along the road in a first direction, and a second target trajectory may be stored to represent an intended path of travel along the road in another direction (e.g., opposite to the first direction). Additional target trajectories may be stored with respect to a particular road segment. For example, on a multi-lane road one or more target trajectories may be stored representing intended paths of travel for vehicles in one or more lanes associated with the multi-lane road. In some embodiments, each lane of a multi-lane road may be associated with its own target trajectory. In other embodiments, there may be fewer target trajectories stored than lanes present on a multi-lane road. In such cases, a vehicle navigating the multi-lane road may use any of the stored target trajectories to guides its navigation by taking into account an amount of lane offset from a lane for which a target trajectory is stored (e.g., if a vehicle is traveling in the left most lane of a three lane highway, and a target trajectory is stored only for the middle lane of the highway, the vehicle may navigate using the target trajectory of the middle lane by accounting for the amount of lane offset between the middle lane and the left-most lane when generating navigational instructions).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">In some embodiments, the target trajectory may represent an ideal path that a vehicle should take as the vehicle travels. The target trajectory may be located, for example, at an approximate center of a lane of travel. In other cases, the target trajectory may be located elsewhere relative to a road segment. For example, a target trajectory may approximately coincide with a center of a road, an edge of a road, or an edge of a lane, etc. In such cases, navigation based on the target trajectory may include a determined amount of offset to be maintained relative to the location of the target trajectory. Moreover, in some embodiments, the determined amount of offset to be maintained relative to the location of the target trajectory may differ based on a type of vehicle (e.g., a passenger vehicle including two axles may have a different offset from a truck including more than two axles along at least a portion of the target trajectory).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Sparse map <b>800</b> may also include data relating to a plurality of predetermined landmarks <b>820</b> associated with particular road segments, local maps, etc. As discussed in greater detail below, these landmarks may be used in navigation of the autonomous vehicle. For example, in some embodiments, the landmarks may be used to determine a current position of the vehicle relative to a stored target trajectory. With this position information, the autonomous vehicle may be able to adjust a heading direction to match a direction of the target trajectory at the determined location.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">The plurality of landmarks <b>820</b> may be identified and stored in sparse map <b>800</b> at any suitable spacing. In some embodiments, landmarks may be stored at relatively high densities (e.g., every few meters or more). In some embodiments, however, significantly larger landmark spacing values may be employed. For example, in sparse map <b>800</b>, identified (or recognized) landmarks may be spaced apart by 10 meters, 20 meters, 50 meters, 100 meters, 1 kilometer, or 2 kilometers. In some cases, the identified landmarks may be located at distances of even more than 2 kilometers apart.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">Between landmarks, and therefore between determinations of vehicle position relative to a target trajectory, the vehicle may navigate based on dead reckoning in which the vehicle uses sensors to determine its ego motion and estimate its position relative to the target trajectory. Because errors may accumulate during navigation by dead reckoning, over time the position determinations relative to the target trajectory may become increasingly less accurate. The vehicle may use landmarks occurring in sparse map <b>800</b> (and their known locations) to remove the dead reckoning-induced errors in position determination. In this way, the identified landmarks included in sparse map <b>800</b> may serve as navigational anchors from which an accurate position of the vehicle relative to a target trajectory may be determined. Because a certain amount of error may be acceptable in position location, an identified landmark need not always be available to an autonomous vehicle. Rather, suitable navigation may be possible even based on landmark spacings, as noted above, of 10 meters, 20 meters, 50 meters, 100 meters, 500 meters, 1 kilometer, 2 kilometers, or more. In some embodiments, a density of 1 identified landmark every 1 km of road may be sufficient to maintain a longitudinal position determination accuracy within 1 m. Thus, not every potential landmark appearing along a road segment need be stored in sparse map <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">Moreover, in some embodiments, lane markings may be used for localization of the vehicle during landmark spacings. By using lane markings during landmark spacings, the accumulation of during navigation by dead reckoning may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">In addition to target trajectories and identified landmarks, sparse map <b>800</b> may include information relating to various other road features. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates a representation of curves along a particular road segment that may be stored in sparse map <b>800</b>. In some embodiments, a single lane of a road may be modeled by a three-dimensional polynomial description of left and right sides of the road. Such polynomials representing left and right sides of a single lane are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. Regardless of how many lanes a road may have, the road may be represented using polynomials in a way similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. For example, left and right sides of a multi-lane road may be represented by polynomials similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, and intermediate lane markings included on a multi-lane road (e.g., dashed markings representing lane boundaries, solid yellow lines representing boundaries between lanes traveling in different directions, etc.) may also be represented using polynomials such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, a lane <b>900</b> may be represented using polynomials (e.g., a first order, second order, third order, or any suitable order polynomials). For illustration, lane <b>900</b> is shown as a two-dimensional lane and the polynomials are shown as two-dimensional polynomials. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, lane <b>900</b> includes a left side <b>910</b> and a right side <b>920</b>. In some embodiments, more than one polynomial may be used to represent a location of each side of the road or lane boundary. For example, each of left side <b>910</b> and right side <b>920</b> may be represented by a plurality of polynomials of any suitable length. In some cases, the polynomials may have a length of about 100 m, although other lengths greater than or less than 100 m may also be used. Additionally, the polynomials can overlap with one another in order to facilitate seamless transitions in navigating based on subsequently encountered polynomials as a host vehicle travels along a roadway. For example, each of left side <b>910</b> and right side <b>920</b> may be represented by a plurality of third order polynomials separated into segments of about 100 meters in length (an example of the first predetermined range), and overlapping each other by about 50 meters. The polynomials representing the left side <b>910</b> and the right side <b>920</b> may or may not have the same order. For example, in some embodiments, some polynomials may be second order polynomials, some may be third order polynomials, and some may be fourth order polynomials.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, left side <b>910</b> of lane <b>900</b> is represented by two groups of third order polynomials. The first group includes polynomial segments <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, and <b>913</b>. The second group includes polynomial segments <b>914</b>, <b>915</b>, and <b>916</b>. The two groups, while substantially parallel to each other, follow the locations of their respective sides of the road. Polynomial segments <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, <b>913</b>, <b>914</b>, <b>915</b>, and <b>916</b> have a length of about 100 meters and overlap adjacent segments in the series by about 50 meters. As noted previously, however, polynomials of different lengths and different overlap amounts may also be used. For example, the polynomials may have lengths of 500 m, 1 km, or more, and the overlap amount may vary from 0 to 50 m, 50 m to 100 m, or greater than 100 m. Additionally, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is shown as representing polynomials extending in 2D space (e.g., on the surface of the paper), it is to be understood that these polynomials may represent curves extending in three dimensions (e.g., including a height component) to represent elevation changes in a road segment in addition to X-Y curvature. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, right side <b>920</b> of lane <b>900</b> is further represented by a first group having polynomial segments <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, and <b>923</b> and a second group having polynomial segments <b>924</b>, <b>925</b>, and <b>926</b>.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">Returning to the target trajectories of sparse map <b>800</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> shows a three-dimensional polynomial representing a target trajectory for a vehicle traveling along a particular road segment. The target trajectory represents not only the X-Y path that a host vehicle should travel along a particular road segment, but also the elevation change that the host vehicle will experience when traveling along the road segment. Thus, each target trajectory in sparse map <b>800</b> may be represented by one or more three-dimensional polynomials, like the three-dimensional polynomial <b>950</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. Sparse map <b>800</b> may include a plurality of trajectories (e.g., millions or billions or more to represent trajectories of vehicles along various road segments along roadways throughout the world). In some embodiments, each target trajectory may correspond to a spline connecting three-dimensional polynomial segments.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Regarding the data footprint of polynomial curves stored in sparse map <b>800</b>, in some embodiments, each third degree polynomial may be represented by four parameters, each requiring four bytes of data. Suitable representations may be obtained with third degree polynomials requiring about 192 bytes of data for every 100 m. This may translate to approximately 200 kB per hour in data usage/transfer requirements for a host vehicle traveling approximately 100 km/hr.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Sparse map <b>800</b> may describe the lanes network using a combination of geometry descriptors and meta-data. The geometry may be described by polynomials or splines as described above. The meta-data may describe the number of lanes, special characteristics (such as a car pool lane), and possibly other sparse labels. The total footprint of such indicators may be negligible.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Accordingly, a sparse map according to embodiments of the present disclosure may include at least one line representation of a road surface feature extending along the road segment, each line representation representing a path along the road segment substantially corresponding with the road surface feature. In some embodiments, as discussed above, the at least one line representation of the road surface feature may include a spline, a polynomial representation, or a curve. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the road surface feature may include at least one of a road edge or a lane marking. Moreover, as discussed below with respect to &#x201c;crowdsourcing,&#x201d; the road surface feature may be identified through image analysis of a plurality of images acquired as one or more vehicles traverse the road segment.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">As previously noted, sparse map <b>800</b> may include a plurality of predetermined landmarks associated with a road segment. Rather than storing actual images of the landmarks and relying, for example, on image recognition analysis based on captured images and stored images, each landmark in sparse map <b>800</b> may be represented and recognized using less data than a stored, actual image would require. Data representing landmarks may still include sufficient information for describing or identifying the landmarks along a road. Storing data describing characteristics of landmarks, rather than the actual images of landmarks, may reduce the size of sparse map <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates examples of types of landmarks that may be represented in sparse map <b>800</b>. The landmarks may include any visible and identifiable objects along a road segment. The landmarks may be selected such that they are fixed and do not change often with respect to their locations and/or content. The landmarks included in sparse map <b>800</b> may be useful in determining a location of vehicle <b>200</b> with respect to a target trajectory as the vehicle traverses a particular road segment. Examples of landmarks may include traffic signs, directional signs, general signs (e.g., rectangular signs), roadside fixtures (e.g., lampposts, reflectors, etc.), and any other suitable category. In some embodiments, lane marks on the road, may also be included as landmarks in sparse map <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Examples of landmarks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> include traffic signs, directional signs, roadside fixtures, and general signs. Traffic signs may include, for example, speed limit signs (e.g., speed limit sign <b>1000</b>), yield signs (e.g., yield sign <b>1005</b>), route number signs (e.g., route number sign <b>1010</b>), traffic light signs (e.g., traffic light sign <b>1015</b>), stop signs (e.g., stop sign <b>1020</b>). Directional signs may include a sign that includes one or more arrows indicating one or more directions to different places. For example, directional signs may include a highway sign <b>1025</b> having arrows for directing vehicles to different roads or places, an exit sign <b>1030</b> having an arrow directing vehicles off a road, etc. Accordingly, at least one of the plurality of landmarks may include a road sign.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">General signs may be unrelated to traffic. For example, general signs may include billboards used for advertisement, or a welcome board adjacent a border between two countries, states, counties, cities, or towns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a general sign <b>1040</b> (&#x201c;Joe's Restaurant&#x201d;). Although general sign <b>1040</b> may have a rectangular shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, general sign <b>1040</b> may have other shapes, such as square, circle, triangle, etc.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Landmarks may also include roadside fixtures. Roadside fixtures may be objects that are not signs, and may not be related to traffic or directions. For example, roadside fixtures may include lampposts (e.g., lamppost <b>1035</b>), power line posts, traffic light posts, etc.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Landmarks may also include beacons that may be specifically designed for usage in an autonomous vehicle navigation system. For example, such beacons may include stand-alone structures placed at predetermined intervals to aid in navigating a host vehicle. Such beacons may also include visual/graphical information added to existing road signs (e.g., icons, emblems, bar codes, etc.) that may be identified or recognized by a vehicle traveling along a road segment. Such beacons may also include electronic components. In such embodiments, electronic beacons (e.g., RFID tags, etc.) may be used to transmit non-visual information to a host vehicle. Such information may include, for example, landmark identification and/or landmark location information that a host vehicle may use in determining its position along a target trajectory.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">In some embodiments, the landmarks included in sparse map <b>800</b> may be represented by a data object of a predetermined size. The data representing a landmark may include any suitable parameters for identifying a particular landmark. For example, in some embodiments, landmarks stored in sparse map <b>800</b> may include parameters such as a physical size of the landmark (e.g., to support estimation of distance to the landmark based on a known size/scale), a distance to a previous landmark, lateral offset, height, a type code (e.g., a landmark type&#x2014;what type of directional sign, traffic sign, etc.), a GPS coordinate (e.g., to support global localization), and any other suitable parameters. Each parameter may be associated with a data size. For example, a landmark size may be stored using 8 bytes of data. A distance to a previous landmark, a lateral offset, and height may be specified using 12 bytes of data. A type code associated with a landmark such as a directional sign or a traffic sign may require about 2 bytes of data. For general signs, an image signature enabling identification of the general sign may be stored using 50 bytes of data storage. The landmark GPS position may be associated with 16 bytes of data storage. These data sizes for each parameter are examples only, and other data sizes may also be used.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Representing landmarks in sparse map <b>800</b> in this manner may offer a lean solution for efficiently representing landmarks in the database. In some embodiments, signs may be referred to as semantic signs and non-semantic signs. A semantic sign may include any class of signs for which there's a standardized meaning (e.g., speed limit signs, warning signs, directional signs, etc.). A non-semantic sign may include any sign that is not associated with a standardized meaning (e.g., general advertising signs, signs identifying business establishments, etc.). For example, each semantic sign may be represented with 38 bytes of data (e.g., 8 bytes for size; 12 bytes for distance to previous landmark, lateral offset, and height; 2 bytes for a type code; and 16 bytes for GPS coordinates). Sparse map <b>800</b> may use a tag system to represent landmark types. In some cases, each traffic sign or directional sign may be associated with its own tag, which may be stored in the database as part of the landmark identification. For example, the database may include on the order of 1000 different tags to represent various traffic signs and on the order of about 10000 different tags to represent directional signs. Of course, any suitable number of tags may be used, and additional tags may be created as needed. General purpose signs may be represented in some embodiments using less than about 100 bytes (e.g., about 86 bytes including 8 bytes for size; 12 bytes for distance to previous landmark, lateral offset, and height; 50 bytes for an image signature; and 16 bytes for GPS coordinates).</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Thus, for semantic road signs not requiring an image signature, the data density impact to sparse map <b>800</b>, even at relatively high landmark densities of about 1 per 50 m, may be on the order of about 760 bytes per kilometer (e.g., <b>20</b> landmarks per km&#xd7;38 bytes per landmark=760 bytes). Even for general purpose signs including an image signature component, the data density impact is about 1.72 kB per km (e.g., <b>20</b> landmarks per km&#xd7;86 bytes per landmark=1,720 bytes). For semantic road signs, this equates to about 76 kB per hour of data usage for a vehicle traveling 100 km/hr. For general purpose signs, this equates to about 170 kB per hour for a vehicle traveling 100 km/hr.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">In some embodiments, a generally rectangular object, such as a rectangular sign, may be represented in sparse map <b>800</b> by no more than 100 bytes of data. The representation of the generally rectangular object (e.g., general sign <b>1040</b>) in sparse map <b>800</b> may include a condensed image signature (e.g., condensed image signature <b>1045</b>) associated with the generally rectangular object. This condensed image signature may be used, for example, to aid in identification of a general purpose sign, for example, as a recognized landmark. Such a condensed image signature (e.g., image information derived from actual image data representing an object) may avoid a need for storage of an actual image of an object or a need for comparative image analysis performed on actual images in order to recognize landmarks.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, sparse map <b>800</b> may include or store a condensed image signature <b>1045</b> associated with a general sign <b>1040</b>, rather than an actual image of general sign <b>1040</b>. For example, after an image capture device (e.g., image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, or <b>126</b>) captures an image of general sign <b>1040</b>, a processor (e.g., image processor <b>190</b> or any other processor that can process images either aboard or remotely located relative to a host vehicle) may perform an image analysis to extract/create condensed image signature <b>1045</b> that includes a unique signature or pattern associated with general sign <b>1040</b>. In one embodiment, condensed image signature <b>1045</b> may include a shape, color pattern, a brightness pattern, or any other feature that may be extracted from the image of general sign <b>1040</b> for describing general sign <b>1040</b>.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the circles, triangles, and stars shown in condensed image signature <b>1045</b> may represent areas of different colors. The pattern represented by the circles, triangles, and stars may be stored in sparse map <b>800</b>, e.g., within the 50 bytes designated to include an image signature. Notably, the circles, triangles, and stars are not necessarily meant to indicate that such shapes are stored as part of the image signature. Rather, these shapes are meant to conceptually represent recognizable areas having discernible color differences, textual areas, graphical shapes, or other variations in characteristics that may be associated with a general purpose sign. Such condensed image signatures can be used to identify a landmark in the form of a general sign. For example, the condensed image signature can be used to perform a same-not-same analysis based on a comparison of a stored condensed image signature with image data captured, for example, using a camera onboard an autonomous vehicle.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Accordingly, the plurality of landmarks may be identified through image analysis of the plurality of images acquired as one or more vehicles traverse the road segment. As explained below with respect to &#x201c;crowdsourcing,&#x201d; in some embodiments, the image analysis to identify the plurality of landmarks may include accepting potential landmarks when a ratio of images in which the landmark does appear to images in which the landmark does not appear exceeds a threshold. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the image analysis to identify the plurality of landmarks may include rejecting potential landmarks when a ratio of images in which the landmark does not appear to images in which the landmark does appear exceeds a threshold.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Returning to the target trajectories a host vehicle may use to navigate a particular road segment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> shows polynomial representations trajectories capturing during a process of building or maintaining sparse map <b>800</b>.

For example, in some embodiments, different trajectories may be generated based on different user preferences and/or profiles. Sparse map <b>800</b> including such different trajectories may be provided to different autonomous vehicles of different users. For example, some users may prefer to avoid toll roads, while others may prefer to take the shortest or fastest routes, regardless of whether there is a toll road on the route. The disclosed systems may generate different sparse maps with different trajectories based on such different user preferences or profiles. As another example, some users may prefer to travel in a fast moving lane, while others may prefer to maintain a position in the central lane at all times.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">Different trajectories may be generated and included in sparse map <b>800</b> based on different environmental conditions, such as day and night, snow, rain, fog, etc. Autonomous vehicles driving under different environmental conditions may be provided with sparse map <b>800</b> generated based on such different environmental conditions. In some embodiments, cameras provided on autonomous vehicles may detect the environmental conditions, and may provide such information back to a server that generates and provides sparse maps. For example, the server may generate or update an already generated sparse map <b>800</b> to include trajectories that may be more suitable or safer for autonomous driving under the detected environmental conditions. The update of sparse map <b>800</b> based on environmental conditions may be performed dynamically as the autonomous vehicles are traveling along roads.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Other different parameters relating to driving may also be used as a basis for generating and providing different sparse maps to different autonomous vehicles. For example, when an autonomous vehicle is traveling at a high speed, turns may be tighter. Trajectories associated with specific lanes, rather than roads, may be included in sparse map <b>800</b> such that the autonomous vehicle may maintain within a specific lane as the vehicle follows a specific trajectory. When an image captured by a camera onboard the autonomous vehicle indicates that the vehicle has drifted outside of the lane (e.g., crossed the lane mark), an action may be triggered within the vehicle to bring the vehicle back to the designated lane according to the specific trajectory.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">Crowdsourcing a Sparse Map</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In some embodiments, the disclosed systems and methods may generate a sparse map for autonomous vehicle navigation. For example, disclosed systems and methods may use crowdsourced data for generation of a sparse that one or more autonomous vehicles may use to navigate along a system of roads. As used herein, &#x201c;crowdsourcing&#x201d; means that data are received from various vehicles (e.g., autonomous vehicles) travelling on a road segment at different times, and such data are used to generate and/or update the road model. The model may, in turn, be transmitted to the vehicles or other vehicles later travelling along the road segment for assisting autonomous vehicle navigation. The road model may include a plurality of target trajectories representing preferred trajectories that autonomous vehicles should follow as they traverse a road segment. The target trajectories may be the same as a reconstructed actual trajectory collected from a vehicle traversing a road segment, which may be transmitted from the vehicle to a server. In some embodiments, the target trajectories may be different from actual trajectories that one or more vehicles previously took when traversing a road segment. The target trajectories may be generated based on actual trajectories (e.g., through averaging or any other suitable operation).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">The vehicle trajectory data that a vehicle may upload to a server may correspond with the actual reconstructed trajectory for the vehicle or may correspond to a recommended trajectory, which may be based on or related to the actual reconstructed trajectory of the vehicle, but may differ from the actual reconstructed trajectory. For example, vehicles may modify their actual, reconstructed trajectories and submit (e.g., recommend) to the server the modified actual trajectories. The road model may use the recommended, modified trajectories as target trajectories for autonomous navigation of other vehicles.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">In addition to trajectory information, other information for potential use in building a sparse data map <b>800</b> may include information relating to potential landmark candidates. For example, through crowd sourcing of information, the disclosed systems and methods may identify potential landmarks in an environment and refine landmark positions. The landmarks may be used by a navigation system of autonomous vehicles to determine and/or adjust the position of the vehicle along the target trajectories.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">The reconstructed trajectories that a vehicle may generate as the vehicle travels along a road may be obtained by any suitable method. In some embodiments, the reconstructed trajectories may be developed by stitching together segments of motion for the vehicle, using, e.g., ego motion estimation (e.g., three dimensional translation and three dimensional rotation of the camera, and hence the body of the vehicle). The rotation and translation estimation may be determined based on analysis of images captured by one or more image capture devices along with information from other sensors or devices, such as inertial sensors and speed sensors. For example, the inertial sensors may include an accelerometer or other suitable sensors configured to measure changes in translation and/or rotation of the vehicle body. The vehicle may include a speed sensor that measures a speed of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">In some embodiments, the ego motion of the camera (and hence the vehicle body) may be estimated based on an optical flow analysis of the captured images. An optical flow analysis of a sequence of images identifies movement of pixels from the sequence of images, and based on the identified movement, determines motions of the vehicle. The ego motion may be integrated over time and along the road segment to reconstruct a trajectory associated with the road segment that the vehicle has followed.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Data (e.g., reconstructed trajectories) collected by multiple vehicles in multiple drives along a road segment at different times may be used to construct the road model (e.g., including the target trajectories, etc.) included in sparse data map <b>800</b>. Data collected by multiple vehicles in multiple drives along a road segment at different times may also be averaged to increase an accuracy of the model. In some embodiments, data regarding the road geometry and/or landmarks may be received from multiple vehicles that travel through the common road segment at different times. Such data received from different vehicles may be combined to generate the road model and/or to update the road model.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">The geometry of a reconstructed trajectory (and also a target trajectory) along a road segment may be represented by a curve in three dimensional space, which may be a spline connecting three dimensional polynomials. The reconstructed trajectory curve may be determined from analysis of a video stream or a plurality of images captured by a camera installed on the vehicle. In some embodiments, a location is identified in each frame or image that is a few meters ahead of the current position of the vehicle. This location is where the vehicle is expected to travel to in a predetermined time period. This operation may be repeated frame by frame, and at the same time, the vehicle may compute the camera's ego motion (rotation and translation). At each frame or image, a short range model for the desired path is generated by the vehicle in a reference frame that is attached to the camera. The short range models may be stitched together to obtain a three dimensional model of the road in some coordinate frame, which may be an arbitrary or predetermined coordinate frame. The three dimensional model of the road may then be fitted by a spline, which may include or connect one or more polynomials of suitable orders.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">To conclude the short range road model at each frame, one or more detection modules may be used. For example, a bottom-up lane detection module may be used. The bottom-up lane detection module may be useful when lane marks are drawn on the road. This module may look for edges in the image and assembles them together to form the lane marks. A second module may be used together with the bottom-up lane detection module. The second module is an end-to-end deep neural network, which may be trained to predict the correct short range path from an input image. In both modules, the road model may be detected in the image coordinate frame and transformed to a three dimensional space that may be virtually attached to the camera.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">Although the reconstructed trajectory modeling method may introduce an accumulation of errors due to the integration of ego motion over a long period of time, which may include a noise component, such errors may be inconsequential as the generated model may provide sufficient accuracy for navigation over a local scale. In addition, it is possible to cancel the integrated error by using external sources of information, such as satellite images or geodetic measurements. For example, the disclosed systems and methods may use a GNSS receiver to cancel accumulated errors. However, the GNSS positioning signals may not be always available and accurate. The disclosed systems and methods may enable a steering application that depends weakly on the availability and accuracy of GNSS positioning. In such systems, the usage of the GNSS signals may be limited. For example, in some embodiments, the disclosed systems may use the GNSS signals for database indexing purposes only.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">In some embodiments, the range scale (e.g., local scale) that may be relevant for an autonomous vehicle navigation steering application may be on the order of 50 meters, 100 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, etc. Such distances may be used, as the geometrical road model is mainly used for two purposes: planning the trajectory ahead and localizing the vehicle on the road model. In some embodiments, the planning task may use the model over a typical range of 40 meters ahead (or any other suitable distance ahead, such as 20 meters, 30 meters, 50 meters), when the control algorithm steers the vehicle according to a target point located 1.3 seconds ahead (or any other time such as 1.5 seconds, 1.7 seconds, 2 seconds, etc.). The localization task uses the road model over a typical range of 60 meters behind the car (or any other suitable distances, such as 50 meters, 100 meters, 150 meters, etc.), according to a method called &#x201c;tail alignment&#x201d; described in more detail in another section. The disclosed systems and methods may generate a geometrical model that has sufficient accuracy over particular range, such as 100 meters, such that a planned trajectory will not deviate by more than, for example, 30 cm from the lane center.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">As explained above, a three dimensional road model may be constructed from detecting short range sections and stitching them together. The stitching may be enabled by computing a six degree ego motion model, using the videos and/or images captured by the camera, data from the inertial sensors that reflect the motions of the vehicle, and the host vehicle velocity signal. The accumulated error may be small enough over some local range scale, such as of the order of 100 meters. All this may be completed in a single drive over a particular road segment.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">In some embodiments, multiple drives may be used to average the resulted model, and to increase its accuracy further. The same car may travel the same route multiple times, or multiple cars may send their collected model data to a central server. In any case, a matching procedure may be performed to identify overlapping models and to enable averaging in order to generate target trajectories. The constructed model (e.g., including the target trajectories) may be used for steering once a convergence criterion is met. Subsequent drives may be used for further model improvements and in order to accommodate infrastructure changes.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">Sharing of driving experience (such as sensed data) between multiple cars becomes feasible if they are connected to a central server. Each vehicle client may store a partial copy of a universal road model, which may be relevant for its current position. A bidirectional update procedure between the vehicles and the server may be performed by the vehicles and the server. The small footprint concept discussed above enables the disclosed systems and methods to perform the bidirectional updates using a very small bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">Information relating to potential landmarks may also be determined and forwarded to a central server. For example, the disclosed systems and methods may determine one or more physical properties of a potential landmark based on one or more images that include the landmark. The physical properties may include a physical size (e.g., height, width) of the landmark, a distance from a vehicle to a landmark, a distance between the landmark to a previous landmark, the lateral position of the landmark (e.g., the position of the landmark relative to the lane of travel), the GPS coordinates of the landmark, a type of landmark, identification of text on the landmark, etc. For example, a vehicle may analyze one or more images captured by a camera to detect a potential landmark, such as a speed limit sign.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">The vehicle may determine a distance from the vehicle to the landmark based on the analysis of the one or more images. In some embodiments, the distance may be determined based on analysis of images of the landmark using a suitable image analysis method, such as a scaling method and/or an optical flow method. In some embodiments, the disclosed systems and methods may be configured to determine a type or classification of a potential landmark. In case the vehicle determines that a certain potential landmark corresponds to a predetermined type or classification stored in a sparse map, it may be sufficient for the vehicle to communicate to the server an indication of the type or classification of the landmark, along with its location. The server may store such indications. At a later time, other vehicles may capture an image of the landmark, process the image (e.g., using a classifier), and compare the result from processing the image to the indication stored in the server with regard to the type of landmark. There may be various types of landmarks, and different types of landmarks may be associated with different types of data to be uploaded to and stored in the server, different processing onboard the vehicle may detects the landmark and communicate information about the landmark to the server, and the system onboard the vehicle may receive the landmark data from the server and use the landmark data for identifying a landmark in autonomous navigation.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">In some embodiments, multiple autonomous vehicles travelling on a road segment may communicate with a server. The vehicles (or clients) may generate a curve describing its drive (e.g., through ego motion integration) in an arbitrary coordinate frame. The vehicles may detect landmarks and locate them in the same frame. The vehicles may upload the curve and the landmarks to the server. The server may collect data from vehicles over multiple drives, and generate a unified road model. For example, as discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the server may generate a sparse map having the unified road model using the uploaded curves and landmarks.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">The server may also distribute the model to clients (e.g., vehicles). For example, the server may distribute the sparse map to one or more vehicles. The server may continuously or periodically update the model when receiving new data from the vehicles. For example, the server may process the new data to evaluate whether the data includes information that should trigger an updated, or creation of new data on the server. The server may distribute the updated model or the updates to the vehicles for providing autonomous vehicle navigation.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">The server may use one or more criteria for determining whether new data received from the vehicles should trigger an update to the model or trigger creation of new data. For example, when the new data indicates that a previously recognized landmark at a specific location no longer exists, or is replaced by another landmark, the server may determine that the new data should trigger an update to the model. As another example, when the new data indicates that a road segment has been closed, and when this has been corroborated by data received from other vehicles, the server may determine that the new data should trigger an update to the model.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">The server may distribute the updated model (or the updated portion of the model) to one or more vehicles that are traveling on the road segment, with which the updates to the model are associated. The server may also distribute the updated model to vehicles that are about to travel on the road segment, or vehicles whose planned trip includes the road segment, with which the updates to the model are associated. For example, while an autonomous vehicle is traveling along another road segment before reaching the road segment with which an update is associated, the server may distribute the updates or updated model to the autonomous vehicle before the vehicle reaches the road segment.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">In some embodiments, the remote server may collect trajectories and landmarks from multiple clients (e.g., vehicles that travel along a common road segment). The server may match curves using landmarks and create an average road model based on the trajectories collected from the multiple vehicles. The server may also compute a graph of roads and the most probable path at each node or conjunction of the road segment. For example, the remote server may align the trajectories to generate a crowdsourced sparse map from the collected trajectories.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">The server may average landmark properties received from multiple vehicles that travelled along the common road segment, such as the distances between one landmark to another (e.g., a previous one along the road segment) as measured by multiple vehicles, to determine an arc-length parameter and support localization along the path and speed calibration for each client vehicle. The server may average the physical dimensions of a landmark measured by multiple vehicles travelled along the common road segment and recognized the same landmark. The averaged physical dimensions may be used to support distance estimation, such as the distance from the vehicle to the landmark. The server may average lateral positions of a landmark (e.g., position from the lane in which vehicles are travelling in to the landmark) measured by multiple vehicles travelled along the common road segment and recognized the same landmark. The averaged lateral potion may be used to support lane assignment. The server may average the GPS coordinates of the landmark measured by multiple vehicles travelled along the same road segment and recognized the same landmark. The averaged GPS coordinates of the landmark may be used to support global localization or positioning of the landmark in the road model.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">In some embodiments, the server may identify model changes, such as constructions, detours, new signs, removal of signs, etc., based on data received from the vehicles. The server may continuously or periodically or instantaneously update the model upon receiving new data from the vehicles. The server may distribute updates to the model or the updated model to vehicles for providing autonomous navigation. For example, as discussed further below, the server may use crowdsourced data to filter out &#x201c;ghost&#x201d; landmarks detected by vehicles.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">In some embodiments, the server may analyze driver interventions during the autonomous driving. The server may analyze data received from the vehicle at the time and location where intervention occurs, and/or data received prior to the time the intervention occurred. The server may identify certain portions of the data that caused or are closely related to the intervention, for example, data indicating a temporary lane closure setup, data indicating a pedestrian in the road. The server may update the model based on the identified data. For example, the server may modify one or more trajectories stored in the model.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a system that uses crowdsourcing to generate a sparse map (as well as distribute and navigate using a crowdsourced sparse map). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a road segment <b>1200</b> that includes one or more lanes. A plurality of vehicles <b>1205</b>, <b>1210</b>, <b>1215</b>, <b>1220</b>, and <b>1225</b> may travel on road segment <b>1200</b> at the same time or at different times (although shown as appearing on road segment <b>1200</b> at the same time in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).

For example, vehicles <b>1205</b>, <b>1210</b>, <b>1215</b>, <b>1220</b>, and <b>1225</b> may transmit position measurements data to server <b>1230</b>, which may average the position measurements and use the averaged position measurement as the position of the landmark. The position of the landmark may be continuously refined by measurements received from vehicles in subsequent drives.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">The identification of the landmark may include a size of the landmark. The processor provided on a vehicle (e.g., <b>1205</b>) may estimate the physical size of the landmark based on the analysis of the images. Server <b>1230</b> may receive multiple estimates of the physical size of the same landmark from different vehicles over different drives. Server <b>1230</b> may average the different estimates to arrive at a physical size for the landmark, and store that landmark size in the road model. The physical size estimate may be used to further determine or estimate a distance from the vehicle to the landmark. The distance to the landmark may be estimated based on the current speed of the vehicle and a scale of expansion based on the position of the landmark appearing in the images relative to the focus of expansion of the camera. For example, the distance to landmark may be estimated by Z=V*dt*R/D, where V is the speed of vehicle, R is the distance in the image from the landmark at time t<b>1</b> to the focus of expansion, and D is the change in distance for the landmark in the image from t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>. dt represents the (t<b>2</b>&#x2212;t<b>1</b>). For example, the distance to landmark may be estimated by Z=V*dt*R/D, where V is the speed of vehicle, R is the distance in the image between the landmark and the focus of expansion, dt is a time interval, and D is the image displacement of the landmark along the epipolar line. Other equations equivalent to the above equation, such as Z=V*&#x3c9;/&#x394;w, may be used for estimating the distance to the landmark. Here, V is the vehicle speed, &#x3c9; is an image length (like the object width), and Aw is the change of that image length in a unit of time.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">When the physical size of the landmark is known, the distance to the landmark may also be determined based on the following equation: Z=f*W/&#x3c9;, where f is the focal length, W is the size of the landmark (e.g., height or width), w is the number of pixels when the landmark leaves the image. From the above equation, a change in distance Z may be calculated using &#x394;Z=f*W*&#x394;&#x3c9;/&#x3c9;<sup>2</sup>+f*&#x394;W/&#x3c9;, where &#x394;W decays to zero by averaging, and where &#x394;&#x3c9; is the number of pixels representing a bounding box accuracy in the image. A value estimating the physical size of the landmark may be calculated by averaging multiple observations at the server side. The resulting error in distance estimation may be very small. There are two sources of error that may occur when using the formula above, namely &#x394;W and &#x394;&#x3c9;. Their contribution to the distance error is given by &#x394;Z=f*W*&#x394;&#x3c9;/&#x3c9;<sup>2</sup>+f*&#x394;W/&#x3c9;. However, &#x394;W decays to zero by averaging; hence &#x394;Z is determined by &#x394;&#x3c9; (e.g., the inaccuracy of the bounding box in the image).</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">For landmarks of unknown dimensions, the distance to the landmark may be estimated by tracking feature points on the landmark between successive frames. For example, certain features appearing on a speed limit sign may be tracked between two or more image frames. Based on these tracked features, a distance distribution per feature point may be generated. The distance estimate may be extracted from the distance distribution. For example, the most frequent distance appearing in the distance distribution may be used as the distance estimate. As another example, the average of the distance distribution may be used as the distance estimate.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates an example autonomous vehicle road navigation model represented by a plurality of three dimensional splines <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b>, and <b>1303</b>.

Trajectories clustered by lane assignment may be useful for identifying lanes along the roadways. In some embodiments, both criteria (e.g., absolute heading and lane assignment) may be used for clustering.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">In each cluster <b>2205</b>, <b>2210</b>, <b>2215</b>, <b>2220</b>, <b>2225</b>, and <b>2230</b>, trajectories may be averaged to obtain a target trajectory associated with the specific cluster. For example, the trajectories from multiple drives associated with the same lane cluster may be averaged. The averaged trajectory may be a target trajectory associate with a specific lane. To average a cluster of trajectories, server <b>1230</b> may select a reference frame of an arbitrary trajectory C<b>0</b>.

As discussed in greater detail below, these mapped lane marks may be used when the autonomous vehicle navigates. For example, in some embodiments, the mapped lane marks may be used to determine a lateral position and/or orientation relative to a planned trajectory. With this position information, the autonomous vehicle may be able to adjust a heading direction to match a direction of a target trajectory at the determined position.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0322">Vehicle <b>200</b> may be configured to detect lane marks in a given road segment. The road segment may include any markings on a road for guiding vehicle traffic on a roadway. For example, the lane marks may be continuous or dashed lines demarking the edge of a lane of travel. The lane marks may also include double lines, such as a double continuous lines, double dashed lines or a combination of continuous and dashed lines indicating, for example, whether passing is permitted in an adjacent lane. The lane marks may also include freeway entrance and exit markings indicating, for example, a deceleration lane for an exit ramp or dotted lines indicating that a lane is turn-only or that the lane is ending. The markings may further indicate a work zone, a temporary lane shift, a path of travel through an intersection, a median, a special purpose lane (e.g., a bike lane, HOV lane, etc.), or other miscellaneous markings (e.g., crosswalk, a speed hump, a railway crossing, a stop line, etc.).</p><p id="p-0324" num="0323">Vehicle <b>200</b> may use cameras, such as image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> included in image acquisition unit <b>120</b>, to capture images of the surrounding lane marks. Vehicle <b>200</b> may analyze the images to detect point locations associated with the lane marks based on features identified within one or more of the captured images. These point locations may be uploaded to a server to represent the lane marks in sparse map <b>800</b>. Depending on the position and field of view of the camera, lane marks may be detected for both sides of the vehicle simultaneously from a single image. In other embodiments, different cameras may be used to capture images on multiple sides of the vehicle. Rather than uploading actual images of the lane marks, the marks may be stored in sparse map <b>800</b> as a spline or a series of points, thus reducing the size of sparse map <b>800</b> and/or the data that must be uploaded remotely by the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0324"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-<b>24</b>D</figref> illustrate exemplary point locations that may be detected by vehicle <b>200</b> to represent particular lane marks. Similar to the landmarks described above, vehicle <b>200</b> may use various image recognition algorithms or software to identify point locations within a captured image. For example, vehicle <b>200</b> may recognize a series of edge points, corner points or various other point locations associated with a particular lane mark. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref> shows a continuous lane mark <b>2410</b> that may be detected by vehicle <b>200</b>. Lane mark <b>2410</b> may represent the outside edge of a roadway, represented by a continuous white line. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>, vehicle <b>200</b> may be configured to detect a plurality of edge location points <b>2411</b> along the lane mark. Location points <b>2411</b> may be collected to represent the lane mark at any intervals sufficient to create a mapped lane mark in the sparse map. For example, the lane mark may be represented by one point per meter of the detected edge, one point per every five meters of the detected edge, or at other suitable spacings. In some embodiments, the spacing may be determined by other factors, rather than at set intervals such as, for example, based on points where vehicle <b>200</b> has a highest confidence ranking of the location of the detected points. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref> shows edge location points on an interior edge of lane mark <b>2410</b>, points may be collected on the outside edge of the line or along both edges. Further, while a single line is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>, similar edge points may be detected for a double continuous line. For example, points <b>2411</b> may be detected along an edge of one or both of the continuous lines.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0325">Vehicle <b>200</b> may also represent lane marks differently depending on the type or shape of lane mark. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref> shows an exemplary dashed lane mark <b>2420</b> that may be detected by vehicle <b>200</b>. Rather than identifying edge points, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>, vehicle may detect a series of corner points <b>2421</b> representing corners of the lane dashes to define the full boundary of the dash. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref> shows each corner of a given dash marking being located, vehicle <b>200</b> may detect or upload a subset of the points shown in the figure. For example, vehicle <b>200</b> may detect the leading edge or leading corner of a given dash mark, or may detect the two corner points nearest the interior of the lane. Further, not every dash mark may be captured, for example, vehicle <b>200</b> may capture and/or record points representing a sample of dash marks (e.g., every other, every third, every fifth, etc.) or dash marks at a predefined spacing (e.g., every meter, every five meters, every 10 meters, etc.) Corner points may also be detected for similar lane marks, such as markings showing a lane is for an exit ramp, that a particular lane is ending, or other various lane marks that may have detectable corner points. Corner points may also be detected for lane marks consisting of double dashed lines or a combination of continuous and dashed lines.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0326">In some embodiments, the points uploaded to the server to generate the mapped lane marks may represent other points besides the detected edge points or corner points. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>C</figref> illustrates a series of points that may represent a centerline of a given lane mark. For example, continuous lane <b>2410</b> may be represented by centerline points <b>2441</b> along a centerline <b>2440</b> of the lane mark. In some embodiments, vehicle <b>200</b> may be configured to detect these center points using various image recognition techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features, or other techniques. Alternatively, vehicle <b>200</b> may detect other points, such as edge points <b>2411</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>, and may calculate centerline points <b>2441</b>, for example, by detecting points along each edge and determining a midpoint between the edge points. Similarly, dashed lane mark <b>2420</b> may be represented by centerline points <b>2451</b> along a centerline <b>2450</b> of the lane mark. The centerline points may be located at the edge of a dash, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>C</figref>, or at various other locations along the centerline. For example, each dash may be represented by a single point in the geometric center of the dash. The points may also be spaced at a predetermined interval along the centerline (e.g., every meter, 5 meters, 10 meters, etc.). The centerline points <b>2451</b> may be detected directly by vehicle <b>200</b>, or may be calculated based on other detected reference points, such as corner points <b>2421</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref>. A centerline may also be used to represent other lane mark types, such as a double line, using similar techniques as above.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0327">In some embodiments, vehicle <b>200</b> may identify points representing other features, such as a vertex between two intersecting lane marks. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>D</figref> shows exemplary points representing an intersection between two lane marks <b>2460</b> and <b>2465</b>. Vehicle <b>200</b> may calculate a vertex point <b>2466</b> representing an intersection between the two lane marks. For example, one of lane marks <b>2460</b> or <b>2465</b> may represent a train crossing area or other crossing area in the road segment. While lane marks <b>2460</b> and <b>2465</b> are shown as crossing each other perpendicularly, various other configurations may be detected. For example, the lane marks <b>2460</b> and <b>2465</b> may cross at other angles, or one or both of the lane marks may terminate at the vertex point <b>2466</b>. Similar techniques may also be applied for intersections between dashed or other lane mark types. In addition to vertex point <b>2466</b>, various other points <b>2467</b> may also be detected, providing further information about the orientation of lane marks <b>2460</b> and <b>2465</b>.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0328">Vehicle <b>200</b> may associate real-world coordinates with each detected point of the lane mark. For example, location identifiers may be generated, including coordinate for each point, to upload to a server for mapping the lane mark. The location identifiers may further include other identifying information about the points, including whether the point represents a corner point, an edge point, center point, etc. Vehicle <b>200</b> may therefore be configured to determine a real-world position of each point based on analysis of the images. For example, vehicle <b>200</b> may detect other features in the image, such as the various landmarks described above, to locate the real-world position of the lane marks. This may involve determining the location of the lane marks in the image relative to the detected landmark or determining the position of the vehicle based on the detected landmark and then determining a distance from the vehicle (or target trajectory of the vehicle) to the lane mark. When a landmark is not available, the location of the lane mark points may be determined relative to a position of the vehicle determined based on dead reckoning. The real-world coordinates included in the location identifiers may be represented as absolute coordinates (e.g., latitude/longitude coordinates), or may be relative to other features, such as based on a longitudinal position along a target trajectory and a lateral distance from the target trajectory. The location identifiers may then be uploaded to a server for generation of the mapped lane marks in the navigation model (such as sparse map <b>800</b>). In some embodiments, the server may construct a spline representing the lane marks of a road segment. Alternatively, vehicle <b>200</b> may generate the spline and upload it to the server to be recorded in the navigational model.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0329"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>E</figref> shows an exemplary navigation model or sparse map for a corresponding road segment that includes mapped lane marks. The sparse map may include a target trajectory <b>2475</b> for a vehicle to follow along a road segment. As described above, target trajectory <b>2475</b> may represent an ideal path for a vehicle to take as it travels the corresponding road segment, or may be located elsewhere on the road (e.g., a centerline of the road, etc.). Target trajectory <b>2475</b> may be calculated in the various methods described above, for example, based on an aggregation (e.g., a weighted combination) of two or more reconstructed trajectories of vehicles traversing the same road segment.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0330">In some embodiments, the target trajectory may be generated equally for all vehicle types and for all road, vehicle, and/or environment conditions. In other embodiments, however, various other factors or variables may also be considered in generating the target trajectory. A different target trajectory may be generated for different types of vehicles (e.g., a private car, a light truck, and a full trailer). For example, a target trajectory with relatively tighter turning radii may be generated for a small private car than a larger semi-trailer truck. In some embodiments, road, vehicle and environmental conditions may be considered as well. For example, a different target trajectory may be generated for different road conditions (e.g., wet, snowy, icy, dry, etc.), vehicle conditions (e.g., tire condition or estimated tire condition, brake condition or estimated brake condition, amount of fuel remaining, etc.) or environmental factors (e.g., time of day, visibility, weather, etc.). The target trajectory may also depend on one or more aspects or features of a particular road segment (e.g., speed limit, frequency and size of turns, grade, etc.). In some embodiments, various user settings may also be used to determine the target trajectory, such as a set driving mode (e.g., desired driving aggressiveness, economy mode, etc.).</p><p id="p-0332" num="0331">The sparse map may also include mapped lane marks <b>2470</b> and <b>2480</b> representing lane marks along the road segment.

As described above, the location identifiers may include locations in real world coordinates of points associated with a detected lane mark. Similar to the target trajectory in the model, the lane marks may also include elevation data and may be represented as a curve in three-dimensional space. For example, the curve may be a spline connecting three dimensional polynomials of suitable order the curve may be calculated based on the location identifiers. The mapped lane marks may also include other information or metadata about the lane mark, such as an identifier of the type of lane mark (e.g., between two lanes with the same direction of travel, between two lanes of opposite direction of travel, edge of a roadway, etc.) and/or other characteristics of the lane mark (e.g., continuous, dashed, single line, double line, yellow, white, etc.). In some embodiments, the mapped lane marks may be continuously updated within the model, for example, using crowdsourcing techniques. The same vehicle may upload location identifiers during multiple occasions of travelling the same road segment or data may be selected from a plurality of vehicles (such as <b>1205</b>, <b>1210</b>, <b>1215</b>, <b>1220</b>, and <b>1225</b>) travelling the road segment at different times. Sparse map <b>800</b> may then be updated or refined based on subsequent location identifiers received from the vehicles and stored in the system. As the mapped lane marks are updated and refined, the updated road navigation model and/or sparse map may be distributed to a plurality of autonomous vehicles.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0332">Generating the mapped lane marks in the sparse map may also include detecting and/or mitigating errors based on anomalies in the images or in the actual lane marks themselves. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>F</figref> shows an exemplary anomaly <b>2495</b> associated with detecting a lane mark <b>2490</b>. Anomaly <b>2495</b> may appear in the image captured by vehicle <b>200</b>, for example, from an object obstructing the camera's view of the lane mark, debris on the lens, etc. In some instances, the anomaly may be due to the lane mark itself, which may be damaged or worn away, or partially covered, for example, by dirt, debris, water, snow or other materials on the road. Anomaly <b>2495</b> may result in an erroneous point <b>2491</b> being detected by vehicle <b>200</b>. Sparse map <b>800</b> may provide the correct the mapped lane mark and exclude the error. In some embodiments, vehicle <b>200</b> may detect erroneous point <b>2491</b> for example, by detecting anomaly <b>2495</b> in the image, or by identifying the error based on detected lane mark points before and after the anomaly. Based on detecting the anomaly, the vehicle may omit point <b>2491</b> or may adjust it to be in line with other detected points. In other embodiments, the error may be corrected after the point has been uploaded, for example, by determining the point is outside of an expected threshold based on other points uploaded during the same trip, or based on an aggregation of data from previous trips along the same road segment.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0333">The mapped lane marks in the navigation model and/or sparse map may also be used for navigation by an autonomous vehicle traversing the corresponding roadway. For example, a vehicle navigating along a target trajectory may periodically use the mapped lane marks in the sparse map to align itself with the target trajectory. As mentioned above, between landmarks the vehicle may navigate based on dead reckoning in which the vehicle uses sensors to determine its ego motion and estimate its position relative to the target trajectory. Errors may accumulate over time and vehicle's position determinations relative to the target trajectory may become increasingly less accurate. Accordingly, the vehicle may use lane marks occurring in sparse map <b>800</b> (and their known locations) to reduce the dead reckoning-induced errors in position determination. In this way, the identified lane marks included in sparse map <b>800</b> may serve as navigational anchors from which an accurate position of the vehicle relative to a target trajectory may be determined.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0334"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref> shows an exemplary image <b>2500</b> of a vehicle's surrounding environment that may be used for navigation based on the mapped lane marks.

Various points <b>2511</b> may be detected corresponding to features of the lane mark in the image. Points <b>2511</b>, for example, may correspond to an edge of the lane mark, a corner of the lane mark, a midpoint of the lane mark, a vertex between two intersecting lane marks, or various other features or locations. Points <b>2511</b> may be detected to correspond to a location of points stored in a navigation model received from a server. For example, if a sparse map is received containing points that represent a centerline of a mapped lane mark, points <b>2511</b> may also be detected based on a centerline of lane mark <b>2510</b>.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0336">The vehicle may also be configured to determine a longitudinal position represented by element <b>2520</b> and located along a target trajectory. Longitudinal position <b>2520</b> may be determined from image <b>2500</b>, for example, by detecting landmark <b>2521</b> within image <b>2500</b> and comparing a measured location to a known landmark location stored in the road model or sparse map <b>800</b>. The location of the vehicle along a target trajectory may then be determined based on the distance to the landmark and the landmark's known location. The longitudinal position <b>2520</b> may also be determined from images other than those used to determine the position of a lane mark. For example, longitudinal position <b>2520</b> may be determined by detecting landmarks in images from other cameras within image acquisition unit <b>120</b> taken simultaneously or near simultaneously to image <b>2500</b>. In some instances, the vehicle may not be near any landmarks or other reference points for determining longitudinal position <b>2520</b>. In such instances, the vehicle may be navigating based on dead reckoning and thus may use sensors to determine its ego motion and estimate a longitudinal position <b>2520</b> relative to the target trajectory. The vehicle may also be configured to determine a distance <b>2530</b> representing the actual distance between the vehicle and lane mark <b>2510</b> observed in the captured image(s). The camera angle, the speed of the vehicle, the width of the vehicle, or various other factors may be accounted for in determining distance <b>2530</b>.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0337"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref> illustrates a lateral localization correction of the vehicle based on the mapped lane marks in a road navigation model.

Additional data may also be received during step <b>2610</b>, such as accelerometer data, speed data, landmarks data, road geometry or profile data, vehicle positioning data, ego motion data, or various other forms of data described above. The location identifiers may be generated by a vehicle, such as vehicles <b>1205</b>, <b>1210</b>, <b>1215</b>, <b>1220</b>, and <b>1225</b>, based on images captured by the vehicle.

As described above, the lane mark may include a variety of different marking types, and the location identifiers may correspond to a variety of points relative to the lane mark. For example, where the detected lane mark is part of a dashed line marking a lane boundary, the points may correspond to detected corners of the lane mark. Where the detected lane mark is part of a continuous line marking a lane boundary, the points may correspond to a detected edge of the lane mark, with various spacings as described above.

For example, vehicle <b>2702</b> may determine a potential travel envelope based on navigational information.

In some embodiments, the navigational information received from a vehicle may include an indicator of a location of the vehicle, an indicator of a speed of the vehicle, and an indicator of a direction of travel of the vehicle.

For example, vehicle <b>2702</b> may transmit the navigational information (and/or sensor data) to server <b>2701</b> a number of times over a period of time. By way of example, vehicle <b>2702</b> may transmit the navigational information (and/or sensor data) to server <b>2701</b> once per minute. Alternatively, the vehicle may transmit the navigational information when it has access to a more reliable and/or faster network (e.g., having a stronger wireless signal, via a WIFI connection, etc.).</p><p id="p-0372" num="0371">At step <b>3202</b>, the received navigational information may be analyzed and a potential travel envelope for the vehicle may be determined.

By way of example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>A</figref>, server <b>2701</b> may determine an area that encompasses the location of vehicle <b>2702</b> and determine a potential travel envelope having a boundary <b>2811</b>, based on the determined area.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0372">In some embodiments, server <b>2701</b> may be configured to determine a potential travel envelope extending from the location of vehicle <b>2702</b> and surrounding the location of vehicle <b>2702</b>.

Server <b>2701</b> may also be configured to determine a side of the boundary of the potential travel envelope in the direction of travel of vehicle <b>2702</b> and determine another side of the boundary of the potential travel envelope in a direction opposite to the direction of travel. By way of example, server <b>2701</b> may determine the upper boundary of the potential travel envelope in the direction of travel of vehicle <b>2702</b> and determine the lower boundary of the potential travel envelope in the direction opposite to the direction of travel of vehicle <b>2702</b>. In some embodiments, the potential travel envelope may extend further along the direction of travel of the vehicle than in a direction opposite to the direction of travel of the vehicle.

In some embodiments, the potential travel distance over the predetermined amount of time may be determined based on the location of vehicle <b>2702</b> and/or the speed of vehicle <b>2702</b>. In some embodiments, server <b>2701</b> may determine the potential travel envelope further based on a selected or predetermined time window. The time window may be selected or determined based on the indicator of the speed of the vehicle. The predetermined amount of time (or a time window) may be in the range of 0.1 seconds to 24 hours. In some embodiments, the predetermined amount of time (or a time window) may be restricted into subranges of 0.1 seconds to 1 second, 1 second to 5 seconds, 5 to 10 seconds, 10 to 60 seconds, 1 minute to 5 minutes, 5 to 10 minutes, 10 to 60 minutes, 1 hour to 5 hours, 5 to 10 hours, and 10 to 24 hours. In some embodiments, the predetermined amount of time (or a time window) may be determined based on the transmission frequency of the navigational information from vehicle <b>2702</b> to server <b>2701</b>. For example, server <b>2701</b> may determine the predetermined amount of time (or a time window) based on the interval between two transmissions of the navigational information from vehicle <b>2702</b>.

Alternatively or additionally, vehicle <b>2702</b> may be configured to perform one or more navigational actions based on the polynomial representation of a target trajectory along the one or more road segments.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0381">In some embodiments, vehicle <b>2702</b> may receive the one or more road segments and store the one or more road segments into a storage device. Vehicle <b>2702</b> may also load one or more tiles included in the one or more road segments into a memory for processing. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, vehicle <b>2702</b> (and/or server <b>2701</b>) may be configured to determine that the location of vehicle <b>2702</b> is in tile <b>5</b> at time point <b>1</b>. Vehicle <b>2702</b> may also be configured to retrieve (or load) adjacent tiles <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>.

By way of example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>A</figref>, vehicle <b>2702</b> may determine that the location of vehicle <b>2702</b> is in a sub-tile (a sub-tile having a pattern of dots in tile <b>5</b>) and load map data of the tiles that are adjacent to the sub-tile (i.e., tiles <b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b>) into the memory for processing.

Vehicle <b>2702</b> may also load the tiles adjacent to the left-top sub-tile of tile <b>5</b> (i.e., tiles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>). In some embodiments, vehicle <b>2702</b> may be configured to decode the tiles before loading the data into the memory.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0383">In some embodiments, rather than receiving the one or more road segments from server <b>2701</b> through network <b>2705</b>, vehicle <b>2702</b> may retrieve the one or more road segments from a local storage. For example, vehicle <b>2702</b> may determine the potential travel envelope based on the analysis of the navigational information and determine one or more road segments including map information for a geographical region at least partially overlapping with the potential travel envelope of vehicle <b>2702</b>. Vehicle <b>2702</b> may also retrieve the data of the one or more road segments from a local storage.

For example, the data collected by a vehicle may need to be uploaded to a server. The sheer quantity of data to be uploaded may easily cripple or hinder the transmission bandwidth of the vehicle. Additionally, analyzing new data by a server to update the relevant portion of a map based on the new data may also be challenging. Moreover, different density levels may be used for mapping different types of features. For example, a density level of 330 kB per km may be needed for mapping non-semantic features, compared with about a density level of 20 kB per km for semantic features. Given the computation resources required for collecting non-semantic feature information and certain hard limit bandwidth caps (e.g., 100 MB per year) that may be imposed to each of the vehicles, there may be insufficient resources available to the vehicles to collect non-semantic feature information all the time.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0386">The systems and methods may enable controlling not only whether drive data is collected, but also when and how drive data is collected. For example, the disclosed systems and methods may enable a server to determine whether a host vehicle is entering a zone including a region of interest. Upon confirmation that the vehicle has entered the zone, the server can cause the vehicle to begin collecting higher density non-semantic features information. If the vehicle is determined to have driven through the point of interest, then the server can cause the vehicle to upload the collected non-semantic features information. If the vehicle is determined not to have driven through the region of interest, the server may cause the host vehicle to discard the collected non-semantic features information. The disclosed systems and methods may also enable the server to update a map based on the non-semantic features information collected by the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0387"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary system for automatically generating a navigational map relative to one or more road segments, consistent with the disclosed embodiments.

Alternatively or additionally, the second navigational information collected at the second density level may include more categories of data collected than the first navigational information collected at the first density level. For example, the second navigational information collected at the second density level may include more non-sematic features (e.g., descriptors), which may need more data compared to that for sematic features, than the first navigational information has. In some embodiments, the second navigational information may include one or more non-sematic features, while the first navigational information may not include any non-sematic features. Examples of semantic features and non-semantic features were discussed earlier in this disclosure. Alternatively or additionally, the second navigational information collected at the second density level may include sensor data from more and/or different sensors than the first navigational information collected at the first density level. For example, the first navigational information may include GPS data received from a GPS sensor. The second navigational information may include GPS data and LIDAR data received from a LIDAR system. As another example, the first navigational information may include GPS data and LIDAR data, and the second navigational information may include GPS data and image (and/or VIDAR) data received from a VIDAR system. As still another example, the first navigational information may include one or more images captured by a camera installed on the vehicle, and the second navigational information may include one or more images captured by the camera and LIDAR data received from a LIDAR system.

Moreover, one skilled in the art would understand that although the descriptions of process <b>3500</b> provided below use vehicle <b>3302</b> as an example, process <b>3500</b> is not limited to one vehicle. For example, server <b>3301</b> may be configured to determine the locations of a plurality of vehicles and cause the plurality of vehicles to collect first and/or second navigational information.

Alternatively, vehicle <b>3302</b> may collect navigational information at a predetermined density level based on a setting associated with a condition of vehicle <b>3302</b> (e.g., a speed, heading direction, etc.).

For example, the location of vehicle <b>3302</b> may be determined once every second or every minute. Alternatively or additionally, the location of vehicle <b>3302</b> may be determined based on the speed of the vehicle <b>3302</b>. For example, the location of vehicle <b>3302</b> may be determined more frequently if it is determined (by vehicle <b>3302</b> and/or server <b>3301</b>) that vehicle <b>3302</b> travels at a higher speed. Alternatively or additionally, the location of vehicle <b>3302</b> may be determined based on the region in which vehicle <b>3302</b> is.

In such systems, maps (e.g., REM maps) may include target trajectories (e.g., three-dimensional splines) that are available to vehicles (e.g., host or target/detected vehicles) traveling along lanes of a roadway associated with a REM map. The REM maps may also include mapped landmarks, which may correspond to a wide array of detectable objects (e.g., road signs, road edges, lane markings, bus stops, or any other recognizable features associated with a roadway, etc.). The mapped landmarks may be associated in the map with refined locations associated with one or more of the landmarks. The refined positions may be determined based on crowd-sourced location information determined during each of a plurality of individual drives along a road segment. The detected objects (e.g., landmarks) and their locations from the map may be used in navigating an autonomous or partially autonomous vehicle (e.g., by assisting in determining where a vehicle is located relative to a target trajectory from the REM map).</p><p id="p-0431" num="0430">To generate a crowdsourced REM map, drive information may be collected from multiple drives along a road segment. This may include, for example, collecting drive information from one vehicle repeatedly traversing a road segment or other area at different times and/or from multiple different vehicles traversing a road segment or other area. The mapping system may then align and aggregate the collected drive information (e.g., an actual trajectory traversed by a vehicle, and/or one or more object detections and associated determined positions for the detected objects) to provide the crowd-sourced REM maps. Such processes can promote accuracy of the maps by filling in holes in drive data sets (e.g., caused by occlusions during a particular drive, etc.), by refining object locations, and by refining vehicle trajectories.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0431">When a vehicle navigates in the world, the vehicle's navigation system may request map information for a road segment from a mapping system (e.g., one or more servers storing map information including, for example, REM maps). The mapping system may provide map sections (or tiles) that include map information for a road segment or a portion of a road segment. However, as the vehicle continues to travel, the vehicle may need to request additional map sections (e.g., tiles) in order to have sufficient map information on hand in order to navigate upcoming road segments. For example, the vehicle may turn from a first road segment onto a second road segment. As a result, the vehicle may need map sections/tiles that provide map information for the second road segment in order to effectively navigate relative to the second road segment. Because there may be at least some delay in acquiring the map section (e.g., tile) needed for the second road segment (either from a remote server or from a local memory storage device), it may be advantageous for the vehicle navigation system to determine, prior to the vehicle turning onto the second road segment, that a map section/tile associated with the second road segment may be required. Based on such a determination, the vehicle navigation system may make a request for a download (or upload) of the map section (e.g., tile) including the second road segment even before the vehicle turns onto the second road segment. In general, to ensure that a vehicle navigation system has access to map sections (e.g., tiles) needed for navigating a particular road segment, such map sections (e.g., tiles) should be provided to the vehicle navigation system prior to the vehicle navigating the particular road segment. Thus, a vehicle navigation system may be configured to determine what map sections (e.g., tiles) may be needed for future navigation (e.g., within a predetermined period of time from a current time). The vehicle navigation system may then retrieve those map sections (e.g., tiles) deemed most likely to be needed in the foreseeable future. Additionally, the mapping system should provide map sections/tiles on a regular basis to maintain efficient delivery of those map sections/tiles expected to be needed for future navigation. Therefore, there is a need for systems and methods for efficiently and accurately providing map sections/tiles for roads that the vehicle is likely to travel on.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0432">In some cases, for example, due to memory, processor, and/or communication bandwidth constraints, the number of map segments (e.g., map segments in the form of map tiles, each of which may representing a region of a predetermined dimension) available to a vehicle navigation system may be limited. For example, in some cases, memory constraints may limit the number of tiles that can be loaded from a database into a cache or RAM associated with the vehicle navigation system. In other cases, communication bandwidth constraints may limit the number of tiles that can be transferred from a remote server to the vehicle navigation system within a certain period of time. Thus, there is a need to ensure that the map tiles loaded by the navigation system and/or requested by the navigation system correspond to those most likely to be used by the navigation system during short term navigation. The disclosed systems and methods may prioritize one or more tiles requested by a vehicle (e.g., requested by one or more processors on board the vehicle) in order to efficiently allocate bandwidth usage between the one or more processors and the engine control module (ECU) in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0433">In some embodiments, as described elsewhere in this application, a map segment may include one or more tiles representing a region of a predetermined dimension. The size and/or shape of a tile (i.e., a map segment) may vary. In some embodiments, the dimension of a tile in a region may be in a range of 0.25 to 100 square kilometers, which may be restricted into a subrange of 0.25 square kilometers to 1 square kilometer, 1 square kilometers to 10 square kilometers, and 10 to 25 square kilometers, 25 to 50 square kilometers, and 50 to 100 square kilometers. In some embodiments, the predetermined dimension of the tile(s) may be less than or equal to ten square kilometers. Alternatively, the predetermined dimension of the tile(s) may be less than or equal to one square kilometer. Alternatively, the predetermined dimension of the tile(s) may be less than or equal to ten square kilometers. Alternatively or additionally, the size of a tile may vary based on the type of the region in which a tile is. For example, the size of a tile in a rural area or an area with fewer roads than may be larger than the size of a tile in an urban area or area with more roads. In some embodiments, the size of the tile may be determined based on the density of the information around a current location of the vehicle (or the location where the data is obtained), possible paths for the vehicle, the number of possible routes in the area, the type of routes (e.g., main, urban, rural, dirt, etc.) in the area and general navigational patterns, and/or trends in the relevant area. For example, if a large percentage of vehicles typically remain on a main road in a particular area or region, map information for a small distance along a side road may be retrieved. If a vehicle does in fact navigate onto a side road that is typically less traveled, then more map information for the side road (e.g., for a greater distance along the side road) may be obtained and/or transmitted to the vehicle. In some embodiments, a tile may have a rectangle shape, a square shape, a hexagon shape, or the like, or a combination thereof. One skilled in the art would understand that the shape of a tile is not limited to the shapes described in this disclosure. For example, a tile may include an irregular shape (e.g., determined according to at least a boundary of a jurisdiction (states, counties, cities, or towns) or other regions (e.g., streets, highways)). Alternatively or additionally, a tile may include a portion of any shape disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0434">In some cases, a simple tile acquisition scheme may be employed. For example, if a navigation system determines that a host vehicle is located within a current tile, then the system may request and/or load all of the tiles that surround the current tile in which the vehicle is located. Such a system, however, may be associated with certain disadvantages. For example, the direction of travel of the host vehicle may suggest that some subset of the surrounding tiles is more likely than other surrounding tiles to include a tile into which the host vehicle will next travel as it leaves the current tile. In other cases where there may be limits on available directions of travel (e.g., in the case of limited access highways, one-way roads, etc.), the host vehicle may not even be able to traverse from the current tile into a particular surrounding tile, or the host vehicle may need to enter one or more other surrounding tiles before it could access the particular surrounding tile. In such cases, merely loading all of the surrounding tiles may result in bandwidth, memory, and/or processor resources being expended relative to low-probability tiles.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0435">The disclosed systems and methods offer opportunities to prioritize tile requests such that bandwidth, memory, and/or processor resources may be dedicated to higher-priority tiles. In some cases, such prioritization may be based on, for example, 1) the location of the vehicle and/or 2) connectivity between tiles (e.g., whether and how road segments may connect to one another across neighboring tiles). For example, tiles for road sections that the vehicle is more likely reach sooner may receive a higher priority for retrieval, and the system may not unnecessarily spend resources to request tiles for road sections that the vehicle is unlikely to travel or cannot easily reach from its current location. Moreover, by providing tiles on an as-needed basis, the disclosed systems and methods may save computing resources (e.g., bandwidth, memory, etc.).</p><p id="p-0437" num="0436">In some embodiments, the disclosed systems and methods may provide a tile for where the host vehicle is located and the tiles (e.g., eight tiles) that surround the tile where the host vehicle is currently located. In some cases, however, a vehicle navigational system onboard the host vehicle may request, load, etc., a group of tiles that do not surround the tile where the host vehicle is currently located. Rather, the loaded or requested tiles may correspond to a set of tiles identified based on a determined likelihood of the host vehicle traversing those tiles within a predetermined period of time. Such priority determinations can be made at any suitable periodicity (e.g., multiple times per second) such that a set of requested tiles, for example, may be revised based on the changing needs of the host vehicle. As discussed above, so that the host vehicle has accurate and useful map information for navigation, the disclosed systems and methods may provide tiles to the host vehicle ahead of time that the host vehicle is likely to need. Additionally, the disclosed systems and methods may provide new tiles on a regular basis to maintain efficient delivery of map tiles.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0437">In some cases, map tile priority relative to a host vehicle current location may be determined at least partially based on map tile connectivity. Map tile connectivity may refer to whether two map tiles are adjacent to one another. More specifically, however, map tile connectivity may be determined based on the road segments included in adjacent map tiles, the direction of travel of available lanes along the included road segments, and whether a host vehicle can traverse from one map tile to an adjacent map tile along the available road segments. In one example, a one-way road may span a boundary of two adjacent map tiles (e.g., map tile A and map tile B) such that a host vehicle can travel from map tile A to map tile B along the one-way road segment, but cannot travel along that same road segment from map tile B to map tile A. Thus, if this was the only available road segment traversing the boundary between map tile A and map tile B, map tile A may be indicated has having map tile connectivity with map tile B, but map tile B may be determined as not having map tile connectivity with map tile A. Thus, if a host vehicle is located within map tile A, map tile B may be identified has having a high priority for loading and/or downloading, etc. On the other hand, if a host vehicle is located in map tile B, map tile A may be identified as a low priority map tile for loading and/or downloading, as it does not have map tile connectivity relative to map tile B.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0438">Similar examples may also involve limited access highways. For example, a bi-directional highway may traverse a boundary between map tile A and map tile B. Because of the limited access to the highway, however, a host vehicle driving along the highway in map tile A may determine that map tile B has a high priority for loading and/or downloading based on its map tile connectivity with map tile B. Once the host vehicle crosses into map tile B, however, while continuing to travel in the same direction along the highway, map tile A may be identified as a low priority map tile for loading and/or downloading. While map tile A may share map connectivity with map tile B, relative to the host vehicle traveling in map tile B away from map tile A, and in view of the limited access to the highway, the host vehicle may have to travel far along the highway (possibly entering several other map tiles) before being able to change directions along the highway and travel from map tile B back to map tile A along the highway. As a result, map tile A may be associated with a low map tile connectivity value in this situation.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0439"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary system <b>3600</b> for providing one or more map segments to one or more vehicles, consistent with the disclosed embodiments.

Server <b>3601</b> may be configured to providing one or more map segments to one or more vehicles based on navigational information received from one or more vehicles (and/or one or more vehicle devices associated with a vehicle). For example, vehicle <b>3602</b> and/or vehicle device <b>3603</b> may be configured to collect navigational information and transmit the navigational information to server <b>3601</b>. Server <b>3601</b> may send to vehicle <b>3602</b> and/or vehicle device <b>3603</b> one or more map segments, including map information for a geographical region based on the received navigational information and/or other information. Database <b>3604</b> may be configured to store information for the components of system <b>3600</b> (e.g., server <b>3601</b>, vehicle <b>3602</b>, and/or vehicle device <b>3603</b>). Network <b>3605</b> may be configured to facilitate communications among the components of system <b>3600</b>.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0440">Server <b>3601</b> may be configured to receive navigational information from vehicle <b>3602</b> (and/or vehicle device <b>3603</b>). In some embodiments, navigational information may include an indicator of the location of vehicle <b>3602</b>, the speed of vehicle <b>3602</b>, and/or the direction of travel of vehicle <b>3602</b>. The indicator of the location of the vehicle may be accurate to within centimeters (e.g., 100 centimeters, fifty centimeters, twenty centimeters, ten centimeters, five centimeters, or one centimeter) of an actual location of the vehicle. By way of example, vehicle <b>3602</b> and/or vehicle device <b>3603</b> may be configured to receive data from one or more sensors and determine navigational information, such as the vehicle's location, speed, and/or driving direction, based on the received data. Vehicle <b>3602</b> may be configured to transmit the navigational information to server <b>3601</b>.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0441">Server <b>3601</b> may be configured to analyze the received navigational information and determine a plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve from a map database (e.g., a local database and/or database <b>3604</b>). The map database may include a plurality of stored navigational map segments each corresponding to a real-world area. In some embodiments, the determination of the plurality of target navigational map segments may be based on the navigational information (e.g., an indicator of vehicle location) and map segment connectivity information associated with the plurality of stored navigational map segments. For example, map segment connectivity information may indicate whether one or more boundaries shared between adjacent navigational map segments (or between adjacent map subsegments) can be traversed by a vehicle traveling along at least one road segment. Alternatively or additionally, map connectivity information may account for available travel directions along road segments traversing navigational map segment boundaries. By way of example, a two-way road may provide bi-directional connectivity. As another example, a one-way road may provide only uni-directional connectivity. In some embodiments, map connectivity information is stored as Boolean bits associated with one or more boundaries associated with each of the plurality of navigational map segments.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0442">Server <b>3601</b> may calculate map tile connectivity information for each tile when creating the tiles or when updating map tiles. The connectivity information may be associated with each map tile in any suitable manner. In some cases, for example, the connectivity information associated with a particular map tile may be stored in a field associated with the map tile. The field may be a header of the map tile. The field may have a predetermined size (e.g., 4 bytes). Having the information in a header of the map tile may enable a processor on board the vehicle to calculate a tile retrieval priority upon receipt of a tile header without having to receive the map data associated with the tile. If analysis of a tile header or a field indicates that a particular tile is a high priority tile (e.g., based on a host vehicle current location, direction of travel, map tile connectivity indicated by one or more received map tile headers, title fields, etc.), then the map tile payload may be loaded and/or downloaded. Such a technique may avoid the need for full tile decoding to determine map tile priority, etc.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0443">In one embodiment, the connectivity information for each tile may include a predetermined number of bits (e.g., 8 Boolean bits per each quarter of the tile). Each bit may indicate whether there is connectivity via a road segment from a particular quarter of a map tile to one of the other eight tile quarters that surrounds it. In total, each tile may contain 4 bytes of connectivity information (e.g., 8 bits per tile quarter, bit per surround neighbor quarter). Resolution of quarters may allow the system to determine tile priority by determining relative to a current quarter what other map tile quarters might the vehicle reach within a predetermined period of time. Additionally, determining the number of quarter hops (e.g., connections) across map tiles may take into account road connectivity and may enable the system to determine an order for the tiles to download according to predetermined schemes.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0444">In some embodiments, server <b>3601</b> may transmit tile field or tile header information to vehicle <b>3602</b>. Vehicle <b>3602</b> (e.g., via its onboard vehicle navigation system) may use the tile field or tile header information to determine map tile priority and determine which tiles to request and in which order the map tiles should be loaded/downloaded. The vehicle navigation system may reprioritize a map tile request as the vehicle moves through a map tile (e.g., through quarters of a map tile). For example, at predetermined intervals (e.g., nine times per second in some cases), the vehicle navigation system may calculate whether priority of tiles to be requested for loading and/or downloading (or in a queue for loading and/or downloading) has changed. If the priority has changed, one or more processors associated with the vehicle navigation system may change the load/download request (e.g., change the order of map tiles to be loaded/downloaded, etc.), may cancel a load/download request (e.g., for one or more tiles previously requested), and/or may initiate a new download request (e.g., to include tiles not previously requested for loading and/or downloading). A decision to cancel a download request may also be based on map tile size and download time.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0445">In some embodiments, server <b>3601</b> may further be configured to initiate downloading of the plurality of target navigational map segments from the map database.

In some cases, the connectivity information may be relative to whole tiles. In other cases, the connectivity may be relative to sub-portions of map tiles (e.g., map tile quarters). The connectivity information relative to tiles and or map tile sub-portions may be stored in metadata associated with the map tiles (e.g., within headers or fields associated with the tiles).</p><p id="p-0448" num="0447">In some embodiments, in alternative to or in addition to the determination by server <b>3601</b> of a plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve from a map database described above, vehicle <b>3602</b> may determine target navigational map segments to retrieve from a map database.

In other embodiments, one or more components of system <b>3600</b> may communicate directly through dedicated communication links, such as, for example, a telephone network, an extranet, an intranet, the Internet, satellite communications, off-line communications, wireless communications, transponder communications, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a virtual private network (VPN), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0451">As discussed, connectivity between map tiles and/or map tile sub-portions may not be bi-directional and may be one-directional (e.g., a one-way road, etc.). As discussed, tile priority may be based on a drivable path (e.g., roads reachable by the vehicle from a current location). Furthermore, in some embodiments, system <b>3600</b> (or one or more components thereof) may take into account additional information, such as a direction of travel (or speed) or proximity of the vehicle to the next tile (if connectivity is based on position).</p><p id="p-0453" num="0452"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of exemplary map tiles and tile segments. The arrows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> indicate the connectivity between adjacent map tile quarters (which may be subsegments of a map segment). As discussed, the connectivity determination used by system <b>3600</b> (or one or more components thereof) may take road travel direction, accessibility, etc., in account. For example, there may be a one-way road such that quarter A may be connected to quarter B, but quarter B may not be connected to quarter A. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, the arrows may represent tile connection metadata and designate which map tile quarters are connected by physical roads and whether a host vehicle located in a certain map tile quarter can traverse along available roadways into adjoining map tile quarters. The direction of the arrows indicates the direction of connectivity. For example, in map tile <b>1</b>, the top-left and bottom-left map tile quarters have bi-directional connectivity indicating that a host vehicle located in either of these map tile quarters can travel to the other of these map tile quarters via at least one physical road segment. On the other hand, there is no connectivity between the top-right and bottom-right map tile quarters of map tile <b>1</b>. An example of one-directional connectivity between map tile quarters is shown between map tiles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>; specifically, between the bottom-right map tile quarter of map tile <b>12</b> and the bottom-left map tile quarter of map tile <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0453">System <b>3600</b> (or one or more components thereof) may use vehicle <b>3602</b>'s location tile connectivity information to set the priority for the next tiles to be requested (and/or downloaded). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of exemplary map tiles and tile segments. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, vehicle <b>3602</b> may be located in the north east quarter of tile #<b>10</b> and traveling in a northwest direction, the first priority tile to be retrieved may be tile #<b>5</b> as it includes a tile quarter connected directly to the map tile quarter the vehicle is currently located. Tile #<b>6</b> may be the next in priority for retrieval as it would be the next tile encountered along the current direction of travel of the vehicle and it has connectivity with tile #<b>5</b>. Moreover, tile #<b>6</b> is closer to the vehicle's current location than other tiles, other than tile #<b>5</b>. Tile #<b>9</b> may be next in priority for retrieval, as the roadway on which vehicle <b>3602</b> is traveling provides bidirectional connectivity across map tile quarters from the current map tile quarter to the bottom-right map tile quarter of tile #<b>9</b>. Further, tile #<b>9</b> may represent the next closest tile to vehicle <b>3602</b>'s current location after tile #<b>5</b> and tile #<b>6</b>. The priority for map tile loading and/or downloading may be periodically updated as vehicle <b>3602</b> travels along a road segment and may take into account any of the factors described here (e.g., map tile connectivity, map tile sub-portion connectivity, current heading direction, current velocity, distance from a current location to one or more map tile boundary locations, etc.). Tile #<b>4</b>, for example, may receive a low priority, even though it is close to tile #<b>1</b>, as the connectivity information associated with map tile #<b>1</b>, tile #<b>4</b>, tile #<b>5</b>, and tile #<b>9</b> indicate that there is no map tile connectivity in these adjacent tiles that would provide a path for the vehicle to travel from its current location to a location in map tile #<b>4</b> without first navigating to one or more map tiles outside the group of map tile #<b>1</b>, tile #<b>4</b>, tile #<b>5</b>, and tile #<b>9</b>. For example, for the host vehicle to navigate to a physical location represented by map tile #<b>4</b>, based on the example shown below, it may be necessary for the host vehicle to first travel from tile #<b>1</b> to tile #<b>9</b>, then to tile #<b>14</b>, tile #<b>13</b>, tile #<b>8</b>, and tile #<b>3</b> before being able to access physical locations represented by map tile #<b>4</b>.

For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine a plurality of target navigational map segments based on the received navigational information and map segment connectivity information associated with the plurality of stored navigational map segments. As described elsewhere in this disclosure, map segment connectivity information may indicate whether one or more boundaries shared between adjacent navigational map segments can be traversed by vehicle <b>3602</b> traveling along at least one road segment. Alternatively or additionally, map connectivity information may account for available travel directions along road segments traversing navigational map segment boundaries. By way of example, a two-way road may provide bi-directional connectivity. As another example, a one-way road may provide only uni-directional connectivity. In some embodiments, map connectivity information is stored as Boolean bits associated with one or more boundaries associated with each of the plurality of navigational map segments.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0469">In some embodiments, the map database may include a plurality of stored navigational map segments each corresponding to a real-world area. By way of example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, the map database may include all map tiles illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, but vehicle <b>3602</b> may request a portion of the stored map tiles (i.e., a plurality of target navigational map segments) to retrieve. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of stored navigational map segments may include a plurality of map subsegments, and each of the plurality of map subsegments includes map segment connectivity information specific to that map subsegment. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, each of map tile may include four quarter tiles. Each of quarter tiles may include its own connectivity information, which may be similar to the connectivity information of a map segment as described elsewhere in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0471" num="0470">The map database from which the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) retrieves the target navigational map segments may be local to the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>). For example, the map database may be stored in storage device <b>3930</b>, and the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may retrieve one or more target navigational map segments from the map database. Alternatively or additionally, the map database may include a database remote from vehicle <b>3602</b> (or remote from server <b>3601</b> if server <b>3601</b> determines a plurality of target navigational map segments). For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may request one or more target navigational map segments from a database stored in server <b>3601</b> and/or database <b>2740</b> via network <b>2705</b>. In some embodiments, the stored map segments may be arranged in tiles (such as map tiles illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b> and <b>38</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0472" num="0471">In some embodiments, the map database may be similar the map databases described in this disclosure (e.g., map database <b>160</b>).</p><p id="p-0473" num="0472">In some embodiments, the map database (and/or a storage device and/or a storage medium) may store navigational map segments in the form of a digital map, and each of the navigational map segments may correspond to a real-world area. In some embodiments, the digital map may also include, for each of the navigational map segments, map segment connectivity information, which is described elsewhere in this disclosure. For example, the digital map may also include, for each of the navigational map segments, at least one map segment connectivity indicator associated with each boundary shared with an adjacent navigational map segment. The at least one map segment connectivity indicator may be stored on the computer-readable medium as a Boolean bit. In some embodiments, the at least one map segment connectivity indicator associated with each boundary shared with an adjacent navigational map segment may indicate whether a shared boundary between adjacent navigational map segments can be traversed by a vehicle traveling along at least one road segment. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one map segment connectivity indicator associated with each boundary shared with an adjacent navigational map segment may indicate a uni-directional boundary or a bi-directional boundary. In some embodiments, the digital map includes representations of target trajectories for vehicle navigation systems (e.g., navigation system <b>3970</b>) to follow when traversing road segments represented in the digital map, as described elsewhere in this disclosure. Alternatively or additionally, the digital map may include representations of recognized landmarks for use by vehicle navigation systems (e.g., navigation system <b>3970</b>) to localize a vehicle position relative to at least one of the target trajectories, as described elsewhere in this disclosure. In some embodiments, the digital map stored in the map database (or a storage device or medium) may include the digital map (or a portion thereof) having a plurality of tiles at different levels illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref> and described above.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0473">In some embodiments, each of the plurality of stored navigational map segments may include a field or a header in which map segment connectivity information is stored. A field or header may have a predetermined size (e.g., 4 bytes). Having the information in a header may enable the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) to calculate a segment retrieval priority upon receipt of a segment field or header without having to receive the map data associated with the segment. For example, if the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) determines that the particular segment is a high priority segment (e.g., based on vehicle <b>3602</b>'s current location, direction of travel, map tile connectivity indicated by one or more received map segment headers, fields, etc.) based on the segment header or field, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may load and/or download the map segment.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0474">In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine one or more navigational map segments adjacent to the current map segment (i.e., the map segment where vehicle <b>3602</b> is currently located) to which vehicle <b>3602</b> cannot directly navigate from the current navigational map segment, based on the map segment connectivity information. The at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may also exclude the determined one or more navigational map segments from the target navigational map segments to retrieve.</p><p id="p-0476" num="0475">In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine the plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve based on at least one of an indicator of a speed of vehicle <b>3602</b> and an indicator of a direction of travel of vehicle <b>3602</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, vehicle <b>3602</b> may be located in tile #<b>10</b>. The at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine that vehicle <b>3602</b> is heading to the south-west direction based on the data received from one or more sensors <b>3950</b>. The at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine the plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve based on the determined the travel direction of vehicle <b>3602</b>. By way of example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine tile #<b>9</b> and tile #<b>14</b> to retrieve from the map database.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0476">In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may prioritize the determined target navigational map segments based on the map segment connectivity information. The at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may download and/or load the target navigational map segments based on the priority of the target navigational map segments. For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may assign a first navigational map segment a higher priority than a second navigation map segment based on an indication by the map segment connectivity information that the first navigational map segment has a navigable connection relative to the current navigational map segment in which vehicle <b>3602</b> is located that is a shorter distance than a navigable connection between the second navigational map segment and the current navigational map segment. The at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may also download (and/or load) the first navigational map segment before downloading (and/or loading) the second navigational map segment based on the priority rankings between the first and second navigational map segments. In some embodiments, the first navigational map segment may not share a border with the current navigational map segment, but the second navigational map segment may share a border with the current navigational map segment.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0477">In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may prioritize the plurality of target navigational map segments, prior to retrieving one or more of the plurality of stored map segments, by accessing fields or headers of at least two of the plurality of stored navigational map segments and analyzing map segment connectivity information stored in the accessed fields or headers. For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may access the fields or headers of a predetermined number of map segments in a vicinity of a current map segment in which the vehicle is located. By way of example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may access the fields or headers of two tiles (e.g., tile #<b>9</b> and tile #<b>14</b>) that are adjacent to tile #<b>10</b> in which vehicle <b>3602</b> is currently located. As another example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may access the fields or headers of eight tiles surrounding the center tile (i.e., tile #<b>10</b>) where vehicle <b>3602</b> is located (some of the surrounding tiles are not labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>). Alternatively, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may access the fields or headers of 24 (or other appropriate numbers of) tiles surrounding the center tile. In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may access the fields or headers of candidate segments based on at least one of a travel direction of the vehicle or a speed of the vehicle. For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine that vehicle <b>3602</b> is heading south-west. The at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may access the fields or headers of tile #<b>9</b> and tile #<b>14</b>, but not tile #<b>4</b> even though tile #<b>4</b> is also adjacent to the center tile. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine a speed of vehicle <b>3602</b> and determine the number of the segments for which the fields or headers may be accessed based on the speed of vehicle <b>3602</b>. For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine that the current speed is relatively slow and access the fields or headers of eight tiles surrounding the center tile (i.e., tile #<b>10</b>) where vehicle <b>3602</b> is located. As another example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may determine that the current speed is relatively high and access the fields or headers of <b>24</b> (or a higher number) tiles surrounding the center tile.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0478">In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may periodically update the plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve from the map database. For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may periodically update the plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve from the map database as vehicle <b>3602</b> travels along a road segment and may take into account any of the factors described in this disclosure (e.g., map tile connectivity, map tile sub-portion connectivity, current heading direction, current velocity, distance from a current location to one or more map tile boundary locations, etc.). In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may update the plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve according to a predetermined time interval. The predetermined time interval for updating the target navigational map segments may be in a range of 0.01 seconds to an hour, which may be restricted in subranges of 0.01 seconds to 0.1 seconds, 0.1 seconds to 1 second, 1 second to 10 seconds, 10 to 60 seconds, 1 minute to 5 minutes, 5 to 10 minutes, 10 to 39 minutes, and 39 to 60 minutes. In some embodiments, the periodic updating may occur at a rate of more than once per second. By way of example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may update target navigational map segments to retrieve from the map database every 0.1 seconds. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may update target navigational map segments to retrieve from the map database based on a data acquisition rate of one or more sensors <b>3950</b> (e.g., a GPS sensor, a camera). For example, an onboard camera may capture images at a rate of one image per 1/9 seconds, and the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may update target navigational map segments to retrieve from the map database once every 1/9 seconds. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may update the target navigational map segments to retrieve based on the speed of vehicle <b>3602</b>. For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may update the target navigational map segments more frequently (e.g., updating the target navigational map segments every 0.01 seconds) if vehicle <b>3602</b> is traveling at a relative high speed (e.g., 50 km/h). As another example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may update the target navigational map segments less frequently (e.g., updating the target navigational map segments every 0.1 seconds) if vehicle <b>3602</b> is traveling at a relative low speed (e.g., 39 km/h). In some embodiments, the periodic updating may occur before all of the determined plurality of target navigational map segments have been retrieved (or downloaded or loaded) from the map database. For example, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may download all the determined target navigational map segments (as below described in connection with step <b>4003</b>) before updating the next batch of target navigational map segments. Alternatively, the target navigational map segments for retrieval may be updated, reorganized, and/or reprioritized periodically (e.g., at a rate of updating every 1/9 seconds). In some cases, all of the tiles may have already been retrieved. In other cases, some of the tiles may not have been downloaded when the updating, reprioritization, and reorganization occur. Additionally, after each reprioritization (and update), some new tiles may be added and others may be dropped. In some embodiments, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may periodically update the plurality of target navigational map segments to retrieve from the map database similar to the process for updating target navigational map segments described above.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0479">At step <b>4003</b>, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) initiates downloading (and/or loading) of the plurality of target navigational map segments from the map database. For example, if the map database is remotely located from vehicle <b>3602</b> (e.g., stored in a storage device associated with server <b>3601</b> and/or database <b>2740</b>), the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may initiate downloading by transmitting to server <b>3601</b> and/or database <b>2740</b> a request for downloading the target navigational map segments. Server <b>3601</b> and/or database <b>2740</b> may transmit the requested target navigational map segments to vehicle <b>3602</b> via network <b>2705</b>. Alternatively, if the map database is local to the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>), such as stored in storage device <b>3930</b>, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may retrieve the target navigational map segments from the map database.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0480">In some embodiments, as described above, the at least one processor (e.g., processor <b>3910</b>) may periodically update the target navigational map segments to retrieve from the map database.
