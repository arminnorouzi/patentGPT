In known rotor blades, a radially outer partition wall, a radially inner partition wall, and the axially forward and rearward partition walls form a one-piece (integral) box shape that surrounds the blade neck and in particular projects therebeyond in the circumferential direction. For reasons of weight and because of the difficult tool design for rotor blades with contoured annular space, it is advantageous to omit the radially inner partition wall. This, however, leads to the problem that hot gas ingress can occur in the area of the missing radially inner partition wall, which can lead to unwanted heating of the rotor blade disk.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the invention to provide a system having a rotor blade where it is possible to achieve weight savings on the one hand, but also to improve the seal from the annular space carrying the hot gas.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is provided a system with a rotor blade for a gas turbine, in particular an aircraft gas turbine, including a blade root, a blade neck adjoining the blade root in the radial direction, an airfoil adjoining the blade neck in the radial direction, a radially outer partition wall, which forms a radially inner boundary segment of an annular space of a gas turbine, an axially forward partition wall and an axially rearward partition wall, which are connected to the radially outer partition wall such that the partition walls surround the blade neck on three sides, the partition walls projecting beyond the blade neck in the circumferential direction, and further including a blade root protection plate designed to be arranged on the blade root. It is provided that the blade root protection plate have at least one sealing portion that extends in the axial direction from the forward partition wall to the rearward partition wall and whose radially outer side is disposed opposite the radially outer partition wall when the blade root protection plate is arranged on the blade root.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By providing a sealing portion on the blade root protection plate, it is possible to achieve a sealing effect that counteracts the ingress of hot gas. Since blade root protection plates are already commonly used, the additional sealing portion results in only a minimal increase in weight. In any case, the mass of a sealing portion of the blade root protection plate is significantly less than the mass of a radially inner partition wall.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The partition walls and the blade neck may form a radially downwardly open pocket. When the blade root protection plate is arranged on the blade root, the pocket may be radially downwardly closed by the sealing portion at least partially, preferably completely.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the system is in an assembled state, the sealing portion may bridge a space formed between a projecting portion of the axially forward partition wall and a projecting portion of the axially rearward partition wall.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the sealing portion of the blade root protection plate covers exactly the area that is left free by the omission of the radially inner partition wall.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The radially outer partition wall, the axially forward partition wall, the axially rearward partition wall, and the sealing portion of the blade root protection plate may form a box-like profile that surrounds the blade neck. The sealing portion may bear with its radially outer side against the axially forward and rearward partition walls or be spaced a very small distance therefrom so as to achieve the desired sealing effect.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to obtain an optimum sealing effect, the sealing portion may have substantially the same length as the blade root in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The sealing portion may have at least one corrugation, which is formed in particular along the axial direction or along the circumferential direction. The formation of at least one corrugation results in stiffening of the usually rather thin sealing portion of the blade root protection plate. Thus, the stability of the sealing portion can be improved by providing at least one corrugation. Furthermore, a corrugation may also be designed such that an improved sealing effect is achieved.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above-mentioned object is also achieved by a rotor blade disk including a plurality of rotor blade slots arranged adjacent one another in the circumferential direction, each having inserted therein a blade root of a respective rotor blade of the system, as described above, and further including a plurality of disk humps formed between the rotor blade slots. The sealing portion of the blade root protection plate is disposed with its radially inner side opposite a radially outer side of a respective disk hump. Thus, the sealing portion may effectively prevent penetration or ingress of hot gas toward the disc humps.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Finally, the above object is also achieved by a gas turbine, in particular an aircraft gas turbine, having at least one such rotor blade disk. The rotor blade disk may in particular be part of a turbine stage of the gas turbine.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention will now be described by way of example, and not by way of limitation, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified schematic representation of an aircraft gas turbine;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified and schematic perspective view of a rotor blade with a blade root protection plate;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view taken substantially along line III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sectional view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, where a corrugation is formed in a sealing portion of the blade root protection plate.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows, in simplified schematic form, an aircraft gas turbine <b>10</b>, illustrated, merely by way of example, as a turbofan engine.
