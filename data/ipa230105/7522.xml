The terminal device may be configured on the ground, including the indoor ground or the outdoor ground, or may be handheld, wearable or vehicle-mounted. The terminal device may also be configured on water (such as a ship and so on). The terminal device may also be configured in the air (such as on an aircraft, on a balloon, on a satellite, and so on). The terminal device may be a mobile phone, a tablet computer (Pad), a computer having the wireless transceiver function, a virtual reality (VR) terminal device, an augmented reality (AR) terminal device, a wireless terminal in industrial control, a vehicle-mounted terminal, a wireless terminal for self-driving, a wireless terminal device for remote medical, a wireless terminal device in a smart grid, a wireless terminal device for transportation safety, a wireless terminal device in a smart city, a wireless terminal device in a smart home, a wearable terminal device, and so on. The terminal device mentioned in embodiments of the present disclosure may further be referred to as a terminal, user equipment (UE), an access terminal device, a vehicle-mounted terminal, an industrial control terminal, a UE unit, a UE station, a mobile station, a mobile platform, a remote station, a remote terminal device, a mobile device, a UE terminal, a wireless communication device, a UE agent, a UE apparatus, and so on. The terminal device may be fixed or mobile.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A network device may usually have wireless transceiver function. The network device may be mobile. For example, the network device may be a mobile device. In some embodiments, the network device may be a satellite, a balloon station. For example, the satellite may be a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite, a medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite, a geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite, a high elliptical orbit (HEO) satellite, and so on. For example, an altitude range of an orbit of the LEO satellite may usually be 500 km-1500 km, and an orbital period (a period that the satellite rotates around the Earth) may be about 1.5 hours-2 hours. Signal transmission delay of single-hop communication between users may be about 20 ms. The delay of single-hop communication between users may refer to delay of transmission from the terminal device to the network device. A maximum satellite visible time may be about 20 minutes. The maximum visible time may be a longest time period that beams of the satellite covers a certain area of the ground. The LEO satellite may be movable relative to the ground. As the satellite moves, a ground area covered by the satellite may change. A signal propagation distance of the LEO satellite may be short, and a link loss may be low, and therefore, a transmitting power of the terminal device may not be required to be high. The altitude of the orbit of the GEO satellite may be usually 35786 km, and an orbital period may be 24 hours. The delay of signal transmission of single-hop communication between users may be 250 ms. In order to ensure coverage of the satellite and improve system capacity of the communication network, the satellite may use multiple beams to cover the ground. For example, one satellite may form dozens or hundreds of beams to cover the ground, and one of the dozens or hundreds of beams may cover a ground area of tens to hundreds of kilometers in diameter. Of course, the network device may also be a base station installed on land, on water, and so on. For example, the network device may be a next generation base station (gNB) or a next generation-evolved NodeB (ng-eNB). The gNB provides a user-plane function and a control-plane function of new radio (NR) for the UE. To be noted that, the gNB and the ng-eNB may only be a name to indicate a base station supporting the 5G network system, and do not have a limited meaning. The network device may also be a base transceiver station (BTS) in a GSM system or a CDMA system, or a base station in a WCDMA system (NB), or an evolutional node B (eNB or eNodeB) in an LTE system. Alternatively, the network device may be a relay station, an access point, a vehicle-mounted device, a wearable device, and a network device in a PLMN network after the 5G, a road site unit (RSU), and so on.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Continuity of a TN service and a NTN service: In order to ensure that continuous services can be provided to a terminal device, the TN service and the NTN service usually need to be continuous. The NT service may refer to a service under NT, and the NTN service may refer to a service under NTN. Continuity of the NTN service may be ensured by the following ways.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a first way, when the terminal device is served by a NTN cell (that is, the NTN cell provides the NTN service for the terminal device), TN measurement for the TN cell may be de-activated. That is, while the TNT cell is providing the NTN service to the terminal device, the terminal device may not perform measurement on the TN cell to prevent the NTN service from being interrupted. The terminal device performing measurement on the cell may indicate measurement of a signal of the cell or measurement of a beam corresponding to the cell, and so on. The measurement of the cell may obtain at least one of following information: a reference signal received power (RSRP), a reference signal receiving quality (RSRQ), a signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), a received signal strength indication (RSSI), and so on.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a second way, when the terminal device tries to detect potential TN coverage (even when served by the NTN cell), a long periodic (less frequent measurements) configuration (provided by a serving RAN) may be configured for the terminal device. In other words, when the terminal device tries to measure the TN cell, the measurement of the TN cell may be performed across a relatively long period, such that measurements of the TN cell may be performed less frequently.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Mobility of the NT service and the NTN service: Since the terminal device and the network device may be mobile, the NT service and the NTN service may be mobile. The terminal device may switch from one network to another. For example, the terminal device may switch from the NTN to the NT. Alternatively, priority of the NT may be higher than that of the NTN. That is, the terminal device may access the NT with priority. When the terminal device is located in the NTN cell, the terminal device may measure the TN cell to switch to the TN cell. In the following, a way of the terminal device in the NR performing measurement on a cell may be explained.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For a terminal device in an unconnected state in the NR:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the NR, a protocol state of radio resource control (RRC) may include: a RRC idle state, a RRC inactive state and a RRC connected state.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the terminal device is in the RRC idle state, service mobility may be achieved through cell reselection of the terminal device. A core network (CN) may initiate paging and configure a paging area. A UE access stratum (AS) context may be absent in the network device. The RRC connection between the terminal device and the network device may not be present.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the terminal device is in the RRC inactive state, service mobility may be achieved through cell reselection of the terminal device. Connection between the CN and the NR may be present. The UE AS context may be present in the network device. A RAN may initiate paging and configure the paging area. The network device may determine a location of the terminal device based on a level of the paging area configured by the RAN.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the terminal device is in the RRC connected state, the network device may control mobility of the service. RRC connection may be present between the network device and the terminal device, and data may be transferred between the network device and the terminal device. The UE AS context may be present in each of the network device and the terminal device. The location of the terminal device obtained by the network device may be at a cell level.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the terminal device is in the RRC idle state or in the RRC inactive state, in order to support the mobility of the terminal device, the terminal device may perform signal measurement on a current cell and/or a cell adjacent to the current cell to achieve cell selection or reselection. The network device may inform the terminal device of configuration information for cell selection or reselection by broadcasting. For example, the configuration information may include a measurement frequency point, a list of neighboring cells corresponding to each measurement frequency point, and so on.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The network device may configure a synchronous block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) parameter for each measurement frequency point. The SMTC parameter may be configured to indicate a time point when the terminal device receives the synchronous signal block (SSB). The terminal device may receive the SSB based on the SMTC and measure signal quality of the current cell and/or the cell adjacent to the current cell based on the received SSB to perform cell selection or reselection.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For a Terminal Device in the NR Connected State:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the terminal device is in the NR connected state, the network device may send measurement configuration information to the terminal device. The terminal device may perform cell measurement based on the measurement configuration information and perform cell selection or reselection based on cell measurement results. For example, the network device may send the measurement configuration information to the terminal device via an RRC message. In some embodiments, the measurement configuration information may include at least one of: a measurement object, reporting configuration, a measurement identity, a measurement gap.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Measurement Object: For intra-frequency measurement and inter-frequency measurement, each measurement object may indicate a time-frequency location to be measured and a sub-carrier interval of a reference signal. For the inter-frequency measurement, each measurement object may correspond to one independent E-UTRA frequency point. The network device may configure a cell associated with the measurement object. For example, the network device may configure one or more of: a cell offset list, a cell black list, and a cell white list. The terminal device may perform event evaluation and measurement on any cell in the white list, but may not perform the event evaluation and the measurement on any cell in the black list.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Reporting Configuration: Each measurement object may correspond to one or more reporting configurations. The reporting configuration may include at least one of: a reporting criterion, an RS type, and a reporting format. The reporting criterion may be a trigger condition for the terminal device to perform measurement reporting. The reporting may be triggered periodically or may be triggered by a measurement event. The RS type may be a type of an RS used by the terminal device to perform beam and cell measurement. The RS type may be SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS. The reporting format may be the amount of reported measurements performed by the terminal device for each cell and each beam (such as a reference signal receiving power (RSRP)). The reporting format may include other relevant information, such as the maximum number of cells reported by the terminal device and the maximum number of beams reported by the terminal device for each cell. The measurement event supported in the NR can include: an A1 event, an A2 event, an A3 event, an A4 event, an A5 event, an A6 event, a B1 event, and a B2 event. The A1 event may be that signal quality of a serving cell is higher than a threshold. The A2 event may be that signal quality of a serving cell is lower than a threshold. The A3 event may be that signal quality of a neighboring cell is higher than a threshold compared to signal quality of a SpCell (primary and primary-secondary cell). The A4 event may be that the signal quality of the neighboring cell is higher than a threshold. The A5 event may be that the signal quality of the SpCell is lower than a threshold 1. The A6 event may be that the signal quality of the neighboring cell is higher than a threshold compared to the signal quality of the PCell (primary cell). The B1 event may be that the signal quality of the neighboring cell of the inter-frequency measurement is higher than a threshold. The B2 event may be that the signal quality of the PCell (primary cell) is lower than the threshold 1, and the signal quality of the neighboring cell of the inter-frequency measurement is higher than a threshold 2.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Measurement Identity: The measurement identifier may associate the measurement object with the reporting configuration. One measurement object may be associated with a plurality of reporting configurations at the same time. One reporting configuration may be associated with a plurality of measurement objects at the same time. The above associations may be distinguished based on the measurement identifier. The measurement identifier may be an independent ID.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Measurement Gap: The measurement gap may be configured to indicate a time point when the terminal device performs inter-frequency measurement or inter-system measurement. The terminal device may perform inter-frequency measurement or inter-system measurement during the measurement gap. Measurement gap configuration may include a period of the measurement gap (mgrp), a starting time of the measurement gap within one period (also known as a starting time gap offset), a time length of the measurement gap (mgl), and so on.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Measurement Reporting: Measurement reporting may refer to the terminal device sending a measurement report to the network device. After the terminal device performs measurement on the cell, when certain trigger conditions are met, the terminal device may perform evaluation of measurement reporting. When the conditions for reporting are met, the terminal device may send a measurement report to the network device. The measurement report may include following three categories: event-triggered reporting, periodic reporting and event-triggered periodic reporting.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Event-triggered reporting means that sending the measurement report may be triggered only when the terminal device meets a measurement event entry threshold configured by the network device and lasts for a period of time. A reporting process may be terminated after the measurement report is sent for once. The reporting configuration corresponding to the criterion may include the following. A trigger type may be &#x201c;event&#x201d; and include one of the measurement events A1-A6 and B1-B2 and the threshold parameter corresponding to each of the included event. The number of reporting may be 1. The reporting gap may be ignored by the terminal device regardless of a value of the reporting gap.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Periodic reporting means that the terminal device may perform measurements on corresponding frequency points based on configured content of the network device, and may send the measurement report based on a prescribed reporting period and gap. The reporting period of the terminal device may be a period configured by the network device. Objectives of reporting by the terminal device may include: &#x201c;reportCGI (reporting a cell global identifier)&#x201d; and &#x201c;reportStrongestCell (reporting the strongest cell)&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the objective of reporting is &#x201c;reportCGI&#x201d;, the number of reporting may be equal to 1.

When the distance between the terminal device and the ground reference point is greater than the eighth distance threshold and less than or equal to the ninth distance threshold, the SMTC parameter 2 may be determined as the SMTC parameter. When the distance between the terminal device and the ground reference point is greater than the ninth distance threshold, the SMTC parameter 1 may be determined as the SMTC parameter.
