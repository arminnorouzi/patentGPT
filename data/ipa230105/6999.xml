Assurance levels (&#x201c;ALs&#x201d;) relate to a degree of confidence that a claimed identity is related to an online identity. Additionally, ALs relate the degree of confidence that a claimed credential is associated with the online identity. Assurance levels have been defined in a number of documents by standards bodies, including the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (&#x201c;OMB&#x201d;), International Organization for Standardization (&#x201c;ISO&#x201d;), National Institute of Standards and Technology (&#x201c;NIST&#x201d;), Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (&#x201c;FICAM&#x201d;), the Kantara Initiative, etc., such as OMB M-04-04, NIST 800-63-2, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Parties seeking authentication of an online identity and/or a credential of an online identity may require a certain AL before conducting an online or offline transaction with the user being authenticated.

Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An identity provider, also referred to as a credential service provider, may provide authentication services in order to verify an online identity and/or one or more credentials of a user (real person) in a networked environment. The identity provider, in verifying an online identity and/or a credential of a user, may associate the user with an online identity, such as a username, and the one or more credentials with the online identity. When verifying (authenticating) online identities and/or credentials, an assurance level (&#x201c;AL&#x201d;), which relates to a degree of confidence that an online identity and/or a credential are associated with the user are accurate, may be determined through various procedures. Online identities, credentials, and associated ALs may all be stored by an identity provider to serve future authentication requests and/or to preserve histories of changes related to a user. Examples of identity providers that rely on low assurance levels may include ID.me, Facebook Connect, Google, and LinkedIn. Examples of identity providers that rely on high assurance levels may include ID.me, Symantec, Verizon, and bank logins.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A relying party (&#x201c;RP&#x201d;) may be one or more of an organization, a business, and/or an individual that seek authentication of a user. RPs may provide user related data to the identity provider to request authentication of a new and/or unidentified online identity, to request authentication of the credentials of a user, and/or to seek re-authentication of an online identity and/or credential of a user. Additionally, and/or alternatively, a user (real person) may provide user-related data to the identity provider to authenticate themselves with an online identity and/or to authenticate a credential.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A credential broker may allow a plurality of identity providers (credential service providers) to integrate their authentication services with multiple relying parties. A credential broker may also allow a plurality of relying parties that wish to authenticate an online identity and/or one or more credentials of a user (real person) in a networked environment to integrate a single entity, the credential broker, rather than a plurality of identity providers (credential service providers). In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a credential broker and an identity provider may be a single entity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to authenticate a user's online identity and/or credential, the identity provider may access various verification data sources. These verification data sources may provide various trustworthy data related to the user for the authentication party. For example, verification data sources may include, but are not limited to, federal agencies, financial institutions, membership organizations, credit bureaus, national archives, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The identity provider may maintain an internal directory of users in an identity core database. The identity core database may be unpublished and/or inaccessible to third-parties. The identity core database may be used by the identity party to provide authentication services and/or provide ALs via various online data formats and protocols, such as a Security Assertion Markup Language (&#x201c;SAML&#x201d;), OAuth, OpenID, etc. The process of populating the identity core database may occur in response to a RP seeking authentication of an online identity and/or credential. The identity provider may create and/or implement a pre-defined procedure for a particular RP in order to automatically obtain the requested authentications and/or ALs. The procedures defined for an RP may instruct the identity provider which verification data sources to access in order to provide an authentication and/or a requested AL.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A credential broker, for a transaction to be authenticated, may receive identification information from an identity provider. Alternatively, the credential broker, for the transaction to be authenticated, may receive identification information directly from a user and/or a third-party. The identification information may include one or more of a first name, last name, full name, date of birth, social security number, address, and/or other information related to the user. In one embodiment, if the identity provider and the credential broker are the same entity, the credential broker may receive login information and lookup identification information stored in, for example, the identity core database. In another embodiment, if the identity provider and the credential broker are different entities, the credential broker may receive the identification information from a requester.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Upon receiving and/or retrieving, the identification information, the credential broker may then hash the identification information. After the credential broker hashes the identification information, the credential broker may remove and/or delete the identification information. In alternative embodiment, the credential broker, for a transaction to be authenticated, may receive a predetermined hash of the identification information. The predetermined hash may be hashed identification information provided by a requestor. The predetermined hash may be a hash of identification information that the credential provider and the requestor have previously determined to be used for the predetermined hash.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The credential broker may then compare the hashed identification information with previously stored hashed identification information in a hash database of the credential broker. If the hashed identification information does not match any previously stored hashed identification information, the credential broker may store the hashed identification information and the identity provider transmitting the identification information in the hash database. The credential broker may then transmit an authentication result to a relying party.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">If the hashed identification information matches a previously stored hashed identification information, the credential broker may compare the identity provider that sent the identification information to a previous identity provider stored in association with the previously stored hashed identification information. If the current identity provider matches the previous identity provider, then the credential broker may then transmit an authentication result to the RP.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">If the hashed identification information matches a previously stored hashed identification information and the current identity provider does not match the previous identity provider, then the user may authenticate their identity with the previous identity provider. Alternatively, if the hashed identification information matches a previously stored hashed identification information and the current identity provider does not match the previous identity provider, then the user may be notified to authenticate their identity with the previous identity provider.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, authentication requests from one or more of the identity provider, credential broker, a RP, and/or a user may be encrypted and/or signed. Additionally, and/or alternatively, any communications between the identity provider, RP, credential broker, verification data sources, and/or users may be encrypted and/or signed using various cryptology methods, including SSL and/or SOAP.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Users that are being authenticated by a relying party may authorize the identity provider to access the verification data sources prior to authentication and/or prior to the authentication being presented to the RP.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The systems and methods described herein may provide a secure way of authenticating a user while also providing privacy for the user. A benefit of the present disclosure is that a credential broker does not maintain any personal identification information of the user while being able to authenticate the user based on non-personally identifiable hashed information. Further, if a user's personal identification information is stolen and if their secure login information is compromised, the user's online credentials may remain secure through the user of the credential broker.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, if the user's person identification information is stolen, an identity thief may use the user's stolen name, date of birth, address, and/or social security number to attempt to open a new account. When the identify thief attempts to login with a new identity provider that utilizes a credential broker as described herein, the identity thief may be requested to provide login information of a separate, previously stored identity provider if the user has previously used the credential broker. In this example, an identity thief may be in possession of static personally information of the user, but the identity thief may not know how to authenticate that identity via a previously registered user. If the legitimate user has not previously used the credential broker, the user may be notified of the identity theft (when attempting to register with the credential broker) because the legitimate user will not be able to log into an account that uses the credential broker. The legitimate user may then be able to assert control over their online identity through their legitimate credentials and prevent further fraud. In another example, one or more of an organization, business, and/or relying party may suffer from fraud, hacking, or theft, and may notify the credential broker and/or users. Then, the credential broker may revoke credentials that have been compromised, and may notify users of compromised credentials to restore control and registration of new credentials.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As discussed above and below, a benefit of the present disclosure is that it may allow for identity proofing. In particular, the present disclosure may allow for an individual to be validated and/or one or more attributes of an individual, such as first name, last name, social security number, date of birth, and/or address, to be validated. Accordingly, the present disclosure may allow for the individual to be validated upon validation of the one or more attributes. For example, an individual may be validated upon confirming that the individual's name is John Smith with a date of birth of Jun. 10, 1985, and a home and/or mailing address of 123 King Street, Alexandria, Va. 22222. Further, the present disclosure may include the ability to use the one or more attributes to resolve to an individual to a single, unique identity. For example, a social security number (&#x201c;SSN&#x201d;) may be used by a bank to resolve multiple John Smiths with the same date of birth to a particular individual. Upon resolving the individual to the single, unique identity, a digital credential may be issued to the individual. The digital credential, along with the one or more attributes and/or other information, may then be used to determine whether an individual having the digital credential is the legitimate individual or an identity thief.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">One exemplary use of the present disclosure may be in voting. A non-personally identifiable, unique identifier may be assigned to a voter. The non-personally identifiable, unique identifier may be hashed and published to a block chain and/or a database after the particular identity (person) votes in the election. When combined with identity proofing at a high assurance level that meets federal standards and an ability to establish voting age, citizenship, and uniqueness, then the combination of the present disclosure with public records may record that a specific, unique legal identity of a voting age cast his/her vote for a particular candidate without revealing the actual identity of the voter.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another exemplary use of the present disclosure may be with Federal Bureau of Investigation (&#x201c;FBI&#x201d;) background check results. Currently, the FBI allows citizens to request their own criminal background histories. The FBI also may send background check results to state and local government agencies to determine whether a particular person may work in a regulated industry, such as at an airport, as an in-home caregiver, a taxi driver , an ambulance driver, etc. However, a citizen, who has requested their own criminal background history may not be able to share their results with a third party directly without ensuring the results have not been manipulated. The problem with the citizen path is that a chain of custody goes the FBI to the citizen to a third party. By use of the present disclosure, the FBI may publish the citizen's criminal background check results to a private block chain, and the citizen may control delegated access to the results. The block chain may prevent the results from alteration and the hashing of the identification information by a credential broker may ensure that the legitimate citizen maintained complete control over the release of their criminal background check results.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Yet another exemplary use of the present disclosure may be with banking and/or sharing economy applications. Banks may need to comply with Know Your Customer (&#x201c;KYC&#x201d;), Anti-Money Laundering (&#x201c;AML&#x201d;), and/or Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#x201c;OFAC&#x201d;) regulations. Sharing economy apps, such as Uber and AirBnB, may also need to verify the identity and criminal history of their suppliers (though requirements differ from city to city and state to state for sharing economy).

The secure data centers may be located at geographical alternate sites, and may include multi-layer physical security. Use of such data centers allows for the minimization of opportunities for unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, and/or corruption of sensitive and system information, and of IT resources upon which the service is dependent. The location and construction, when combined with other physical security protection mechanisms, such as guards and intrusion sensors, may provide robust protection against unauthorized access to the identity provider's and/or credential broker's equipment and records and protection from adverse environmental conditions.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">If the identity provider and/or credential broker uses third-party hosting, the ability of the identity provider and/or credential broker to provide facilities that meet the above-described security considerations may be determined either by a physical inspection by the authentication party and/or through review of independent analyses and audits of the facilities.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The identity provider and/or credential broker may also use development facilities, which do not process real user data, may also be protected by multi-layer physical security, minimizing the opportunities for unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, and/or corruption of sensitive and system information, and of IT resources on which development is dependent. The identity provider and/or credential broker may also use back-up and/or disaster-recovery sites including the same level of protection. A reduced level of security may be permissible to the extent that no real user data is stored. Security may be sufficient to ensure that the sensitivity of proprietary information and the ability to support the production system is not compromised.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The identity provider and/or credential broker may also allow information and media to be transported between sites. Sensitive information and IT resources in the custody of staff of an identity provider and/or credential broker may be protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, and/or corruption by having special procedures for use and potential storage in public areas, such as hotels, restaurants, car parks. Further, any back-up and/or disaster-recovery sites may have the same special procedures for the same level of protection.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the event that the identity provider and/or credential broker has sensitive information to be disposed of, such as unhashed identification information received by the credential broker, disposal methods may meet or exceed the requirements and/or policies of various standard setting bodies, including the Department of Defense (&#x201c;DOD&#x201d;) and/or National Institute of Standards and Technology (&#x201c;NIST&#x201d;), in order to ensure that techniques applied match the storage media technology in use.

Risk assessments may analyze threats including, but not limited to, password guessing; message replay; eavesdropping; introduction of malicious code; compromised authentication arising from insider action; out-of-band attacks by users, system operators, and/or third-parties; spoofing of system elements and/or applications; malfeasance on the part of a user; and/or intrusions leading to information theft.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each transaction may be protected by end-to-end encryption, such that all data transfers are secured. Additionally, full-time automated monitoring and test script execution may be provided with automated notification to operational personnel. Further, daily system management reports may be produced, reviewed, and/or protectively stored. System management reports may include security events, transactions processed, system usage and/or capacity, and/or system availability.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The identity provider and/or credential broker may employ an identity-based key management architecture. Keys may be assigned key names (identities) and the assigned key names may be used to reference the appropriate key. The key naming model may be used with an identity-based encryption, in which the key name may be mathematically converted into a public key, as well as with symmetric encryption algorithms, such as format-preserving encryption (&#x201c;FPE&#x201d;), and advanced encryption standards (&#x201c;AES&#x201d;), in which the key name may be used to derive a symmetric key.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Initially, an identity provider and/or credential broker base key may be generated. A separate base key may also be generated for each encryption algorithm. The identity-based encryption (&#x201c;IBE&#x201d;) base key may be maintained as a master secret. Further, a one-time backup of the one or more IBE base keys may be performed in order to provide for disaster recovery.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">When a key is requested from a Key Management System (&#x201c;KMS&#x201d;), the key name may be used to generate the actual keying material, i.e., the symmetric key in the case of symmetric encryption algorithms, such as FPE, AES, and/or triple data encryption standard (&#x201c;3DES&#x201d;), and the private key, in the case of IBE. After the requesting entity has been appropriately authenticated, the KMS may use a Key Derivation Function (&#x201c;KDF&#x201d;) to combine the base key and the key name, producing the actual keying material.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">This derived-key approach enables the KMS of an identity provider and/or credential broker to be stateless, which allows individual encryption keys to be generated on-demand from a base key. The ability to derive keys may be deployed in a highly distributed environment without the need to continuously replicate keys across servers. For example, if a key is required for disaster recovery or audit purposes, the key may be regenerated.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Keys may have a predetermined lifecycle when used to encrypt data, and may be refreshed on a predetermined schedule. The KMS of the identity provider and/or credential broker may incorporate a key expiration and derivation system that allows complete management of a key lifecycle. Keys provided by the identity provider and/or credential broker may include an inherent time reference that determines when the key is to be automatically cycled. Additionally, keys may reference distinct base keys, which allows for a procedure-based key refresh.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Any of the systems, servers, modules, and/or devices, discussed above may include any type or combination of computing systems, such as handheld devices, personal computers, servers, clustered computing machines, and/or cloud computing systems.
