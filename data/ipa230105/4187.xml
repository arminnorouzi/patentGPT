More particularly, the present embodiments relate to a modular expansion hub and related system for attaching accessories to a computing device or for mounting the computing device to a stand.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Portable computing devices have grown in popularity and ubiquity worldwide in recent years. Users of these devices have found applications for many different types of work and in settings in nearly all parts of life. In some ways, these devices have been used to replace or improve other devices, such as flashlights, cash registers, lab equipment, scientific instruments, cameras, and other electronic devices. The convenience and adaptability of portable computing devices such as tablet computers and smart phones have therefore helped serve many needs of users for many purposes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such portable computing devices often have batteries that need to be regularly charged between uses. Thus, although the devices can provide great benefits in remote areas and when used in mobile applications, they also frequently need to be connected to power to restore charge. In these times, users often find it difficult to quickly and easily control the charging of the device while still operating the device, particularly in settings where the portable computing devices are under heavy duty loads and operating cycles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the computing devices can be very effective on their own, it is also common to use a case or cover on the computing device to protect it from bumps, drops, scrapes, scratches, and other damage. The presence of a cover can make the mounting and securement of a computing device or a charger complex, unreliable, slow, or otherwise challenging. These covers also similarly inhibit the usage of electronic accessories that are connected to the computing device due to interference from the cover or an undesirable connection to the computing device. There is a constant need for improvements in portable computing devices, covers, and related parts of these systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of the present disclosure relates to an expansion hub for a portable electronic device, wherein the expansion hub includes a housing having a rear side, a first electrical connector to connect to an electronic device, a second electrical connector on the rear side of the housing and configured to mate to a third electrical connector in a rear direction relative to the housing, with the second electrical connector being in electrical communication with the first electrical connector, and a mounting connector to mate the housing to a second mounting connector positioned external to the rear side of the housing in response to movement of the housing in the rear direction.

It should be understood that the following descriptions are not intended to limit the embodiments to one preferred embodiment. To the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the described embodiments as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following disclosure relates to modular electronic device systems that can enable smoother and more intuitive, seamless, durable, and adaptable interfacing between a portable computing device and a cover, a stand, an expansion device hub, and accessories mountable to the computing device or to the cover. In example embodiment, the modular electronic device system can include a case or cover for electronic device, wherein the case includes an electrical connector to engage in electrical contact with the electronic device, an electrical connector facing in a rear direction from the case (i.e., facing in a direction perpendicular to the rear surface of the case or perpendicular to a rear surface of the electronic device), and latching portions on the case for attaching the case to a support base arm or to an accessory device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The support base can be releasably connectable to the latching portion of the case and can provide an electrical connection to a power source, such as a power source used to charge the electronic device through the electrical connectors embedded or held by the case. An accessory device can include a latching portion that is releasably connectable to a latching portion of the case and can electronically connected to an electrical connector on the case.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the electronic device can be protected by case while being easily attachable and detachable from the support base and the accessory device without having to remove the electronic device from the case and without having to connect and disconnect sensitive plugs at a side or end portion of the electronic device. Thus, with an electrical connector on the case and facing in rear direction, the case can be mounted to the support base with the arm latching portion facing the rear-facing electrical connector on the case. This orientation allows a user to make a pushing motion to attach the case to the support base arm for easy mounting. In other words, the user can hold the electronic device with the front of the user interface facing the user's face, and, while in that orientation, can move the electronic device in a rear direction to latch to the mount of the arm without having to look behind the electronic device or case. Additionally, the stand latching portion of the case can support the case at the center of the rear of the case so that the case and any electronic device within it will be balanced as it is supported by the arm/stand.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accessory devices can be modularly attached and detached from the case and, simultaneously, attached and detached from electrical communication with electrical connectors extending through the case so that power and information can be exchanged between the accessory device and electronic device positioned in the case. Accessory devices can include devices such as credit card readers, light sensors, antennas, laser scanners, oxygen sensors, air sensors, printers, related devices, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another aspect of the disclosure relates to an expansion hub for portable electronic device, wherein the expansion hub includes a housing with a rear side, a first electrical connector to connect to the electronic device, and a second electrical connector on the rear side of the housing and configured to mate or mount to a third electrical connector in a rear direction relative to the housing. The second electrical connector can be in electrical communication with the first electrical connector. The hub can also include a mounting connector to blindly mate the housing to a second mounting connector positioned external to the rear side of the housing in response to movement of the housing in the rear direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With the mounting connector mated to the second mounting connector, the second electrical connector can be in electrical communication with a third electrical connector. The expansion hub can therefore provide electrical connection to an electronic device and an electrical connection to an external (i.e., third) electrical connector that is to the rear of the housing of the hub. For example, the first electrical connector can plug into or otherwise connect to an electrical interface of the portable electronic device, and the second electrical connector can plug into or otherwise connect to an electrical interface of the separate device, such as a stand, accessory, or additional expansion hub.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The rear positioning of the second electrical connector can allow the expansion hub to be moved in a rearward direction as it establishes a connection to the separate device. In this way, a person using the expansion hub can make the electrical connection to the separate device without having to look at the connector as it mounts to the separate device. Furthermore, with the expansion hub integrated into a case or cover for the portable electronic device, the user can hold the sides of the electronic device or cover and move the electronic device in a rear direction (i.e., along a direction extending perpendicular to the rear side of the device or hub) to mount the electronic device and cover to the separate device. While the electronic device and cover are moved in this manner, the mounting connector of the expansion hub can &#x201c;blindly mate&#x201d; with the second mounting connector, wherein mechanically latching, magnetically engaging, or otherwise securing or locking parts on the separate device and the expansion of engage with each other, interlock with each other, or provide an attractive force to each other while the user is positioned on the front side of the device and the connectors on the rear side are not visible to the user (i.e., the user is visually &#x201c;blind&#x201d; to their mating). In some configurations, the expansion hub can have a mounting connector that mates with the second mounting connector using a biased latch system, and the second electrical connector can meet with the third electrical connector using an interface including at least one biased pin (e.g., a pogo pin) or other biased member or electrical conductor. The biased latch system can have a feature that prevents the electronic device and cover from unintentionally falling off of the stand when the latch is initially unlocked.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Modular systems such as those disclosed herein can take on a wide array of different configurations based on which modules are connected to the system at a given time. For example, the system can include an electronic device, a case, an accessory hub or device adapter, a stand, and one or more accessory devices. In another example, the system can include the electronic device, a case, and the stand. In another example, the system can include electronic device, a case, and the accessory hub. The one or more accessories can be added as a supplement to other components to provide different types of expansion via new sensors, batteries, storage devices, and other useful components. The electronic device and case can be used while mounted to the stand directly or while the device adapter is positioned between the case and the stand, and, in either situation, power or data can be exchanged between the electronic device, the stand, and/or accessories connected to the case, electronic device, or device adapter. Thus, the modular system can be used while mounted to a stand or while disconnected from and separated from the stand.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to the figures.

The rear surface <b>140</b> can therefore face away from the user in a rear-facing direction <b>142</b> that is perpendicular to the rear surface <b>140</b> of the electronic device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cover <b>102</b> can be referred to as a reversibly removable (i.e., non-destructively removable and without adhesive) case, skin, or protector for the electronic device <b>104</b> that is added to the housing <b>122</b>. The cover <b>102</b> can have a rear portion <b>144</b> configured to overlap and at least partially cover or enclose the rear surface <b>140</b> of the electronic device <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the rear portion <b>144</b> can cover all of the rear surface <b>140</b> or substantially all of the rear surface <b>140</b> (e.g., all of the rear surface <b>140</b> except for a cutout for the camera <b>133</b> or another rear-facing sensor). The cover <b>102</b> can therefore act as a barrier preventing other objects from contacting and potentially damaging the rear surface <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the cover <b>102</b> can include one or more sidewalls <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> configured to at least partially wrap around lateral sides of the electronic device <b>104</b> (e.g., the sides through which the buttons <b>128</b> are positioned, through which the speaker <b>130</b> is exposed, or through which the electronic port <b>132</b> is positioned). In this manner, the cover <b>102</b> can enclose or house multiple sides of the electronic device <b>104</b> and can protect the electronic device <b>104</b> from impacts or contact with other potentially damaging exposure on its lateral sides. See also cover <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref>. In some embodiments, the cover <b>102</b> can include a material that is water-resistant, caustic-chemical-resistant, or anti-bacterial to provide additional durability and protection for the electronic device <b>104</b> and its users. In some cases, the cover <b>102</b> can include a material that is easily cleanable. These features can be especially beneficial in hospitals and other health-related and dirty settings.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cover <b>102</b> can include an expansion hub <b>154</b> positioned in and protruding from the center of the rear portion <b>144</b>. In some embodiments, the expansion hub <b>154</b> can be positioned centered within a range of about 10 percent the overall width and/or length from the center point of the rear portion <b>144</b>. The expansion hub <b>154</b> can have a rear electrical connector <b>156</b> and a latching or mounting connector <b>158</b> (e.g., a biased latch), as described in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. The expansion hub <b>154</b> can also have an electronic device connector <b>160</b> configured to make electronic contact with the electronic port <b>132</b> of the electronic device <b>104</b>. For example, the device connector <b>160</b> can include a plug that is inserted into the port <b>132</b> to establish electrical communication between the connector <b>160</b> and the expansion hub <b>154</b>. As used herein, two parts can be in &#x201c;electrical communication&#x201d; with each other when they are electrically connected to each other in a manner providing transfer of power or data signals between the parts. In some examples, the electrical communication can be through electrical contact between the parts, such as by conductive structures engaging with each other. In some examples, the electrical communication can be provided through wireless electrical pairing or exchange, such as by paired inductive coils providing power or by a wireless data communications antenna/transceiver. In some configurations, the device connector <b>160</b> can engage the electronic device in a direction perpendicular to the rear direction. For instance, the connector <b>160</b> can be configured to make a connection with (e.g., plug into) the electronic device <b>104</b> parallel to an axis perpendicular to direction <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cover <b>102</b> can also include multiple outer perimeter edges (e.g., <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>). In some embodiments, these outer perimeter edges are simply part of the material used to enclose the electronic device <b>104</b>, but in some embodiments, one or more outer perimeter edges can include an accessory connector (e.g., <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>170</b>) configured to mount and attach an accessory device <b>110</b> and to provide electrical communication between the accessory device <b>110</b> and the expansion hub <b>154</b>. Accordingly, the accessory connectors can be positioned at the peripheral parts of the cover <b>102</b> and can mechanically mount accessory devices while also providing electrical contacts for the accessory devices to be powered and to provide or receive signals from the electronic device <b>104</b> via the expansion hub <b>154</b> and connector <b>160</b>. An example accessory connector system is described in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The stand <b>106</b> can be configured to provide support to the electronic device <b>104</b> and cover <b>102</b> and to suspend them above a support surface (e.g., a tabletop, desk, or wall) to which the stand <b>106</b> is attached or on which the stand <b>106</b> is resting. For instance, the stand <b>106</b> and its arm portion can suspend the case or cover with the rear direction of the cover <b>102</b> being substantially horizontal (i.e., with the front- and rear-facing surfaces being vertical). The stand <b>106</b> can therefore be referred to as a support device that supports one or more modular components of the system <b>100</b>, a base station configured to provide a &#x201c;home&#x201d; or base location for the attachment of modular components of the system <b>100</b> to a support surface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The stand <b>106</b> can include an arm portion <b>172</b> extending from a vertical beam <b>174</b> and a base portion <b>176</b>. A distal end <b>178</b> of the arm portion <b>172</b> can include an arm electrical connector to establish an electrical connection to the rear electrical connector <b>156</b> of the expansion hub <b>154</b> or to a rear electrical connector of the device adapter <b>108</b>. See, e.g., the connection system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and its related description below. The arm portion <b>172</b> can include a hinge <b>180</b> configured to pivot the distal end <b>178</b> relative to the vertical beam <b>174</b>, such as by pivoting the distal end <b>178</b> about a horizontal pivot axis <b>182</b>. In some embodiments, the arm portion <b>172</b> can pivot relative to the base portion <b>176</b> about a vertical pivot axis <b>183</b>. Additionally, in some cases, the distal end <b>178</b> can rotate relative to the hinge <b>180</b>, such as by allowing the distal end <b>178</b> to pivot between a first orientation (e.g., a landscape orientation) and a second orientation (e.g., a portrait orientation rotated 90 degrees relative to the landscape orientation), as indicated by arrow <b>181</b>. The connected cover <b>102</b> and device adapter <b>108</b> can therefore also rotate between those rotated positions while being connected to the distal end <b>178</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The additional electronic component <b>114</b> can provide a connection to an external device or power source for the system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the additional electronic component <b>114</b> can therefore be a plug or cord connecting the base portion <b>176</b> to a power grid or other power source. In some embodiments, the base portion <b>176</b> can include a power bank (e.g., a battery) or other electronic components (e.g., an electronic storage device or auxiliary device connector hub) configured to supplement or add to the capabilities of the electronic device <b>104</b> and that are therefore connected to the electronic device <b>104</b> via the distal end <b>178</b> of the arm portion <b>172</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The device adapter <b>108</b> can be referred to as a device hub. The device adapter <b>108</b> can be mountable to the cover <b>102</b> and can electrically connect to the rear electrical connector <b>156</b> using a front-facing electrical connector on the device adapter <b>108</b>. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. The device adapter <b>108</b> can also include a rear electrical connector <b>184</b> and a device hub configured to extend the capabilities of the cover <b>102</b> when added to the cover <b>102</b>. The device adapter <b>108</b> can therefore provide a pass-through connection from the rear electrical connector <b>156</b> to rear electrical connector <b>184</b> for the transfer of power and electronic communication (e.g., from the stand <b>106</b>) to the electronic device <b>104</b> through the cover <b>102</b> and device adapter <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a module hub (e.g., a USB device hub) can be positioned in the device adapter <b>108</b> to manage the provision of power and data from accessories (e.g., <b>112</b>) and the stand <b>106</b> to the cover <b>102</b>. The device hub of the device adapter <b>108</b> can be connected to the front- and rear-facing electrical connectors of the device adapter <b>108</b> and can control the transfer of power and data connections through the device adapter <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the device adapter <b>108</b> includes one or more peripheral or accessory connection ports, plugs, pins, or mounting positions (e.g., latching portions <b>186</b>) configured to couple with and electrically connect the accessories (e.g., <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>) to the device adapter <b>108</b>. The latching portions <b>186</b> can therefore include electrical connections to the device hub and, via the device hub, to the front- and rear-facing electrical connectors. In this manner, the electronic device <b>104</b> can exchange, send, or receive signals from the accessories attached to the device adapter <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The addition of the device adapter <b>108</b> to the cover <b>102</b> can increase the overall number or connection types of the mounting points for accessories as compared to the cover <b>102</b> alone. For example, plugs or sockets for connection to accessories on the device adapter <b>108</b> can be different types (e.g., one-way versus two-way data transfer, audio versus video, VGA versus HDMI display ports, etc.) or can provide different power levels than the cover <b>102</b> or relative to each other. In some embodiments, the cover <b>102</b> lacks any accessory connectors, and the addition of the device adapter <b>108</b> therefore introduces the possibility for accessory expansion of the capabilities of the electronic device <b>104</b>. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the device adapter <b>108</b> can include integrated components (e.g., a battery, camera, etc.) that, rather than using a latching portion <b>186</b> to attach to the system <b>100</b>, are an integrated part of the device adapter <b>108</b> itself and are usable by the electronic device via the device adapter <b>108</b> and cover <b>102</b> when the device <b>104</b> is mounted in the cover <b>102</b> and the device adapter <b>108</b> is mounted to the cover <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The accessory devices <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> can include input devices (e.g., sensors, thermometers, keypads, barcode scanners, magnetic strip or chip readers, etc.), output devices (e.g., lights, rangefinding emitters, printers, external device controls, displays or display connections, etc.), electronic storage components (e.g., flash memory), energy storage devices (e.g., batteries), similar devices, and combinations thereof. The accessory devices <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> can be attachable to the cover <b>102</b>, to the device adapter <b>108</b>, or to either one interchangeably. In some embodiments, the mounting or latching positions on the cover <b>102</b> and device adapter <b>108</b> can therefore be consistent in their attachment mechanisms and electrical connections so that a device (e.g., a card reader accessory <b>110</b>) can be mounted to the cover <b>102</b> or device adapter <b>108</b> interchangeably. In some embodiments, the cover <b>102</b> and device adapter <b>108</b> can provide different kinds of connection points so that different kinds of accessories can be connected to the system <b>100</b> based on the needs of the user.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The accessory devices <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> can generally be configured to be portable with the electronic device <b>104</b>, cover <b>102</b>, and device adapter <b>108</b> so that their addition to the system <b>100</b> does not force the user to remain stationary or in a limited range of nearby locations (e.g., as would be the case if an accessory <b>110</b> included a chain or cord to another external device). Additionally, accessories <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> can be configured to draw power from the electronic device <b>104</b> or from other power-supplying accessories connected to the system <b>100</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, the accessories <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may not need their own internal power source (e.g., their own battery) to operate. Furthermore, accessories <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> can be configured to establish electronic communication with the electronic device <b>104</b> via a wired connection (e.g., through the cover <b>102</b>) or by a wireless connection (e.g., via a wireless communications system and protocol known in the art (e.g., BLUETOOTH&#xae;, RFID, WI-FI&#xae;, infrared transceiver, radio frequency transceiver, etc.)).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accessory devices <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> provide modular customizability and adjustability to the system <b>100</b> by allowing the electronic device <b>104</b> to take on new functions and capabilities depending on the needs of an individual user or enterprise user. Furthermore, accessories can be changed or exchanged to permit the users to adapt the system <b>100</b> for new purposes and settings over time. For example, a first set of accessory devices can be used by the electronic device <b>104</b> at a first time, a change of conditions can be detected, and then the user can exchange, add, or remove an accessory device from the first set to define and use a second set of accessory devices for the electronic device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example embodiment of a cover <b>200</b>. The cover <b>200</b> has the properties and features of cover <b>102</b> described above, and the properties and features of cover <b>200</b> are used in cover <b>102</b>. The cover <b>200</b> is shown in an exploded view, wherein the cover <b>200</b> includes a rear housing <b>202</b> (i.e., a rear casing), an expansion hub <b>204</b>, and a front housing <b>206</b> (i.e., a front casing). In some embodiments, the rear housing <b>202</b> (i.e., a rear casing) and front housing <b>206</b> (i.e., front casing) can be integrally formed as a single part, and the expansion hub <b>204</b> can be attached to that single part. In some embodiments, the expansion hub <b>204</b> can be formed within (e.g., co-molded within) the rear housing <b>202</b> and front housing <b>206</b>, thereby integrating the expansion hub <b>204</b> amongst the other parts of the housing and embedding the parts of the expansion hub <b>204</b> within the surfaces and protection of the housing portions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The expansion hub <b>204</b> can include a central housing <b>208</b> that is electrically joined to a first electrical connector <b>210</b>. A rear side of the central housing <b>208</b> can include the second electrical connector <b>212</b> including a plurality of electrical contacts or pins positioned on the housing <b>208</b>. The central housing <b>208</b> can also include a mounting connector <b>214</b> to mate the central housing <b>208</b> to a second mounting connector positioned external to the rear side of the central housing in response to movement of the central housing in a rearward direction (i.e., along axis Z). For example, the second mounting connector can be positioned on the distal end <b>178</b> of the stand <b>106</b> or on the front-facing surface of the device adapter <b>108</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the mounting connector <b>214</b> includes two diagrammatically shown elongated rectangles which represent openings or latches configured to connect to respective latches or openings of the second mounting connector external to the central housing <b>208</b>. The central housing <b>208</b> can also be configured to contain a device controller or hub module configured to manage connections to optional peripheral accessories at accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> that are spaced away from the central housing <b>208</b> but are electrically connected back to the central housing <b>208</b>. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and its related descriptions herein. The accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> can be positioned peripherally external to the housing <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The central housing <b>208</b> can be positioned in an opening <b>220</b> in the center of the rear side <b>222</b> of the rear housing <b>202</b> so that the second electrical connector <b>212</b> and mounting connector <b>214</b> are exposed and accessible through the rear housing <b>202</b>. The accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> are structures positioned in portions of the cover <b>200</b> where accessories (e.g., <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>) can be conveniently retained and used. In some embodiments, the accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> are positioned centered in the edges of the rear side <b>222</b> of the rear housing <b>202</b>, such as by being positioned in openings <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> along the peripheral edges of the rear surface <b>222</b>. The openings <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> can at least partially extend around the peripheral edges, wherein a portion of the opening is on the rear side of the rear housing <b>202</b> and a second portion of the opening is formed through the lateral sides <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> of the rear housing <b>202</b>. In this way, at least one accessory mount (e.g., <b>218</b>) can define a recess (e.g., <b>236</b>) that opens laterally (e.g., through the lateral side <b>232</b>) and rearwardly (e.g., through rear side <b>222</b>). In other words, a recess <b>236</b> can be accessible through the lateral side <b>232</b> and through the rear side <b>222</b> due to the shape of opening <b>225</b> cutting into each of the sides <b>222</b>, <b>232</b> and due to the recess <b>236</b> having a similar shape. An accessory device therefore can be inserted into the accessory mount (e.g., <b>218</b>) and into the opening (e.g., <b>226</b>) parallel to a direction extending perpendicular to the lateral side (e.g., <b>232</b>). This can allow the accessory device to be installed using tracks or grooves in the recess (e.g., <b>236</b>) that guide or automatically align the device into place on the accessory mount (e.g., <b>218</b>) and that prevent it from falling out of the accessory mount while attached. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and its related connection system <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">An accessory device in the recess <b>236</b> can also be exposed to the rear direction due to the opening (e.g., <b>226</b>) having an open rear portion. This rear exposure can be advantageous to allow the accessory device to be thicker than the cover <b>202</b> or recess <b>236</b> in the rear direction, such as by at least partially protruding from the rear side <b>222</b> when mounted to the recess <b>236</b>. The increased thickness can be used with large accessory devices such as batteries, barcode scanners, devices with moving parts, etc. Additionally, sensors or output devices (e.g., a secondary camera lens or flash) can be exposed on the rear side of the accessory device and can be accessible or visible through the rear part of the opening (e.g., <b>226</b>) so that they can receive their input or provide their output without necessarily having to protrude from the lateral side (e.g., <b>232</b>) or rear side <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first electrical connector <b>210</b> can be positioned in a portion of the rear housing <b>202</b> and can be configured to be aligned with and connected to a connector on the electronic device <b>104</b> when the device <b>104</b> is mounted to the cover <b>200</b>. For instance, the first electrical connector <b>210</b> can include a support portion <b>238</b> and a connector plug <b>240</b> supported and protected by the support portion <b>238</b>. The support portion <b>238</b> can keep the connector plug <b>240</b> from being damaged due to twisting or bending by partially surrounding and bracing the connector plug <b>240</b> against the electronic device <b>104</b> while the plug is inserted into the electronic device <b>104</b>. This can be beneficial when the rear housing <b>202</b> is made of an at least partially flexible material and would not otherwise provide a rigid housing to protect the connector plug <b>240</b> while it is in the electronic device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first electrical connector <b>210</b> and accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> can each be connected to the central housing <b>208</b> of the expansion hub <b>204</b> by flexible cables <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>. The flexible cables <b>242</b> can be positioned on opposite sides of the central housing <b>208</b> (enabling them to have a minimized length to the edges of the cover <b>200</b>) and can be routed through wire-guiding channels or recesses in the rear housing <b>202</b> or can be co-molded, adhered, or otherwise attached to the rear housing <b>202</b>. The flexibility of the cables <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> can allow a manufacturer of the cover <b>200</b> to position the first electrical connector <b>210</b> and accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> wherever they are needed in the cover <b>200</b>. For instance, if the size and layout of the electronic device <b>104</b> changes over time due to changes in features over product cycles (e.g., change in position or size of camera <b>133</b>, buttons <b>128</b>, speaker <b>130</b>, size of housing <b>122</b>, etc.), cover manufacturers are enabled to adapt to those changes by using existing expansion hubs <b>204</b> and merely changing the positions of the first electrical connector <b>210</b> and openings <b>220</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> as needed to accommodate a new electronic device <b>104</b> (e.g., to position the accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> in a new cover without covering a speaker <b>130</b> that is repositioned when a new electronic device <b>104</b> is released).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, the number of accessory mounts <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> can be customized by the manufacturer, wherein any number of accessory mounts can be used (including zero) in a cover <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, three accessory mounts are used to provide a user with access to accessory mounts on each side of the electronic device <b>104</b> that is not occupied by the first electrical connector <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, one or more accessory mounts can be used on the same side as the first electrical connector <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, multiple accessory mounts can be used on a single side or edge of the rear housing <b>202</b>. This customization of the cover <b>200</b> is enabled at least in part by the flexible cables <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> and their connectability to (or disconnectability from) the central housing <b>208</b> for each accessory mount.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The front housing <b>206</b> can be positioned on a front side of the rear housing <b>202</b> and expansion hub <b>204</b> to cover the front-facing surfaces of the rear housing <b>202</b> and expansion hub <b>204</b>. The end user of the cover <b>200</b> and electronic device can therefore use the entire cover <b>200</b> as a single unit, and the wiring and electronic components of the expansion hub <b>204</b> can be aesthetically hidden and also protected from damage due to exposure. Thus, the front housing <b>206</b> can hide the central housing <b>208</b> and cables <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> when the cover <b>200</b> is viewed from the front. The front housing <b>206</b> can include a soft, compliant, non-marring material configured to contact the rear surface of the electronic device <b>104</b> without scratching or blemishing the device, such as felt, fabric, foam, velvet, flexible plastic, leather, similar materials, and combinations thereof. An example positioning of a front housing <b>206</b> is shown in front housing <b>534</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. The front housing <b>206</b> can have its width, length, and depth dimensions arranged to fit within the rear housing <b>202</b> with the rear housing <b>202</b> covering the sides of the front housing <b>202</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). In some embodiments, the front housing <b>206</b> can have its dimensions arranged to cover all or substantially all of the width and length dimensions of the rear housing <b>202</b>.

The front electrical connector can enable the device adapter <b>108</b> to connect to a rear electrical connector <b>212</b> of a cover <b>102</b>/<b>200</b> and to thereby provide paths for electrical communication between the device adapter <b>108</b>, the cover <b>102</b>/<b>200</b>, and the electronic device <b>104</b>, as further described below.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic side section view illustrating features of a connection system <b>300</b> with electrical connectors and mechanical latches usable with the covers <b>102</b>/<b>200</b>, device adapter <b>108</b>, and stand <b>106</b>. The system <b>300</b> can have a male connector <b>302</b> configured to attach and connect to a female connector <b>304</b>.

In some embodiments, their positioning can be reversed. Furthermore, a device (e.g., device adapter <b>108</b>) can include a male connector <b>302</b> on one side (e.g., the front side) and a female connector <b>304</b> on the opposite side (e.g., the rear side) thereof, such as the device adapter <b>508</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically shows features that are implemented in system <b>100</b> and cover <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each connector <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can include a set of electrical contacts <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> configured to engage each other upon attachment of one connector to the other. These electrical contacts <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> can thereby establish electrical communication across the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. A first set of the electrical contacts (e.g., <b>306</b> in this embodiment, but can be <b>308</b> in another embodiment) can include a set of biased members configured to extend at least partially away from an outer surface <b>310</b> of the connector <b>302</b>. For instance, the biased members can be a set of pogo pins that are depressible into the outer surface <b>310</b> to ensure a consistent connection with the other electrical contacts (e.g., <b>308</b>). Corresponding pairs of contacts can electrically couple electrical traces, wires, or other conductors in the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. In some embodiments, the contacts <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> can include other electrical connector designs, such as, for example, a plug having prongs and an electrical socket configured to receive and make an electrical connection with the prongs.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the number of pins or contacts corresponds to the expansion capability of the system. For instance, a pair of contacts can be used for ground, a pair can be used for power (e.g., 5-watt or 7.5-watt power per accessory device), a pair can be used for a first data stream (e.g., between the electronic device and the stand), another pair can be used for a second data stream (e.g., between the electronic device and an accessory device), and another pair can be used for a third data stream (e.g., between the electronic device and a device adapter accessory device). In various embodiments, the number of contacts can therefore be designed and optimized based on the expandability of the modular system. In an example embodiment, the number of pairs can match the number of pairs in a standardized connector system such as, for example, USB-C or similar standards. Thus, although five pairs of contacts are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and a set of eight contacts is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, any number of contacts that would fit on the central housing <b>208</b> or stand <b>106</b> and within the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be used. In some embodiments, a set of separate data stream connections can be used for each accessory mount (e.g., <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>), and a ground connection and power connection can also be provided to each mount. The central housing <b>208</b> can include an electronic expansion hub to manage the distribution of power and the transmission of data streams to the accessory devices on the cover, to the stand (and any devices attached to or positioned in it), and to the device adapter (and any devices attached to or positioned in it). See, e.g., expansion hub <b>602</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A portion of each connector <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be used for mechanically latching the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> to each other. In this embodiment, the male connector <b>302</b> includes a set of latching hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> on each side of the contacts <b>306</b>, and the female connector <b>304</b> includes a set of receiving slots <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> configured to align with and receive the latching hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>. The hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> can be referred to as first and second latching portions (e.g., arm latching portions when they are located on a support arm), and the slots <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> can also be referred to as first and second latching portions (e.g., case latching portions when they are located on a case or cover). In some embodiments, one of the latching hooks <b>312</b> is stationary on the connector <b>302</b>, and one of the hooks <b>314</b> is movable relative to the connector <b>302</b>. Thus, when the male connector <b>302</b> approaches the female connector <b>304</b>, the hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> can be inserted to the slots <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> as the stationary hook <b>312</b> moves into slot <b>316</b> and the movable hook <b>314</b> moves into slot <b>318</b>. The movable hook <b>314</b> can deflect radially inward (along direction <b>320</b>) as the hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> move into the outermost portions of the respective slots <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, and then, once the hook <b>314</b> is inserted into the inner cavity of the slot <b>318</b>, a biasing device <b>322</b> can bias the hook <b>314</b> radially outward (opposite direction <b>320</b>) to latch the hook <b>314</b> in slot <b>318</b>. Simultaneously, the hook <b>312</b> can be fully inserted into the inner cavity of slot <b>316</b>. In this position, the male connector <b>302</b> can have its contacts <b>306</b> in electrical communication with the corresponding contacts <b>308</b> of the female connector <b>304</b>. The hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> can prevent unintentional withdrawal or disconnection of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> from each other due to the hooks engaging against latching surfaces <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> within the slots <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> need to be separated from each other, a detachment slide <b>328</b> can be moved in a direction parallel to the direction <b>320</b> to overcome the biasing force of the biasing device <b>322</b> and to move the hook <b>314</b> into position where it can be pulled or slide out of the slots <b>318</b> without engaging the latching surface <b>326</b>. Accordingly, one side of the connection system <b>300</b> can be disengaged while the opposite side with hook <b>312</b> remains engaged with latching surface <b>324</b>. This one-sided unlatching system can help prevent the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> from disconnecting from each other prematurely, especially when the weight of the electronic device, cover, or similar structures are being borne by the mechanically interlocking hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>. Thus, an additional step can be needed to fully disconnect the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> from each other, wherein, after moving the hook <b>314</b> to a disconnecting position that is not engaging the latching surface <b>326</b>, the connector <b>302</b> having hook <b>312</b> can laterally slide hook <b>312</b> away and out of engagement with surface <b>324</b> or can be rotated to pivot the released hook <b>314</b> out of slot <b>318</b>, then to slide the other hook <b>312</b> out of its slot <b>316</b>. In some embodiments, both hooks <b>312</b> can have respective biasing devices and slides <b>328</b> to deflect them in each of the slots <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>. Thus, two latches may need to be simultaneously deflected by the user to separate the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> from each other.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can also include a set of magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> that are configured to be positioned around a perimeter or outer portion of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. The magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> can be configured to be magnetically attracted to each other and to therefore apply attractive magnetic forces between the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> to help guide and secure the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> to each other when they are brought into close proximity with each other. In some embodiments, the magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> can include permanent magnets, electromagnets, ferromagnetic materials, similar structures, and combinations thereof. A set of durable, non-marring material layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b> can overlay the magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> to help cushion the engagement of connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, to prevent engagement of harsh scratching or marring structures in the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, and to keep the magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> protected. For instance, the material layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b> can include a rubber, rubberized, or plastic material, such as a self-healing plastic that minimizes scratches and/or absorbs them non-permanently, whereas other portions of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can include metal (e.g., aluminum) or other materials that would scratch more easily or would scrape against each other, thereby providing a less comfortable user experience than connectors using plastic material layers as guards or bumpers.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The inclusion of the magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> can also help make the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> capable of blindly mating with each other. In other words, the magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> can use their magnetic attraction to each other to align the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> within a certain range of distances without the user having to look at the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> to ensure their proper alignment. The magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> can guide the user's hands even if the connectors are out of view (i.e., the user is &#x201c;blind&#x201d;). This magnetic guiding force, in conjunction with the mechanical latches using hooks <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> and slots <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, can allow a user to completely couple and attach the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> to each other by using his or her sense of touch and feeling the combined force feedback provided by the magnetic attraction and the hooks engaging the slots.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can have the magnetic structures <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and their covering material layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b> positioned around a perimeter or outer circumference of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> in a manner that prevents the contacts <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> from being seen or accessed while the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are coupled to each other. In other words, the presence of the magnetic structures <b>332</b> can visually block a user from seeing between the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> once the material layer <b>336</b> is laterally adjacent to a protrusion <b>338</b> containing a slot <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, and the protrusions <b>338</b> can visually block the contacts <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> from view at the side of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. The visual barriers provided by the protrusions <b>338</b> and protruding magnetic structures <b>332</b> also help show that these connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are blind mating connectors because they prevent a user from seeing the connections when they are about to be made.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">At least one of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can include a connector sensor <b>340</b> is configured to detect the presence of a coupling of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> relative to each other. In an example embodiment, the connector sensor <b>340</b> can include a Hall-effect sensor used to measure and detect magnetic field output by magnetic structures <b>330</b> or the change in the magnetic field of the magnetic structures <b>332</b> has caused by introduction of the protrusion <b>338</b> near to the connector sensor <b>340</b>. A sensor data line <b>342</b> can connect to a controller (e.g., of the expansion hub or stand) for providing power to the contacts <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> to ensure that power provided to the contacts is disabled when the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> begin to separate from each other. This connector sensor <b>340</b> can help ensure physical mating before the contacts <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> are powered and can help thereby to avoid dendrite growth. In some embodiments, the connector sensor can be a biased pin that is depressed when the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are attached to each other or another mechanical switch configured to make an electrical connection when the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are joined. In some embodiments, the connector sensor <b>340</b> can be used to detect the connection of the connectors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, and its signal can be used to initiate or authenticate on-attachment pairing of electronic devices (e.g., on-attach wireless BLUETOOTH&#xae; pairing of the electronic device to accessory devices or the stand).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of an accessory connection system <b>400</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The connection system <b>400</b> can include an accessory device <b>402</b> configured to slide into an accessory mount <b>404</b>. The accessory device <b>402</b> can be one of the various accessory devices disclosed elsewhere herein, and the accessory mount <b>404</b> can be one of the other accessory mounts disclosed elsewhere herein. The accessory device <b>402</b> accessory mount <b>44</b> are not shown to scale in order to improve clarity in disclosure of the features of the connection system <b>400</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically shows features that are implemented in system <b>100</b> and cover <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The accessory device <b>402</b> can include an enlarged width portion <b>406</b> and a narrowed width portion <b>408</b>. The narrowed width portion <b>408</b> be configured to be inserted into a recess <b>410</b> of the accessory mount <b>404</b>. In some embodiments, the enlarged width portion <b>406</b> is omitted or has the same width as the narrowed width portion <b>408</b>. The accessory device <b>402</b> can also include one or more ridges <b>412</b> or tongues configured to make sliding engagement with corresponding grooves such as groove <b>414</b> adjacent to the recess <b>410</b> in the accessory mount <b>404</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ridge <b>412</b> extends laterally (i.e., perpendicular to the Y and Z axes), and a second ridge <b>412</b> can be used on the opposite side of the accessory device <b>402</b> (i.e., also perpendicular to the Y and Z axes). In this manner, the ridges <b>412</b> and grooves <b>414</b> can permit bidirectional sliding motion of the accessory device <b>402</b> relative to the accessory mount <b>404</b> (i.e., along axis Z). Once ridge <b>412</b> is positioned in groove <b>414</b>, the accessory device <b>402</b> can thereby be prevented from moving relative to the accessory mount <b>404</b> along a front-rear axis Y shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Thus, when accessory mount <b>404</b> is used as an accessory mount in one of the embodiments shown above (e.g., as mount <b>216</b>), for example, the accessory device <b>402</b> is insertable through lateral side <b>416</b> of the mount <b>404</b> and is not insertable into the recess <b>410</b> through the rear side <b>418</b> (which corresponds to a rear-facing surface of rear portion <b>144</b> or a surface such as rear surface <b>222</b>).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The connection system <b>400</b> can also include at least first and second retaining elements configured to prevent the accessory device <b>402</b> and accessory mount <b>404</b> from disconnecting unintentionally. For example, the narrowed width portion <b>408</b> can include a detent <b>418</b> configured to be facing inward toward a wall <b>420</b> of the recess <b>410</b> upon insertion of the accessory device <b>402</b>. When the accessory device <b>402</b> has been sufficiently inserted into the recess <b>400</b> along axis Z, the detent <b>418</b> can align with and receive a pin, ball, or other biased protrusion <b>422</b>. In other words, the biased protrusion <b>422</b> can partially retract into surface <b>420</b> as the narrowed width portion <b>408</b> approaches and contacts biased protrusion <b>422</b>, thereby applying a force to the biased protrusion <b>422</b> that overcomes a biasing force applied by a biasing spring member <b>424</b>. Accordingly, with the accessory device <b>402</b> fully engaged with the detent <b>418</b> receiving the tip of the biased protrusion <b>422</b>, a minimum pull force along direction Z is required to remove the accessory device <b>402</b> from the accessory mount <b>404</b> that will overcome the force applied by biasing member <b>424</b> and will retract the biased protrusion <b>422</b> into surface <b>420</b> again to release the accessory device <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A set of electrical contacts <b>426</b> can be positioned on an inward facing surface of the accessory device <b>402</b>, and a corresponding set of electrical contacts <b>428</b> can be configured to engage with the electrical contacts <b>426</b> of the accessory device <b>402</b>. The sets of electrical contacts <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> can be electrically connected to each other when the accessory device <b>402</b> is inserted into the position wherein the protrusion <b>422</b> soft-locks the accessory device <b>402</b> in place in the recess <b>410</b>.

The diagram diagrammatically shows the cover <b>600</b> (with its expansion hub <b>602</b>), an accessory device <b>638</b>, and a stand <b>630</b>. An additional hub (e.g., device adapter <b>108</b> having its own expansion hub similar to hub <b>602</b> and/or controller <b>626</b>) can be added between the blind mating connectors <b>628</b>, <b>632</b>. The circuit layout can extend through the cover <b>600</b> and its expansion hub <b>602</b>, with the first electrical connector <b>604</b> being a USB connector or similar structure configured to connect to the electronic device. The expansion hub <b>602</b> can also incorporate a USB hub <b>606</b> (i.e., a device hub or port routing hub) with an upstream port <b>608</b> connected to the first electrical connector <b>604</b> and a group of downstream ports <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>616</b> controllable by a controller <b>618</b> (e.g., a microcontroller, processor, or control logic) that is part of the USB hub <b>606</b>. The controller <b>618</b> can manage the transfer of data and power between the first electrical connector <b>604</b> and accessory mount connectors <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, and <b>624</b>. The expansion hub <b>602</b> can further include a power management microcontroller unit (MCU) and/or dual port power delivery (PD) controller <b>626</b> configured to route power through the cover <b>600</b> and between the first electrical connector <b>604</b>, expansion hub <b>602</b>, the accessory mount connectors <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, and the second electrical connection <b>628</b>. The second electrical connection <b>628</b> can also be connected to the USB hub <b>606</b> for data routing through the stand <b>630</b> to the first electrical connector <b>604</b>. As discussed above, the stand <b>630</b> can include a connector <b>632</b> to an external power source <b>634</b> or to connectable devices in or on the stand, such as by a USB receptacle <b>636</b>. In an example embodiment, the external power source <b>634</b> can provide about 5-15 watts of power to the system per accessory device used, about 30 watts for the electronic device, and about 50 watts total in a typical implementation. When the external power source <b>634</b> is disconnected or turned off, power from an internal battery of the electronic device can be routed to the accessory devices and expansion hub via the USB plug <b>604</b>. Furthermore, if an accessory includes an energy storage device (e.g., external battery), power from that device can be routed to other devices using the USB hub <b>606</b> and controller <b>626</b>. High voltage or wattage can be provided to the electronic device while accessory devices are afforded less voltage or wattage, such as 15 volts to the electronic device and 5 volts to the accessory devices.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">An accessory device <b>638</b> can include its own microcontroller unit <b>640</b> in electronic communication with a connector <b>642</b> attachable to one or more of the accessory mounts <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>.

These electronic components of the accessory device can electrically connect to a mount (e.g., <b>624</b>) to enable their operation via a port (e.g., <b>614</b>).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">To the extent applicable to the present technology, gathering and use of data available from various sources can be used to improve the delivery to users of invitational content or any other content that may be of interest to them. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, TWITTER&#xae; ID's, home addresses, data or records relating to a user's health or level of fitness (e.g., vital signs measurements, medication information, exercise information), date of birth, or any other identifying or personal information.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal information data can be used to deliver targeted content that is of greater interest to the user. Accordingly, use of such personal information data enables users to calculated control of the delivered content. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure. For instance, health and fitness data may be used to provide insights into a user's general wellness, or may be used as positive feedback to individuals using technology to pursue wellness goals.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The present disclosure contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. Such policies should be easily accessible by users, and should be updated as the collection and/or use of data changes. Personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection/sharing should occur after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities should consider taking any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. In addition, policies and practices should be adapted for the particular types of personal information data being collected and/or accessed and adapted to applicable laws and standards, including jurisdiction-specific considerations. For instance, in the US, collection of or access to certain health data may be governed by federal and/or state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); whereas health data in other countries may be subject to other regulations and policies and should be handled accordingly. Hence different privacy practices should be maintained for different personal data types in each country.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of advertisement delivery services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; or &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; of participation in the collection of personal information data during registration for services or anytime thereafter. In another example, users can select not to provide mood-associated data for targeted content delivery services. In yet another example, users can select to limit the length of time mood-associated data is maintained or entirely prohibit the development of a baseline mood profile. In addition to providing &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; and &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; options, the present disclosure contemplates providing notifications relating to the access or use of personal information. For instance, a user may be notified upon downloading an app that their personal information data will be accessed and then reminded again just before personal information data is accessed by the app.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Moreover, it is the intent of the present disclosure that personal information data should be managed and handled in a way to minimize risks of unintentional or unauthorized access or use. Risk can be minimized by limiting the collection of data and deleting data once it is no longer needed. In addition, and when applicable, including in certain health related applications, data de-identification can be used to protect a user's privacy. De-identification may be facilitated, when appropriate, by removing specific identifiers (e.g., date of birth, etc.), controlling the amount or specificity of data stored (e.g., collecting location data a city level rather than at an address level), controlling how data is stored (e.g., aggregating data across users), and/or other methods.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal information data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user, other non-personal information available to the content delivery services, or publicly available information.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the described embodiments.
