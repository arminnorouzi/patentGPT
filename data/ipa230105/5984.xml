The display layer and the CMOS backplane are respectively manufactured and then integrated into a module through a bonding process. In the bonding process, the display layer and the CMOS backplane are bonded to each other with one pair of bonding pads for each sub-pixel or one pair of bonding pads for each light-emitting device between the display layer and the CMOS backplane. As the pixel density (i.e., the number of pixels per inch, PPI) of the module is increased (or as the pixel pitch is decreased), the gap (hereinafter, the bonding pitch) between the bonding pads decreases. As the gap between the bonding pads decreases, the difficulty of bonding surface processing and an alignment operation increases, and thus, the manufacturing yield decreases.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided are a display layer having a monolithic structure to secure a gap between a plurality of bonding pads and a display device including the display layer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of presented embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of an example embodiment, a display device includes a display layer including a plurality of light-emitting devices and a plurality of switching devices in a one-to-one correspondence with the plurality of light-emitting devices, wherein the plurality of light-emitting devices and the plurality of switching devices form a monolithic structure;

Each of the connection lines CL may extend from the switch control block <b>250</b> to the switching device <b>121</b> arranged in the switching layer <b>120</b>. The one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> may be connected to the plurality of switching devices <b>121</b> through the connection lines CL, and each switching device <b>121</b> may be controlled through the one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> to operate the corresponding light-emitting device <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> may be included and/or arranged in the driving layer <b>200</b>, and the one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> may be connected to the plurality of switching devices <b>121</b> included in the switching layer <b>120</b>. Bonding areas BA<b>1</b> may be arranged between the driving layer <b>200</b> and the display layer <b>100</b> to connect the one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> to the plurality of switching devices <b>121</b>. When the pair of bonding pads <b>131</b> and <b>230</b> are bonded to each other, they may be referred to as a bonding area BA<b>1</b>. In other words, each of the one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> may be connected to the display layer <b>100</b> by at least one pair of bonding pads <b>131</b> and <b>230</b>. Here, the pair of bonding pads <b>131</b> and <b>230</b> may consist of a bonding pad <b>131</b> of the display layer <b>100</b>, and a corresponding bonding pad <b>230</b> of the driving layer <b>200</b> corresponding to the bonding pad <b>131</b> of the display layer <b>100</b>. The bonding pad <b>131</b> of the pair of bonding pads <b>131</b> and <b>230</b> may be for connecting the switch control block <b>250</b> to the display layer <b>100</b>, and may be distinguished from the bonding pad <b>130</b> for connecting the driving device <b>210</b> to the display layer <b>100</b>. That is, in addition to the bonding areas BA<b>0</b> arranged in the pixel, the bonding areas BA<b>1</b> for connecting the switch control block <b>250</b> to the display layer <b>100</b> may be formed and arranged. In the case where the plurality of light-emitting devices <b>111</b> or the plurality of sub-pixels are included in the first pixel P<b>1</b> of the display layer <b>100</b>, boding areas BA<b>1</b> for connecting one switch control block <b>250</b> to the display layer <b>100</b> may be arranged such that the number of the bonding areas BA<b>1</b> is equal to the number of the plurality of light-emitting devices <b>111</b> or the plurality of sub-pixels. For example, in the case where the first pixel P<b>1</b> of the display layer <b>100</b> includes four light-emitting devices <b>111</b> each constituting one sub-pixel, four switching devices <b>121</b> may be arranged in the switching layer <b>120</b> in order to switch the four light-emitting devices <b>111</b> on and off. For connection between one switch control block <b>250</b> and the four switching devices <b>121</b>, four bonding areas BA<b>1</b> for connection between one switch control block <b>250</b> and the display layer <b>100</b> may be arranged. The connection lines CL may be respectively arranged in the bonding areas BA<b>1</b>, and the connection lines CL may be spaced apart from each other. For example, in the case where the driving signal applied from one driving device <b>210</b> is a combination of driving signals for the first to fourth light-emitting devices, the driving signal corresponding to the first light-emitting device may be allocated to the first light-emitting device through the first switching device which is controlled by a first switch control block.

As in the previous example embodiment, in order to connect one switch control block <b>250</b> to the four switching devices <b>121</b>, four bonding pads <b>131</b> may be arranged on the display layer <b>100</b>, and four corresponding bonding pads <b>230</b> may be arranged on the driving layer <b>200</b>. Although it is described that one switch control block <b>250</b> corresponds to one pixel or one driving device <b>210</b> in the previous example, one switch control block <b>250</b> may not necessarily correspond to only one driving device <b>210</b> and may correspond to the plurality of driving devices <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The gap between the plurality of bonding areas BA<b>1</b> arranged to connect the one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> to the display layer <b>100</b>, i.e., the bonding pitch, may be, for example, greater than or equal to the pixel pitch. One switch control block <b>250</b> may be arranged to correspond to the plurality of driving devices <b>210</b> connected to the one switch control block <b>250</b>. The one or more switch control blocks <b>250</b> may be arranged at one end of the cross-section of the display device <b>10</b> according to an example embodiment, across a region larger than one pixel. Because they may be arranged across the region larger than one pixel, the bonding pitch of the bonding areas BA<b>1</b> may be greater than the bonding pitch of the bonding areas BA<b>0</b> arranged in the pixel.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the driving layer <b>200</b> of the display device <b>10</b> according to an example embodiment may include a data control block <b>270</b> including a plurality of column lines and a scan control block <b>290</b> including a plurality of row lines.
