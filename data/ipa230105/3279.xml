Typically, one side of the belt is wrapped around metal/rubber rolls, while the other side is exposed to chemicals such as polymers, resins, etc. However, such joints often fail leading to catastrophic failure during a process using the mechanical belt, such as extrusion. Joint failure can be caused by a low joint strength, improperly selected backings that cannot withstand the pressures exerted by the rolls, or thermochemical environments created on the material processing side that weaken the belt strength. Accordingly, mechanical belts with improved joint designs that have improved strength properties are desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a first aspect, an unassembled multilayer mechanical belt may include a first angled step-joint tab, a second angled step-joint tab, and a central overlap region between the first angled step-joint tab and the second angled step-joint tab. The central overlap region may include a first mechanical belt material layer overlying and adhered to a second mechanical belt material. The first angled step-joint tab may include a first tab backing material and a first tab adhesive material.
