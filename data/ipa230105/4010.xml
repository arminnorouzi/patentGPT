Number 2021-110104, filed Jul. 1, 2021, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a wearable display device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Previously, a head mounted display (HMD) is known as a wearable display device that is detachably worn by a user on a head and directly projects an image displayed on an image display unit onto the eyes of the user. The HMD is used in a wide variety of applications, for example, as a display device for remote assistance of an industrial device, a medical device, etc., in addition to viewing content video such as a DVD or a video.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in a case where an instruction is received from a support person at a remote place, a worker wears an HMD including a camera, and images an image of an external scene including a target subject with the camera. When the external scene imaged by the camera is displayed on a monitor, etc., on the support person side, assistance from a remote place is performed in which an appropriate instruction is provided from the support person to the worker by voice or video.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a case where the worker performs actual work, when the image display unit is disposed in front of the eye, a field of view of the worker is blocked and efficiency of the work is reduced. Therefore, it is desirable to move the image display unit to a position away from the eyes of the worker. For example, JP-A-2016-212320 discloses an HMD that can be moved from a position corresponding to the eyes of a worker to a position outside the field of view by flipping up an image display unit while the HMD is worn.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the HMD disclosed in JP-A-2016-212320, the camera is provided at the image display unit, and thus when the image display unit is flipped up, the camera moves together with the image display unit. At this time, since the range of the external scene imaged by the camera changes before and after the image display unit is flipped up, the subject of the work is deviated from the imaging range of the camera. Therefore, there is a problem that the external scene imaged after the image display unit is flipped up is not intended by a support person at a remote place.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the problem described above, according to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a wearable display device of the present disclosure includes a mounting unit, an image display unit that displays an image, a frame that supports the image display unit, an imaging unit that is supported by the frame and that captures an external scene, a coupling unit that connects the frame and the mounting unit such that a position of the image display unit with respect to the mounting unit is changeable in a first direction, and an image acquisition unit that acquires a first image of the external scene from a range on one side in the first direction in the imaging range of the imaging unit when the position of the image display unit with respect to the mounting unit is changed from the one side to another side in the first direction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating a usage state of an HMD of a first exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a front view illustrating a configuration of a main part of the HMD.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an electrical configuration of the HMD.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a transmission flow of a captured image from a controller to a host device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view illustrating a change in an imaging range before and after flip-up.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a front view illustrating a change in the imaging range before and after the flip-up.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a usage state of an HMD of a second exemplary embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Note that, in the drawings used for the following descriptions, characteristic portions are expanded for convenience to make characteristics easily comprehensible in some cases, thus dimension ratios among respective constituent elements or the like are not necessarily the same as actual dimension ratios.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Exemplary Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A wearable display device according to the present exemplary embodiment is an example of a head mounted display used by being worn on a head.

The mounting unit <b>101</b> of the present exemplary embodiment has a helmet shape covering the entire head HD of the worker M, but the shape of the mounting unit <b>101</b> is not limited thereto. For example, it can be a hair band shape worn on the head HD of the worker M. In this case, the hair band shape is configured by a mounting base portion provided on the +X side of the head HD of the worker M and a belt portion linked to the mounting base portion.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The image display unit <b>102</b> displays images corresponding to both eyes EY of the worker M. The image displayed at the image display unit <b>102</b> is, for example, an image related to a work transmitted from a support person (hereinafter, simply referred to as an operator) at a remote place. The image displayed at the image display unit <b>102</b> is, for example, an image transmitted from a work support person (hereinafter, simply referred to as an operator) at a remote place.

The imaging unit <b>104</b> includes, for example, a small imaging element such as a CCD camera. The imaging unit <b>104</b> may be configured by assembling a plurality of imaging elements. In this case, an imaging range in which the imaging unit <b>104</b> captures the external scene can be easily expanded.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The coupling unit <b>105</b> is a member that connects the frame <b>103</b> and the mounting unit <b>101</b> such that the position of the image display unit <b>102</b> with respect to the mounting unit <b>101</b> in the vertical direction Z is changeable. The coupling unit <b>105</b> rotates about a rotational axis extending in the left-right direction Y orthogonal to the vertical direction Z, and thus changes the position of the image display unit <b>102</b> with respect to the mounting unit <b>101</b> in the vertical direction Z. In the present exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the coupling units <b>105</b> are provided on both sides of the frame <b>103</b> in the left-right direction Y.
